2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for the Big 12 swimming and diving championships. This apartment was very convenient to everything we needed! Some steep wooden stairs to the upper (covered) entrance, but we didn't experience any cold weather, so it was fine. Although the apartment is located above the owner's wine bar, it was very quiet. No noise at all! Easy parking. Surrounding neighborhood was mostly residentially with a small commercial area across the street - also very quiet. We have a toddler, so I was concerned about her early bedtime, but it was so nice and relaxing! The kitchen was well equipped and perfect for a couple or small family. The price was also excellent."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Tiny Farmhouse. Heather was the best host - letting us know we could check in early, showing us around the property, and even gifting us some fresh eggs. I became fast friends with Winnie, and seeing him at the door was a highlight of being there.
It was so lovely falling asleep with the windows open and hearing nothing but nature. The bed was very comfortable - and the frogs lulled us to sleep with their songs.
We will definitely be back - as it was a great landing pad as we took in some of the wonderful sights the area has to offer."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was an absolutely amazing host! Before we even got to the town, she messaged to see what time we would be arriving and if we would need an early check-in. We were going to be early, but I planned to kill time until check-in. She went out of her way to get a place ready for us hours early AND upgraded us to a larger place, free of charge, since our traveling circumstances changed. The cabin was adorable! It was super clean, comfy, and the views were beautiful! Upon check-in, Heather had freshly picked flowers for us and a hand-written card, welcoming us. She also brought us farm-fresh eggs to cook during our stay. She made sure to check in on us via message, seeing if we needed anything. She even went out of her way to turn the lights on for us when we forgot. We often saw her out and about on the property and she was always SO kind and helpful. We loved taking in the scenery from the rockers on the porch and also playing with/loving on her pups! We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"breathtaking, stunning, peaceful. the pictures don't do it justice! the farm stay was everything i needed, i wish it wasn't just for a day but ill be back for sure. heather is so kind-hearted and her dogs are the sweetest. the house itself is gorgeous with little hidden treasures everywhere. fully stocked with everything you could ever want. it was awesome to dim the lights and watch a movie before going to bed! there's parks nearby that are a must see, heather has a great guide book to check out. the weather came thru for me in the daytime and at night it feels like you could touch the stars. just 10/10 overall. thank you heather, i can't wait to come back and share a glass of wine with you! (and treats with the pups) happy trails always ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've stayed at Heathers place before, and both times it has been a lovely little getaway. We live within an hour of here, but it's worth it to dedicate a night to sitting out in nature. The peace and quiet on Heather's little patch of land is incredibly refreshing.
The dock is lovely, and where I've spent most of my time when I've come. To sit by a fire and listen to the wildlife, drinking some wine, you can't beat it.
The small cabin is adorable, clean, and cozy. We brought food to heat in the oven and microwave, and both worked, and Heather even had a cookie sheet.
Fairmont is a small place, so you may want to swing by somewhere for groceries on the way in.
Just make sure you have good company when you come, be it person or a book. It's an incredible piece of land, and Heather is an absolutely wonderful host."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely little place in a peaceful setting. It's nice to feel like you're away from it all but also be relatively near more active areas. The space is small but exceptionally clean and planned out well to provide everything needed. Heather is very kind and was quick to answer any questions I had. I will definitely stay again if I'm traveling through the area. Thanks!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As everyone has said, Zion Heritage Farm and Heather‚Äôs tiny farmhouse are just amazing. I came to relax, reflect and have some solo time, and the farm was beyond perfect for that. I miss it (and the pups Molly and Winston!) already, and could have easily stayed another week! Great jumping off point for Coopers Rock/hiking, too."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little getaway

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The tiny farmhouse was so peaceful and such a cute stay. The farm land is beautiful, perfect for a peaceful getaway. Heather couldn‚Äôt have been a better host - she was friendly, attentive, flexible, and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay! She really went above and beyond for her guests."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful calming spot. loved it!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved the peacefulness of the farmhouse. It is just as it looks in the photos. The hammock on the porch was the perfect way to relax after my drive. Heather was wonderful and communicated promptly. She also shared somethings to do around the property.
The mattress on the futon was like sleeping on a cloud! The space was just perfect for my night with everything I needed. I would absolutely stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather‚Äôs place was wonderful! She was an incredible host. I felt right at home.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing experience visiting Heather‚Äôs tiny house. A quiet and peaceful place, to disconnect and feel what this world could give to us. My partner was out of the country for a month, and we all need to reconnect and enjoy each other‚Äôs company. I all I have to say, that I‚Äôm really grateful for this experience from what Heather‚Äôve had to offer us and definitely would come back sometime."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"very nice place to stay, charming, quite, simple and cozy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To say this was one of our best Airbnb experiences is a total understatement - Heather's tiny farmhouse is an absolute gem that we were so lucky to find for our weekend trip!
The surrounding area had a lot of fun activities (hiking, geocaching, fishing) and the weather really treated us right during our stay. As we got to exploring the Fairmont area more, we kept finding ourselves itching to return to the tiny farmhouse for the peaceful environment it provided. On our last full day, we opted to keep our errands short so that we could spend most of our time at home, building a fire and watching the sunset on the surrounding hillsides.
The experience we had was nothing short of excellent, and we are already making plans with friends to return for a longer stay. While the place itself was lovely on its own, it wouldn't have been nearly as perfect of a stay without our host, Heather. Heather is accommodating, kind, and proactive, and we can't wait to visit her and the pups again soon! ‚ù§"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heather came through like a super star. I booked it later in the day, and knew there was a chance of it just being too late. Heather responded, we agreed on an arrival time that gave her enough time to clean, and she confirmed the reservation.
The GPS address she lists was perfect, got us right to the front gate. A warning about getting there though: it's paved roads all the way there, but it's hilly, and a bit narrow in places. If driving in the winter time, do be cautious.
The tiny house was ADORABLE. It felt very cozy and immediately we were able to relax when we saw it. Heather ran the heater for us earlier in the day so the house was a lovely temperature when we got there.
Heather came out to show me how to light the pellet stove on the dock (HIGHLY recommend) and made sure we had drinks and snacks. Heather was so delightful, and I sincerely look forward to coming back soon to spend another night. Thank you so much for sharing your slice of heaven with us!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I visited the farm with my boyfriend for a long weekend trip. Heather‚Äôs place was the perfect stay! It was clean and quiet. Heather also had everything we could need and more- she greeted us with some eggs and apples!
We will absolutely be visiting in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heather‚Äôs Airbnb was a gem! Tiny place nested out in the country, you won‚Äôt regret going there for a night or two or more! Wish I was able to stay there longer but will definitely come back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This little farmhouse was so lovely! Such a wonderful way to get out of the city and Heather was so helpful and friendly.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can‚Äôt say enough nice things about our stay! Heather was the best host, the location was heaven on earth and the price is on point. Will absolutely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heather‚Äôs place is serene and homey. Her dogs were warm and welcoming and she generously allowed us to pick some apples from her orchard (happy National Apple Day!), even offering to let us check out later than usual due to our midnight arrival.
The place was cozy and comforting. Can‚Äôt say enough good things. Rural but not too remote - easy road to navigate in my low-clearance Prius, even at night.
Thank you, Heather! :-)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The only thing I would change about this tiny farm house is how short my stay was. Heather is kind and welcoming. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked! It was nice she had so many items that would be easy to forget on your trip. The doggos are a great part of this stay. They are so sweet and we loved when they visited us. The rocking chairs were my favorite part, watching the birds eat on a chilly fall morning. Heather also let us help ourselves to some yummy apples and provided firewood."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! It was so cozy and a perfect place to just relax and enjoy nature. Heather is a great host too!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"had a great stay here. easy check in and the cottage was adorable. twinkle lights on the porch as I arrived. the kitchen was stocked well and the couch/bed was comfortable. got a great surprise when Molly and Winston showed up I didn‚Äôt think I would see them because of the rain but they were so cute and cuddly. Heather was super responsive, welcoming and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again if in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Heather is a fantastic host. The spot is so beautiful ‚Äî I loved waking up early and watching the light change. I‚Äôll be back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are thinking about spending a few days on the farm, stop thinking and just book it. You will not regret it! You‚Äôre gonna wish you booked longer. Heather is an outstanding host- we felt welcomed & taken care of from the moment we arrived. The property has everything you need for a peaceful, relaxing vacation. When you‚Äôre rested up and ready for adventure, visit one of the many state forests nearby or just follow Heather‚Äôs guidebook. I could go on and on but I‚Äôll just say this- what an unforgettable experience & I cannot wait to go back!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The farm looks just as good as it does in the pictures. The dogs are wonderful and Heather was super helpful and respectful. Could not recommend this stop enough.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A small oasis in the mountains of West Virginia. This is a great tiny house experience on a very peaceful farm, but still close proximity to Morgantown.
Heather is a wonderful host, and makes sure to check-in regularly for any needs.
If you are visiting family, going to a WVU game, or just looking for a weekend getaway, I highly recommended this!
(be sure to drive carefully at night. We are in the mountains after all)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"BEST BREAK UP EVER!
Long story short I booked this mini vaca as a couples getaway and ended up coming alone. Heather went out of her way to show me the time of my life! This place is the little slice of heaven I didn‚Äôt know I needed! I can‚Äôt explain in words how beautiful the cabin, scenery, and company is. Not to mention how perfectly equipped Heather is for all types of adventures. This is a must stay, hands down. No one will be able to top this experience ever. Thank you Heather!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Heather was an amazing host that really went out of her way to make sure my stay exceeded all expectations. When I come back to the area l'll certainly be looking to book again!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I really enjoyed our relaxing weekend at Heather's cabin.
Heather couldn't be more helpful. She lent us the use of her 4-wheeler due
to my wife's sore foot to enjoy the property. She was a great host! The apples
on the property were wonderful. We will definitely be back to visit with
Heather!
Roger & LuAnn"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny farmhouse was the perfect escape away from our busy lives. The land itself was beautiful and so calm. Weloved getting visits from Molly and Winnie. Heather was an amazing host, very kind and considerate of our every need. We were busy the few days we stayed, so we didn't get a ton of time to hang out. But what we did get to spend had been incredible. And the apples were delicious!!!! Definitely going to go back but will also be recommending to others!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve been to! Heather goes above and beyond as a host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another amazing stay at the tiny farmhouse! I was eager to come back a second time because my first visit was such a wonderful experience.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Heather was amazing and super helpful and kind. I highly recommend her adorable cabin to anyone!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don't think twice, as soon as you find availability for your dates book this heaven place. So peaceful and quiet. We have never spend this much time in our airbnb. This place is amazing. Glad we booked for two days. Get your fresh eggs for breakfast. Spend time at your porch or relax on the hammock. Watch at night fire flies (First time we have seen them live) Walk around, have a drink at the pond. Heather is an amazing host, her tiny house has everything you need. She also offered us to charge our rental car, which was a Tesla. The only thing I can complain about is there are no bug screens and we had to use AC at night which is very noisy. We would prefer the fresh air. I don't think this is an issue for everybody. Stop reading reviews and book this place, before it's gone:)
Thanks again for having us Heather."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely location, near the Mon River and on a big functioning farm. Heather couldn't have been nicer."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easiest 5-star review I've had the opportunity to write! Heather's place was so charming and peaceful, and it's clear she's put a lot of love into her property. Getting there was easy, and Heather made check-in a breeze. As a solo traveler, the tiny house was perfect - the fully-equipped kitchen was great, the futon comfy, and I so enjoyed sitting on the front porch with a cup of coffee at sunrise and watching the fireflies at dusk.
The location makes it an ideal basecamp for adventures in the surrounding area - visiting Morgantown, hiking or climbing in one of the parks or forests, or venturing a little further afield. That said, the farm is so serene and lovely that just staying on the property itself is a vacation.
I think that perhaps the highlight of my trip was the host herself - Heather was incredibly warm, welcoming and communicative. Sitting on the dock at sunset with a glass of wine, good conversation, and the company of three sweet dogs was such a memorable treat!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Heather's tiny house! Despite being ""out in the country"", it was easy to find from the address given, and it was very easy to locate the key and get inside. She had the air conditioning running, everything was very clean, and she was excellent with communication the whole time. She even brought me some food on the first evening, although respected my interest in privacy.
I particularly liked the detail in all the photos on her listing. I was able to plan what food to cook based on what spices and pots and pans I saw pictured in her kitchen cabinets. I highly recommend Heather's lovely cabin!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a magical stay! The little farmhouse is beautifully decorated, homey, and super clean. You can tell every detail was deliberately placed. If you‚Äôre a nature lover, I cannot recommend this spot enough!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely evening escaping the city! Heather was so kind and made us feel right at home. She brought us fresh eggs, we sat at the pond feeding the fish, played with the dogs, picked some peaches, and grilled some corn on the cob! Will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather was very friendly! The cabin was perfect! The fresh eggs and peaches were delicious! We really enjoyed the evenings sitting on the dock talking with Heather and playing with the dogs. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an easy to find relaxing get away. We can't wait to come back! Thank you for sharing your beautiful property with us!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heather‚Äôs place was just what I needed for a short stay, and I wish I would‚Äôve booked it longer! The small farmhouse is cozy and the outside atmosphere is quiet and peaceful. It is equipped with everything you need and the fresh eggs were a wonderful surprise as well. While I didn‚Äôt have a chance to meet Heather in person, she was very communicative and made sure I had everything I needed. I did have a chance to meet her sweet pups though, and they joined me on the porch for breakfast ‚ó°Ãà If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful retreat, I would highly recommend. Would love to come back if I‚Äôm in the area again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heather farm is like visiting old friend that you never met. It immediately feels cosy and like home. It's wonderful place if you want to be away from city noise. Have a swim, have a fire, have a chat!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our visit and it was exactly what we expected. The property was easy to find and close to the interstate. The house was clean and we loved the fresh picked flowers on the kitchen table. The property was beautiful and we loved talking with Heather. She was so outgoing and personable. We also appreciated that we had access to fresh eggs and peaches from the farm.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The Tiny House was a very nice and cozy place to stay. Heather is a ‚Äúone of a kind ‚Äú host. She greeted us with a smile and made us feel at home. The country setting and location worked out perfect for us. We can‚Äôt say anything bad about it. We would stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend Heather and her tiny home enough! She was the sweetest host I've ever had (gave us eggs and flowers) and communicated super well. Even had options for things to do like kayaking! The house itself is really nice and clean, with a great kitchen and very cozy, homey feel. My husband and I really enjoyed the porch and read together quite a bit on it. Out of all the places we stayed on our trip together this was our favorite!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The drive from Pennsylvania was absolutely beautiful- through mountains, the sky and clouds so close you feel you could touch them.
The house was easy to find, about 10 minutes off the major highway. All roads, though definitely ‚Äúback roads,‚Äù were very well marked. The GPS on my Waze app led us directly here.
It truly is a beautiful location. Sitting on the porch in one of the rocking chairs or laying in the hammock is truly relaxing. The sounds of nature and the beautiful wind chimes are magical.
Inside, the house is perfect. The couch easily pulls out into a bed that is very comfortable! The kitchen and fridge were stocked with items that we had not thought to bring, including fresh eggs from Heather‚Äôs farm.
The water pressure is strong and it gets hot quickly. The appliances are perfect- easy to use and very utilitarian. There is storage for our bags and clothes.
The sky at night is incredible- so very many stars can be seen this far away from light polluted cities."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best host ever! had a great 4-night stay, peaceful, and relaxing. The dogs greeted us every day. Highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a beautiful 10 days at Heather's cottage! It's a home away from home, including dogs. Beautiful location, peaceful. My daughter already misses being greeted by Molly and Winnie, and I miss having a cup of coffee on the front porch, listening to the birds and watching the bunnies hop around. I cannot wait to come back to Heather's farm! Thank you Heather! Everything during my stay was perfect!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was cute, clean and cozy. We loved the fresh flowers and the dogs. I highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My trip was incredible. Heather made my experience truly unforgettable! I have never felt more at peace and I am counting down the days until I can visit again ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíô
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful and a wonderful place to stay with a friendly host and great area. We thoroughly enjoyed our get away here. Heather was super friendly and helpful, very attentive. Everything was spotless and we had everything we needed. Could not recommend this place more‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Possibly the best AirBnb I've ever stayed in. Heather is a gem, a one-of-a-kind spirit, thoughtful, funny, generous. I was backpacking so had limited access to transport and technology so Heather went above and beyond what regular hosts do. The cabin is nestled in the most beautiful scenery imaginable, incredibly peaceful, like the old-fashioned America I had come to seek. The cabin was spotless and cosy, fully stocked, warm and airy. It was like a story from an old book: the organic farm, Heather's three hopelessly wonderful dogs, the chickens, the cardinals and fireflies, the windchimes, the old tractor, the meadow grass, the pond and dock, the most caring, generous host you're ever likely to meet. Regenerative, special. Thank you Molly, Winston and Juniper. Thank you, Heather. If I could put time in a bottle..."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, responsive, helpful, timely & overall, a nice person."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heather's WV retreat is a real joy. The tiny home is set amongst the rolling hills of the WV mountains. The kitchen is fully functional and very clean. The bathroom is also VERY clean. Great water pressure and tons of hot water. The dogs are a treat, as well as the orchard and bees. It was a very surreal setting. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back. Thank you for a very pleasant stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather was an absolute joy. She said there was peace at her home and it couldn‚Äôt be more true. From the adorable and friendly dogs, to the gorgeous scenery it was truly a getaway. We will most certainly be back in the future!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heather is an amazing host and communicated clearly about everything during my visit. Would highly recommend checking out the place if you‚Äôre staying in the area!! Everything was super clean when I arrived and the location was beautiful.

The cottage is extremely well stocked and the fresh flowers she had picked for me were both beautiful and the perfect touch.
I can‚Äôt wait to stay again when I‚Äôm in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My partner and I stayed at Heather's place for an anniversary and it couldn't have gone better. The surrounding area is beautiful. We enjoyed meandering around the country roads and borrowing heather's kayak to take up to Pricketts Fort State Park. The tiny house is perfect, it's extremely comfortable, cozy, and quaint with everything you could need. It's apparent that Heather has spent a lot of time, thought, and energy into making this space as special as it is. Lastly, Heather is extremely kind and will make you feel like you're at home without any of the responsibilities of home. We came hoping for time to slow down a bit and for the chaos of work/every day life to feel lighter, and that's exactly what we got. We will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was up in the area for a few months for work. Initially I was really nervous about being up there alone.. but very quickly heathers calm and friendly presence put me at ease and helped me feel right at home!
The view and the cabin was breathtaking every single morning and brought me peace every day. I absolutely enjoyed my entire stay and so thankful to Heather and the kindness she always showed me! So very thankful for her and this piece of paradise she shared with me for so long!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were greeted at the gate by two beautiful dogs, Winnie and Molly! Our stay was perfect, Heather made us feel at home with all the touches to her little place! So quiet and peaceful with beautiful sites. Definitely recommend! Looking forward to visiting soon!!!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful 1 night stay at Heather's tiny home. It was cozy and peaceful. We loved being able to cook dinner, bake cookies and sip wine in the rockers on the front porch. Heather was so nice and very responsive to our inquiries and needs. The farm is so nice and quiet and we loved all of the kisses from Molly and Winston. I really wish we could've stayed longer. Thank you Heather!"

I would recommend a larger more comfortable sectional couch with a table in the middle to set drinks on and a nightstand by the beds so a guest can put a clock, phone, or a bottle of water next to the bed, otherwise very nice. Thank you! Happy Nee Year!"

We chose this place because we have small dogs (a Yorkie and a Chihuahua) and there aren't many pretty friendly hotels in the area. This was much more affordable and we absolutely loved everything about our stay. The house was immaculate, and furnished and decorated perfectly. We felt right at home and had everything we could possibly need. We already have it bookmarked for next year's stay! Thank you for everything, we especially loved the Folgers 1850 kcup coffee (we had never had it before) and the snack basket was a nice touch even though we didn't eat any of it. All around great experience!"

I noticed the nicely displayed towels, the choice of white linens, washcloths in a darker blue color which allows me to not make a mess of the white towels when I do my makeup (always a smart choice to provide a darker hand towel or washcloth in the bathroom!), the Castile soap, and the coffee creamer and beans for freshly ground coffee, amongst many other things. It stands out that what she puts into it is quality. These are the standout touches that make me come back! The apartment is spacious, spotless clean, and the bed is terrific! 5 stars all around!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a quick in and out stay so I just wanted a place within 5 mins of my son's place. This apartment was a perfect distance and super cute. Very clean and comfortable. Would absolutely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was our first time in an Airbnb and it was an amazing :) Julie was very kind and helpful
We are going to come back for sure"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kari is the absolute best! Her place was spotless, easy to locate and a breeze to enter late at night! Kari is very good at communicating, offered excellent tips for the area and treated us with kindness! We will be back soon and often, perfect spot for rest after a busy week. Thank you Kariü´∂"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the farmhouse was even better than we had hoped for. It is even better than the description that air BNB provided. Our recommendation is, if the location works for you book your stay immediately. You will be so glad you did!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was beautiful! Very clean and comfy. The host were very friendly and the place was above and beyond what we expected
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was at my midway point in my travels. There were several reasons why this place caught my eye on the Air BnB site. The space was free of clutter, the wood floors, and the reviews of past visitors. The place matched the description and then some.
When I arrived a herd of cows moseyed over to see me. They settled on the hillside meadow across from the place for a few hours. This added the the peacefulness of the surroundings.
Indoors, the place had a calming affect. Great bed, super clean rooms, a nice sized bathroom well stocked and great towels, the back lounge area had a comfy couch where I unwound from my 6 hour drive.
I wish I could have stayed longer. I will definitely be back as this is one of my favorite Air BnB stays!
I was able to spend a little time chatting with Kari and Brad, a truly lovely couple, on their porch in the morning.
I was able to see the small waterfall on their property. I only wish I had more time spend next to this natural water feature."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous view and wonderful apartment. Extremely nice hosts and was very worth the price
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious and cozy space. Easy to feel at home. As other reviewers have commented, the snacks are a really nice touch.
Awesome hosts! Brad was very thoughtful about what would be useful for my trip and was friendly and helpful whenever I had a question."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wish I could have checked in soon, I would have loved to have spent more time. Unfortunately (but fortunate), it was just a place to shower and sleep before getting back on the road!
GREAT place!
#countryroadstakemehome"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our favorite Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in. They were so responsive and helpful and my gosh the place is adorable. They thought of everything, cute little milk bottles and snacks. Unfortunately we went to the grocery store before we got to the place. The bed was so cozy, watching the cows outside of the bedroom window, the huge bathroom were just a few of our favorite things! We might go to West Virginia again just so we can stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing!! It was peaceful, warm and cozy. Exactly what my wife and I were looking for. Amenities were best of the best. We will stay here again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing location for some peace and quiet. The scenery alone was 10/10.

They were so kind and I will definitely go back. Very clean, easy to find, and ultra cozy."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kari and her husband were kind, responsive and friendly. I booked last-minute but the suite was spotless and full of amenities and charm. Holiday decor was a nice touch as were all the thoughtful snacks, creamer in the fridge (huge one for me) and s'mores-making station. Bed was comfy, bathroom was large and very clean, heaters and wifi were great, and the location is really lovely, quiet and rural, while not being too far out of town (and a pretty drive out). I saw some deer grazing, and everything was beautiful in the snow. Also, easy access from main road onto a smaller backroad to arrive. Parking in drive right in front of suite. I'd stay again anytime I'm passing through."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings! The space was just as pictured and had lots of thoughtful added details to make you feel at home. We would highly recommend a getaway at Brad and Kari‚Äôs!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my favorite place to stay when I come to town‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the perfect getaway, exactly as described (but better!) and I‚Äôm grateful to have found this hidden gem! Thanks Kari for a wonderful stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kari‚Äôs place is amazing! It was immaculate, and she has thought of everything to make you feel at home! It is a beautiful house on such a peaceful farm setting. We saw deer each morning! We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a peaceful getaway just outside of Morgantown. Very private and the property was stunning!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just passing through and we arrived in the dark, but it was easy to find.
Woke up in the morning surrounded by farm country. Every detail was taken care of and the Decour was perfect. The bed was comfortable and bathroom was immaculate. Also many wonderful little amenities and treats that were not advertised, were left for us to enjoy. Highly recommend this comfortable getaway."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Kari‚Äôs place. She thought of everything, and the place was immaculate. Highly recommended."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kari and Brad were extremely friendly and proactive with their communication! They have instructions for everything, answered any texts quickly, reached out to make sure everything was OK, and made me feel very comfortable in the space.
Their Airbnb space is extremely clean and nicely appointed. Everything that you could need is there. I was traveling for a work event and the kitchenette was perfect. Thank you so much for some yummy snacks and for providing for my love of coffee!
What a peaceful setting, it‚Äôs quiet and in the country, so it was perfect after several long days of work to be able to come back into such a relaxing environment! I was also quite fortunate to arrive and be greeted by 14 deer in the side fields!
I really can‚Äôt say enough about how comfortable they made me feel and how clean and comfortable the space was! I highly recommend and would absolutely return again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kari and Brad were fabulous hosts. The place was super clean, private, comfortable and quiet. Best sleep I had while on this trip. All the special touches and snacks were a welcomed surprise. Nice to wake up to the family of deer frocking in the fields."

It was easy to find, beautiful location and home, and the attention to detail was superb. My husband and I hope to visit again and spend more time enjoying the area and the amazing Airbnb that Kari and Brad have worked hard to create for travelers."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Totally exceeded our expectations! The place was so clean with creative special touches. We sat outside and enjoyed the sunset, stars, deer and meadow view. It was more spacious than we expected and the shower lived up to it's reviews! This was just what we were looking for and hope to return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,One of the nicest Airbnb‚Äôs we have ever stayed. Would definitely stay here again. Kari had gone the extra mile to make our stay special.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The night before staying at the Farmhouse we were at a Hilton in Pennsylvania. Night and Day!
The hotel lacked all the wonderful aspects we found at Kari‚Äôs: easy checkin‚Äô, personal touches, snacks, QUIET, great communication. Yes, the Farmhouse, is off the beaten path but well worth it. 15 min to Morgantown, WV, and a bit more to Fairmont, WV, on a gorgeous windy road was easier than navigating the registration process at the big name hotel. I‚Äôm a big fan of simplicity and sincere human connections. This gem had it all. Sincerely, Nancy from Whidbey Island, WA."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great if you want a secluded lovely get away! You get a real feel for being in beautiful West Virginia. The hosts are fantastic and took care of lots of details I would‚Äôve never thought of.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay! Kari thought of everything and went above and beyond! One of the best air bnbs we have stayed in. Thank you!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,you can tell Kari and Vrad are thoughtful people by all the little extras they provided for the farmhouse. So nice! thier place was very affordable and provided a great rest opportunity for two weary travelers. This was also the cleanest Air B&B I have ever stayed in. Spotless! Highly recommend.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a few days to go sightseeing to Frank Lloyd Wrights two houses Falling Waters and Kentuck Knob and attended the WVU football game . The place was close to the stadium and restaurants. We enjoyed the chairs outside looking over the peaceful field and deer . It was very spacious and comfortable with a comfortable bed. Good Wi-Fi .

We will be back without a doubt, and hopefully for a longer stay!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! It felt so inviting and cozy! The surrounding land was beautiful and peaceful. It was super clean and decorated beautifully! It was bigger than I expected. We had everything we needed and more. The treats and s‚Äômores were great and there was even oatmeal, yogurts, water, coffee and tea. It is very clear that Kari enjoys hosting and cares about providing a great place to stay. I would recommend this place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely AirBnB that had all the amenities we could have hoped for! The location is tucked away on a quiet back road just a short drive outside of Morgantown. The apartment is attached to the main house, but also feels secluded because it has windows facing out to a large garden and backyard. Kari and Brad have thought of everything, from snacks to coffee (with fresh cream and milk!) to little s'mores kits to an electric water kettle to bathroom supplies. Everything was so clean and organized, and we only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the space. We were touched by how thoughtfully everything was arranged for our stay! Will definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Morgantown. Kari was a wonderful host who's extra touch made this a special stay. This place is very clean, safe peaceful location, and comfortable.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kari and Brad are among the warmest and most gracious hosts I've ever experienced. With so many other reviewers I can only rave about the peace and beauty of this farm and its extraordinary personal touches. To be more specific--yes, I've previously been encouraged to enjoy the night sky. But only Kari and Brad provided actual star-gazing chairs! Thanks again for everything, you two, and I look forward to returning to this glorious place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another wonderful stay with hospitable hosts! We couldn't ask for a better place to stay after a long day hustling in the bustling city of Morgantown. Peaceful surroundings and quiet location - just as described. We love the thoughtful amenities and the relaxing decor. Kari and Brad's place is on our favorites list!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous, peaceful stay with lots of thoughtful, personal touches from Kari and Brad"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Let me start by saying that if I was EVER an Airbnb host, I‚Äôd ASPIRE to be like Kari! üòäShe and Brad have done such an amazing job of creating a peaceful, clean, welcoming environment‚Ä¶ as soon as I got there, I didn‚Äôt want to leave! I felt right at home, and they went above and beyond with the little touches that made it all the more comfortable‚Ä¶ coffee/tea choices (with ALL the fixings), snacks, light breakfast choices‚Ä¶ even though we didn‚Äôt get to meet while I was there (it was a busy weekend for all), I knew she was only a message away and was ALWAYS responsive. This will be our new place to stay when we are in the area‚Ä¶ if you have the chance to book this Airbnb, do it. You won‚Äôt be disappointed! It‚Äôs a peaceful country setting but only 15-20 minutes away from all that I needed in the Morgantown area. I can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Farmhouse was Awesome!! it was peaceful and quiet. The personalized welcome was cool. The s'mores maker was cool and a nice little treat before bed. The snacks and stuff to make coffee was appreciated. If you forget some essentials like tooth brush or stuff to shave. Kari and Brad have a little essentials basket made up.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"it was exactly what we needed and exerting that was advertised. we called the same day and were surprised at how available and gracious our hosts are. we didn't have an opportunity to meet our hosts, but we would certay stay again. highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Karis place is very nice. They allowed us to make a last minute booking and when I had made a mistake on the booking , kari worked with me to resolve the issue I initiated. we would certainly stay again if we are in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,this was the perfect place for us to stay after a stressful move and a 6 1/2 drive

There were snacks, bottles of cold water, coffee, tea, blankets, and pillows and much more. Such a well cleaned place. Love the deer in the fields around their home. The fireflies were like fairies dancing all around."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is awesome, better than what you see in its Airbnb photos. You get to enjoy stunning views from the rooms and seeing deers and cows is a fantastic bonus. Kari and Brad are great hosts, they've got your stay covered. It's quiet, perfect for some relaxation. I've suggested it to my friends already."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location and wonderfully appointed. Every detail was thoughtful and from the minute I stepped into the apartment I felt comfortable. The apartment was spotless and had I not brought anything with me in terms of toiletries or towels I would have found everything I needed right there. Fabulous stay and I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a restful and beautiful property.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kari and her husband are clearly gifted in hospitality. Every communication was friendly and thoughtful, going above and beyond any other hosts I have utilized here before. Their attentiveness was never intrusive, just full of kindness.
Walking in, you could immediately feel a warmth and coziness that I found so comforting. The nightly firefly performance was stellar, and I took their recommended ‚Äúdeer drive‚Äù to spot over 30 of them in a mile long stretch. Again, so peaceful!
I stayed at The Farmhouse as a personal retreat to refresh myself emotionally and spiritually. It was absolutely perfect for my needs!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kari and Brad's place was one of the most beautiful AirBnBs I've ever had the pleasure of staying at. They had everything you need and more, even provided little snacks, coffee, tea, water, etc. They really went above and beyond! They were friendly, accommodating, had easy instructions, and even provided some of the best local restaurants and things to do. The view from the living room window was breathtaking, especially at night when the fireflies were dancing around. Thank you for everything!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Kari's and Brad's place is exactly as described - a peaceful, country get-away with lots of wildlife and so many thoughtful amenities that make them super hosts! Kari kept in touch to make sure nothing was lacking and responded immediately when messaged. Couldn't ask for better hosts or better accommodations!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Our accommodations were perfect. The place was very nice and decorated beautifully. It had every we needed and more. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area. Kari was very attentive and she puts communication and hospitality first. Great place to stay!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place has to be the best, cleanest, well furnished and organized stay I‚Äôve had so far. It is jaw dropping amazing in every way possible! Kari is an excellent super host and made a wonderful place for guests. I highly recommend this place and for sure going back there if I‚Äôm in town again for a longer stay. :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kari and Brad were wonderful hosts! We got to meet them during our stay. The place is beautiful and peaceful, and we felt right at home."

We hope to return in the future."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kari and Brad's place was just as they showed in the photos. It was easy to find with GPS-directions and I found everything to be immaculately cleaned and organized. I appreciated the personal thoughtfulness Kari and Brad showed in their home i.e. They have snacks in the kitchen for guests that are organized ""sweet"" and ""salty"". They also provided a guiding book with listings for local food spots or outings (with descriptions and directions etc.) The stay was more than what I needed. I would definitely recommend Kari and Brad's spot if you need a quiet night or weekend out of the city. Definitely a good spot if you're looking to take a work-sabbattical or need some space/time to yourself. I would consider staying here again if I am in the area. Thank you Kari and Brad!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Magnificent! All of it‚Ä¶ they made sure to leave lights on for our late arrival. Had a surprise snack activity waiting for us AND told us about the ‚Äúlight show‚Äù out back. Cannot praise this stay enough!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kari's place is so divine! We absolutely loved the personal touches, which included ready to make smores to the toiletry basket :) Kari and her husband were sweet enough to provide us a nice welcome and some great restaurant recommendations. Not only was the bed super comfy, but at night, it was so peaceful, which included a firefly show as well. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really can‚Äôt say enough about this awesome little Airbnb. It was immaculate, incredibly comfortable, and the hosts were beyond helpful and so friendly! They even let us know to watch the fireflies in the field at night which we loved ! The road getting to the Farmhouse is a bit windy but you get the hang of it quickly. By far the most cozy and comfortable place we‚Äôve stayed at such a wonderful price! You will not be disappointed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Super cute and homey! Would recommend 100000%. We can‚Äôt wait to go back!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Kari and Brad‚Äôs private space was exactly what I look for when booking an Airbnb. I felt right at home immediately. Everything was very clean and amenities were right where I expected them. I‚Äôd absolutely recommend a stay here and will be requesting again if I find myself back in the area!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here because I had a pottery event not far from here- and if I have any close by in the future I will be booking with Mitchell ! He was super friendly, attentive, & went above and beyond for us. He was very responsive to any messages we sent & I can‚Äôt say enough great things about him. Thanks again Mitchell & hope to stay again !"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre going to Morgantown, STAY HERE!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing space! Spacious, clean, and decorated with local highlights. Friendly, gracious hosts. Would recommend to anyone needing to stay in Morgantown."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was fantastic, even better than advertised. Everything was very clean, very neatly labeled, very easy and pleasant to use. Space was very cozy and welcoming. They even took their time to take care of all of the little things, like three cold water bottles in the fridge and one outside in case you wanted warm water. One of the best Air bnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever stayed at"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mitchell popped out to welcome us when we pulled in, he was very friendly and inviting. The room was cozy and comfortable for myself and two friends, everything felt fresh and clean. The stash of games and coffee/tea were so appreciated! Even with the hosts and two dogs upstairs, the room felt private and quiet aside from normal footsteps above. This was a great find for a super reasonable cost."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second stay here! It's very convenient to WVU. The place has everything we need for a comfortable overnight stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely place to stay! The friendliest host and family and a really cozy spot in Morgantown. I was really impressed by Mitch's communication and am so grateful for his flexibility.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent value! Easily one of the nicest basement rooms I have ever stayed in, and I have stayed in a few. The bed and couch were super comfy. Plenty of space for a single or a couple. Quaint and warm decor. All-in-all, it's a cozy spot to call basecamp.
The only note I would share is anyone with a larger vehicle might find the driveway a little tight. I have a Tacoma, and while it is not a massive truck, backing out of the parking area was a little sketchy at times.
Mitchell is forthcoming on the parking, but just a note of caution if you are traveling in a full-size vehicle and won't leave it in the driveway the whole time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mitchell went above and beyond by providing a lot of the little things that can make a stay more comfortable....desk, coffee maker, keurig, microwave, refrigerator, plates, plasticware, mugs, teas, coffees, restaurant ideas, extra blankets, curling iron, variety of toiletries, extra towels, clear directions for remote and lighting."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely room and great communication with owner. Nice spot in Morgantown for WVU games etc!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mitchell's place was the perfect alternative to an expensive hotel on a football game weekend in Morgantown. The listing is accurate. We loved the bed--so comfy, and the couch. Instructions for arrival, parking and departure were very clear. We would stay again."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Mitch is great and so is his place. He has every thing you need like a regular hotel room would have, but better (think fridge and coffee). The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the house is a split level and the guest room is lower. If you‚Äôre a light sleeper, take into account that you may hear any slight movement from up above."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great deal for nice basement apartment!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay at Mitchell‚Äôs Airbnb. Room was clean and exactly as described. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I was thrilled to see that Mitchell's place was still available when I was in town for work again. this is my new go to anytime I'm in the Morgantown area! The perfect place to spend a relaxing night after a long day.

Clean and cozy and had everything we needed!
I would highly recommend!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for visiting WVU! Close enough to everything and easy to Uber. Host is very accessible and replies right away to any questions. We will definitely stay here again next time we come to WVU!

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Mitchell‚Äôs place had a very comfortable bed and couch. It was a very good refuge from a busy stay in Morgantown. I highly recommend the place. However, it is important for people to take caution with the parking spot. I had a bad fall when I came in slipping on the gravel on the incline close to the back hatch of my SUV. The gravel on an incline on concrete is VERY slippery and dangerous. The place is great. But please take caution with the gravel. A caution about it from Mitchell would have helped me when I came in at night. I had not expected such a sudden bad fall. Nice stay but my hip still hurts‚Ä¶. Just be cautious."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay for a few nights! The bed was super comfy and having a couch in the room too made the stay even better!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a ton of fun staying with Mitchell. We ended up chatting about music and even jamming a bit! But the space was also incredibly private and if I had wanted to just disappear it would‚Äôve been no problem.
The room was much bigger then I expected and the bed is an incredibly comfortably soft temperpedic and there was a space heater for when it got cold at night.
On site parking and central location to some bars downtown were just a nice bonus!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place in a great location. Downtown Morgantown, WVU, and Coopers Rock State Forest are all nearby. Mitchell was extremely friendly and everything we could have needed was provided to us. We appreciate him & his family for their great hospitality. We can‚Äôt wait to return to Almost Heaven!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Mitchell's place. It's a great value and close proximity to the bike trail was a big plus, along with indoor bike storage."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very conveniently located. Beds are a little small but otherwise perfect!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was host was amazing!! The room was perfect! The bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful room with a lot of space. Great location and clear communication. Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Booked Mackenzie‚Äôs place for my sister‚Äôs bridal shower weekend. There were four females that stayed at the airbnb. We loved the decor and that there was plenty of room. We also loved having three bathrooms to get ready and the extra supplies provided if needed. We did find the garage behind the garage to be a little unusual and spooky. We also were not sent check in instructions, until we asked for them after 3 o‚Äôclock. But once asked the host sent over the instructions and it was smooth sailing from there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This home has a good central location in Morgantown, which makes it easy to get to various destinations around town. The home is very tastefully decorated. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. Note that you will need to bring your own wash cloths if staying at this location. After realizing that we were only left 3 wash cloths for 4 guests, we reached out to the host to see about getting additional wash cloths. We didn‚Äôt hear back until the following day when the host informed us that they only provide hand towels. This seemed odd as there were enough bath and hand towels set out for us, just not enough wash cloths."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a short visit at Mackenzie's Airbnb in Morgantown but I can't say enough about how wonderful the experience was. From start to finish, this Airbnb stay exceeded all of our expectations. Mackenzie is a fantastic host who goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcome and comfortable. Communication was smooth and prompt right from the moment I booked, and any questions I had were addressed right away. The property itself was not only beautiful but also immaculately clean. The attention to detail in the decor and furnishings truly added to the charm of the place. The photos online simply do not do it justice ‚Äì it's even nicer in person. The amenities provided were top-notch. The kitchen was well-equipped, the bathroom was spotless, and the beds were incredibly comfortable. I highly recommend this airbnb & I look forward to returning in the near future!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space. Clean, bright and inviting. Comfortable night sleep. Great location, pretty central to everything."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was a great find especially on WVU graduation weekend when literally everything around was booked! It definitely would have cost more for any of the good hotels in the area for the amount of space available here. Was great to have to whole family in one spot, and then the other side of the family just on the next street over! Made for the perfect weekend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location, so close to the alumni center, the coliseum and the stadium, allowed us to easily get to all our activities. Access to a Kroger and many restaurants of all kinds at a nearby shopping center was a bonus. The two outside and one inside parking spots were great. All the areas of the place were very clean. Appreciated that Mackenzie‚Äôs description clearly noted the more remote location of the twin over full bunk room on the entry level which was not an issue for us with all adults but could concern someone with young children. Mackenzie proactively communicated; I did not have a reason to contact her but felt like I‚Äôd get a quick reply if I did. Overall, one of my best stays."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This place is just perfect! The amount of space allows everyone to spread out, the open concept allows for amazing social time, & the location being a short walk from the football stadium & a short drive from campus/downtown can‚Äôt be beat! I recommend this space for anyone visiting Morgantown & will certainly have this at the top of my list the next time I visit the Mo!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean, easy and great location!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeously decorated townhome located near the Evansdale campus. Close to everything. The home was very well stocked and decorated and we felt right at home. Will definitely stay here again for our next visit to WVU!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was great and photos very well represent the place. It was so quiet and comfortable and spotless when we checked in.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, beautifully decorated, inviting and perfect for a WVU getaway!
We will definitely return!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This is a great place to stay when in Morgantown. It is close to Evansdale and Downtown, and would be perfect if you were going to a WVU football game."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was affordable, clean, and comfortable. Super nice hosts. We would definitely return."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Place was perfect for our weekend at WVU. Place was super clean, nice beds and linens. Had everything we needed and appreciated the small details. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Henry and Mackenzie were incredibly nice. Their home is beautiful and the perfect size for my family of five (parents, 2 teens and a toddler). The decor was beautiful and the open floor layout was great for family game nights and watching movies."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was exactly as described and very centrally located to the WVU campus and hospital. We were in town for a family reunion and WVU Basketball game, and we were only about 10 minutes from the coliseum and about 5 min from a grocery store, other family‚Äôs hotels, gas stations, restaurants, etc. The hosts were quick to respond when we were about to arrive and I realized I didn‚Äôt get my check in/front door code. I was concerned that parking would be an issue for our two large vehicles since there are only 2 spots out front, and we did utilize the garage space for entertaining. Definitely not a reflection on the hosts- as they were clear that parking was limited. Neighborhood was quiet, but I imagine that would be a different scenario during football season. The beds were comfortable and the linens/blankets were great. It was nice to have stuff for the kids in our party as well. The walker was nice to have for the baby. All in all- great value for the money!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location was ideal - across from Mountaineer stadium- the home was very well decorated and maintained, very clean and comfortable. It sleeps a lot of people, which we didn‚Äôt use, had a grill and WiFi/TV accommodations. Their kitchen is well stocked ( very nice pots and pans) and they even had cups/plates etc‚Ä¶ for toddlers- it was a great stay to celebrate Christmas with our family!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice clean place. Host was very responsive. We were attending our son's graduation from WVU, great location for school functions."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Family of four, in town for swim meet at Mylan Park Aquatics.
So thankful for all of the space, everything so well done and comfortable. Perfect landing spot to let our young athletes (and adults, too!) get good rest and relaxation."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, we loved the decor & the location. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so pleased with our stay. We were comfortable and felt right at home. We loved that we could walk to the stadium for game day, and the entire place was spotless and very well appointed. Would definitely consider staying again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,Had a comfortable stay with my family. Utilized all bedrooms even though one is behind the garage. Good location to central Morgantown. Less than 5 minutes to suncrest shopping center with shops and Kroger.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,"First the good stuff - The accommodation is superb, well laid out, nicely decorated, spacious, superb location to the football stadium, nice amenities, everything you want from a home from home! Hosts are quick to respond to questions/queries and look to resolve any issues speedily. Parking great and close to town centre and restaurants. Unfortunately first impressions marred our stay, when we lifted the bedding for our first night there were a large number of hairs on the base sheets (in both bedrooms) and other areas of the house clearly hadn't been swept or dusted. The hosts responded and sent cleaners the following day to remedy the problem. If the house had been deep cleaned before our stay it would have been a 5 star vacation and maybe the host is just a victim of paid cleaners not doing their job well enough? This was discussed with them and they kindly offered a small refund for the problem. Apart from this its a great place and location. We would come here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect location for a football weekend! The home itself was super clean, spacious and just the right size for the 6 adults we had on our trip! Would definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, great host, great location!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic hosts & home! We can‚Äôt wait until our next visit!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed multiple times now, really great place and great host."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at the Green House for a week as we moved my daughter into her apartment for school. The townhouse honestly exceeded my expectations. It was very clean, quiet, and in a great location. It was a beautiful oasis in the middle of a busy area of town. Our hosts were very responsive to questions and made our stay stress-free. We were sad to leave!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Greet location, comfy beds and great hosts. Would rent again and recommend to anyone visiting Morgantown."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house with all the bells and whistles. Mackenzie and Henry were amazing hosts and kept in touch throughout our stay. Will definitely be back for another visit soon!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mackenzie and Henry were extremely pleasant to work with. Their responses to my questions were always prompt and pleasant. When I inquired as to whether or not the property had a pack 'n play portable crib, to save us from having to bring ours, they said it did not. But, then they quickly responded back to me that they had just ordered a pack and play and it would be there for our stay. The property did not have a booster seat or high chair, but maybe they'll add those items soon as well. The home was lovely throughout, and you can tell they take great pride in their newly renovated property. Thanks again for your thoughtfulness!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you to this fantastic brother and sister. We had booked another place and when we arrived to that place it was less than safe to stay. I immediately went on Airbnb and found this home and reached out to book and they were quick with their response. They got us in and the place was great! Our 12yr old LOVED the house and could not wait each day to get back to the house. Clean, neat, comfy and very responsive! Thanks again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"3 story townhouse immediately across from WVU football stadium. Place had been totally upgraded inside and is very nicely decorated. Plenty of space. Very clean, nice linens and towels and comfortable beds and nice furnishings. Well stocked kitchen utensils. Overall it‚Äôs a good value. Myself and 3 adult children had a very enjoyable stay. Will keep this one in my files for future stays should the need arise. Thanks Mackenzie!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was perfect for my family of six. It‚Äôs beautifully decorated, clean and the beds were very comfortable. Lots of space for us to have our rooms but also gather as a family in the living room. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay again next time we are in Morgantown. MacKenzie and Henry were very responsive to questions."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our visit during freshman orientation. So cute, clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed. Very close to the stadium which would be nice during game days. We would definitely rent again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home. Clean comfortable, and owners are very responsive to messages. Would stay here again if in town."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Upon arrival, we found that the home was not clean due to a miscommunication with their cleaning service. However, MacKenzie was prompt in addressing the situation and went above and beyond to make things right. They put us up at a very nice hotel for the night, which was much appreciated after traveling for twelve hours from an international flight.
Despite the initial hiccup, I must say that the home itself was very lovely and matched the photos exactly. The decor was tasteful, the amenities were convenient, and the overall ambiance was cozy and welcoming.
What stood out to me the most though was the level of care and hospitality shown by our hosts. They were genuinely concerned with our comfort and made sure to rectify the situation as quickly as possible. Their prompt and gracious response truly turned the situation around and made for an overall positive experience.
If you are considering staying in Morgantown, I highly recommend MacKenzie place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great. It was clean and matched the description. we had a great time here. It was a short driving distance to restaurants and outdoor walks.

The host also had stocked toiletries in the event you forget something. They also left us a welcome gift! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my families second visit to this house. We felt like we were going home. I was having surgery at hospital and I had to be there early in morning. The proximity to hospital made it the perfect place to prepare for surgery and I got a full nights rest that night.
My family was able to stay close while I was recovering and felt at home. Giving them the ability to go back to condo to eat and rest between visits. Perfect location and amenities. Thank you Mackenzie & Henry for making this visit to Morgantown a little less stressful for us!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mackenzie‚Äôs prosperity looks just like the photos. The guest who stayed before us unfortunately left a major mess for the cleaning crew which resulted in our check-in being delayed. McKenzie communicated the issue and made sure to accommodate us. I highly recommend this property.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place to stay at Morgantown

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mackenzie and Henry‚Äôs Green House was PERFECT!! I now want Mackenzie to travel to decorate my house. You feel like you‚Äôre staying in a magazine! Amazing location- wonderful responsive and accommodating hosts, insanely comfortable beds. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more! We‚Äôll definitely be back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Green House was perfect for our football weekend! This townhome is spacious and so inviting! Great touches everywhere. And so close to the stadium. Can‚Äôt wait for future stay üòÄ
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved staying at the Green House in Morgantown WV. It's walking distance from the magnificent WVU football stadium. Henry the owner and host should is a super host; pleasant and accommodating. Henry made sure we had everything we needed from the time we booked this place to the time we left it; he was a pleasure to deal with and even stoped by to see how we were doing. His townhouse was totally renovated by himself and beautifully decorated by his sister. It totally looked like a showroom of a store like Restoration Hardware. The accommodations were like a fancy hotel with very comfortable beds, crisp white bed sheets and super clean bathrooms. The kitchen is awesome and spacious and had all of the utensils and things that we needed. I highly recommend this place to anyone who would like a 5 star place to stay in Morgantown."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for our girls weekend! Upon check-in we had problems with the front door code and they were terrific at responding. No issues with the door after it was initially addressed. Additionally, we loved the little touches that were provided such as toiletries under the sink, snacks and k-cups. They even provided white claws and eggs in the fridge! Lastly, the location was very convenient for the football game and for various parts of town. I highly recommend this house!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautifully appointed, totally renovated townhouse only steps from Milan Puskar Stadium. Perfect location for visiting WVU‚Äôs Evansdale Campus, yet only a short drive to the downtown campus. Staying at the Green House proved to be a much better choice than booking two hotel rooms for our party of three. The upper floor of the townhouse provided us with two separate bedrooms and bathrooms. The first floor consisted of an open floor plan with an area for lounging and lunching. The updated concrete kitchen countertop is the stunning centerpiece of the first floor, an HGTV lover‚Äôs dream. Our brother and sister hosts have great attention to detail, incorporating local works of art so you know you are at home in the Mountain State. One particular piece of art, a poster from the September 2022 music festival Healing Appalachia, is illustrative of just how recently the unit has been updated. The location is safe, secure and has a parking space. Communication with the hosts is easy, although we didn‚Äôt want for anything. We look forward to an eventual return. Thank you."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautifully appointed two bedroom condo was home for a week, while my wife was at Ruby hospital. I had long stressful days of sitting in hospital and children I was missing. My in-laws were able to bring my kids to the condo and we all fit comfortably. I went home nightly and was able to decompress, spend time with kids, cook a good meal in the well equipped kitchen, and most of all sleep. The mattresses are comfortable, the rooms were clean and only a min from hospital entrance. I would recommend to anyone visiting Ruby, because it‚Äôs even in walking distance. Communication with owners was easy. Thank you Mackenzie and Henry for making this stay easy for us during a difficult time!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay at the Greenhouse! I‚Äôve stayed in a lot of AirBnbs, and this one has been my highest quality stay. It hit the marks of everything I look for: well appointed, eclectic design, convenient location, and immaculately cleaned. I loved the cozy feel of the decor- they struck the perfect balance of making it feel like ‚Äòyours‚Äô for the weekend without being cluttered. And it was incredibly well appointed! Every time I opened a cabinet or drawer, I smiled because they thought of something I forgot. Henry and Mackenzie were great hosts and very communicative during my stay. Will highly recommend to anyone traveling to Morgantown!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was much bigger than expected. It fit our needs for a short overnight stay. I read many reviews as we had our children with us. I didn't see much about the fact that it is located right in the college town and that kids are in and out all hours of the night. We made do and did not let it ruin our stay, but just for future people to know there is a lot of noise from the hallway and surrounding apartments. We woke up many times to kids yelling and arguing. The apartment itself was very nice and clean."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is located in downtown with many homeless around. We got woken up early in the morning by homeless shooting up drugs right outside our window. You need to park in a parking garage for a fee. The apartment is old, surrounded by air conditioners, and smelled of industrial chemicals. No salt, coffee, or tea. Everything was minimal and cheaply done. The mattress was very hard. This place had no soul. Super disappointed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location was great
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie's place was a perfect overnight stop for us. The place is spacious, and there are plenty of choices for food within a very short walk. Hazel Ruby McQuain Park is just a short walk as well. We walked along the river from the park in the morning before checking out. We had a few questions upon arrival, and Julie answered us right away and was very helpful."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie is an exceptional host. Cute and quaint apartment and was spotless! We had arrived about 1 1/2 hrs earlier than expected traveling from the southern tip of Delaware-she was gracious to allow us to come in early! Definitely would stay again if we are heading up there again! Thank you Julie! Felicia & George
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Julie was so quick with responses and was super nice and sweet. Had a lovely stay and great time.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was really nice being in a clean home especially downtown!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A leaking pipe from above welcomed us upon our arrival but was quickly taken care of. We
Were refunded our cleaning fee due to a delay cleaning up after said leak. Host was very responsive and apologetic. We understood this was no fault of hers. There was a ceiling tile missing in one of the bedrooms and black flakes/debris constantly fell into the closet and bathroom. We were very sorry to discover there was no microwave to heat up our yummy leftovers. All in all though we would definitely stay here again for the great location and the fair price! Julie thanks so much for all of your help!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Host
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie‚Äôs places on High St. became my default rentals when visiting my WVU daughter. The location is convenient to so much, and the rates are typically as good as you‚Äôll find. If I needed to communicate with her she was always quick with a reply."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location in the middle of downtown morgantown. walkable to bars, restaurants, shops, and the bike trail. Large two bedroom, three bathroom condo with separate office space."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was very nice and clean.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host was extremely accommodating. Super helpful with any questions asked and always in a timely manner. Would highly recommend and look to stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a getaway
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was larger than thought from the listing and location is great for downtown location, close to restaurants and nightlife. Price for a regular weekend is great. As others mentioned, if you want luxury then this may not be the place for you, however if you want convenience to WVU downtown this place is perfect. The host is responsive and has always replied quickly."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice apt. The location is perfect. In front of all the bars and restaurants on the main strip. Having a washing machine was also a nice touch. Very roomy and a lot of space for comfortable stay. we had issues first and second day with the heat. But she was very responsive and sent someone right over. But the water never seemed to stay hot when your showering. You got like 15 mins before it‚Äôs gets cold. But other than that 4+ stars for me!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious condo downtown. Convenient location and surprisingly quiet. The bedrooms are away from the street keeping the noise from partiers down to a minimum. Plenty of room and comfortable furniture and clean linens
Parking was provided for my stay very close by. Perfect for a quick visit for students."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay downtown in Morgantown, close to everything! So easy to get inside and I felt very safe in the locked complex. Would stay again!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was easy to find with the provided instructions. The place was as described. No complaints really as it worked great for our stay. The couple of minor things that happened, Julie was very responsive.
Only a few minor things to note. 1. You will hear people and cars behind the building from the bedrooms as it‚Äôs built into a hill. 2. You will need to prop the bedroom doors open if you want the heat to get in."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie was super responsive and helpful. Great and prompt communication. The apartment was clean and centrally located to all sorts of restaurants and things to do
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie is a super responsive host. Would certainly stay again. Thanks bunches, Julie!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie's place is spacious and in a great location.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a setup space with a great location. extremely convenient
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,pefect location and conveniently set up for anyone onthe go. Everything about the place is in the first dress free stay I already booked it for a second time
2023-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"This apartment is a great stay for college aged boys who don't cook and just need a roof to sleep under. It is everything you would expect from a college dorm. The towels were as thin as paper towels and the kitchen was missing cooking supplies outside of 3 small pots and a cookie sheet. There were a lot of finishing touches we couldn't ignore so we cut our stay short.
If you are accustomed to a more 3 or 4 star hotel experience or even a Marriott suites experience, this will not satisfy you. If you are looking for a place to crash, drink or party downtown, this is your place.
It wasn't our type of airbnb, but might be for others."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,We were grateful for the room and flexible check in time. The apartment was spacious though not very clean.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A friend and I stayed here for Halloween and it was perfect! We could walk to each destination & there is plenty of food around too! It‚Äôs so peaceful and out of the way from everything. The space was SO TIDY! And it literally has everything. 10/10! The hosts are the sweetest!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie has been absolutely wonderful. Had to make an emergency trip for my daughter and she was very quick to respond to my same day booking and getting me in again for another two days when I had to stay longer than I thought. Great location!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Julie is really nice !
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked a few months in advance for a wedding. Julie was very responsive from day 1 through check out!

2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for a weekend visiting our daughter at school, and the location was very close to her dorms. The building felt secure and very spacious once we were inside. Being on High St., we were close to many restaurants and shops!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"The apartment is on the 2nd level, and there is no elevator in the building. It‚Äôs one fly narrow stairs. Walking up to the apartment with a luggage is very challenging.
Lights in the corridor were not working on the day we checked out, and we only found out after we locked the apartment door. It was completely dark without lights, and there are no windows in the corridor. Luckily, l was holding my phone. I managed to turn on the light on the phone, with the phone light, I walked down the stairs, and opened the building door, then rest walked down with luggage.
Also the parking is not on the premises. It‚Äôs a public parking nearby.
Coffee pot were not cleaned, and used coffee ground was still there.
I couldn‚Äôt find a cutting knife. Cutting board is at the top of the shelf, I assume most people stay there don‚Äôt cook."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host - easy check in and communication. The neighborhood was not what we were expecting as it was our first time to Morgantown but didn‚Äôt have any problems with parking and enjoyed a nice dinner down along the river (walking distance). This was a great value stay for our group of 4 adults.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great instructions for check-in, spacious and clean apartment."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! And Julie was a great host. There were lots of good restaurants in walking distance: Monarcha, Finger Foods, Bubble Fish and the Iron Horse. Oh, and the Blue Moose for coffee! The neighborhood can be noisy (that‚Äôs just downtown life), but Julie provided white noise machines in the bedrooms which helped and we brought earplugs for sleeping. The Spruce Street parking garage was a great place to park. It felt very safe, especially with so many police officers parking there too. I would definitely stay here again!"

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We loved Julie‚Äôs place! We were in town for a football game and this was a perfect location for a night out. These WVU alum had a great time and felt right at home staying downtown. A lot of space and multiple bathrooms for a group. We would stay here again and can‚Äôt recommend this place enough!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A diamond in the rough, if there ever was one. This place is exactly as described and really relaxing. Had a small glitch with the wifi, but Julie was responsive and helpful in getting it resolved within 10 minutes. The whole place was definitely a gem and we will certainly be back in the future. Thank you!!
One thing to note is that the location is on the second floor. The only downside from this visit is that we didn't spend a lot of time here (WVU football game), but it was certainly relaxing."

This apartment is a hidden gem in the middle of Morgantown's downtown. Julie and Wyatt were extremely friendly and responsive. The apartment was clean, cozy, comfortable and has so much space. The location is just perfect! I arrived to the WVU-downtown campus by walking 8 minutes across the beautiful downtown. Also, by walking 5 minutes, I could arrive to the river, an amphitheater, and other outdoor activities. Perfect place for a perfect price. I would highly recommend this AirB&B to anyone looking for a cozy, clean, and well-managed place to stay."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Aaron is an excellent host who is responsive and accommodating. The house was exactly as pictured and as described. It suited our needs while in the area.
Things that are important to me with an Airbnb rental are a clean home in a safe neighborhood, a clean, well-stocked kitchen, and comfortable furniture and beds. Aaron‚Äôs place delivers on all counts. The kitchen was extremely clean, well-stocked, bright, open, and updated. The beds were among the most comfortable we have experienced in a rental and we slept really well. We would definitely stay again if we find ourselves in this area."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My colleagues and I were staying at Aaron‚Äòs Airbnb for a work trip. The place was big enough for us to spread out and still work, but also cozy enough to still feel connected. The bed was super comfortable and none of us had any complaints during our stay. Whenever we do return to Morgantown, we will be sure to stay here. It was super close to town, and Aaron was a great host and gave us plenty of recommendations on places to eat."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. We were in town cause my mom was in the hospital which was so convenient being 5 minutes away. We had to keep extending our stay and Aaron was so helpful with all that. The beds were so comfortable, clean and nice. I actually took down the information from the beds and pillows because we slept so good. There is a little bit of everything there so there wasn't much store runs we had to take like some places we've stayed. Very local to anything we needed. It was very bad weather when we headed in and he even had it warm and toasty when we arrived. We sincerely thank you for all your help."

We enjoyed coffee in the mornings and sunset in the evening from the back deck where we also watched the neighborhood rabbit and many birds.

Can we talk about the linens and pillows on the beds? Luxurious! I‚Äôm lucky enough that he shared where he got them when I asked. His place was perfect for us and we made wonderful memories and our son got his Law Degree on Saturday. It was an exceptional stay and when we didn‚Äôt bring the dogs Aaron refunded the pet fee immediately. Nothing but good to say, and awesome deck. We‚Äôll be back!"

WV Haven was squeaky clean, kitchen was well stocked, and linens were soft and cozy (thank‚Äôs for stocking extra blankets, and adding a fan to each of the rooms, Aaron!).

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home nestled close to campus but far enough away and not be bothered by the stupid traffic. Update it with all of the modern minutes looking for in a home. Aaron was very responsive a super great home gave great information about the local area as well as went above and beyond to make sure my family and I enjoyed our stay and we‚Äôre comfortable. What do you see with this property is definitely what you get in the pictures do not do it justice.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"I traveled with 6 people (3 couples), so it was awesome that we could all have our own room. The beds were comfortable, and the house appears to have been recently remodeled, so everything inside looked new and clean. Great location close to downtown. Neighborhood was quiet. There was enough space for 3 cars in the back driveway (and we traveled with 2 big trucks). Check-in was simple, the hosts communicated well. I would recommend this spot if you‚Äôre visiting Morgantown!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quite, spacious, clean, and great area! Aaron is an amazing host. The photos of the listing do not do it justice. My family and I booked after loosing our home to a fire! Aaron was more than accommodating to help get us settled in. When I need to stay local in Morgantown I will never book anywhere else."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"UH-MAY-ZING! Aaron was super responsive and helpful! We booked with very short notice and he was extremely accommodating! The house was updated, clean, and SUPER cozy! Everything you‚Äôre looking for in an AirBnB experience! FIVE STARS!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Morgantown and Aaron was an excellent host. Immaculately clean and very well stocked, especially with kitchen amenities like spices, coffee and cooking oil. I‚Äôm amazed at how well the cozy space is utilized. Would definitely stay here again or recommend this property for anyone visiting the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Aaron went above and beyond for me in a tough circumstance. The house looks small on the outside but surprisingly is quite big on the inside. It is clean and well designed. This is a hidden gem.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"While I would like to keep this little gem to myself (especially since I‚Äôll travel to Morgantown many more times with a child going to WVU), it would only be fair to give an honest review to share. This home and the stay was absolutely perfect!
The info on the listing was true to the home and our experience. Full details provided for easy checkin/checkout processes. Communication from the homeowner (Aaron) was extremely helpful, and he was beyond kind to me and my family (every Airbnb homeowner should be this kind and thoughtful).
The home was updated, having new appliances and all the supplies we needed. And clean, like actually super clean - the homeowner and cleaning crew truly love this home and take great care of it.
Location of the home is also great - 5 minute drive or 20 minute walk to so many places, including WVU‚Äôs downtown campus.
I can‚Äôt say enough great things about this home! My family will definitely be staying here again! Thank you for everything Aaron!!"

Such a weight off my mind to have a great air bnb close to my girl at WVU., did I mentioned my girl brought her kitten to stay with us!!!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! Great location right near WVU, but still a quiet neighborhood. The owners communicated with us from start to finish. The place was clean and offered us the perfect option to spread our family out and give privacy. My husband and I used the basement suite while my father-in-law was upstairs. We couldn't hear him walking around ever. We brought our pup too which was really nice. They provided bowls, a crate, and a fuzzy dog blanket. All of us enjoyed the stay and would definitely rent the place again! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Aaron and Carmen were wonderful hosts. Their place was in a great location, clean, and had all the amenities you need. I would recommend their airbnb to anyone. We will certainly be back."

Thank you so much!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us. the space is a great size, loved the outdoors and huge mud/laundry room. The bed rooms are very nice and super cute."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely amazing and a great experience. Thank you Julie
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We would stay here again. One downfall is the parking garage is a couple of blocks away so to load/unload is a bit of pain.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location to everything downtown. This place is spacious and everything was clean as a whistle. Cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Morgantown.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Julie was very helpful. Place was nice. We loved it.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was perfect for a weekend visit with my niece at WVU. Walkable distance to food and fun.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a great option if looking to be within walking distance of WVU and downtown Morgantown. Julie was very easy to communicate with. I recommend this place and will definitely try to stay here again on future visits.
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"Booked this apartment for a baseball weekend in Morgantown and was everything that we needed for 2 nights. Had difficulty with the internet connection the first day, but Julie was very proactive and quick in helping us get the problem resolved. Parking was convenient. As others have mentioned, noise from High Street was quite loud, but to be expected given the location. A good choice for a short stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were thankful to find Julie's place just a couple days before our scheduled arrival to Morgantown for a tour of WVU. The apartment was spacious and comfortable, and just a short drive to the university. The street noise was a bit loud for me, something to consider if you're a light sleeper, but my husband and two kids slept fine. We also greatly appreciated the free and convenient parking just a block away. We would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Would definitely recommend Julie‚Äôs place for everyone except light sleepers. It was clean, had multiple bathrooms, had enough beds to sleep numerous people, and was located right on the main drag ‚Äî really close to restaurants, shops, and the WVU campus. Julie was a considerate host and very responsive to our messages. However, the apartment‚Äôs location also means you hear a ton of street traffic and students going in and out of the bars across the street ‚Ä¶ well into the AM. My son, who is a heavy sleeper, had zero issues with the noise, but my wife and I struggled to sleep through it."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Super close to WVU.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this stay, it is within walking distance of a ton of restaurants and shops, is very clean, and decorated nicely! Julie was very prompt to respond to messages and was very nice."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Julie was very accommodating to our situation. Due to our scheduling changes, we had to change the reservation twice. Each were accepted and we even got a refund for a night we weren't able to stay! Julie was responsive to my questions and pleasant to deal with."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A group of friends and I are returning guests. We loved Julie‚Äôs place because it is so close to everything. We came to visit Morgantown for the weekend and this is the perfect place to stay if you‚Äôre wanting to experience downtown. It is a very clean place. We felt right at home. The price is very reasonable and there are no complaints from any of us. We loved it once again and look forward to our next trip to stay!!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Large enough for a group. Extra matresses. As described. If you plan to park outside the front of the building instead of the parking in the back of the block make sure to put money in the meter. They do check.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,My stay here was great Julie is so nice and friendly the place we stayed was much bigger than expected lots of room and good central location short walk from all the activities around would recommend staying here
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"It was amazing, it looked exactly like the pictures. Bathrooms were clean and the toilet paper had little bows on them, Very spacious and comfortable. easy to find. The only complaint i have was the bars across the street were noisy however it‚Äôs to be expected in a college town. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Very big space, solid location"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie‚Äôs place is a good value for the money and central to Morgantown and the campus. Easy to get around and great parking included.

2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Julie was very nice,helpful, responsive also. Very well explanation of everything. Great location. Very understanding.
Will stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, super clean. Great deal, more spacious than I thought. I'm a light sleeper and the sound from the street was disturbing to me but I moved to the room upstairs and it was fine. My daughter had no problem with it."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie‚Äôs place was exactly as listed. Will definitely look to stay at her place in the future.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Julie's place was good and as advertised.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We were in Morgantown for a show at the Metropolitan Theatre and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more perfect spot to stay. The location is perfect and close to everything. Highly recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's place is great, very centric, just as described. Everything is in clean and in great condition, super cozy and easy to access.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a true gem! Very comfy and cozy place that‚Äôs right in the heart of WVU. Walkable to every club, bar, and restaurant in the area, plenty of activities and food. Plenty of space in bedrooms and bathrooms as well as the common areas. This is a great place to stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was shocked at how much space there was with it being on top of the shops of a main street. Wonderful place to stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cool place to stay for a weekend
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"5/5: Great value; as described; great overnight stay when passing through. Host was a great communicator and quickly accomadated a last minute stay.
Place is big, and has plenty of extra mattresses if needed.
Place was comfortable, clean, and although we‚Äôve never been to this city (so didn‚Äôt know how safe the area is), we felt fine outside, and definitely felt safe inside.
Like others have mentioned, 2 main rooms are on a main street downtown, and across from bars, but if you just run a white noise app, it doesn‚Äôt even phase even the lightest sleepers of us.
FYI, There are stairs to enter, but not bad. Also, parking is in a garage (included with stay) with only a few minutes walk, and our car was safe, and we enjoyed the walk. We were able to unload/load next to place; it worked out well."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Couldn't be more convenient.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thank you very much
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"As described, this place was awesome! Great spot for 6 adults on a gameday weekend. located in walking distance to anything you can need, including the PRT.
I will say High Street is super noisy to the 2 bedrooms right on the street, on a weekend. Noise til 4am. Second night opted for ear plugs and it was fine. only downside to the whole place.
Pepp rolls in the kitchen is a nice touch! Easy access, free parking in garage. WVU color theme throughout.
Would stay here again for sure."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie‚Äôs place was perfect for us on an extended stay due to a family illness. Tons of space, everything we needed nearby, clean and cozy. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough, we will certainly be back!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,A group of us friends came up to stay at Julie‚Äôs place. It was very clean. Probably one of the best places I had ever stayed. If your looking to stay near everything in Morgantown this is the place to stay! We parked our car Friday night and did not move it until we left on Sunday. We could walk anywhere we needed to go from this wonderful location. Also it was very reasonably priced. We plan to make another trip to Motown and stay here!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay here! Julie provided very clear instructions for check in, check out, and parking. She was also especially quick to respond to questions that I had.
The apartment was very nice and spacious for our group and was in a great location right on High street. With High street being very busy with bars and restaurants, I was expecting some noise from the nightlife on the street, but it was actually much quieter than I had expected.
Great experience, would love to stay here again on future visits to Morgantown!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie‚Äôs spot was great! She was very communicative and the spot was perfect for being right downtown. You can park and walk to the shops, nightlife, food, etc. Very nice spot in Morgantown.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie‚Äôs place is in the heart of downtown, it was the perfect home base for our weekend of exploring Morgantown! We were worried about the tricky downtown parking initially, but Julie has a free parking pass in a safe parking garage just a short walk from the condo and across the street from one of the many adorable coffee shops!! We booked super last minute and Julie was so accommodating with our check in time and kept our stay smooth!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great spot that‚Äôs surprisingly big and spacious. You can easily walk to all restaurants and bars, and you have beautiful views all around.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed staying at Larissa's Place very much. Everything we could need was provided and the space was very clean and comfortable. Larissa is a great communicator and her warmth and thoughtful touches throughout her space were very nuch appreciated.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars doesn‚Äôt do this place justice! Great place in an even better location-perfect for a short 3 day weekend getaway. My wife and I both attended school in a similar looking room‚Äîbrought back alot of memories from grade school back in the 90s. It is located in a quiet neighborhood and only ~15 mins to WVU campus, Coliseum, WVU Hospital, Coopers Rock, and tons of yummy restaurants. We loved the beautiful oversized shower in the bathroom and soft close drawers/cabinets and full sized appliances in the kitchen. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets were a dream to sleep in, so soft. My wife didn‚Äôt realize she lost an earring while staying and the Host contacted us and we were reunited with the earring! Very responsive and attentive hosts!! They thought of every little detail and anticipated the needs of their guests with everything in the loft. We would definitely stay here if in the area again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My parents & I had the best time staying here the night before my college graduation! The unit lacked for nothing! Clean, large, perfect spot, we even enjoyed the quaint park directly next to the unit. The bathroom shower was beautiful, the mattresses were comfy & clean. Also, Joey is a wonderful host and had everything we needed upon arrival. If you need to stay in Morgantown for any type of event this is a wonderful place to book. The historical vibe of the old school house is also a super cool touch.
Thanks Joey!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A charming, refurbished schoolhouse room! The bedding was so comfy and everything was decorated exactly as the photos show it. The bathroom was high-end and awesome.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was exactly what we needed to allow my son who is a student at WVU recover from his surgery! We felt right at home! The loft was so close to everything. We will definitely be staying here on our trips back to WVU! The hosts were amazing!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came up for the WVU & Texas Tech football game, and we were so glad we chose the schoolhouse loft over a hotel! The unit was clean, stylish, well appointed, and organized. Our family of 3 was way more comfortable in this spacious loft than we would have been in a cramped hotel room.

Our hosts were nothing short of awesome. Their quick response to our few questions (had been sent prior, guest fail ), friendliness, and personal touches (hand written note & snacks) made us feel like fam.
The space is beautiful, exceptionally clean, quiet, simple but luxurious at the same time, and was more than we expected when we opened the door. Kitchen and bathroom were immaculate, all new appliances and features. Bed (we used only 1) was very comfortable, linens were clean and smelled fresh, lots of pillows to choose from. Living room area super comfortable & tv was perfect for the size for the room. Temp controls, tv, blinds all high tech but easy to use.

From location (ended up being less than 5 minutes from my family‚Äôs house!), to communication, and cleanliness, we were extremely happy and enjoyed our stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jamie could not have been nicer or more kind. We were in Morgantown for a family emergency and had to spend lots of time at the hospital. Jamie blocked off additional nights in case we needed to extend our stay. The house was perfect. The beds were so comfortable and the home was incredibly clean. It was perfect for our needs and had two cool dive bars (town hill and Mario‚Äôs fishbowl) within walking distance that stay open late. Little extras of snacks and coffee is a great touch.

Our girls especially loved the fun staircase and the design of the house.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What an absolute treat it was to stay here while we were on our climbing trip. We have been to a lot of great places with our Airbnb adventures but this one definitely was one of my favorites.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came to the area from Philly to scatter some of my mom‚Äôs ashes on her birthday (she grew up 30 minutes away in Fairmont), so it was an emotional trip‚Ä¶ This home was not only no fuss and no stress, but it was very comfortable! I even reached out to find out where the comforter and pillows were from. They were also very responsive, helpful and friendly to boot. Would 100% stay here again when I come back to the area."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best views in all of Morgantown!
Wonderful, private house in a neighborhood with beautiful, panoramic views of WV. I loved taking in the views while walking my dogs, and there was a nice little hiking trail not too far. Everything in the house was spotless, the kitchenware was very high quality, and the bed was so comfortable. Plus, it was only a 3 minute commute to the WVU campus.
Only slight difficultly was the path up to the front door from the back parking spot. It is very rocky so you cannot roll luggage, and it's a little challenging if you are carrying anything heavy or unloading by yourself. But all in all I would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Highly recommend!Beds were super comfortable. Very quiet area. Very close to High St. Our group had a very comfortable stay. Thanks

A very relaxing stay.
thank you so much."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jamie‚Äôs place was great it was clean and close to the town. Exactly what we needed for a family wedding in town - directions were east to follow and we even left something behind on accident and they were right on top of letting us know and making arrangements to get it back to us. Would absolutely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect place to stay while traveling on a long road trip. The view at night was beautiful. The outside doors for each basement bedroom was a lovely touch as our dogs weren‚Äôt sure about the spiral staircase. This was the cleanest place we‚Äôve stayed. We would absolutely return and hope to soon!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a great place to stay while on a short work trip.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cutest place to stay, clean. Thank you for hosting us!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay, the place was clean and we got a kick out of the spiral staircase. Good location for getting around town."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was clean and well appointed. All the necessities were available and well organized. The house was virtually spotless. There was no need to contact the host during my visit, but clear directions to the location and for check-in/out were provided by Jamie. The area is pretty quiet. It was easy to sleep well.
A note to perspective guests: The spiral staircase is quite narrow, making taking things up and down somewhat challenging. We used the exterior steps as much as possible; but the rain forced us inside. The exterior doors in the downstairs bedrooms made it easy to get all of our stuff inside quickly. Smaller, less rigid bags (duffle or backpack) are much easier to move to the top floor bedroom if using the spiral staircase.
If ever I have a reason to stay in Morgantown again, I certainly will seek out this location a second time."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Jamie's place in Morgantown was delightful. The accommodation was impeccably clean and featured a modern design. Its convenient location, just a short 10-minute downhill walk to our son's dorm at WVU, made it even more appealing. The outdoor area provided a wonderful space to unwind and enjoy some relaxation before heading to the Saturday afternoon football game. Without a doubt, we look forward to booking this place again in the future."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The house was as advertised. We had no problem finding it as we‚Äôd seen the picture of the house on the website and it is easy to see from the street. The house was clean and tidy. The washer and dryer came in handy and it was nice to have coffee pots made available to us. It is in a quiet location which what was needed after a stay on the high street. Having said that, it is only a very short drive down the hill to get to the Main Street in Morgantown. We would definitely stay here again."

The property has all the amenities a visitor needs and is immaculately clean. Jamie communicates clearly and quickly. The house is located within a walkable distance from downtown as long as you remember you are staying in a steep and hilly town. We highly recommend a stay at this property. It was affordable and a joy.
A small, yet helpful hint: The northern side road entrance is a little tight but easily accessible from the south side entrance."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was clean and as described and equiped with everything u may need including pots,pans, tuperware, and cleaning supplies only thing i would say is when using gps it will bring u to front on the house and there is a house in front of it and has a bling narrow drive can be confusing especially at night but once figured out was all good and enjoyed our stay"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jamie‚Äôs home was perfectly located for everything we wanted to do. The house was very clean and included many amenities-nice touches! Beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed to use for our stay. Jamie was quick to respond to messages.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house. Attention to details with supplies already in stock to make your stay easy and convenient.
Jamie was EXTREMELY responsive and friendly. I was in town for a family wedding. In the rush to get to the church on time, we accidentally locked ourselves out. We immediately texted Jamie who not only was extremely nice and responsive about it but had a spare key available to us within minutes of our cry for help. If only all hosts were like him.
The house was perfectly sized and spacious. The two bathrooms were perfect and the spiral staircase satisfied my childhood obsession with them. Parking was abundant.
If I am ever in town for a UWV football game we already know where we are staying."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property was brand new and perfect for our family. The host told me they had just finished renovating and we were their first guest. This house was amazing value compared to other listings in Morgantown at this quality. There was plenty of room for my girlfriend and two children and there was still room to spare.
Overall I would highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre looking for a new house with good proximity to downtown! Thank you Jamie and Angela!"
