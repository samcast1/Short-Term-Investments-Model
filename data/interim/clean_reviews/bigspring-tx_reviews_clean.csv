2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Deema's place was wonderful! We let her know we were coming into town for a graduation and when we arrived there were cute graduation napkins. She had extra, individually wrapped toiletries in the bathroom in case we forgot anything too. I also appreciated the wall mounted TVs in the bedrooms. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep in a new place when it is quiet, so being able to run a movie to fall asleep to was great. We went with my in-laws and this was their first time at an Airbnb. Deema made sure to send any details they might need since they were arriving before us. Check-in was a breeze and it was a great place to stay with family while in town! We would absolutely stay here again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Danette and Phillip are deservedly superhosts. Very friendly, helpful and caring. Their home is very lovely, well maintained and artfully decorated. The setup is comparable to a Holiday Inn or any 5-star hotels. The bedroom is lockable, separate from a full bathroom, which is in turn separate from a mini-foyer where I could brush my teeth and fix my hair/makeup. Very clean and inviting. The hosts maintained a respectable distance, but also engaged in uplifting conversation. I think I have found my people lol. I had a space reserved in the fridge which I didn't get to use because I was there for a night only. I recommend her space wholeheartedly. Five stars!!"

2022-08-01,3.0,Group trip,If you want a place with lots of room this is the place! If you are expecting 5 star amenities you will be disappointed. You can sleep 8 people but the supplies are a little lacking for 8. Not enough place settings nor seating in the kitchen. If you are planning on cooking you will need to bring your own spices-i.e. salt & pepper. You will be rationed on paper towels as well as toilet paper. Hopefully they will restock the closet with more washcloths and hand towels! The house is in a great location! The neighborhood is very quiet and it is easy access to all that you would need! The host responds quickly to your messages. And very good air conditioner!!!

2022-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"We were in Big Spring for a happy occasion to visit family and a new great grand baby. There were 2 couples and 3 teen age boys in our party and everyone was able to have a bed and privacy which was really nice. The home smelled fresh and was clean which was high on our list. The coffee maker was a Keurig which was great as we had brought our own pods. The kitchen was large but the table only had 4 chairs. We only had breakfast there. Just around the corner is a grocery store, a Denny's and other restaurants are not far away. We were glad we chose to stay here."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a spacious house. Kitchen is redone and nice to have. Don‚Äôt expect much in decor. The house looks like updates are in progress but not finished. The location was great to be near our family

A large TV in the living room and nice TV's in the bedrooms. The kitchen was the best, recently updated with a nice open concept and plenty of room to work. Keurig coffee maker is a plus and they were kind enough to include an array of K-cups for their guests to use. And I really like the beds with the nice memory foam for a firm comfortable rest. Location was very nice as well and was right next to a very nice grocery store (much nicer than the HEB in town...)."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Michael‚Äôs home is nestled in a convenient location and the neighborhood was surprisingly quiet throughout the day and night!

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very nice! However, the reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 is that there were wasn‚Äôt any shampoo, conditioner, etc. in the bathrooms and there is no ice in the refrigerator. This is the second time that we‚Äôve stayed here. The first time, we notified Kara about the lack of ice and she said to use the ice cube trays but there were none! I would have thought that she would have corrected that but she didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs very frustrating to have traveled 7 hours and not have ice for a cold drink. The ice maker doesn‚Äôt work, so if you plan on staying here just be prepared to buy some ice for your stay."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kara‚Äôs Airbnb was phenomenal. Like other guests have mentioned - the photos truly do not do the home justice. The home is incredibly spacious and well decorated with just enough decor/furniture to make it feel like home - but not enough to make you feel overwhelmed. There were many extra touches that truly showed our host was willing to go the extra mile - for example the coffee selection, disposable dinnerware (in addition to the dishes in the kitchen) and even a welcome snack basket.
The home is tucked into a nice little neighborhood behind Big Spring State Park in a quiet neighborhood that we felt super comfortable in with our 4 kids.
Kara was quick to respond with any questions we had and you can tell that she takes her responsibility as a host seriously. We would absolutely rent from Kara again."

The kitchen had all that we needed to cook our family Thanksgiving dinner and a very nice coffee bar, with all the equipment to make any type of coffee we wanted. The additional two bedrooms are good size and a nice size bathroom. We had plenty of towels and hot water for all six of us to shower. Unfortunately the dishwasher, (although not very old) died when we were there, but Kara was very responsive and brought us extra towels and a dish strainer. It was scheduled to get fixed the day we left. Not really much to walk to near the house but only a short drive to restaurants and groceries. A nice neighborhood and we felt safe coming and going. Overall a wonderful place to stay, we will be back."

This house is exactly as described and the photos doesn‚Äôt even do it justice! All of the rooms are clean, spacious and well stocked with extra blankets and pillows. The bathrooms had plenty of extra towels and travel size toiletries.
The kitchen was well stocked and she even had a welcome note, complimentary snacks and well stocked coffee pods & creamers if you‚Äôre a coffee drinker!
We were in town for a family reunion and if it‚Äôs ever held in Big Spring again, Kara‚Äôs home will be our FIRST choice!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,2nd stay. Just as wonderful to stay here as it was the first time! Highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Dante's Place was ideal for our stay in Big Spring. We attended a family reunion a few miles away. Linda's home provided us with a clean, comfortable place to stay. If we stayed at the hotel, we would have had to book 3 rooms for 3 nights. Dante's Place was clearly a better value and easily more comfortable than a hotel stay. It enabled us to spend much of the day at the reunion and then relax in the evenings and part of the mornings in a private, relaxing setting. The house is well laid out with a really nice common area (family room with large sectional sofa, large kitchen and dining table) conducive for visiting. Each of us were treated to inviting, spacious bedrooms with comfortable beds. We really liked that the bedrooms are located in 3 separate corners of the house. This gave each of us additional privacy at night. The master bedroom suite is a highlight. It's a large bedroom with a king size bed, dual vanities, bathtub, large shower, walk-in closet and water closet."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,I was impressed with the home especially with the cleanness. I would stay here again. Linda was very helpful and friendly.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to stay!! Very comfortable and nicely decorated! Had all the basics that you would need in the kitchen and I really liked all the coffee stuff! Appreciated the water and snacks that was already there so we didn't have to go shopping right away. Beds were great and lots of plushy towels. We would definitely stay again.

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed in many states with bigger homes for a full week cheaper than 5 days here. Price gouging because people only come here to work and the town knows this and takes advantage. I would highly recommend staying in another area and drive.
Deema also is trying to charge for existing damage to the house be sure to take photos upon arrival if you have to stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,very nice easy to work with beautiful home

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,The pictures and desciption were not accurate. It was represented as an entire town home. It was 2 rooms and a.kitchen added on the a home. The pic of the front of the house was not a recent pic. Couldnt flush toilet paper down toilet.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love this place! We‚Äôve stayed here several times and plan on staying again. Joe is very responsive and a wonderful host!!!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was great for the price and the location. We needed a stay with multiple beds for a large family since we were in town for funeral services, and this was the best option. The location was great and the neighborhood was quiet and friendly. We are glad it had several fans throughout the place, because it was hot with this Texas heat, but glad it finally cooled down during the night. My only suggestion is that the beds were not very comfortable; however, for a one night stay, it worked great. The hosts were super friendly and responded quickly! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Joe we appreciate the stay! It was perfect for our large family.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice stop for the night
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay very welcoming and very accommodative when need something and very polite. Describes exactly what your getting and I love the extra beds just in case you got guest over. I definitely recommend booking with Joe.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great for anyone traveling with littles. There was toys for my 10mnth old to play with and even dishes. There was plenty of beds and space. The parking was very hard to get in and out but we managed and we did have some small toilet issues other then that it was a cute place to enjoy family time. I would stay again if we where in the area.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Place is as described. Plenty of thoughtful touches, especially if you have children.
Joe was very responsive, especially when we had a small issue. We would stay here again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable place, and it has everything you could possibly need for your stay.
Feel safe neighborhood"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Requested early check in. Joe was very quick to accommodate. The queen an so twin bed in the bedroom was great. The one off the Living space was a little unstable. There were on two of us so we took the beds in the bedroom. Little area outside would be nice for an evening glass of wine but it was too cold to be outside. Neighborhood was very quiet. It was a little warmer than I like. Not sure the thermostat in the space was actually working. I believe the temp was controlled by the folks living in the other duplex. No biggie though. Was very comfortable for an overnight stay, felt safe and slept great. Thanks Joe for being a great host. I would use this place again"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful, comfortable, clean, great neighborhood, great location! my stay was shorter han expected but i will be back! host was attentive and communicated very well! might be the location for my Staycation!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My kids and I had a great stay. Was easy to get to town and comfortable beds. Recommend for anyone who wants something simple
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The description is fairly accurate, and there is indeed nothing fancy about this place.
PROS.
The price, whilst still expensive, it‚Äôs amongst the cheapest in Big Spring.
It‚Äôs very spacious and has a lot of sleeping arrangements.
It has a big, private-ish driveway.
CONS.
Both beds being on the northern median wall, we could hear lots of noise next door.
It could use a bit more pillows and beddings.
The toilet takes too long to refill its tank (about 5 minutes), which is problematic when you have stinky solids in there.
There really are better coffees than Folgers out there to provide for guests, without spending too much. It makes a big difference.
The shower could use a bit of work and cleanliness. The shower head swivels on its own whilst in use. The shower mat is a bit dirty."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay! So much more than I expected. I had my 2 year old niece with me and they had baby tableware, baby soap, and baby towels available. Absolutely wonderful!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joe's place is just as described, but even more comfy. Check in was a breeze and he made sure to let us know he was available if we needed anything. We really appreciated that he left items there in case we had forgotten anything after our long drive,(toothbrushes, shampoo, soap, snacks etc) We felt like we were at a friend's place because it was so inviting and comfortable."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So glad we found Joe's place on our way to Dallas. This is a home away from home. It was very comfy and welcoming. Instead of going out (after arriving late) and getting something, we heated up a frozen pizza, thank you for that. Definitely stay again."
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Joe‚Äôs place was as described. Thankful for a late night stopover as quickly as we needed it. The home was clean and stocked with drinks and any other items you may have forgotten to pack which was thoughtful. The one thing that caught us off guard was the ‚Äòplease don‚Äôt flush toilet paper‚Äô sign. Sounds like plumbing needs an update.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joe‚Äôs place was even better than in the pictures! Very spacious and clean with thoughtful touches.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfy stay! Really enjoyed my stay!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Joe‚Äôs place. It was clean, cozy, and in a great location. The kitchen was great for making breakfast, and the coffee was delicious. We plan to stay here every time we‚Äôre in Big Spring. Thanks Joe, you‚Äôre the best!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy communication, and comfortable environment. well definitely return!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Affordable, clean, & spacious!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy place to stay. Plan to stay there again.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"More than I needed for just me but the price was right and it looked like a decent place. The layout is a little odd but it has everything you need and then some. Was kinda shocked when I saw the sign that said don‚Äôt flush toilet paper in the restroom, they should probably upgrade the plumbing or install a bidet. Other than that everything was fine and the place was what I needed at the time. Thanks again for your hospitality Joe."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Comfy place
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for hosting us Joe. We appreciate your hospitality.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Came through from Dallas. Place was great and had what I needed for an overnight trip. Very spacious and clean! Joe responded fast to my texts. Definitely would recommend!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,(:
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joe's duplex is a great value and such a clean and thoughtfully stocked home for the night. Check in was very straight forward and simple, the host communicated well and was very forgiving and understanding of me over sleeping and checking out half an hour late, with the fortunate leeway that there were no bookings for that day. A high recommend for anyone needing a clean and comfortable place to stay for a night or more."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place was as listed. Easy to get to from main highway. Lots of traveler friendly amenities. Good value. Highly recommended going to hike in Big Spring State Park nearby.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Joe‚Äôs place is spacious and full of amenities. It is clean and quiet. Joe is more than friendly and generous. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was clean and welcoming. The entry is keyless. The host responds quickly to inquiries and provides additional amenities; coffee selections, bathroom essentials including Qtips etc. The home is dated and probably 3 stars but is clean, comfortable, safe, and welcoming."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A very nice place! Quiet and everything we needed.
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is as described. Very comfortable but the AC did not work properly during my stay. It was 107 outside and the home stayed around 80 degrees inside. It was so miserable we left early and got a hotel in town.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place to stopover on my way across Texas.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay at! Very accommodating, nice, and clean. Definitely recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a nice stay, very clean, enough space to chill and sleep, we just passed and sleep there, literally an 7 hour stay for sleep, but everything was excellent. Recommend it!!!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"good place to stay! be aware that the bathroom is attached to the room with the crib, with no other access. we loved all the personal touches and were very comfortable. it's quirky, clean and cozy"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as the listing described! It was what we were looking for in a stay for a stop over on our way to Big Bend. Joe was quick at responding to any questions I had.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for a large party. Basement level apartment with all the required amenities. Would absolutely recommend.
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"nice place, but no washer or dryer
but besides that it's a very comfortable place, i would definitely recommend it especially for the price."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joe was very pleasantly sweet and helped us at short notice‚Ä¶.the house is family friendly and I would stay again
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and more room than expected. I'd definitely come back
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We liked to stay here. The check in however was a kind of scary thing as we got in at 0400 dark time and since the door was unlocked for us as#1, we were scared to go in for fear someone was in there already and #2 we wasn‚Äôt sure if we were in the right place so we wasn‚Äôt sure if we were walking into someone else‚Äôs home. They had Christmas lights inside which we liked that. They had lots of store items and a cold water and that was fun. We would def stay again."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Cheap and safe place to spend a night or two.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs a great place
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazingly spacious & well stocked if you have forgotten anything. Joe was very accommodating to our late night check in & always a message away. We liked having the availability of several beds to choose from in different rooms, so we could configure sleeping arrangements to what fit us best."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for what you get
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house is well appointed with everything a traveler could need and more! It was beautifully decorated for the holiday season and I had a super comfy sleep on the master bed. This was perfect for me but would be ideal for a larger group too. Five star plus!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! You guys, this place is HUGE for the price! You can sleep a lot of people in there. I honestly thought it was one of the cutest places that I‚Äôve stayed in. It had a little unique touches and quirks. I could honestly see myself living in a cute place like that. As soon as you enter, you walk into the kitchen. A full kitchen that will allow you to cook any meal. Plenty of snacks, coffee, tea. The living area had plenty of seating, and a beautiful fireplace, nicely decorated for the holidays. The restroom also had endless amounts of toiletries. Even children tooth paste and toothbrushes. Yes they are so thoughtful. Plenty of napkins and toilet paper‚Ä¶.. clean towels, linen‚Ä¶.. literally ready to move in. I will note some things that you may find to be an issue‚Ä¶. Though it did not bother me‚Ä¶. The doors were a bit tricky to lock, The knobs on kitchen sink were weird (right one was stuck, and the left on turned on if you pulled it in either direction), the bedroom door did not have a doorknob, the lights to parts of the house took me a second to find, but honestly all of these things were zero issues for me. It honestly added character to this cute home. We didn‚Äôt use the shower because we only stayed one night, and we have been traveling across the country only showering at every other Airbnb, so I cannot say whether the shower was clean and worked well. But hot water came pretty quickly in the bathroom sink. I will say, I had a trouble sleeping. The Queen bed in the bedroom was pretty hard, but that was not the reason for why I was not able to sleep. Because this is kind of like a duplex attached to the rest of the house, I kept tripping out on the sound of running footstep noises. It turned out that it was just the child that lived next-door, but as I tried to get ready for bed, we would hear the running footsteps along with laughing, and honestly it was creepy lol. What made it creepy was that the footstep noises seemed to come from the ceiling above the queen bed. So throughout the entire night when someone next-door would walk around in their house (which happened multiple times throughout the night) it would sound like someone was walking on the ceiling right above my head. Being a mother traveling with her toddler, I was kinda spooked out. But I know it was just people walking next door. I‚Äôm sure they thought the same as my toddler ran around laughing on our side. Old homes mean thin walls, but that‚Äôs what makes them fun. I wish this house was located somewhere closer to the main highways that my family Normally uses to get from cali to texas, because I would love to stay here again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,5 stars!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time during our short stay.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is as advertised. No frills, nothing fancy. Kind of like staying in a deer camp house or with you Grandparents in the 80's. It was clean, quiet, and had all of the amenities listed. If you have a big family and need space for everyone to sleep but are not concerned with privacy, this is your place. Great for the solo or couple traveler."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,great place
2021-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"This is definitely a no-frills place. And even at that, we were unable to stay for a night. If you Can smell odors and musty smells, this is Not your place to stay."

2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Staying here was like staying at at a 1 to 2 star motel, so I wouldn't stay here if you are expecting more. It is a bit run down and in an area that is a little shady."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place & nice location, I would suggest taking the shower mat out of the tub. Others shampoo & stuff in the restroom. Very thoughtful putting female products in the restroom. Great idea, but nothing I needed...lol. There was food in the fridge, felt as if someone was living there while we stayed. However, felt alone. Thank you Joe!! üòäüëçüèæ"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù! Couldn‚Äôt find a better way to describe it! Great accommodation, great location, not a single issue!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joe was awesome. The place was clean and organized. We stayed here for my nephews graduation and it was perfect. The price was right and much much better than staying in a truck stop hotel in Big Spring. My husband ended up leaving my keys in the house and Joe was super awesome about it, found them, and got them back to me. Definitely recommend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great area, nice place to stay. Clean area and fully equipped with necessities. Host was extremely nice and we had a pleasant stay."
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place it's self was ok. Good area, close to the schools in town. The inside was a bit more aged and in need of repair than I thought it would be; there was a wallet sized chunk of drywall cut from the wall by the fire place; a large crack in the bedroom wall; there was no door for the bedroom which was unsettling; the shower had some stains and the mat inside was soaked when I stepped on it. Behind the rear fence there was a dog barking for most of the day which sounded a lot like a screaming child. I was charged the regular cleaning fee but there was trash underneath my bed and a dust bunny the size of my foot underneath the futon. Not sure I would stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is situated in a nice, quiet neighborhood. If the need arises to stay here again, I definitely would stay stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Joe is great at responding and anything you need help with he's always a text away this location is great for travel or work you won't find many places like this in big springs this a good place too rent !

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you very much for the comfy airbnb. We loved the updates and how everything was accessible; toiletries, location, everything that we needed. We will definitely see if this house is available for our next stay in Big Spring. It's sad that we had to go to Big Spring under sad circumstances with the passing of Mando's mom, but staying at your house left us worry free about where we were going to lay our heads for the night. I would suggest maybe leveling out the parking area and laying concrete because the parking area is terribly bumpy, dusty and has lots of stickers. My son's car almost got stuck on one of the bumps. But other than that, our stay was wonderful. Way better than staying at a hotel and not having any privacy. God bless you!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gloria is a super host, very responsive and accommodating. Gloria's place is very charming and quaint! We enjoyed our stay even though we were in town for business. We had to add two days due to a shuffle in meetings and she had no issues with this. The bed is very comfortable, and we felt safe and secure. The towels are big and fluffy, and we weren't chilled in the bathroom. Check-in and checkout were very easy and quick. Her place is so much better than staying in a hotel. We had no highway noise, which can disturb sleep."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Baylee is hands down the BEST host. Her fast responses and communication are what made the stay that much better.
Hippie Hideaway is the cutest little apartment. The decor is the precious, and not over powering. The king sized bed is very comfortable and was made with clean linen before my arrival. The building is located in a very quiet area, considering how close you are to downtown it was surprising to not have traffic or chaos. WiFi is easily accessible. Smart TV in living room with all of the streaming apps predownloaded. In the bathroom medicine cabinet Baylee even has a travel sized necessities kit Incase you forget something. I thought that was a very thoughtful and a nice touch as well.
All in all, I would 10/10 stay here again and at any other properties that Baylee has listed."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was just what I needed for my time working in Big Spring. The unit was nicely decorated, comfortable, and quiet. Baylee was absolutely amazing in her flexibility and communication with me throughout the duration of my stay, making sure I had what I needed and communicating with me about extending my stay longer than I had originally planned due to work. The friendly and proactive communication really made my stay pleasant and I would definitely book with Baylee again if I am ever in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Older home that had been renovated. Surprisingly quiet neighborhood. The place was clean and had the best A/Cs I have ever seen. I like it about 66 at night and these things accommodated. You could hear people walking up stairs a occasionally but not a big deal. Be was comfy. It was 112 degrees on my truck thermometer when I pulled up. The reason I was staying there was due to my A/C being out in my RV. In my RV the 2 A/Cs I have will keep 85 degrees on a day like that but not a problem with Baylee‚Äôs place. When Baylee could not make it to clean up the unit from the previous stay, I was offered no cleaning fee to make it right. I thought that was fair. I did not stay my last night due to my schedule but was so pleased with the stay that I did not request a refund for the last night. During my stay, I did not need anything from Baylee but if I did, Baylee would have taken care of me."

,,,Host canceled on me last minute
,,,"There were cockroaches in this place. One of them fell on my friend's face while she was sleeping. The host promised to get rid of cockroaches and return the money. However, he never happened to actually return the money. The worst experience ever!"
,,,Our reservation was canceled 5 hours before check-in time. The notice indicated reasons for cancellation were beyond the host‚Äôs control. So not sure what happened but we were forced to make alternate arrangements that changed our travel plans in the midst of progressive vacation experience. Thankful for another Airbnb host that made accommodations for a last minute booking.
,,,"Smells like cat urin!!!! horrible location!!!! Joe will not refund your money if you are allergic to cats or cannot tolerate the smell of urin throughout the place!!!
Avoid at all costs!!!!!"
