2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Davi's Place in West Hollywood is a gem! The place is stylishly decorated and impeccably clean. Davi is an exceptional host, providing prompt communication and valuable local tips. The location is unbeatable, offering both tranquility and easy access to Sunset Boulevard. The hot tub was awesome, we loved soaking in the hot tub. I highly recommend Davi's Place for a memorable stay in West Hollywood."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful. Well worth the trip. The cabin was nice and cozy and the views are fantastic. The space was nice and clean and very comfortable. The one thing I wished was that the internet was useable, as the speeds were such that it was practically unresponsive. However, everything else about the space was amazing. Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Thank you
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place! So unique and such a lovely helpful host. Would 100000% recommend, a must do for any LA visit!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such an amazing unique experience. My bf and I had such a blast. Heidi is so sweet and makes you feel right at home. The outside shower is relaxing. The view is incredible. The doggies would greet us every morning. Would recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it! Especially the outdoor showers.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi was so welcoming and wonderful and her location was absolutely gorgeous. 100/10 recommend and will be revisiting over and over again ❤️
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This accommodation is magical, you are in the middle of nature.
Wake up in the morning with the sun and take a few deep breaths on your terrace.
I could go on and on about this place.
Heidi is a wonderful person and a great host.
The best thing to do is book one of Heidi's great accommodations, then you'll know what I mean. ;)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bubble house is totally unique. It is perched at the top of a hill accessed by rustic wooden stairs. This is not a place for someone looking for extreme luxury. The shower is outdoors, the hike up the drive is not easy, the lav is enclosed and adjacent. This is a place for people looking to get back to nature and experience the beauty of Topanga. The bed is situated in a bay window with great views. The shower has plenty of hot water. The location is ideal for visiting the town or venturing out to Malibu and the the beach. Heidi was awesome and her dogs are super friendly. Loved the stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice views & super cozy. we loved the dogs & the pigs. heidi was also super nice.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peeps Bubble was incredible. A bit of a climb to get to the cabin but doable. Heidi was incredible. Invited us into her home and we met all the sweet pups. If we are ever here again we will return!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"heidis place was an oasis of piece and we loved out little hideaway in topanga! would love to come back! and the dogs were so lovely, a big plus!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay at Heidi’s place in Topanga canyon! Definitely a cool funky property she has. I really enjoyed my stay however, do think it works best for a certain type of guest! It definitely was a bit more on the rustic side of the lodging spectrum and especially with the colder weather we were experiencing in the canyon, ran a bit on the chillier side!
I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun stay in with a beautiful view - just know that it is giving more camping cabin energy than traditional apt or cottage.
Thanks Heidi for the stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I never left! It is as peaceful and special as the pictures convey. The outdoor shower was super refreshing, and the pups are a wonderful, welcomed addition. Heidi is such a friendly, warm person, and I am so grateful she opened up her space for people to experience solitude! I was a solo female traveler and felt safe and at home. Also LOVE the town of Topanga, I had plans to explore far and wide but barely left the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Magical little getaway spot!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place to disconnect from the busy life. Fresh air, beautiful sunset. The animals are adorable! When they greet me outside the cabin made me feel like a Disney princess. Heidi's instructions were super clear, I didn't have to ask for anything else. I had a perfect getaway trip:)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi was present but also gave you privacy and was attentive and welcoming I would definitely stay here again !
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a magical retreat! Will definitely be back. Very clean & serene.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very artistic property in Topanga Hippie style! As a songwriter, the space provided interesting art and natural surroundings, providing the perfect backdrop for creating. Thank you Heidi, for the retreat and conversation! ❤️"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay— perfect for my solo nature retreat! Location feels like miles from civilization even though you’re just 20 minutes away from Calabasas. The place is a magical treehouse— a little glamping, a little cozy cottage. I enjoyed the outdoor shower and had no problems with the open, communal vibe. Everyone I met who was also staying on property was very friendly. Tons of hiking and outdoor exploration nearby. Internet was sparse, I went to town for a reliable internet connection. I felt very safe and comfortable. Heidi has created a unique and special corner in Topanga— definitely will be back again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi is a wonderful host and a great person to have a chat with. She’s a wealth of creativity and has built a really unique space in a town full of similarly unique people and breathtaking views.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything I was hoping it would be + dog and pig friends made it a memorable little trip! Definitely would visit again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely peaceful place with lots of character!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved my solo getaway for a night in the treehouse. Heidi’s space is so cozy and comforting, and I enjoyed reading though the cute vintage children’s book “I like you.”
I am always looking for unique places to stay, and this is truly one of a kind… rustic but comfortable, cozy with proper plumbing and hot water, and views that are breathtaking.
There are some great hikes and restaurants 15 min away, so the location is great if you have a car but still want to feel remote.
It rained all night while I was there, which encouraged getting comfortable in the provided robe, reading a book, and enjoying the sounds of frogs and rain on the roof. It’s a special property and I’d certainly like to return in the future."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi’s cabin was absolutely dreamy and the property was gorgeous. It felt completely private. It was very clean and decorated so well. Worth the price, we would definitely book again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi’s place was absolutely wonderful - we could feel the warmth of her energy throughout the entire space. And Heidi herself met with us several times, introduced us to her amazing puppies (I’m very scared of dogs but I think a huge part of it healed through this trip). I wish we could have more time there! It just felt so great to be away from the city and be reminded of how beautiful and simple life is. Will never forget this experience!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay in Heidi's cabin. Perfect for a peaceful weekend away!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking to disconnect and just enjoy the beautiful nature of topanga then this is the place for you. Just be careful not to pack a big bag because the driveway/ hill is steep so be logical. I’d say check in before sun down so you can see the entrance area clearly. Heidi was so sweet and saw I was struggling because it was dark and rainy (my luck) and walked me to my room herself. What a lovely person. The bed is so comfortable and she offered a heater and the plushest blanket and bath robes. I’d say bring tea bags, snacks and coffee with you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I want to thank Heidi first and foremost. Your property is so much more than I could have imagined. It was a perfect get away.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at Heidi's hideaway in Topanga. It was peaceful, magical, and just what I needed. Heidi was so gracious and I enjoyed chatting with her and meeting her family. Her dogs were so friendly too.. don't be surprised if one of them adopts you! Will definitely return :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heidi was a lovely host! We enjoyed staying at her magical getaway. The decor was eclectic and had its own vibe. We loved looking at the stars through the window bed, and the outdoor shower was pure magic. Bed was so comfortable! She was a very proactive host and made sure we felt welcome."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing NYE staycation in Topanga thanks to Heidi’s treehouse paradise. The surrounding canyon views are breathtaking, we loved walking around outside feeling like we were at a camp or retreat. The pups were so sweet (I must admit Eloise was my favorite) and of course the pig! We crossed paths with Heidi and her family over the weekend and that made the stay even more special. Such a wholesome and friendly vibe on the property. Everyone made sure we enjoyed our stay and always had a smile to share. Check out Cafe on 27 and Endless Color Pizza if you get a chance! Thanks for everything, Heidi & family ♥️"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Heidi is a friendly, responsible and proactive person. We enjoyed staying her property with her family, beautiful dogs and also a pig! Liked the Tarzan shower at night most."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This spot was super magical! Loved having our own space, but folks in the other cabins on the property were so welcoming and made us feel right at home. Cute, rustic, a perfect place to be close to LA but feel at peace!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heidi is a dream host !
The cabin is so cozy , the view is breathtaking.
The bed is very comfortable , woke up feeling like I was in a nest in the trees .
Thank you for such an amazing stay and welcome !"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a creative, art-infused, cozy cabin — that maybe has a bit of magic swirling around inside — this is the place. I loved my stay here so very much. Thank you Heidi!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place! It was a fantastic stay. Definitely good for our souls.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time here, such a nurturing place. Especially loved waking up to the animals. Heidi is awesome! Would def come back here some other time."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay, feeling at home and cozy right away. You have everything you need, it’s a rustic cabin but very comfortable and clean.
The view was beautiful, lots of hikes around, groceries and restaurants just 10min away."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time staying here. The place is full of so much character and love and became the perfect place to retreat back to after a day of exploring LA. Nestled in amongst the Santa Monica mountains Heidi’s place is perfectly placed to watch the stars at night and take in all the nature by day. Unfortunately we didn’t get to meet Heidi but we did have the pleasure of meeting her assistant Gabi and also her Son, Noble. Who were both super helpful during our stay. The real all stars are the lovely dogs and little pig who rock around the ranch. They will welcome you in and say goodbye. My favourite was Elouise. It would be lovely to stay here again in the future."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Mountain Bubble was perfect for a getaway to a beautiful place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heidi’s Bubble was so beautiful words cannot describe the peace I felt. I loved every minute I spent on her property. I even cried on the last day. Coming from a city life to one so still was powerful. The town was so cute. I recommend the water lilly cafe for your morning yummyness. Also cute shops all around. I would LOVE to come back to topanga especially to Heidi’s every chance I get. She was so great! She feels like you’re staying at a family members house. Her doggos and piggy were the cherry on top. Thank you for this beautiful experience 💗
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredibly beautiful place!!! Heidi was so super kind!!! This was such an amazing stay thank you
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! So unique and serene. The outdoor shower overlooking the mountains was stunning and the room itself was perfect for my long weekend stay. Heidi was very responsive and her dogs were so cute! Only things I wish I had known before booking is that the lock is a hook lock, not a proper lock and key. I didn’t have any issues but made me a little nervous knowing someone can just unlatch it from the outside and walk into your space. Also, there were other Airbnb guests on the property (in separate cabins) which wasn’t an issue for me but just something to know before booking. Overall would definitely recommend and would love to come back!"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Heidi was very welcoming and helpful but the place does require a lot of work for safety and privacy.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gorgeous spot for a relaxing, unplugged experience, with delightful shops and restaurants a short drive away."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After I was greeted with a standing ovation from the dogos in the boathouse and a warm hug I knew I was in for a treet!! This place is nothing short of magical, especially the mountain bed!!! And the shower in the olive tree blew my mind every time!!! Magic pure magic✨"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Heidi’s home is beautiful. You can step outside and feel like you’re camping. She also has the sweetest dogs and other furry family members. Thank you!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a perfect, cozy stay!! A wonderful way to get away from busy life, and feel comfortable in a space that is not your home, but feels like it could be!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was lovely, just as advertised. It was cozy, modern, and clean. I enjoyed my stay. The cabin was up in the mountains but close enough to several nice restaurants and cafes. I would like to maybe go back again sometime when the weather is cooler."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi's ""Beep Bubble"" cabin was a great two-night stay in the canyon. We loved the privacy, fun outdoor shower, and most of all, her potbelly pig Dot and all of Dots friends! Thank you Heidi for welcoming us into your home and sharing your beautiful property with us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this stay was just extraordinary! The landscape is just amazing, Heidi was a very oblinging host, who gave me great recommendations regarding things to see in the area. I really loved staying in the mountain bubble and enjoying the quite nature arround and chill with the dogs at the evenings. This experience is broadening the mind of everyone that visits this magical place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying here is more than just an Airbnb - it's got a very special energy to it that transports you. It's one of a kind and I will continue coming back. Make sure to connect with Heidi and get some life wisdom from her.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow, what a find! Simply put, this a magical little corner of the world that I hope more are lucky enough to find. Heidi is friendly, artistic and energetic. My wife and I were lucky enough to meet Heidi and her new pet pig! From the friendly animals, the beautiful views and the unique artistic touch to everything behind the walls of Heidi's property you will leave this air bnb but it will never leave your mind. We will be back, if you are reading this you should book it now. Thanks Heidi!!!! Please give the pig kisses for us. :-)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beeps mountain bubble was the scene of my first night in California from uk and it was a magical experience I'll never forget. Such a cool room and the outdoor shower is dope. All the amenities were well cleaned and taken care of. The canyon was so peaceful and beautiful and it felt like we had the whole valley to ourselves, stargazing most of the night on the wonderful outdoor bed gave us a chance to connect with Mother Nature. It felt like such a magical adventure so thank you Heidi for providing such an awesome space. We'd love to come back one day and stay longer for sure."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We truly had an amazing time. One of the most unique places we have ever stayed!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Heidi was such a friendly and warm host. Our stay at the Beep's Bubble was a peaceful and quiet, yet adventurous experience. The views of mountains from the cozy cabin windows were lovely, getting to shower outdoors (what Heidi calls a Tarzan shower) was insanely refreshing with the cool night breeze, and being among the pets was so much fun. A number of her sweet dogs came up to our cabin to greet us. The style is quirky yet elegant, kinda like we were in an Anthropologie shop but a cabin. :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super comfortable & accommodating.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Heidi's place is totally magical. We had a wonderful time at her cabin, which is incredibly unique, cozy, comfortable - and the views! Wow - pretty spectacular. The cabin has everything you need, the outdoor shower was a dream, and the deck is a lovely spot to relax and enjoy the views. Her property is filled with all kinds of amazing art, thoughtful touches, cool structures and really blends into the natural surroundings. The town of Topanga is close by, with great food and shops. Heidi was friendly, responsive and all around a great host. We didn't want to leave - and we can't wait to come back and visit again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved my stay! Decided to do celebrate my 25th in pure solitude away from it all and in the hills! Heidi was very responsive and super accommodating!

Grounding and nourishing.
Very grateful.
Would return in a heartbeat."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi's place is magical. It's something quite special. We finished a longer trip with Heidi and had stayed in many places before we got to her. But no place was as special as this. It's beautiful in a whole special way. Clean avant-garde.
In addition, the views, the tranquility and Heidi's hospitality which was outstanding.
I traveled with my teenager and neither of us will forget about this place. It's made an impression! ❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beep’s bubble is a magical little spot. Honestly, I wanted to lounge in the heavenly bed all day. So comfortable and surrounded by the huge windows with gorgeous views. I was truly tucked into a fairy tale energy.
I felt very peaceful and relaxed on her property and at my place. The perfect place for me to unwind and come to stillness again after a few weeks of nonstop movement."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi’s place is a home away from home , elegantly and effortlessly designed by her , you feel in nature tucked away , comfortable , no cares with beautiful views , mountain air , drinking your French press coffee, without all the stress of traveling far. Topanga is truly a hidden gem in LA and Heidi’s place is a gem within that gem. The interiors are filled with hand picked art that will delight you. This is a place you should repeatedly frequent because it’s an experience without pretending to be ."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Heidi is an incredible dynamic person with a unique, breathtaking property. This experience was unlike any of my previous stays elsewhere. The cabin I stayed in was perfect and cozy with views of the beautiful trees and mountains. If you’re looking for an ideal Topanga stay full of nature, art, and wonder, look no further!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi's place is fantastic! It's set in a beautiful, pristine area near Topanga...the scenery/views are breathtaking.
Upon arrival, Heidi greeted me and took me on a quick tour. It was wonderful getting to know a bit of the history of her place and of the surrounding area. Heidi's artistic background and energy can be seen and felt around every corner of this eclectic hideaway.
The cabin I stayed in was adorable. It was cozy, and had so many windows I felt as though I was outdoors the entire time. Looking out at Big Rock from the outdoor shower is one of my favorite take-aways... Thank you, Heidi. I'll definitely be back."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our one-night stay at this charming Airbnb! The place is super cute, efficient, and impeccably clean, with an amazing view to top it off. Celebrated my 40th birthday here, and it was truly memorable. The hosts were incredibly sweet and responsive, making our experience even more delightful.
Highly recommend trying their breakfast – it's worth it!
The only suggestion for improvement would be to add a few shelves on top of the bed headboard for a bit more space, but honestly, that's just a minor detail in an otherwise perfect stay. Would definitely return and recommend to others without hesitation!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such an amazing stay! The space looks exactly like the photos but even better. Amelia & Ian were very responsive and accommodating. The cabin was private and serene. We hope we will be able to stay again sometime soon. Thank you both so much! 💗

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb was the perfect getaway for my boyfriend and I for the weekend. We wanted a romantic spot away from the city but still accessible to LA and this place was great. We were able to go out to dinner in LA and then come back to this unique + special place in the evening.
Soaking in the hot tub in the morning and evening was a huge plus! The cabin is beautifully designed and it was so nice to look out at the gorgeous Topanga views.
If you’re looking for a special place to have a relaxing getaway, this is your spot!"

Topanga Canyon is very sweet and lovely to spend some time browsing around. Gorgeous homes nestled amongst the trees and staying at Ian and Amelia’s place gives you a magical little taste of living in the glorious California canyon air. Very comfortable bed - amazing view and delightful aroma wood hot tub = bliss ! Great drive down to Malibu. There is a lovely porch space for hanging out stargazing as well. Delightful little cabin."

beautiful, serene, we heard many species of birds every morning, had coffee in the hot tub every day, and felt so cozy in the cabin every night.

The room was beautifully curated and furnished, extremely cleanly inside and out! The amenities were amazing and the view was unbeatable! Vast and sweeping views of the incredible mountains and canyon, while still feeling extremely private and intimate.
If there was one place with room for improvement, it would be an upgrade to the quality of the mattress and pillows, but for the experience and view, it is beyond worth it!"

I needed a quiet place to stay for a meeting in the city, and this place was it - a peaceful, modern, and unique getaway. Amelia had everything prepared for our arrival, she even had the hot tub temperature ready! The location is in the mountains of Topanga, and the cabin was easy to find, parking is well marked and the cabin is designed to maximize all of the peaceful nature around it. It is literally built into/on the landscape as pictured, immaculate and modern, you will think you've been swooped away to scandanavia. There is a view overlooking the canyon, the hot tub is literally steps away from the cabin. The shower runs excellent hot and cold water, all amenities are delightfully well placed within the cabin itself. There is a coffeemaker, plugs for phone charger, outlets, classy sheets and a comfortable bed, matching robes, this is a category of glamping of its own...pure luxury."

Excellent communication from the hosts and flexible and accommodating to our needs. Cosy, but also felt spacious due to the design, had everything we needed & wasn’t cluttered. Bed was really comfy, slept so well in the peace and quiet…breathtaking views, the outdoor shower was spiritual experience and with the cedar hot tub and beautiful rock formations it felt like a private spa retreat! best place we stayed on our roadtrip so far 😊"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most spectacular Airbnb on the planet!!!!! An architectural delight and design masterpiece. This little Finnish cabin with a view to soothe your soul is like nowhere I’ve ever stayed before. It was perfect!!!! No detail was left undone, the bed was beyond comfortable and the wooden hot tub like a 1970’s Big Sur dream. I absolutely loooved this stay and cannot recommend it enough. Airbnb should feature this property, it is that Amazing!!!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I whisked my girlfriend away to Amelia and Ian's little Airbnb for her birthday (2 nights). We had an amazing time and felt very at peace in the Topanga hills, this place is truly something special (better than pictures). Check-in was easy and self-sufficient, the room was very minimal and clean. Our favorite part was the outdoor shower it was unlike any experience we've ever had coupled with the private hot tub we left feeling recharged and ready for our week upon departure. My one complaint is the bed is advertised as a queen but in reality, it is 2 twins pushed together which separates in the middle and can be uncomfy for two people. My one tip is to either not bring food into the cabin or use the yetti cooler they have outside because we woke up to ants our final morning. All in all would recommend to friends and family. Thanks Amelia & Ian!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amelia & Ian have designed a beautiful tiny home, simple but efficient with everything you need. They were very responsive to our needs and provided recommendations when needed. The space felt very private on the property and was in a great location.

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Garry’s place is in a wonderful location, just a short walk to various restaurants, bars, and grocery stores. You get a designated parking spot on the street which is really nice. We loved how welcoming and friendly Garry was when we first arrived, even with us coming later at night. We stayed in the studio guest house -the space was comfortable but it could definitely go through some maintenance and deep cleaning (there was a bad smell near the kitchen sink, the shower door leaks, one of the kitchen shelves is wobbly - so not very functional). However I loved Garry’s hospitality and the location, it’s a great price for what you get. 🙂"

The best part of the stay is Garry our lovely host. He waited us till late since we had a late flight to help us checking in, he also went out his way to help us with some laundry which I could not thank him enough. It’s all about details with his place, the cold drink when we first arrived, sunburn gel in the fridge (considering LA was so hot and my husband got pretty bad sunburn on the first day). I would strongly recommend Garry and his place to anyone."

I would DEFINITELY recommend this AIR BNB venue , and plan to stay AGAIN when possible during another trip to West Hollywood. 5 STARS, in my book ...all around AND at a great price per night.

We had our privacy and xtra space, amenities and awesome accommodations like Air bnb's can have, but we also felt like we had a personal concierge, ready to answer any questions we had or offer suggestions about where to shop, eat, etc.
Garry's location can't be beat... we were able to use it as our home base for the activities we wanted to do and we felt completely safe, comfortable and cared about. 5 star customer service all the way."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was probably one of the best experiences that I've had with an AirBnb rental. Garry has put a lot of thought and care in this space which is essentially a small guest house tucked in a quiet corner behind his residence. The place was sparkling clean, the kitchen was fully equipped, and the bed was very comfortable. Parking was easy and always available in front of the residence. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful and quiet yet walking distance to shops and restaurants. Garry was extremely responsive to all of my questions. The only downside (and this was not an issue for me), is that there isn't (nor is there space for), a desk and chair for those who might need a proper set up to work from."

Two big drawers under the bathroom sink and a glass shelf above the sink for all your stuff. Thoughtful touch like putting a few bottles of
coconut water in the fridge. Bed was comfortable even though I prefer a box spring. Garry was very responsive to all questions. I will definitely return!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent home base for hiking in Griffith Park (Observatory, Caves, Hollywood Sign, Ferndell park), in a beautiful neighborhood, with plenty of healthy and hip food options nearby to refuel and socialize. Harut and his father were extremely responsive and friendly. The cottage was small but private, safe, well decorated, clean, and had everything necessary for one person: kitchenette, bathroom, outdoor and indoor table and chairs, and comfortable twin bed. I especially appreciated the coffee, water, and snacks and would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing experience to staying here for me. Harut and his dad are so helpful. The area is perfect. Room was so clean. I definitely suggest.
Thank you for everything !!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love your place is a very cozy place to stay, it just was my tight schedule didn't allow me to walk those beautiful surroundings"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut and his family were wonderful - friendly, kind and responsive. The location was perfect for my trip - less than a mile from my daughter's apartment. Easy access to Griffith Park and the Fern Dell trail. If you're traveling solo, can't beat the value."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For a 1-person stay, you can’t beat Harut’s property! The neighborhood is quiet and parking usually isn’t an issue. The room itself is small and cozy with plenty of storage and fully stocked with everything you could possibly need, as far as home supplies are concerned! The TV and wifi are easily accessible as well, and the air conditioning was very convenient! My only issues were with the bedding, which had a fuzzy comforter that I personally did not enjoy laying on (though he provides plenty of blankets to make up for it, which I used!), and the patio area, which I found uninviting as there were always flies there, even when it wasn’t raining. It didn’t really affect my stay though, as I never made use of it. The smoke alarm being immediately next to the stove was also inconvenient for cooking as it went off as soon as the stove warmed up (it’s a gas range), though I understand there’s nowhere else to place it. Oh, and bring an extension cord for electronics! Overall, it’s GREAT!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean and it was walkable to market, restaurants and hikes."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect little place to crash for a few days during my solo stay in LA. Cozy and great location. Highly recommend and I personally would return again if needed!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this Airbnb. Great location near Griffith park and central to Hollywood and all LA action. Harut was extremely communicative. This is a small cozy place for one but well set up and ideal for a busy weekend out and about in LA.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place…really enjoyed staying here!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut was very friendly & met me to hand off the key upon arrival. It was a very nice micro cottage that had everything I needed for the week. Comfortable bed, a small but very functional kitchen, & the shower was just large enough (I’m 6’1”, 230lbs). Very quiet & private. I enjoyed walking the neighborhood."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 1st time stay at this propety, but it will not be the last time. The hosts (Harut, his father John, and mother) (I didn’t get her name, but I’m sure she responsible for how quaint, clean, and cozy this place is) were AWESOME!! I did not meet Harut in person, however Mr John was readily available to meet all my needs, and Harut answered ALL my questions in a timely manner. (So fast some time I was like WTF lol) The cottage was decorated beautifully in a Breakfast at Tiffany’s theme, and had snacks, water, and coffee supplied. It was safe, cozy, and clean. As I stated above, I’ll definitely be staying here again. Thank you all for caring for me and making me feel safe, and welcome."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a nice private space. I prefer this type of arrangement more than sharing a home with someone.
The place is clean, very well decorated, and they had treats."

His cottage is beautiful, peaceful and it’s perfect for a solo traveller. Harut’s place was very cute, super clean and cozy with a great design. The cottage has everything you need, the snacks, bottles of water, coffee, tea, shampoo, lotion and etc. The neighborhood itself is just perfect, walkable to many convenient locations nearby and it’s a very safe area.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Harut’s place — it’s perfect for a solo traveller looking for a private and peaceful spot with everything you could need.
Groceries, cafe, laundry etc are a 5 mins walk away. You can hike up to Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood sign easily here too. There are dogs on site but they are friendly and don’t roam freely so don’t worry about going out into the courtyard.
Harut waited out late for me on check-in as my flight got in late evening and was very attentive throughout the stay. I’d definitely recommend and would visit again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely space in a very safe neighbourhood.
All home comforts including private outside space.
Harut was very friendly and quick to respond to messages which made checking in and out really easy.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely private and secure accomodation. I would recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really good guest house to stay at if you're a solo traveler. The place was somewhat hard to find considering I showed up at 1am and the address pointed to a different building but Harut was super responsive and had a different person show me the correct place.
The airbnb was clean and beautifully decorated. There were even some nice snacks laid out which was a nice touch. I think the only downside was the noise in the morning as the owners had a dog they led out to use the bathroom several times. Good thing I brought earplugs though."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut’s place offered a peaceful, super clean & homey oasis during my stay! I found it so easy to locate & was walkable to a lot of convenient locations nearby. Always felt very safe & secure. Would absolutely stay here again on my next trip out!!!"

Highly recommended 👍👍"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut's place is a peaceful little getaway right near the bustle of Hollywood. It's perfect for one person, and the decorations really make the place feel like a home. There's lots of shops and restaurants just around the corner."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! It exceeded my expectations. Perfect for 1 person. Has everything you need and is stylish, clean and quite.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place - it's essentially a MIL apartment in a converted shed behind a small apartment building, with a private, enclosed patio. Funky decor, super clean, very quiet. Harut responded to my messages almost as soon as I sent them, and was flexible about check-in/out times. Location is also great -- there's street parking plus easy access to the DASH, city bus (both a block away), and metro (less than a mile away). I would absolutely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in LA to visit my son, and Harut’s place was perfect for my stay: quiet, well-appointed, comfortable. Harut was very responsive to my questions, and very helpful during the check-in and check-out process. Great location. I’m glad to know about Harut’s guest cottage—I would happily return!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Harut was super responsive and very helpful, all of my questions were answered promptly.
The coach house is small but clean, tidy, and well organized. The welcome snacks were a lovely touch and I felt very safe at the rear of the property away from the street. The shower stall is a bit cramped but its manageable! You just may need to turn the water off and sit on the toilet to shave your legs.
The neighborhood is lovely as well, with plenty of street parking right out front of the property and a grocery store, dry cleaners, and several restaraunts and small businesses within an easy five minute walk. The property is nice and quiet, and the private patio for the coach house was a lovely place to relax and unwind without disturbing the neighbors.
I will absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in LA! I really cannot recommend this place highly enough! Thanks so much for making my vacation smooth and special!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a lovely accommodation for a solo traveler. Beautiful, walkable neighborhood and a very well put together apt for such a small space. I also loved the private patio. It is tiny, but it wasn’t an issue at all for me. Would absolutely book again"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut was a friendly and helpful host. The cottage was centrally located for my purposes. The cottage was well-stocked with coffee, snacks and water. A full service grocery store is only a block away."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut was so kind and helpful. He went above and beyond. He let me check in a little early and a little later than normal. He delivered an Amazon package to me. He let me extend my stay by two days at my request. This is such a lovely, very cozy little spot that's located in a great part of Hollywood. It's also a very quiet block He's made the most of it; providing everything one needs for a 5-day stay in LA. You get the entire space to yourself which is HARD to find in LA. Because it's in the back behind the main apartment building, it is ultra-quiet. There's even a small back outside area where you can sit and meditate or drink your morning coffee. No weirdness happening around it. The interior amenities and decoration are thoughtfully curated. I can't say enough about Harut or his wonderful space. I'm so glad I found it and would stay there every time I'm in LA. It's priced right - very affordable. 10 out of 10. Thanks, Harut!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Nice and private, perfect place for a solo traveller to stay. The host was very responsive and helpful.

I absolutely recommend this place, 5 stars"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly a great place to stay for one person. The space is small and the kitchen and bathroom are a little tight, but over all very comfortable and great location. About a 5 minute walk to a full grocery store with everything you need."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have nothing but great things to say about this stay. Met my needs and expectations perfectly. Cozy, plenty of amenities, and a great place for a home away from home while touring around the area. Harut was extremely responsive and helpful leading up to, during and after the stay. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience or a more comfortable stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was everything I had hoped for! Will be booking again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check-in. Host was very accommodating and welcoming. The surrounding area felt safe for a person like me (woman) who was traveling alone. It was also quiet and away from the busy streets so sleep was undisturbed, but you weren’t in the middle of nowhere so the touristy parts were a 5-10 min car ride away or 30 min walk away if you wanted to go.
Cottage came with towels and amenities that made traveling lighter possible.
Super plus - it was near a grocery store so if I needed anything, it was a 5 min walk away. There are also some decent restaurants near by to grab a quick meal.
The cottage is located behind the main house (disconnected from the house so it’s all for yourself) and you are free to exit and enter whenever.
It truly is only for 1 person to stay in so just a heads up (this wasn’t a bad thing). Maybe you are very tall, the bed and shower would not suite you."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonderful experience here! Harut is so active and kind. The cottage is very convenience. All stuffs that you need for living are complete. It will make you feel comfotable and private in the area. If you expect to use public transport like bus or subway, it is walking distance. Don’t miss your stay at Harut’s place, if you are planning to spend time in L.A."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little guest house. Perfect for my work trip. They even had toiletries and snacks and water. Very comfortable and had everything you could need. I also enjoyed the private patio
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a single person. Harry was kind and accommodating. Safe street and I was able to find parking even when they posted “no parking Monday am for street cleaning.” Nice grocery store within walking distance. I hope to book again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I loved Harut’s place! It was cosy and comfortable and very safe. The snacks and the water Harut left were a nice touch.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut was incredibly warm, welcoming, and responsive during my stay at his cottage! He greeted me at the gate when I arrived and promptly answered all of my questions when I messaged him. The space itself was well decorated and very homey. I also felt very safe in the area as a solo female traveller—not something you can say about all areas of LA. Would def recommend staying here. :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will always stay here whenever I’m back in LA for work. It’s perfect - location, size, privacy, safety and cuteness. I loved it."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Cute comfortable space to stay at. Really close to lots and walkable distance aswell. The host was really lovely and made sure my stay was comfortable. I would stay here again
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I highly recommend this as a safe place for female solo travellers.
I would like to begin by saying that Harut, and his family are lovely. His family would leave the lights in the cottage on for me if I came home after dark. It made me feel very secure knowing that someone was keeping an eye on me, and I could head next door if there were any issues.
Be aware that space is a guesthouse behind shared housing, so there are people coming and going, there may be dogs/cats around. The interior is a little cluttered, so you may need to move things around to make yourself some space. It's also just the right size for one person of average height and weight to move around comfortably.
The best thing about the space was Harut, he added an extra day at a discount so I could be comfortable leaving to catch my flight, and facilitated early check in for me. Highly recommend for an affordable and safe space close to busses and shops."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut was warm and welcoming. His place was cute, immaculate, cozy and well equipped with good coffee and a functional kitchen. Beautiful neighborhood. I’d gladly stay here again!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, well-appointed and conveniently located garden house. Harry is an excellent host. The space fits one person only, however, and a large guy (6ft+) will find the bathroom and shower functional but VERY tight."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the best study at Harut’s Hollywood Cottage. Centrally located near a market, an excellent Thai restaurants, and easily walkable to UCB Theater and Griffith Park. It was so peaceful and the perfect size for one person.

You’re two blocks from Hollywood Boulevard but in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Restaurants, shops and sites are within easy walking distance, which made it night to just walk to dinner or for coffee. Hiking trails are close by, Griffith Observatory is close by, and all the fun of Hollywood is just a few blocks away. Check in/out was easy, and Harut was a pleasure to work with. Super friendly and responsive to answer any questions I had. I highly recommend this location and this property owner to anyone. It was a fantastic stay!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So nice to have Harut greet you when you first arrive. The way airbnb should be! This is a small space with a twin bed so it is good for a single person stay. Clean and adequate for what I needed. I had a pleasant stay. Thanks.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I love the location of Harut's place - a short drive up Franklin to the trendy Atwater Village and also easy access to highway 101 from there. The decor is pleasing and Harut and family are welcoming.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved my stay at this adorable cottage! It was perfect for one person on the go & Harut thought of everything. It has the cutest little private patio and is in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood. It’s a 3-5 min walk to UCB, the Oaks Gourmet, Gelson’s, and a strip of bars & restaurants. Highly recommend!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is a great deal in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Harut is a stellar host. I innocently inquired before my stay if he had a citrus squeezer and he immediately said he would get one. It was on the kitchen counter when I arrived. Also, I managed to lose a backpack the second day I was there...and of course the house key was in it. Harut and his dad rallied to go to Home Depot late at night to make a spare key for me, and his dad met me in front of the property with a smile on his face, when he just as easily could have been abrupt and annoyed. Much appreciated! About the place itself: know that it is TINY. There is room for one person, unless you're a couple who are comfortable sleeping in a twin bed. But everything you might need is there: microwave, stove, table and 2 chairs, bathroom with a nice shower, cable TV, even a little L-shaped patio area. It's a little stand-alone cottage behind the main house. so you're not dealing with street noise, though there really isn't that much street noise to begin with.--and the neighborhood vibe is safe and peaceful. And there's even ample FREE parking on the street, a rarity in L.A. (Street sweeping on Monday and Tuesday might add a degree of difficulty.) You're not far from Silver Lake, Los Feliz, The Hollywood Bowl, or Burbank Airport. Pro tip: if you're not going to be spending almost all your time on the west side--or maybe even if you are--you'll wanna fly in and out of Burbank and avoid LAX for sure. Very likely to stay here if it's available next time I'm in town."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host, very clean and comfortable place. Thanks so much Harut!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful stay. The hosts were kind and answered all of my questions. It’s a little cozy, but the location is everything. I will stay again for sure."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Stayed here for 9 nights, first time in LA and in a great location. Short walk to the metro station or bus stop 2 minute walkaway. The accommodation was excellent with everything provided that you would expect. Plus a food package with snacks left by Harut as well which was a great addition. Nice outdoor space and all very clean. Met Haruts dad on the welcome and Harut was very quick in responding to any messages. The location felt very safe and was on a small street just off the main road and with grocery store just a short walk away.
Great stay in LA for a solo traveller and would definitely stay here again if back in LA . Thank you :)"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have nothing but good things to say about my stay with Harut. Harut and his father both treated me with kindness and went out of their way to help. The location can’t be beat, as you can easily walk to the supermarket and several great restaurants. Perfect for the solo traveler! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I truly enjoyed the private outdoor space included, and the decor inside made it so cozy. I loved the acoustics in the shower!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very nice and cozy. Exactly what was describe and shown in the picture. Harut responded very quickly and was accommodating. We definitely stay here again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great small cottage for solo travelers! It was super clean, had extra towels, and the AC unit worked well. Would definitely recommend for an affordable option!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,super nice and easy place to stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Harut's place is perfect and it's on a great location. It's close to public transportation, and a walk distance from some really nice sightseeings from LA.
Everything was perfectly organized inside the cottage, and it's perfect for a solo traveler. I would definitely recommend it to everyone, and I hope to be back someday.
Harut was very kind and helpful, and even allowed me to check-in early."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut was a lovely and cooperative host, accommodating our needs with quick replies to all communication. Since my reservation was on behalf of a family friend who needed housing when our guest room became unavailable, I can't say more about the unit itself, except that our friend was very happy. And grateful."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut's cottage is a wonderful landing pad from which to explore Los Angeles. This was my fifth stay (would have been seven, without pandemic) and it's easy to see that he is always thinking of ways to make the cottage more accommodating. Neighborhood celebrity sitings and good street parking are an added bonus."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Harut is a perfect host and his space is adorable. Really well appointed and situated!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is sweet, cozy and in an amazing location. 15 min walk to the walk of Fame, 15 min walk to the train station, three min walk to a local grocery store and several restaurants and shops. Lyft comes quickly when you just don't want to wait. and Uber Eats delivers quickly as well! the cottage is also close to Griffith Park, the Observatory, Bronson Park, Bronson Caves, Hollywood Bowl, etc. The location provided a unique experience."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would strongly recommend it!!! It a very decent private room in a decent neighbourhood. You even have a private backyard! I enjoyed every night walking around and just enjoy the beautiful view and the Hollywood sign. The location is wonderful, super close to Hollywood and the famous Griffith Observatory. 5min away from groceries. What I love most about this room are the decorations inside, carefully designed. Kept surprising me with rich details, even the key came with an eye of ra. Overall it's really homy and healing. I would say the pictures didn't do it justice. It's definitely an experience rather than merely a stay. Perfect for the travellers especially if it's your first time in LA. I really had a wonderful time here. Prolly my best airbnb experience so far. Definitely will come back again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut’s place is very cute and cosy, very comfortable and in a great location with good security. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut's place is ideal for the solo traveler exploring Los Angeles. It's conveniently located, but you also have the benefit of enjoying a relaxed neighborhood rather than a hotel amid the nonstop hustle and bustle of other tourists. I felt safe staying in this neighborhood where restaurants and a grocery store are a short walk away. Harut's place is clean, secure and the amenities -- especially the kitchenette -- are convenient and much more than you will find in a typical hotel room. Also, Harut is a responsive and caring host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location. Harut's place is as advertised and walking distance to a lot of places in Hollywood and always a place to park in the streets."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cottage is a super clean cottage in a very safe area, which is actually very important to us women, who travel alone. You can have nice walks and the apartment is about 8 minutes away from the Hollywood Blvd by car. Harut took care of every inquiry I had and I would recommend this apartment to everyone, who wants to stay in Los Angeles."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Harut's place was perfect for a solo traveller, and first timer in LA, like me. Highly recommend."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at this quaint, cozy, and wonderfully decorated cottage.
Harut was an amazing host. He was prompt and very accommodating with my concerns prior to my stay. Everything was very straight-forward once I got there. The place has all the basic necessities you will need.
Hopefully when I’m in town again, I get to stay at this fantastical place."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place in nice area. I appreciate the snacks.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic stay at this beautiful little cottage, from beginning to end.
The space was so thoughtfully decorated and stocked with all the essentials. You can tell a lot of thought was given into the needs of the guest and how to provide a comfortable and memorable stay. The cottage was complimented by responsive, professional and kind host, Harut. I wouldn’t have changed a thing."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut’s place was beautifully laid out and presented. Clean, well equipped - and the location is perfect.. safe and peaceful. Thanks for having me!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable spot in a great neighborhood that's easy to get to the freeway, but still quiet. The place was super cute, and the host was very easy to work with and warm. Great for a solo venture to have a launching off pad to explore."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautiful, clean, and private space. It has all the essentials for kitchen, bath, and bedroom. The furniture was perfect sized, modern and comfortable. Enjoyed the private patio. The decor and details of the place also brought joy. The location is in a nice neighborhood with respectful and friendly neighbors, and is at walking distance to the grocery store, nature walks, public transportation and restaurants. You can expect a great host, who is very welcoming and attentive. For my long stay, I felt very well taken care of and felt close to home. I would definitely recommend to stay here."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A charming place to stay. Harut was great and communicative. Cannot wait to visit again soon!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great spot, close to Sunset Boulevard and other amenities. Harut is so helpful he goes above and beyond to make sure you have had a nice stay, would definitely recommend!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Harut was very attentive and communicative. Location is in nice and quiet neighborhood with grocery store around the corner. And other stores not not too far (<2 miles). Place is very cozy but doable for one.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut’s place was great. It’s in a nice little neighbourhood and felt very safe.
The guest house itself was cozy but ample-sized for one person. There were lots of nice decorative touches around. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great.
Harut himself was a great host. He was kind enough to wait up to welcome me after my delayed arrival, and communicated swiftly to put me at ease. There was a nice ‘welcome basket’ of snacks and drinks which was really thoughtful and much appreciated.
I can’t recommend Harut or his place highly enough!!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time staying here. It was in a nice neighborhood yet close to public transportation. It's definitely enough space for 1 with a bathroom, kitchenette, and desk space, and the bed was very comfortable. The shower is a bit small though so there's not much space to maneuver around, but I enjoyed the water pressure and it was fine enough for my stay. The only thing to watch out for are the rugs - they are super slippery since there's no rug pad underneath, so I almost slipped and fell multiple times lol. Other than that though, speedy communication and nice private haven to explore LA from."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Accommodation was clean, quiet, tranquil, good location, free parking on a street and tasty welcoming snacks were there for me 😊
Everything functioned well.
Accommodation is quite small. It is something you might consider when booking this appartment especially if there are 2 people with luggage."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in a safe neighborhood, nearby grocery and restaurants. Nearby trails and hiking. The Airbnb is small but perfect for a stay for one. My sole complaint is you must be flexible to shave your legs in the small shower but this is a minor thing as the water pressure and temperature were great. Thank you again to Harut for your kindness and excellent communication."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This tiny, charming, quiet, sunny gem is in a fabulous, safe neighborhood near Griffith Observatory. Will stay again when I visit my daughter."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a cozy little place to stay and very convenient to my vacation needs, and I would definitely return. I was concerned at first that it would be too small but honestly for one person not much more space is needed and I was thankful to avoid a hotel with a lobby and other guests. Easy parking, and I loved having the coffee maker for immediate caffeine needs! Thanks for a great stay, Harut!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a comfortable, safe, private unit in a great neighborhood. It’s a perfect size for one with a nice side patio, great amenities and a comfortable bed. There is a grocery store, restaurants & good transit, all with walking distance. Hope to stay here again!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Well located carriage house on a safe and quiet street in Hollywood. Never had a problem finding parking on the block. Harut was helpful with check in and promptly responds to texts. The place is cute and clean and is quite small. It suited me because I was out sight seeing and visiting family most of the day. Good value.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had a great time staying at Haruts place. The private cottage is located in a charming, nice and quiet neighborhood very close to public transport, restaurants and stores for your daily needs. As well as a perfect getaway for several hiking routes and activities around Hollywood Hills. Harut has been a great host - he is very kind, supportive and responsive.
I’d come back anytime again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very adorable space perfect for one traveler! I loved the location - super beautiful neighborhood which was nice to walk around, easy parking, close to Griffith park.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was an amazing stay! Everything was perfect! Harut is great, very attentive.

2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is super clean and cute but it is suuuuuper small. If you are bringing a big suitcase or you are a big person, this is not the place for you. The host is awesome and the area is super safe."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut is such a friendly host. He is quick to respond, always willing to work with you to allow for an early check in if its ready and a late check out if he can.
His unit is spot on for its description and a great value for a single traveler. This is my second time staying here and as always - parking is super easy and safe, he leaves little snacks for the guests to munch on -- and he even got some cupcakes for me for an early birthday gift- Such great little details that make me always seek him out when I come to visit.
He recently redid the bathroom and its uber clean and well stocked. and the water pressure is AMAZING-- i wanted to stand in there forever just to have that water hit my back -- Check this place out you will NOT be disappointed."

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great, parking is great.
Very private.
It was smaller than I thought it would be but absolutely fair for the price and because I only used it to sleep and shower in it was just fine for me.
Super safe area which was important to me."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut's place is perfect for a solo stay in L.A. It's clean, safe, and quiet, and close to so many desirable neighborhoods and activities, within walking distance in many cases.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great short stay at Harut's place. Unit looked exactly like the pictures and Harut provided an easy check in experience. Recommend to others looking for a budget stay in Hollywood.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,After being lucky enough to book Harut's place four times I can say that he is constantly paying attention to details and always improving the guest cottage. He is very easy to communicate with and it's great being near such a warm family.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quality and cozy. Like other reviews - good spot for things near Hollywood. Place has everything needed for a trip - even a patio.
Harut - kept rolling with my late arrival changes and was reachable.
Recommended."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut's guest house is lovely. A great location, I was able to get to and/or from DTLA, Los Feliz, the heart of Hollywood, West Hollywood, and beyond, all without having a car! This is the perfect home base for a single traveler looking to explore the must-see spots in LA. Harut was flexible with checking in and was kind and welcoming. The actual guest house is tucked away behind the main residence, so you feel at peace and at home even though you are a short distance from bustling Hollywood Blvd. The space was clean and provided ample amenities comparable to any hotel. The outdoor space was a great bonus. Harut was also easy to get a hold of and responded quickly and kindly to my inquiries. Would highly recommend!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,How I wish I could have rented this studio cottage in my younger days while living in Hollywood. How much better rested I would have been! But it is here now and is truly peaceful. Harut and his family give the place thoughtful and warm vibes.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut's bungalow is the perfect place for one person visiting L.A. It has everything a person needs from an iron and ironing board to a Keurig coffe maker and everything in between. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash provided are high quality. He even provides snacks and bottled water. Communication was instantaneous. The location is super - among lovely bungalows at the foot of hills covered with spectacular mansions. Strolling in the neighborhood becomes a self-guided architectural tour. It is just far enough from The Strip and just close enough to the glamour. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a great experience here. This cottage was perfect location to parks, restaurants, stores and studios.

It’s perfect for a solo traveler. Everything you need is there. Additionally, I work during the daytime and the WiFi was perfect. The location is great, you’re close to everything and Uber’s we’re quick and easily accessible. The Gelson’s down the street is a nice touch. Highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The absolute perfect cottage for your next LA stay. I could not give this place and this host more of a rave review! Harut was so kind and welcoming and made me feel right at home.

Decorated so cute, a nice kitchen for quick simple meals, a mini fridge and freezer, a Keurig stocked with K cups, cream, and sugar. Tv and amazing wifi.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! I stayed for about a week to do some apartment hunting and Harut was always near-immediately responsive to all my questions throughout the week about literally everything! The hot water in the shower is great and the bathroom comes equipped with extra body wash, shampoo, etc in case you forgot to pack your own. After UberEats was starting to get expensive, the little kitchenette with a stove, an oven, a mini fridge, a microwave, dishes, silverware, a frying pan, and Pyrex baking trays provided everything I needed for lowkey, easy meal prep. Other tenants in the small apartment building that shares the same lot in front of the guest house are very friendly. While there are certainly (friendly!) neighbors, the guest house is incredibly private and also has its own comfortable, equally private outdoor space with some seating, shade, and a bit of sun if you want it. Harut, his dad, mom, and dogs are also very friendly! Street parking is always available and safe, often right in front of the lot. Easy walking distance to a ton!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little place was wonderful! It has the perfect amount of space and felt so cozy. Good location as well. Harut was a very friendly host. 10/10 recommend!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is on a beautiful street & the place was chill. I didn’t noticed when I booked it that it was a twin bed so I was glad I was traveling solo. Harut was very accommodating & left good snacks!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I truly enjoyed my stay here. Everything was perfect!. Harut was very communicative whenever I had any questions and I appreciate that a lot. I felt like I was home and comfortable entire time. Hope to come back again!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve booked this place now twice for my mom for when she’s in town. It’s central and easy to access. She loved her stay. Harut is one of the sweetest people on earth. It’s perfect for a one person stay and sometimes you really need one of those in LA. My mom felt safe and blessed with all the little commodities that the space provided. She loved making her coffee in the morning and relaxing in the back patio. She also appreciated that there was a snack within reach whenever she needed it as she waited for me to pick her up. Easy, great experience. 101 is around the corner!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The stay was lovely. Great location and neighborhood. Perfect for the solo traveler. I’d stay again in a heartbeat.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a cozy space! Perfect for a solo traveler. The area is great - not far from most places I needed to go to during my stay. Street parking was also always available as I rented a car. Harut was very responsive and kind. I highly recommend this place!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Harut’s lil cottage oasis is a great place to decompress and go explore “the hills”.
Parking was a breeze— free and safe.
There’s a nice lil kitchenette and Fridge if you’d rather eat In and enjoy the private lanai off the side.
Great breeze comes in through all the windows at night and you get a lovely smell of the flowers all over the property.
The shower has piping hot water for your muscles after a long day of hiking and it’s stocked with very nice toiletries.
Harut was super friendly from the pre to post booking and met me out front on arrival day to assist with luggage and show me the place. He even checked in to make sure all was meeting expectations or if there was anything else I needed. Very very friendly host and a great place to stay.
I’ll be back !!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place especially for a female solo traveler! Near all the tourist spots and walking distance from local shops. 10/10 recommend especially with the great communication and accommodation that was done for me. Would deff stay again!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Words cannot explain how great this staying was. Harut is just unbelievable. He’s such a great hots. Five stars aren’t enough to rate his hospitality and this cozy and lovely place. I highly recommend this Airbnb.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First rate across the board. Excellent host, location, amenities, parking, clean, well-designed. Ideal for a single visitor."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Harut took the extra time and effort to make sure I had a parking spot. He also stayed up late just so I was able to check in. Clean place and very stylish perfect for the single traveler. 5/5
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'd like to say a big Thank you to Harut for outstanding hospitality and exceeding my expectations. My flight was delayed by two hours, but Harut was patiently waiting for my arrival to hand the key over despite late hours. During my stay he messaged me and asked if everything was all right and if I needed anything. He's definitely a great host who I strongly recommend to deal with if you choose to stay in LA ;)"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic private guest house in a great location. Has everything you could ever need as a solo traveler. Would stay again!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Herut was a super host, he went out of his way to make sure the stay was amazing. The place was cozy and funky and in the heart of Hollywood. You can’t beat the price and privacy that his place provides."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great area if you want to be closer to Hollywood Blvd (the Walk of Fame), Griffith Observatory, Runyon Canyon Park, it's also close to the Metro Red Line if you prefer catching a Uber to public transport."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Honestly this place is so sweet small cozy clean great safe area and Harut was so lovely I am still in shock he helped me with heavy luggage and when I left I left my jewellery and he delivered it safe to me what a gentleman. Beautiful place and beautiful service :)
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"To start off I just wanted to say meeting Harut he was so accommodating and friendly. He made sure I had the most perfect stay he was very fast on and always responsive to any question I had. Haruts cottage was everything and more for me to start off it was sparkling clean from the kitchen to the bathroom to the room. Everything smelled so nice and was spotless from the first walk I went inside I could tell how much time Harut puts in before every guest that checks in I have never been to a more cleaner Airbnb and the decor was perfect. Every detail is so beautiful and I immediately felt right at home. The door in the kitchen leads you to a little spacious backyard for you to read and enjoy your time and unwind. I spent a lot of time there. Also it is located in a great and safe area to many hiking trails and Gelsons market right in the other block Security gated I couldn’t feel more safe. My stay was so comfortable this is by far my FAVORITE Airbnb experience and one to be remembered everything was as advertised overall wonderful perfect , Stay and when my check out was up I did not want to leave. I will definitely be back and only stay at Harut’s cottage. If I could I would give him 10 stars!!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My experience with Harut was one for the books. To start off once I booked Harut for the stay he recommended me things to do which was so generous for him, upon my arrival I was treated with the upmost hospitality and respect. Haruts place was extra clean and everything smelled so good and new, everything was sanitized and clean which was amazing. Harut had disinfectants and sanitizers ready for me. From the bed sheets to the bed frame to the bathroom everything was sanitized and cleaned. The place was spacious and very accommodating. The location is very local to everything. Harut accommodated all my requests within minutes and was available to meet all my needs. I will recommend him to all my family and friends if they want to stay somewhere amazing in the heart of Hollywood that’s clean and accommodating. Thank you for your prompt responses and everything you do. 5 stars isn’t enough to rate this place and my experience."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very, very private studio where we felt like we had our own full dwelling. Stayed 5 days, never saw another soul. The studio set-up was perfect for a traveling couple. Easy parking, very safe and quiet neighborhood, modern and clean accommodations. No reservations in considering another stay at Daisy's when we next visit Diamond Bar."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always responded to my messages in a timely manner. Very understanding and extremely accommodating. Will definitely be returning for a longer stay during the summer to use the pool. This time it was still to cold. We stayed here thinking it would already be warm like it AZ but it wasn't so no swimming for us.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For a last minute trip to pick up some college textbooks in the Los Angeles area in bad weather and I had to spend the night was I was grateful to get the room. It was more than I I normally paid and 40 mins out of the way I had to go but it was a room. The place was clean and bed was comfortable. I just stayed to sleep. I didn’t even use any of the things that the room had for accommodations. Nice and clean place. Quiet, built like a tiny home or an RV. If I had to be near the area again, when my daughter has softball in Pomona I would not mind staying in the room again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, very clean, responsive host."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little studio they have everything you need . Daisy and her family were very friendly I will definitely stay again . Thanks guys

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Exactly what was advertised and friendly.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house and neighborhood are very beautiful. I appreciate that Daisy always responded to us promptly, checked in with us, and made accommodations for us even when it was late. She’s very thoughtful with every detail. The little printed instructions inside are cute, clear, and helpful which saved us a lot of time to get to know the place. Checking in and out was very easy and private."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Daisy
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is such a gem of a find. The listing is extremely detailed and paints an accurate description of the studio/room so that you know exactly what you’re booking before time. The studio looks and feels extremely clean. You can tell that the host has experience and is extremely thoughtful/caring because everything has been thought of. I felt as if I was staying in a highly acclaimed hotel with all amenities included. It is a shared property, which did make me a bit anxious when booking, but if you’re a bit more introverted like me this is not at all an issue. The property is ample and the studio feels safe and is actually very private. Something important to note are the quiet hours, since the property is in a neighborhood with homes right next to each other. Honestly such a beautiful place in a perfect location (with Pomona being in the center of everything in Southern California). Lastly, Daisy is VERY good at responding. So much more to share, not enough words. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for 2 people. Daisy and her family is very friendly. Definitely recommended
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private and just as described!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a comfortable place to stay. The pool was great...and we enjoyed using the barbecue.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Over all great place, I loved that I had access to the pool. it was a little spooky to have other guests walk past and trigger the motion lights. I didn't realize there'd be other guests staying in a back room. but they were overall quiet. The light switch in the room is annoyingly across the room, so when you come in late you have to search for it in the dark. I was pleasantly surprised I had access to Daisey's digital entertainment like Netflix and Amazon. Comfortable bed, and again I loved being and to lounge by the pool."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great area, kind and friendly owner. I highly recommend that place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little quiet place.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed the quiet and private location. The rental was close to lots to do and eat! The only thing I would recommend is that there be a light in the kitchen.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a lovely stay at Daisy’s place. The studio was in a quiet safe neighborhood with walking trails down the street. The studio was very clean. I felt cozy and comfortable there. Daisy was very responsive and helpful. Thanks Daisy!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All good
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Daisy’s Airbnb was really great for the short stay. It was easy to find and in a very good neighborhood. The place was really nice and very clean inside and out. The pool was great for this summer heat along with the great working AC inside the space. Overall would definitely recommend Daisy’s Airbnb to other people.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location! Private and accessible. Very clean and neat with clear instructions. God a good nights rest and would absolutely stay here again!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful back yard and studio. Second stay at the property, will definitely return."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed in many airbnbs. This is by far in the top three, and my first for many other reasons. Very pleasant stay- peaceful and warm. The attention to detail was nice, and at times felt elegant. The colors were warm. It had everything we needed: full kitchen, plenty of room, big bed, nice bathroom with a roomy shower, coffee, big TV, etc. I reside in riverside-locally to where the airbnb is and I look for airbnb of this manner to get away. Additionally, nice hiking trails nearby."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at Fallon’s and would recommend it to anyone looking for some back-to-basics peace and quiet in the canyon.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was exactly as advertised and just what we wanted for our trip. The instructions provided for finding the place and checking in were super easy to follow. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful getaway.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful relaxing spot immersed in nature!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and location. Easy to communicate with the hosts. Wish I could live here so I could take a bath in that clawfoot tub every day!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing place to stay if you want a quiet get away near Los Angeles. The canyon is gorgeous and the sound of the creek below is incredible. The space was clean and just as described. Be ready to off road (kinda) to get to the house as it is off the beaten path but my Jetta could manage
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place to get away from the city and just unwind and have some time for yourself. Also great for romantic getaway
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I loved this house! Definitely want to stay here again, so gorgeous and peaceful"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My goal was to unplug and decompress, and mission accomplished. The place was exactly as described, except better. The weather was great so I spent some time on the deck enjoying the birds and frogs and creek. You can expect a little bit of a drive to get to most things if you want to venture outside of Topanga, but that’s part of the charm and allure. 10/10 would absolutely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very easy check in and check out - loved the place so much! Enjoyed the morning on the deck in the sun with coffee. Really wish we had more than one night here! Must stay place in Topanga! The canyon is gorgeous.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I write all my reviews like I am recommending it to my family members, honestly. Pros and Cons.
Pros. It’s a very unique experience if you like to be in nature. The cabin has been redone in a beautiful way. It’s built on a hillside and it has three separate sections. Ground level is the kitchen and living room, lower level is the full bath, top level is the bedroom. Stairs are NOT inside the cabin it’s all outside access. Peacefulness and tranquility is what you will love!
Cons. This property used to be some sort of an artist community living type of a place, you will see several “old” RV’s and tiny cabins around you. Property is going through renovation so it can look rustic in some areas. Especially the dirt bumpy road that leads to your cabin. Entire property is work in progress. Little bit more attention to cleaning the cobwebs might be helpful.
If you like nature and all that comes with it, you will love it! If you are a high maintenance urban diva, maybe not be for you?"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First I have to start with the outside bathroom AMAZING!!! So beautiful and peaceful loved it! Sitting out on the balcony listening to the creek and even some light music whether it be in the am or pm it was fantastic I never wanted to leave . The only downside I would say is no tv for late nights after all the adventures to just cuddle up and watch a movie but still with that being said I would 100% book again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was great had coffee in the morning and looked at the scenery. If you want a place to get away from the city this is definitely the place. My phone service didn’t work out there was amazing!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, it rained during the entire time we were there so the road leading up to the house was extremely bumpy and muddy. It was hard to see at night but we didn't have any issues finding the place with Fallon's directions. It was a challenge walking up the steps to the detached rooms with an umbrella and luggage but that's not the host's fault. Just something to keep in mind. There would be no issues otherwise on a clear day. We just had bad luck with the weather. I initially booked the area so we could hike and enjoy the outdoors but we couldn't do that at all. The trees and stream were nice to look at in the morning and the air was fresh! We loved the bathtub and the salt lamp was a great touch. The heater kept the room warm on a cold and rainy night. The property was lovely and we would definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect couples getaway! Lovely location with amazing views. Definitely worth staying here for the weekend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a weekend getaway close to LA! Perfectly spacious for two people and close to hikes and restaurants.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fallon was super helpful and responsive. Check-in was easy and fast. And the location is unbelievable. Views of the Santa Monica mountains make you feel like you're in a rainforest.
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a short stay. Beautiful views, cozy little place."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had a lovely stay and Fallon made it very easy to find and get settled in. I didn’t have WiFi once I got up the hill so I wasn’t able to communicate until I left, but I had purposely booked the getaway to disconnect so it wasn’t a problem during this stay. Directions were very helpful and I’ll be sure to stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Words that I speak will not do this place justice! It’s beautiful and serene. It’s quiet and beautiful. Definitely a vibe. Many trails to venture and explore. Being from Florida the views are breathtaking and beautiful. Recommended 12/10
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you so much!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was nice to step away from the busy city to something peaceful. The bath tub was warm and relaxing. I would recommend if you’re looking to regroup
and relax."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, great location."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend for couples, we had a great time and just being so close to the canyons really just makes this place special. Cute home as well and awesome views in the upstairs room. We’d be willing to come back ! There’s not really any nightlife here so where you stay is very important when coming to Topanga imo."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night at Fallon's place and we really enjoyed it.
Everything is as described and the bed is very confortable, we had a wonderful night.
The breakfast on the patio is a must.
Fallon is very responsive and solved quickly the propane issue we had!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect quiet staycation for NYE. One of the most unique airbnb's we have stayed in! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting an off the grid getaway to relax and recharge.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a charming space! Beautifully tucked away and super peaceful. Very responsive host with clear instructions. Would stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fallon was a wonderful host. We unexpectedly had to leave earlier than anticipated. Fallon was very understanding and even encouraged us to cancel the reservation to try to have a new person book and give us a partial refund. We appreciate his consideration and would love to come back again in the future to fully enjoy the stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fallon was a great host. Incredibly responsive, left great directions & instructions. Such a great creative space. It's everything you'd expect in the Canyon. We all had a great time, pups included."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time at Fallon's place. The house is tucked away from the city hustle and bustle, in the lush green surroundings, quiet and pristine."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay and time around Topanga.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was chill—smooth and trouble-free. Locating the house was a breeze, and its proximity to Santa Monica, just a 20-minute drive away, made it an ideal retreat."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fallon’s place was an EXCELLENT stay - I wish we had gotten more time to fully take advantage of the surroundings, but for our 3-day stay, it was perfect.
My partner and I needed a little getaway, and even though we both needed to work, the WiFi was strong enough and PERFECT for remote work. The keurig coffee station was needed, and I loved that there was a full kitchen to cook small meals when we didn’t go down the road to the restaurants.
The bathroom…oh my goodness, I’ve never been so excited to shower, get ready for bed, and take a bath! Having a bath every night under the stars was a very special experience.
The bed was super comfy, and overall, the whole stay was serene and incredibly helpful at easing the stress we were both under.
Fallon is super communicative and helpful, too.
Absolutely would love to stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My partner and I had a quick but wonderful stay at this unique house.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great price and location. The layout was charming and good for sharing space with my friend because each area was on a different floor and the two bathrooms were helpful. Location was beautiful and relaxing. Had a really nice stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cool experience. It’s a cabin on a big hill in the valley of a state park. The rooms are separate parts of the house. Instant hot shower. Gas stove. Quiet. Low phone reception. Peaceful restful unplug from everything outside.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Secluded, relaxing, great experience!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved staying here. Peaceful, serene and beautiful are just some words to describe this place. The bathroom with the tub and the window made for such a nice relaxing time. I will definitely book again! Thanks so much"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great get away from LA
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute unique Airbnb very centrally located to the topanga canyon
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Came for a little getaway with my partner. We loved it, the location was beautiful, the cottage was exactly like the pictures and really clean. We enjoyed every single part of it! Will definitely be booking again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"cute hidden little get a way in the hills, there was also a small creak nearby. nice location"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a great stay, it was the perfect getaway. Everything was so clean and beautiful! It's in a very nice location tucked away in the mountains :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"All im going to say was that the place was magical and if your really trying to experience authentic native cali vibes go here. its located on the iconic Topanga Canyon, so many songs about this canyon. Only like 15 mins from PCH so iconic. At night we drove to get some pizza at some cool bar and drove along the coastline until we got tired and headed back to the air bnb! The only thing i can say is that at night, definitley a bit spooky cause of the pitch dark from being in nature in the mountains but thats what made me love it even more. Its 100% raw. I love that there is no TV, encouraging you to enjoy your surroundings! They did a good job! Perfect lil get away! Thanks again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful and peaceful getaway. My husband and I had the best baby moon. Perfect little get away for the weekend. The bath was my favorite and super relaxing. :)
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a cozy and remote rustic house with a wonderful patio to enjoy the stars at night.
It was comfortable and private. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place! The views are amazing, so quiet and peaceful. The rooms on separate floors was different but added uniqueness to the cabin. Would definitely book again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We did just a one night stay, but wish it was longer! This home is a gem in itself with thoughtful touches in a peaceful oasis. Each room is its own separate space, making this a true indoor/outdoor experience."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was absolutely enchanting and even more secluded than described. Not sure if we were supposed to bring paper goods but that was a minor oversight on our part. The only glitch we experienced was the inability to access
wifi. I knew we were not going to have cell reception, but we weren’t able to plans our trips out of the area. That aside, I would definitely return!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was incredible! So scenic and a beautiful getaway from the city. It’s tucked away in the mountains so at night, it’s lit up by the moon and cicadas fill the background noise. The house has 3 tiers so you need to walk up and down stairs. The house is very simple but clean and cozy with lovely decor and the outdoor decks to sit under the sun or stars. We arrived at nighttime so it’s easy to miss the entrance even despite the locations, so just be cautious if you’re arriving in the dark. Also there’s pretty spotty wifi so it’s perfect if you want to disconnect for the weekend. Didn’t get to check out the trails or wander, but definitely wish we did some exploring! Highly recommend staying here"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Loved how quiet it was (:
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I loved this spot and would love to return. So perfect for a little getaway. It was peaceful and quiet-- with sounds of crickets at night. We loved it so much!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friend and I were looking for a peaceful retreat from LA. We stayed at the Dragonfly house and the Japanese Teahouse. Two different styles and vibes. We still can't decided which one we liked more. We loved them both. The property was very easy to find and convenient to the local restaurants and market. Fallon was super helpful and welcoming. We will definitely be back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect spot for a relaxing stop off. wish I could have stayed longer 👍👍
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay in Fallon’s place was incredible. His place is so comfortable and is exactly as described. I loved that the house set up forced you outside to access the different levels. The bathtub at night was the icing on the cake 🤍
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fallon's place was great!
Spotless, easy check-in, and on a compound with several other unique units, but still has a aire of privacy to it.
This place is renovated nicely and very clean. All the kitchen items you need. Comfortable bed with an east facing window and deck outside the bedroom for 🌄 sunrise!
The bathroom, kitchen/living room, and bedroom are all on separate floors that you have to walk on outside stairs to access. I love indoor/outdoor living so great for me, but something to be aware of if that's not your jam.
Everything is well kept and/or new. Will 100% stay here again when visiting Topanga!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,All the canyon vibes! Clean and a fun lay out to stay. Not contemporary at all! Fun tub and lots of outside stairs and decks.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous spot - loved the attention to detail
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,View was amazing and nature surroundings were a great . Definitely will be back again
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was cool. A little hard to find at first but the printed directions helped. The only downside was that there was no tv. Ither than that i would stay here again. The place was clean and no issues
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay at Fallon’s place. This was exactly what we were looking for; clean, quiet but surrounded by beauty. Had all we needed for a romantic night away. Definitely recommend and would return for some peace and quiet in nature."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved it
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can't wait to stay again :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. What an incredible weekend! This palace was absolutely gorgeous and so so cute. We were looking for a romantic getaway, and this was just that. The area was so close to lots of fun date spots and places to explore, which were all conveniently included in the house manual. I would 10000% come back and 10/10 recommend"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fallon's place located in the midst of tall trees on the top of Topanga Canyon was beautiful, peaceful and relaxing. The sound of nature around was soothing and calming. Great spot to get away from the busy cities, traffic and crows. I was able to find serenity in my morning meditation sitting outside on the patio and absorbing the silence and nature. I wish I had more time there, at least 4 days to really enjoy it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! This place was even better than the photos and I almost think they should be retaken because of how surprised we were. The place was pretty big and spacious and the views were amazing! I had a wonderful time here and would definitely come back! Only thing is the bathroom shower/tub area gets pretty wet, I think there might’ve been a leak but there were lots towels/rags provided so we were okay, looked like an easy fix (no biggie). Took a bath at night and in the morning because of how beautiful the bathhouse is. Thank you Fallon!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time staying here! Super clean and felt very secluded. Host was very helpful and responsive. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is so beautiful, quiet, private, and the whole property is magical with the hiking trails and the creek! Absolutely lovely. The multiple patios are dreamy!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cutest little cottage! Amazing view and so close to the little stores in town and the state park.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Incredible space! Well designed, spacious, and cozy in that ""treehouse"", ""spiritual retreat"" kind of way. 100% would visit again. Highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I went to Fallon's place alone by myself and i had a great a time. I feel so safe. The place is fantastic! Its away from the City, its very quiet, the air is so fresh because its surrounded by the trees. You can hear the frogs, birds are chirping and crickets which i liked the most because it reminds me with our home in the Philippines ❤️ I got a privacy and what i liked the most was the bathroom ❤️. The view from the bathroon was awesome!. I met Fallon and he was so nice, very friendly and he is very easy to talk to.
I very reccomended this place and you will never regret it. I definitely coming back again with my husband next time."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is super cool. Would definitely stay again. Very memorable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay in Topanga!, very peaceful , nothing but birds chirping & frogs croaking . Such a Beautiful area , We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a retreat! Thoroughly enjoyed the patio overlooking the oak trees. I already miss the morning bird song and evening frog lullabies.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great secluded vibes. Rustic and peaceful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a peaceful get away in nature. We’ll be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing! Loved reconnecting with nature and relaxing in this home 😄 not to mention the price was an absolute deal! Thank you for making this place so amazing and accessible!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"what an amazing place and definitely inspired creativity! the location is a dream, and the layout of the house is so fun. I'd definitely come back. there are no snacks provided, and it's outside of town, so make sure to stop before you settle down. really just gorgeous all around."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,It was easy to find and walk in . I loved bathroom. All was good
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My Family and I enjoyed Fallons place a lot. it was certainly peaceful and beautiful. We enjoyed being in nature with no distractions. The fresh air, being so close to the beach. Only downside was we didn't get a chance to soak up the stars in the tub. Will definitely recommend it to other guests and rebook in the future. Next time we will see if we can book it for the whole month."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Majestic, woke up to rain in the morning. Watched fog come down from the mountains. Very special location and would defiantly stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unforgettable for the frogs croaking and the bathtub alone :) sweet and quirky spot was a perfect date night .. and Fallon was very communicative .
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fallon’s place is absolutely lovely. Just up the canyon as described this unique stay was convenient to drive to the beach in Malibu and offered the privacy of a mountain lodge. As Fallon describes this place is more akin to glamping and has great amenities with a kitchen, disconnected bath down the external stairs and a private bedroom with attached half bath upstairs in the tree tops. You can hear the calming sounds of nature in the evenings and the birds chirping in the morning. If you are looking to get away from the scene in Malibu and LA and enjoy nature but still be close enough to the action then this place is for you!! Fallon is super responsive and attentive to guests."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place to stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a def a great experience with my fam at Dan’s tree house. It’s our little home away from home.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and fun place to stay! Sturdy and safe, even fit with a slide for quick exit! The top deck outdoor seating area is icing on the cake. Located in the backyard of the host, it has privacy and is quiet. If you’re looking for something affordable, unique, a quick drive to Disneyland, and with a kind and responsive host, this is your place!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying here! The treehouse was a welcome reprieve after a bustling trip to New York and before flying back to Australia. There was street parking for our hire car, right out the front of the house and Dan had our permit ready before we arrived. It was about a 1/2 hour drive to Disneyland (with traffic) and including traffic it was an hour drive and we were parked and in Universal Studios. There was an ALDI and Walmart about 1km-2km away for groceries. Dan was so awesome, he was really responsive and helped us settle in and provided local insight. We would absolutely come back here and recommend to any of our friends and family. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host Dan was very responsive and amiable. He offered great suggestions for restaurants. As for the treehouse he built, wish I had one in my backyard. It was perfect. I especially like the upper deck area in which you were enveloped in the tree’s canopy. A peaceful oasis in the hectic, frenetic Southern California area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly had a wonderful time! Great area we were able to do a lot. The Airbnb was very cute and cozy. There was a lot of privacy, and felt comfortable the whole time. Overall rate it a 10/10"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was our third trip and each time our daughter has loved it and asked to come back. Our girls both commented on how his “outhouse” is as nice as most people’s bathrooms in their home. The treetop deck in the tree canopy is magical.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan was an awesome host! Very helpful and friendly, not to mention the treehouse is such a trip! One of the coolest places I’ve stayed in my life. Makes me want to build one! Will for sure be telling people about this, thanks Dan!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan was a superb host. He was responsive, friendly, and interactive with not only us, but our children upon arrival. The description Dan has does not describe the beauty you experience when in the treehouse or on the deck of the treehouse. The treehouse is within walking distant of multiple eateries and amenities. I will definitely be back to enjoy this little oasis again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time my daughter and I have stayed at the tree house and it is a magical refuge. I can’t think of a better way to start the day than drinking coffee on the rooftop deck in the canopy of a tree. The craftsmanship of the space also makes me feel like I’m nesting in a piece of art. We will continue to plan our trips down to visit our family along with the availability of the treehouse.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan was a great host. The place was also easy to find. As son. As I spoke with Dan to get in the house, his instructions were so accurate it’s like he was right next to me.
Now let’s get to the treehouse, this place out a smile on our faces everyone we talk about it.
I would definitely come back, it was so much fun!
Thanks Dan, I don’t normally write reviews but when I do, it means I enjoyed it a lot!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and fun atmosphere.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan is such a nice host. This is our second time here and my grandson wants to go again. The treehouse is incredible. Very relaxing.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Dan is a great host with a very unique treehouse. Dan was responsive and the place was just as advertised. Only thing is the bathroom can get a bit chilly when the temperatures are low due to it being outdoors, but the hot water works great. Would visit again. Thank you Dan."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great tree house!! We loved everything. Thanx Dan
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s place was awesome. Great host with a very unique treehouse. Dan was responsive and the place was just as advertised. Only knock is the bathroom can get a bit chilly when the temps are low due to it being outdoors, but the hot water works great. 5/5 stars."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at the treehouse! Perfect place to stay on our first family trip to Disney. My 4yo daughter LOVED the slide. Dan was an amazing host and we felt right at home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was exactly as my kids and I expected. The location was nice, quiet and easy to find. The space was perfect for us. The kids loved the slide, and the deck. And being an adult, it was kinda cool to be a kid again inside a treehouse!
We went to California adventure for the day and the drive was a short 17 minute drive. We didn't get a chance to utilize all the amenities because our stay was so short, but I would have loved to enjoy the deck and the fire pit that was there."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent two nights in Dan’s treehouse and loved it. We booked it for the unique experience and close to Disneyland. Our kids loved the treehouse and especially the slide. We didn’t get to enjoy the rooftop or the fire-pit due to the rain, but would have made for nice amenities. It was perfect for our family of four. In addition to the treehouse, Dan was great to communicate with and meet us to check us in along with providing great local recommendations."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"HIGHLY recommend staying here! I was on a solo trip and Dan made me feel so safe. He has a bubbly personality and is fun to talk to. The treehouse itself felt private and relaxing. Especially at night on the top deck (my favorite spot). The weather was perfect the first week of March! The slide was also fun to go down. I truly lived out my childhood dreams here and you will too if you’ve always wanted to stay in a treehouse.
Parking: There was an abundance of street parking available. I was never worried about a spot.
Location: There’s so much to do around the area! If you’re driving in and need a car wash (like I did), the Brea Express right across the street is amazing! Dan provided wonderful recommendations for both food and activities (Fullerton Loop Trail is great). Stores with necessities such as Walmart and Target are just a short drive away.
I can’t wait to stay here again. What are you waiting for? Book your stay now! You won’t be disappointed :)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second time staying at Dan’s, beautiful and amazing treehouse. What a spectacular experience and some thing I hope to repeat. Dan is an amazing host, and the treehouse is beyond words! If you haven’t had this experience, it’s a must do!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely magical! Dan was super friendly, responsive, and kind. His beautiful treehouse was the perfect place to spend our vacation. Super peaceful and amazing for the location, price, and just everything. Highly recommend staying here."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second stay at Dan’s treehouse and we loved it again! My kids had a blast. It truly feels secluded and private, a peaceful oasis in the midst of the city. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, easy to walk to the grocery and a variety of restaurants/bars! Even though it was pouring rain most of our stay we remained cozy in the treehouse. The top deck is beautiful. I would return."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse experience was amazing, everything you would expect from the photos. The Airbnb was a pleasant surprise with how clean it is and the lack of bugs. It was a beautiful place to sleep as everything felt sturdy and well-built. The host was very friendly and provided instructions that made accessing Airbnb very easy."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had so much fun staying over here! Kids love the place. Beds were comfty. Dan was so noce too.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the rooftop deck and hung out there every night! Was a pretty calm neighborhood and was a good location and distance from restaurants as well as Disneyland being nearby. Dan was helpful and gave us tips for the area and attractions. The space was very clean and the bed was super comfortable!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s spot was a perfect getaway and close enough to Disneyland to make my trip much easier. Loved the tree house and had a ton of fun, the fire pit was a great spot for s’mores! Thank you Dan for letting us stay there!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical place! This treehouse is not only gorgeous but it's also comfortable and cozy. We loved waking up ensconced in greenery and sitting out by the fire pit. Next time we return to Brea, we hope to stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan was a great host! The treehouse was so fun for my son. Beautiful treehouse! It was a great experience. Location was perfect as there is so much to do. Bed was comfy too!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough great things about Dan’s Treehouse - it was magical! My oldest son and I stayed for two nights while he attended his college orientation. Yep, a college student and his mom - we absolutely loved it!
The attention to detail, the cozy surroundings, the fact that we were in a treehouse, it was the best stay. Dan was wonderful, recommended places to eat, and just an all around great host.
Book this treehouse!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the pleasure of booking Dan's tree house last minute. It was just what we needed and was perfect. Dan was super accommodating and welcoming as well! It's centrally located to eateries and was super convenient to get to Disneyland. I highly recommend booking the tree house for an unforgettable experience :)
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan’s treehouse is an exceptionally special place. The memories you will make and waking up to the sunlight sparking through the leaves is soul-energizing.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The tree house was our accommodation for our family Disney trip. The tree house is 15 min from Disney, making it an ideal place as it is so close. The downtown area of Brea, which has several restaurants, is within walking distance to the tree house. A target is a 5 min drive too making it easy if you need to pick something up. The tree house itself is amazing! The craftsmanship, the storage, the privacy, the cleanliness and of course the slide! The bed is super comfortable and the shower had good pressure and temperature. I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A perfect local staycation gem 💎 removed from the hustle bustle but immediately accessible to urban amenities once you walk out of the premise. Coffee spot across the street is pristine.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely wonderful ❤️
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I gotta tell ya: this is the most rockin, epic treehouse, I’ve ever experienced! Dan’s craftsmanship, artistry, and attention to detail are impeccable. And his hospitality is over-the-top! I can’t recommend this one highly enough!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at Dan's treehouse. It really is a hidden oasis! We are local and have wanted to check this out for a few years and we are so happy that we did! We brought our small dog with us and enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere. You can tell that Dan put alot of effort into his treehouse and backyard. We appreciated all the details, there really is no place like it! The treehouse/bathroom was pristine and had everything you need. We will definitely be back. Thank you, Dan, for sharing your wonderful treehouse with us! What an amazing experience!! P.S. the slide is awesome - even for adults :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,stay was the best! 100%recommended.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan is a great host. Beautiful place. Or should a say a charming experience. Kid loved the place. We love the setting. Just wonderful. What else can I say? Thank you.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay with Dan, and it was just as amazing! Beautiful, walkable location. It was for my kid's birthday, and I tried to take her to Downtown Disney, but we ended up just leaving right away because she would rather play at the treehouse."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical experience! It was a cozy, comfortable, and secluded slice of privacy in the heart of the city. The only place we will be looking to stay on our next visit."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, especially if you have kids. Our daughters loved it, and just enjoyed the idea of sleeping in a tree house and celebrated our older one's birthday! very friendly and responsive host! Definitely would stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan was a wonderful host! He was very welcoming and helpful about things to do around the area. The tree house was perfect! Thanks for the wonderful stay Dan!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Dan is hands down one of the BEST hosts I’ve ever encountered! This is the second time I’ve stayed here and we cannot wait to return!
Dan’s treehouse is truly magical, from the twinkling lights to the hidden slide. I brought my son for his birthday this year and he said it was the, “‘ second best day of his life.”’ The first being watching the snow fall for the first time! That says a lot!!
We had a blast racing down the slide, snuggling in the bed, and playing chess on the rooftop patio.
My son thought the outdoor shower was the coolest thing ever and had fun washing up for the day there.
We will absolutely be back!!!
Thank you Dan for helping me make my cutie pies dreams a reality!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the first time I've stayed at an airbnb and it was a lovely experience! Thanks so much!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was my first time booking something where our dog was allowed and he loved it! We had an amazing experience with the three house! Thank so so much for the restaurant’s and trails recommendation Dan. We loved it!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love staying at Dan's treehouse! It is always an amazing experience!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan was very helpful and responsive during our stay. Place definitely met expectations. We stayed here for my son's 8th birthday and both kids were both very happy! Can't beat that!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing experience! We enjoyed many hours on the upper deck being the tree canopy. The treehouse feels so secluded but yet is located steps away from amazing restaurants. Dan gave great recommendations for restaurants and area hikes.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an enjoyable weekend! The treehouse was extraordinary and the fire pit was perfect for the evenings! Have already referred to many friends at their request!! Dan is great! Friendly, helpful, and attentive. You won’t be disappointed!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. You’re gonna love it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing and fun place to stay! We had a blast
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dans Treehouse is quite possibly one of the most unique and amazing experiences for a stay, must try the slide! Very fun and private, short drive to Disney or the beaches! Perfect retreat! I’d definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We chose this place as a surprise for my 8 year old son. He was blown away! The space is so secluded. It’s in the heart of houses and so close to restaurants, but you don’t feel that at all. We were grateful it was dog friendly, but make sure your dog can be carried or is agile. Our large dog refused to go up the steep stairs, so it took a bit of work. So leave the big dog at home and for sure book this place! Location is great for access just about anywhere. Memorable for all the right reasons! Dan is so responsive and helpful. Friendly but gives you absolute privacy and space."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing experience. The tree house was perfect. We got to live out our childhood dreams. Dan was an amazing host, so kind and caring. The space is beautiful and well laid out. I can't wait for our next tree house adventure!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,And an amazing host! The treehouse was gorgeous. So much thought and detail went into it. Defiantly would stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would give this place a million stars if I could! There are no words for the experience, craftsmanship and attention to detail. This is a dream for children and adults alike."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan’s treehouse adventure is a true labor of love. He’s a masterful craftsman and I appreciate that he shares his talent by renting out his special place. He will tell you it was 15 years in the making and the care he put in to his creation is evident in everything he has constructed. I loved being able to host a small gathering for a bonfire on chairs he crafted himself. I shared his listing with family and friends so they could see the photos and all were impressed. I was also able to give tours to some family and friends in the area who were all impressed as well. Great location with plenty of dining and stores within walking distance. Dan was very helpful explaining everything and had great recommendations on places to go. It was a great experience.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan's place is a dream coming true for adults and kids. It is safe and still the feeling of being in an adventure but with all the comfort you need. Plenty of good restaurants and Shoppings around, safe street parking, 20 min from Disney, amazing terrace on the top of the tree, and Dan is very responsive and nice. He will make sure you have a great and comfortable stay. Don't think twice! It is hard to find availability here so if you get lucky, book it and enjoy your stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, especially if you have kids. Our son loved it, and just enjoyed the idea of sleeping in a tree house. Clean space, and very friendly and responsive host! Close to allot of stuff. Definitely would stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's treehouse is a whimsical and extraordinarily well-executed experience, and we very much enjoyed our stay. Despite being located in a suburban community, you feel like you could just as easily be in the middle of nowhere, with beautiful landscape architecture and a high, rustic privacy fence framing the treehouse. As for the treehouse, it's constructed amidst *several* trees, which together form a canopy that surrounds the rooftop deck and creates the illusion that you're sheltered in a much larger wooded environment. And what a treehouse it is! Every detail is handmade, with an extraordinary level of attention to detail that means that every inch of the space is put to good use. It's clear that Dan loves his art, and he puts just as much attention to detail into hosting his guests. We had a wonderful time, and perhaps one day we will find an appropriate excuse to book again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan's treehouse was AMAZING! I was in the area for an extended weekend and it still did not feel like enough time to fully enjoy my time there (definitely need to have extended my stay). The treehouse will bring out your inner child and allow you to forgot about everyday obligations while you're there. Dan was also such an amazing host and was communicative and kind throughout our whole stay. Would love to book this place again if I was in the area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved it so much we wanted to live there! So peaceful yet so much fun! Thanks Dan we’ll be back :)
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s place is so cool! Of course loved the slide and the fact that I got to stay in a treehouse. Dan is a great host too, very friendly and communicative. Definitely recommend checking it out."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It make our treehouse dream come true, and its location is very nice. We had a wonderful weekends!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a dream come true, to live in luxury inside of a grove of trees. Besides being a great super host, Dan has built a most beautiful, comfortable, playful, and thoughtfully efficient tiny house in the treetops, a truly brilliant use of space. Plentiful ficus leaves above and surrounding provide remarkable privacy in a quiet suburban neighborhood with a thriving little downtown a mere ten minute walk from home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely amazing! Booked to celebrate my 25th birthday and am so happy that I did. It was so much fun staying in a tree house I felt like a little kid again. Great vibe had fun going down the slide. And it was really close to a lot of stores and restaurants. Dan was an amazing host would definitely come back
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience! We will definitely be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan was a great host. We really enjoyed our time there and it was a really fun experience.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved the treehouse. Great space.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it is a super cute place! Very well designed and built with love.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan’s treehouse is a perfect outdoorsy feel in the city. Plenty of privacy and enough room for two to three people. Plenty of food and shopping within walking distance and just a short drive to Disney. If there is a kid inside of you then this is the perfect place to stay. You can even slide down to the shower and restroom. We had a great stay, and highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! It’s really a special magical location… This place was built with love and you can feel that.
Our boys loved the slide (it really feels like a treehouse, but was built so solidly it feels like a home as well).
We went to local parks (walked to one and drove to Craig Regional Park - which is beautiful and a very closer drive - where we saw ducks and walked/rode scooters), walked to local restaurants, and the movie theatre… We played board games, and we enjoyed the upper deck as well as the beautiful backyard.
I would recommend this place to a small family or even a couple with a sense of whimsy. Such a lovely spot!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan’s was awesome. Great location. Beautiful treehouse. I could have stayed a week longer. The slide was a riot. 10/10 would stay there again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan gave a nice tour of the place and was very friendly. The place was very unique and I’d definitely use it again if I’m in the area.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan's Treehouse is definitely a kids dream come true. This place truly is magical! The treehouse was by far the coolest place I have stayed in on Airbnb.
The kids absolutely loved it. The boys were greeted by Dan who gave them one special challenge and that was to go down the slide at least 20 times before bed. They definitely exceeded. They were super bummed that we had to leave. We will definitely be coming back. Thanks again Dan for this childhood dream! What a great host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is what I would call a true hidden gem in LA. It's always been a dream of mine to stay in a treehouse and I get to stay here with my kids who felt like princesses living in a enchanted forest. We loved every single minute of it and can't wait to stay again. The craftmanship of the treehouse deserve some kind of award! It was truly a memorable experience!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I would 100% recommend Dan's place if you have kids!!
Was awesome experience, peaceful, rod top, fire pit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's place is just magical, for kids as for adults. We enjoy every detail of the treehouse.
When we arrived, Dan welcomed us. It is a super cozy and well though place. The Sounds of Birds , the view from the rooftop, the Night Smores by the Bonfire. Everyone should plan a visit ...it is a gift to remember for a lifetime."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan's treehouse is the cutest and place full of memories!
Dan is a kind, friendly, warm boss!
Reading books, slippers, and coffee in the loft.
Kids have a whole house🎠!
The toilet is clean and practical!The house has a market across the street.Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ on Brea Street!
It's a beautiful travel memory.❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing more can be said that hasn’t already been said: magical, perfect, FUN!! Exactly what I was hoping it would be, and more. Dan was so great and easy to work with. I hope, if you’re reading this, you’re lucky enough to stay at this fantastic spot some day!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great for a small family with kiddos who love going down the slide. We had so much fun making s’mores, building a fire, and just relaxing at the treehouse.
Dan said to go down the slide 20 times before bed, well my kids did that and then some."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's treehouse is a childhood dream come true. Every detail is perfectly thought out, from the craftsmanship of the treehouse itself to the S'mores ready fire pit to the recommendations for local coffee shops and hikes. Great host and a great time at the treehouse!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at Dan’s place. The kiddos enjoyed it. Will be back again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay in Dan’s Treehouse! It’s even more impressive in person. The location is perfect for travel to Disney and we loved chatting to Dan, he was very helpful with local suggestions.
Thanks for a lovely stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Dan’s Treehouse! It’s a hidden gem, cozy, peaceful and relaxing. My son had a blast with the slide and making s’mores at night. It was so relaxing, my favorite part was the top deck. I read a book and enjoyed the view. Dan was an amazing host! We can’t wait to book our next stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time staying with Dan. The craftsmanship, privacy, and peacefulness of the treehouse is just amazing. My family loves going here!!! Dan is an amazing host with a one of a kind property!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan’s treehouse was so cool! My kids LOVED the slide and I loved the scenery and ambiance. Dan was so nice and helpful.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, I recommend it to everyone"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love our experience and would definitely stay again! Thanks Dan!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! You open a cabinet door in the kitchen and there is a slide! I'll start there. The slide was a blast, and made going out to the bathroom easy and fun. After a few drinks even my wife thought it was fun! It also worked extremely well as a transport system to take all our bags outside when checking out. Honestly, this treehouse is amazing. The attention to detail was beyond anything I've ever seen. Dan is a woodworker, and he clearly put a tremendous amount of thought and pride and care into the design and build of this treehouse. The quality of workmanship is evident everywhere you look. This is not some slapped together novelty that someone threw together and called a treehouse. This is the real deal. The backyard is completely private, including your own gated area with a fire ring made of actual stones. The bathroom, though outside, is nicer than many indoor bathrooms. The rooftop deck is fantastic. Next time I'm bringing sleeping bags to sleep up there!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The treehouse was a great experience. It was just as it looked in the pictures. My two boys loved it! The slide was a big hit. Even though its in the backyard, its extremely private. You feel as if your in your own little world. I would highly recommend this property, its a beautiful unique experience. We will definintly be doing this again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing! We felt right at home! Can not wait to visit the treehouse soon!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the treehouse. Perfect for my husband and I. Loved how walkable to the downtown area it was but still felt like we were somewhere in the mountains 😆 We would stay there again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an AMAZING treehouse. I spent all my time admiring the fact it was all built from scratch by Dan while my kids were having a blast playing. Definitely would book again in a heartbeat!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The attention to detail on the tree house was amazing. My boys played while I worked on school work. They didn’t even want to leave the property because they had so much fun. Dan was very helpful. He helped us set up a fire. I’ve never been at such peace away from home. We will be back for sure!!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay, & it was a truly memorable experience for our kids. Thanks Dan!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan’s treehouse was so cozy! The location is great and Dan is very friendly! Wish we had more time to chat! Definitely hope to stay again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value and impeccable craftsmanship, the neighborhood is also extremely walkable we didn’t even need our rental car. Dan is super friendly and communicative. I can’t really describe the treehouse easily, you just have to experience it.
The tree house is completely enveloped in a ficus tree and you feel like you’re in a private area even though you’re in the middle of a city."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I'm not sure what I can say that others haven't already! I'm already looking forward to booking again with the intention of being able to just stay in and enjoy the peaceful surroundings since this trip we spent most of our time outside of the treehouse at Disneyland. The one thing I wish I'd remembered to pack was a pair of flip flops or shower shoes for trips between the treehouse and restroom.
It was great getting to chat with Dan about his woodworking and process of building the treehouse. And he was most gracious and accommodating in arranging for pick up of my cosmetic and toiletry bag that I accidentally left behind.
10/10 would absolutely recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's treehouse was absolutely magical! We had a fantastic time staying here and Dan was extremely friendly and accommodating. I loved sleeping next to an open window looking at the moon through the branches. It was a
childhood dream come true."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved staying here and would definitely do it again. I was fascinated with the carpentry, ingenuity, and thoughtfulness that went into this treehouse. The downtown area was a block away and an easy walk to so many things close by. Dan was very friendly, helpful, and available if needed."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our daughter wanted to stay in a tree house to read for a weekend to celebrate her birthday and Dan’s place was perfect. She loved reading under the lights on the tree top deck, leaving the house via slide, roasting s’mores in the fire pit, and riding her scooter to get our meals a few blocks away. She gave it 2 thumbs up and didn’t want to leave at the end of our stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A perfect stay. The treehouse felt magical. A very comfortable space. Dan, thank you for sharing your gift with the world. My daughter absolutely loved the slide. Great neighborhood where we could walk to restaurants/shopping center. A lifetime memory."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan was very hospitable and friendly. Hard to believe he built the treehouse himself! My daughter loved it and keeps asking to go back.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything I imagined came true over these last few days in Dan’s Treehouse. My kiddos and I had thee most magical experience for their Spring Break. This was a bucket list experience that we now want to continue crossing off or our list on a continuous basis! This is truly a gift offered to children to keep the magic alive in their hearts & even nurtured my own inner child. Being able to sleep in our amusement park was the most invigorating experience that we will cherish for a lifetime. We were continuously reassured during our visit & felt right at home the entire time. Dan is one of the most kind-hearted individuals that we’ve come to meet in our life & to meet him is to love him. He treated my kids with kindness & respect the entire time & even had s’mores with us! We would be honored to stay in his gorgeous utopia again & my kiddos cannot stop raving about their treehouse getaway experience! These are memories that because of Dan, we will have for eternity. Sooo dreamy!!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our third stay at Dan’s magical treehouse. Can’t say enough about what an amazing place this is and how wonderful a host Dan is!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a magical place! This treehouse is just like the ones in cartoon which is just way too adorable. The best bathroom for a camping like experience. Dan the host is very friendly and responsive. This place has basically everything you need. We had so much fun at this place and definitely recommend it to everyone!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was definitely a wonderful experience! The treehouse is beautiful and cozy,perfectly designed for kids. Love the hidden slide and the fire pit ❤️ a perfect little getaway for the weekend 👍"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a great, peaceful, safe getaway in the city! 2 great playgrounds walking distance, very quiet, close to downtown Brea. It was a treehouse of dreams without leaving civilization!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan's treehouse is truly magical - really a one-of-a-kind Airbnb experience. Tucked away in a secluded and quiet bush-lined alcove, the treehouse is absolutely lovely inside and out. The top deck is phenomenal. The bathroom/shower facilities were fully functional, clean, and as convenient as they could possibly be for a treehouse. The inside of the treehouse is a wonderfully sized space for 2-3 people. And it had everything we could have possibly wanted - a comfy bed, tv, games, mini fridge, microwave, AC, space heater, and more. Can't wait to stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dans treehouse was great! Private little getaway. A 5 minute walk to restaurants and bars. We would definitely be back. Thanks Dan
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan, thank you for your pure hospitality. Thank you for the kind gestures. Great little getaway. Enjoyed the surrounding areas. I just wish it wasn’t raining the whole time. Overall great time, great stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great experience with my family!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was amazing beautiful place to relax
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family absolutely loves Dan’s Treehouse! This was our second stay and it was just as wonderful as the first time. Dan is a great host and highly recommend his place! We hope to make this a family tradition (:
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My kids LOVED it and so did I! :) I think we totaled 100 trips down the slide. Thanks for a great stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan was great in describing his treehouse! My eight year old loved it! We went to Disney while there! I wish we had more time to stay and explore. We will definitely be back to Dans treehouse!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Daughter definitely wants to go back. We had an amazing time. I could live there honestly lol
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiance and I had a wonderful time at Dan's treehouse! It was exactly like the pictures and Dan's craftsmanship is outstanding - I can't believe he built everything himself and there's nothing like waking up among the trees. There's even a lovely deck to hang out on and it makes for a great getaway, even though it's only a short walk to the Brea downtown area. Not only was the treehouse itself an amazing and cozy place to stay, but Dan was so welcoming and allowed my two nieces to come visit during the day. They really loved the slide! Thanks for the best stay ever!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Magical!!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan's treehouse is AWESOME! The inside and outside spaces are both beautiful. The only downside is that you have to go downstairs to go to the bathroom, but hey, you're staying in a treehouse! Dan is communicative and gave great tips about stuff to see and do. We had fun hanging around the firepit and walking to Downtown Brea - lots of fun stuff to see and do! I'd highly recommend this for a memorable family getaway."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan was wonderful! He was communicative, quick responses and friendly. I love his beautiful place, so did my daughter. I took her for her bday. Now she wants a tree house of her own 😅!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect space for what I needed! Everyone I was at the conference with was super jealous of my space, ha! It was so great."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the tree house! Dan was a wonderful host, greeted us at the entrance, explained everything we needed to know, and offered some great recommendations for food and entertainment in the area. We spent most of the time relaxing in the tree house. The rooftop patio is fantastic, it was such a great experience drinking wine in the evening and coffee in the morning inside of a tree. The shower and toilet are separated from the tree house, so it may be a bit chilly if you have to make a late night bathroom run in February (we enjoyed every bit of this unique experience :) ) Everything was very clean and tidy, as well as private. We will definitely be making a trip back here as soon as possible!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I 100% recommend staying here. The treehouse had a very large living/bedroom and top deck, there was never an issue of space for 1-2 people. The bathroom located in its own separate space was very clean and well-designed, it had hot enough water to combat a very chilly morning! It is located very close to a shopping district (right across the street). You can tell that Dan put a lot of thought into the design, from the layout to the slide and top deck to how the yard subdivides the backyard from the Airbnb section with foliage and a gate making it feel very private. Street parking was very easy to find, often the front of the house being available. Dan was an excellent host from the check-in walk-through to getting to chat with him right before I left."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Treehouse is an incredible feat of workmanship and a really special spot. We didn’t quite understand that there was no plumbing in the treehouse or that it would be a short fit for my 6’3” husband, but that’s on us. I loved making use of the desk and admiring all the built-in cubbies throughout. Dan’s woodwork and attention to detail are stunning, as is the entire backyard setting. Probably ideal in Spring & Fall for temperature due to the numerous windows & alfresco bathroom. A really special spot!
Dan was also a really flexible, friendly & accommodating host, which we appreciated tremendously. We used the treehouse as a base for a 2-day Disneyland adventure, which worked out well!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful experience
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very interesting Airbnb! Great to surprise for the kids!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A unique and memorable place to stay. We had a blast there. A few minutes away from Downtown Brea and only about a mile from Brea Mall. Highly recommend this place if you want to experience something different.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan's treehouse is a real adventure! you will feel like the Swiss family Robinson. Dan is an amazing carpenter and has done all the building himself-it is a real work of art. A unique and memorable experience!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My 11 year old son and I spent the weekend in Dan's treehouse as a mother-son getaway. The treehouse was amazing! When we first pulled up, we were confused because it looks like a regular neighborhood, but then Dan walked us into the backyard and to a private grove of trees where the treehouse is hidden. After giving us a tour, Dan told my son that the only rule was that he had to go down the slide at least 20 times! While the area is very walkable and has nearby restaurants, movie theater and improv, make sure to save time to just hang out at the treehouse going down the slide, reading or playing a game up on the rooftop deck in the treetop canopy, roasting marshmallows in the bonfire, or watching a movie from the bed. Overall great experience! Thank you, Dan!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cool, unique experience. We were nervous about staying in a treehouse on the night of a big storm but it turned out to be so cozy and peaceful (I felt like I was in an ASMR video!). The craftsmanship of the house was stunning. You can tell that great care went into every detail. The slide with the “secret door” was a huge hit with the kids — so fun.
I think the house could use a bit more light — it was hard to see the board games we were playing and had to get out our flashlights. I also might suggest not having a TV with every streaming service so that people can really unplug. (I know, you can just not watch it, but it’s kind of hard!).
We enjoyed our stay and as others noted, Dan is a wonderful host. Definitely recommend his treehouse adventure."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dans treehouse was such a magical place. I booked time here for my kids as a Christmas experience gift and we all had a blast. Dan was very welcoming and took the time to show us where everything was. He even had a complementary bottle of wine in the treehouse which was a nice treat. The kids loved going down the slide, and dancing in the rain on the rooftop under beautiful twinkling lights. I highly recommend staying here. We will definitely be back."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved staying at Dan’s place! Such a unique experience!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan's Treehouse was a truly memorable experience. The moment we walked through the gates, it was like walking through our own magical world. It was as if we had entered an interactive art piece that was playful, whimsical, and refined. Although the pictures are as accurate as pictures can be, they cannot capture the warmth of the vibe that we felt inside. It rained one day we were there and it felt delightfully cozy. Dan has an attention to detail that was clear both from talking to him, and from every part of the treehouse. The brick work of the surrounding yard was meticulous and charming. The inside furniture was thoughtfully crafted specialized pieces. There were three of us staying for 4 nights and there was enough storage to accommodate us comfortably. We feel absolutely fortunate for having gotten to experience such a space."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. I initially rented this beautiful treehouse for my Christmas holiday w my significant other. Unfortunately he couldn't make it so I turned it into a girls trip w my dancemates. Dan is one of the kindest and most talented people I have ever met. He is accommodating and compassionate. He gives such a welcoming vibe and being an island girl I appreciate good hospitality. His space is whimsical and his attention to detail in all his wood work, architecture, design, landscape is through the roof. My dancemate that stayed w me noticed his skills in trimming his trees... I admire the fine details in his bathroom & treehouse design. everything was intentional & well done. It was clean & immaculate. Somethings I look for when renting spaces in cottages, tiny homes, A frames, tree houses, ect. is the outdoor bathroom, architecture/design, decor/style, cleanliness... Dan nailed everything! This was worth the stay and will be booking again. Do yourself a favor and book! You will love it!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A magical adventure! Dan was an awesome host and made us feel right at home! A truly wonderful experience!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the tree house, it’s perfect for a small family that wants to escape from the routine. My family and I enjoyed the built-in slide, the seating area upstairs, and downstairs, as well as the games. Our host, Dan was very friendly, responsive, and caring.
We can’t wait to be back. My family, and I had a great time."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dans treehouse will always be our favorite place to go to! I hope to one day go along with our kids, I would really love for them to have the experience We’ve had. Dans treehouse is a really good place to go and relax, it is very peaceful, and you could go to a lot of different restaurants that are nearby. Dan is very friendly, and made our experience better and recommended a lot of places to visit! Can’t wait to go back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dan is an amazing man. He created the best treehouse I have ever seen. He communicated clearly on everything, gave fantastic recommendations and even troubleshot road construction.
This location is peaceful and beautiful. I would love to stay there again!!!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I like the concept but when staying in winter time it gets a bit uncomfortable and inconvenient with a separate outdoor bathroom that you need to go outside and take stairs to get to at night. While I can still tolerate the cold, water pressure for the bathroom isn't grear to overcome the outdoor temperature. The slide is a nice touch for younger children. Overall it's a nicer experience than pure camping outdoor, but if you think it's an alternative to a fully indoor, air conditioned lodging, it is not. But the host, Dan, is a friendly and accommodating person and the house is a heritage californian home, too."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Experience!
Beautiful and cozy tree house.
Me and my daughter had an amazing time, enjoying the fire pit at night. Having breakfast at the top deck, watching Christmas movies inside. We also loved the fact that so many restaurants were walking distance.
Dan was so nice and helpful. Made us feel at home.
We appreciated the complimentary bottle of wine.
I highly recommend it! :)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan was once again a wonderful host in a magical place. His treehouse is a peaceful, fun, beautiful, comfy and relaxing retreat! I highly recommend it to everyone who likes adventure, or actually anyone at all😊 We will be returning, and hopefully not in the too distant future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The treehouse experience was everything we thought it would be! We had a great time enjoying the quiet environment on the roof hangout area and inside the treehouse. The firepit was cool but my son would 'hands-down' rate the slide as the best aspect of the treehouse! The convenient walk to the shops worked well for us. Thanks Dan!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is truly a special get away. Our kids had so much fun, especially going down the slide (they used it like 50x each day). So grateful for cool places like this where we can create special memories for our family. Ate pizza around the fire pit, played card games on the rooftop balcony, and walked to breakfast each day. The architecture of the treehouse is truly amazing. We had a cozy stay! Thank you, Dan!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This treehouse is an amazing place! Restful, private and magical! If we could give it 6 stars we would.
The host Dan is such a nice and talented guy!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Dan's amazing treehouse is just what my kids and I were looking for in our restful weekend. We hardly left the treehouse except to go out to breakfast once and bring back dinners to enjoy around the fire pit or up on the rooftop deck. Dan was a very accommodating host. We wished we could have stayed just one more day. The kids will miss that slide exit for sure! Even mom used the slide a couple of times. :-)
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough about our great stay at the treehouse. I had been keeping an eye out for a weekend to book for quite awhile. When I’ve opened up, I booked it immediately so I could take a trip there with my daughter. We had such a great time during our stay there. A weekend filled with lots of laughs, fun, good food and little walking adventures! She had a great time playing on the slide and we enjoyed eating dinner outside, up in the tree with the beautiful lights. It’s so close to downtown and the markets that we never even drove the entire time. Dan is a lovely host and gave us plenty of ideas of fun things to do in the area. The treehouse itself is so beautifully built and must to visit! I’d love to stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is an absolute sweetheart. One of the best hosts I have came across to this date. His listing speaks for itself and the place is even better in person than the pictures. Such a clean and cozy place. The craftsmanship that he put into this stay is absolutely insane and impressive. Can believe he built it all himself! He was so kind and friendly to my friends and I, it felt like we new him for years. He gives you all your desired space and is always looking for advice and improvements. To top it off he even gives a complimentary wine bottle!! The slide is even built for adults and I had so much fun going up and down. The shower had hit water and the water pressure was good! Can’t wait to stay again. Thank you Dan for sharing your stories and your home with us. See you soon.💕"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan was very nice and welcoming

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic!!!! Hidden gem in a busy area but there is no way one can feel or even think such a beautiful, calm, peaceful and enjoyable place is nestled inside the busy area. Dan's craftmanship is supremely visible and the care he has taken to build the home is visible clearly. This is the real ""vacation"" we had, our son went down the slides gazillion times, every day starts and ends with slide for our son. He enjoyed this place thoroughly. Worth every time we spent here."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan's place deserves the Air B and B award for innovation, raw talent and getting lost in the energy and adventure of a treehouse. His kind nature and carpentry magic happens right in his home. His food recommendations were excellent and that treehouse slide created unforgettable moments as we were celebrating my sons 9th birthday... looking forward to returning in the near future 😀"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan's place is truly magical and he is a friendly host. He has lots of lovely touches and the treehouse is just amazing. Beautiful craftsmanship, plenty of room for two adults and a child and several places to sit and relax under the canopy. My daughter absolutely could not get enough of the slide and the adults couldn't either. It's a wonderful and comfortable experience and we can't wait to come back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan was a wonderful host…very friendly and helpful. The treehouse is a work of art…spectacular! We really enjoyed our stay!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t say enough about Dan’s place! It’s clean, fun and clearly built with a lot of love and attention to detail. It’s truly incredible how private the treehouse feels, all the while sitting within a five min walk from downtown Brea. Whether for a romantic getaway, or a fun adventure with the kids, the treehouse is the right spot!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host is very welcoming, the treehouse is beautiful, a great trip"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dan was awesome. His craftsmanship is experienced right upon arrival as you enter through his woodshop and get to see where his creations are made. His time, dedication and creativity are something to be admired as you make your way through his backyard and into his treehouse. He crafted a perfect mix of coziness and convenience as you enter the miniature cabin like experience complete with an upper deck, full restroom and well hidden slide entrance which my kids could not get enough of. There are local eateries, markets, parks and entertainment all within walking distance. I highly recommend this unique stay to anyone with kids or those without who just want to be a kids again themselves, even for a short while. Thanks Dan."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was so fun to be there, I felt like a kid. I really had a amazing time.☺️"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, host very hospitable and the treehouse is peaceful, serene, and comfortable. A must stay for anyone wanting a different kind of vacay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The tree house is a dream house! We've always wanted a fun and memorable getaway with our 4yo son and this was perfect. The tube slide was sturdy and the top deck was perfect for snacks! The bathroom was smartly designed and AC this August heat wave was great. The restaurants and playgrounds were under 10 minutes away which is just right for kiddo pace. We look forward to booking again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful private unique place to stay for a short visit. Fun experience for kids. Has all the basics you need. Dan the host very accommodating. Yet gave us our space. So flexible too. Don't miss out on this. So fun. Reasonable too.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Best mini vacation ever! Can’t beat the tree house views and feelings of being in gorgeous tree :) Dan’s so inspirational, you will be lucky to have a conversation with the expert himself"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place with easy in and out access. Great value.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic! We absolutely loved our stay in this treehouse. My husband and I wanted to have a small getaway to relax and celebrate his birthday and this place was perfect. So fun and imaginative. It was a great place for two adults to enjoy some peace and quiet and it was conveniently located near restaurants so we had plenty of dinner options when we went out. Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan was a great host and the tree house was awesome!! My 7 year old daughter loved the experience and spent hours on the slide. I highly recommend the treehouse as a bucket list item and especially fun for kids.
The local area has lots of restaurants and shopping and several parks and pool - all within walking distance.
Dan built the treehouse and his craftsmanship is inspiring.
My family looks forward to visiting again soon"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such a beautiful treehouse - so many thoughtful details, and my favorite was the top deck where you are literally inside the tree with the canopy all around. Enjoyed spending time up there - morning (breakfast), evening (dinner/wine). Very relaxing! For the kids - a slide, wifi, *and* TV? They were sold! Dan and his sweet dog Zeus were gracious hosts and we hope to return for a stay again in the future."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan’s treehouse is truly a fantastic getaway in a quiet neighborhood. Dan made the space feel very secluded, yet it’s located in his backyard! Downtown shops, restaurants, and entertainment are steps away.
There is just something undefinably comfortable and calm about the treehouse. It was our favorite thing coming home from a busy day of exploring to such a cozy environment. Dan didn’t miss a detail with this place.
The treehouse is roughly 20 minutes from Disneyland and under an hour from LA.
I can’t recommend this incredible place enough!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time at Dan’s just as fabulous this time around.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So much fun! A real adventure kind of experience! My husband, toddler son and I all had a blast at the Treehouse. Also, we spent a whole day at Carbon Regional Park where my son played for hours on three playgrounds. The park is a short drive away and includes a easy hike to Southern California's only Redwood Grove. The treehouse is walking distance to a ton of resturants. We had a really nice dinner at the Olive Pit across the street. In the evening we sat around the fire pit and then moved to the upper deck which was a thrill as you're surrounded by the Trees canopy. It's a total glamping experience in the middle of the city. I hope we get to come again someday!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What an incredible experience! Definitely would recommend staying here.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked this trip for our kids. Now that we've had the pleasure of living in the tree house, I hope everyone takes this unique opportunity to wake up surrounded by trees, literally slide down to a beautiful patio garden, and linger in the lovely shade of the tree's canopy on the top deck. Dan is the perfect host- eager to support, knowledgeable about the area, and respectful of privacy. I encourage guests to share their interests with Dan as he will direct you to great eating and activities. There is so much to do in this area. We simply walked across the street to the Gateway Center to pick up groceries and enjoy a variety of eating and entertainment options. While there are 3 beds listed in the description, Dan keeps an extra matress and linens in the closet. The tree house was perfect for two adults and two pre-teens. We regret planning this trip for only two days. There is so much to see, do, and eat in the area. We look forward to seeing Dan again and embracing a longer stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our experience at the treehouse was wonderful, our kids loved the slide. We were able to have bon fire. The host Dan was really nice and welcoming. We had an amazing time as a family."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My son loved the slide and I loved the patio in the canopy. The location is in good walking to several restaurants.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was such a fun experience for our family and we will definitely be staying again. Dan thought through everything for the treehouse and the location is amazing. Even though the treehouse is on Dan’s property, it feels like you have the place to yourself. We can wait to book the treehouse again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was amazing the kids really loved the experience of it.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This unique Airbnb is nestled in a quaint neighborhood close to so many fun things to do! My girls ages 6 & 15 loved staying in the treehouse and did not want to leave. Dan was a great host. When we arrived he thoroughly explained everything we needed to know. The place was neat, clean and well made by Dan himself. My girls are sure to remember this trip for a lifetime!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd stay at Dan’s treehouse. My family absolutely enjoy our stays here. Close to stores, movies, restaurants, all within walking distance. Dan is always friendly and quick to reply. A must do on your bucket list."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to spend vacation. Lots of other attractions near by. Surrounding area is also great (all restaurants/shops/mall)..
DEFINITELY recommend this place😊."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kiddos 2 and 4 had blast at the tree house! They were up and down on the slide non stop :)
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a dream! I highly recommend bringing a yoga mat or something so you can lay on the deck looking up at the canopy. We stayed up there for hours staring up at the leaves. It's like being in another world. Bring your own toiletries for the lovely shower and wood for the firepit. Dan's craftsmanship is incredible and he was such a warm, welcoming host. We loved getting some quality time with his sweet dog, Zeus. Can't wait to come back!
If you're looking for local recommendations, we had an amazing dinner at Khan Saab, coffee and pastries from Drip, and brunch with craft cocktails at Poppy & Seed (in Anaheim). There's an installation with a grocery store, movie theatre and more just down the street (walkable from the treehouse). And Dan is very accessible and happy to give recommendation. :)"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super host!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you never have stayed in a tree house before and are curious, this would be the one to stay in for sure! My wife and I enjoyed our time there. The host Dan was quick to respond and was a pleasure to meet. 10/10 👌"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My kids LOVED this treehouse. It was in a secluded spot on Dan's property. The treehouse construction is beautiful, and my kids loved taking the slide down. My daughters are 9 and 12 so even for the older kids it was fun. We roasted marshmallows and hot dogs at the fire each night. It was also nice to have a 5 minute walk to grocery, breakfast, lunch, dinner places. Thanks for a great weekend getaway!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Okay, this is really a childhood fantasy come to life! Staying in the Treehouse was a wonderful experience, and Dan and Zeus were great hosts!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a real “glamping” experience! Fire pit with wood and marshmallow sticks is provided. Absolute privacy, sturdy craftsmanship and a congenial host made for a fun experience. Bring your own toiletries and know that the very nice shower, sink and toilet are in a separate little outbuilding at the base of the tree. Great lighting for nighttime visits to the toilet. There is no water in the treehouse but it has everything else you could want, including internet and WiFi tv. We loved it and the outdoor bathroom wasn’t in the least inconvenient for us."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a good time at the tree house! :)
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a magical adventure indeed! Dan has created a special place for all ages to enjoy and be filled with a sense of wonder, meticulously designed and so well though out. He was so kind to our (2) pooches, and even included a complimentary bottle of wine. The slide was phenomenal, our kids must have gone down over 200 times. My favorite part of the trip was watching our six year old son, waking up and immediately and wordlessly jumping into the slide to go down to the bathroom. So funny. The hardest part was deciding whether to spend the evening by the wood burning fire pit, or on top of the roof deck under the brilliantly lit tree canopy, so we had to do both. Thank you again Dan!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an amazing, magical place where everyone becomes a kid again 🌳 💗"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"AMAZING treehouse! So beautifully done. Exactly how it is described! Loved the upper balcony, it was so quiet and relaxing! My 5yo loved the slide!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Have been waiting to book this place for 6 months. Randomly stumbled upon an open reservation in the month of March & blindly booked it. By far my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed at. If you have an opportunity to stay here, don’t hesitate."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I were so excited to stay here. The views already sold me plus the continental breakfast every morning was the icing on the cake. I felt like i was staying at a distant relative's place.
I loved having a coffee in the morning with the beautiful coastline views.
Sherry & Paul were great hosts and their dogs ginger qnd coco were great roommates!! Will stay again!!"

Thanks again we closed our stay in style"

The highlight was the well-kept garden with the view over the Pacific and Santa Monica. We were allowed to use the kitchen and hot tub and enjoy the fire pit. We chose the place since we didn't want to stay in the stressful LA but wanted to enjoy the tranquility in Malibu. Still, we did a lot of things in LA.

Paul was kind and helpful, finding a beach umbrella and offering sunscreen when we headed down to Gladstones for a seafood dinner at the sea. The room was very warm for sleeping (79 degrees) but it cooled down in the middle of the night. The hot tub was fantastic, giving us an unforgettable view of the full moon rising and the ferris wheel spinning over Santa Monica pier.

Just one thing for improvement: on my checkout date, the cleaning staff went into my room packed all my personal belongings and moved it to the common area 2.5h prior to the checkout time as listed without any communication with me. Which slightly obeying the Airbnb safety regulations"

Very serene and peaceful setting. We felt refreshed and ready to venture on the next morning. Highly recommend staying here.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful and the host was helpful. The fire pit is the highlight with the view of the bay. Even saw a shooting star, which is pretty good considering the light pollution of LA. This place is a great find!"

The house is absolutely beautiful! A great space, and..the view….just breathtaking! I wasted many an hour just sat outside looking and enjoying.
The room was very comfortable, clean and homely, with little touches here and there, the bathroom. Was very clean, and the basics provided too.
I was free to use the house as my own, it was utterly perfect!
I Highly recommend this property if you want something that presents incredible value for money, with lovely people and a view that hotels would charge a fortune for!
Thank you Shelly and Paul for you hosting of me!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I came for a little local getaway. Check in was very easy with the instructions provided. The view and little decorating details are awesome, we were very pleased. I told my husband we could pretend we were staying on the top floor of some fancy hotel lol. The one minor down side was that street parking wasn’t as available as we imagined. We found a spot but there wasn’t an abundance of options, which made us reluctant to drive anywhere. Perhaps it’s because there was construction in the area and it isn’t always like this. We ended up getting food delivered which was fine."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here in Hollywood Dell. Mathias gave amazing video instructions on how everything worked in his place. The bed was comfy, the room was spacious and the area was classic LA. I also really loved the view waking up in the morning. I would come back here again for sure.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning setting and lovely studio. It feels like you're in a tree house. The studio is up in the Hollywood hills, tucked away from LA bustle. The bed was extremely comfortable, and we loved using the bathtub located inside the studio. I would note that there are quite a few stairs to climb, so if you have weak knees, it might not be for you.
Mathias was a wonderful host. He was very responsive and friendly. Would highly recommend this place! We would love to visit again."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic view, great location, friendly & communicative host. I would happily stay here again. One thing to note is the private toilet is in a separate room 1-2 steps away from the unit itself, and does not have the same heating/AC as the rest of the space."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing host! Super beautiful place amazing views. Soooooo cute !

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Mathias’s place. He was great at communicating instructions and the view was great!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enchanting place. Mathias was an excellent host and made things easy. Would love to return here for a solid week to daydream and write. Great views and leisurely walk to Beachwood Cafe/Market. Enthusiastically recommended.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The view and the vibe was just what we hoped for. Amazing to be right in the heart of the city but feel lifted up out of it and get that bit of nature and simplicity. The outdoor shower and bathtub are well worth the price of admission alone. It was perfect for our private lil getaway to decompress from holidays with family.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"""Absolutely breathtaking! This Airbnb offers spectacular views that will take your breath away. Clean, and the white bed sheets are a lovely touch. The outdoor toilet adds a unique and adventurous element to the experience, and the cool bathtub is a wonderful way to unwind while enjoying the natural surroundings. It truly feels like a secluded tree house, making it perfect for some peaceful alone time. If you're looking for a one-of-a-kind retreat with a touch of adventure, this is the place for you!"""
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place in a gorgeous setting. Mathias’s place is tucked away in the hills but is also just a 5 - 10 minute drive to Hollywood.

Highly recommend for an unforgettable stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mathias’ studio is a peaceful haven with a breathtaking view !
You are surrounded by nature , yet 8 mins away from the city .
The bed is a dream , so comfortable!
The best is taking a bubble bath in the cast iron tub overlooking the city view .
This is my second time stating here this year and will be back to my home away from home .
Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great view. Great sunset.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mathias' place was a perfect little getaway up in the Hollywood Hill. The loation was awesome, just a couple of miles away from everything in Hollywood that a visitor would want to see. The place itself was just as described in the listing and the views about the window were even better than described. Mathias as a host was perfect - great communication, very responsive, check-in process was clear and easy and we bumped into him as we were heading out for the evening and he was very ready with recommendations and suggestions for restaurants, destinations and how to get to places. Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was a great host, friendly, always called me by my name, and was very helpful to questions when asked.
Provided very clear instructions in a video, everything was nice and clean.
If anything it looked way better in person than what I thought was on photos. View was amazing, has a sunset view from the bed, and can see the whole city from where you slept. Everything was very nature oriented and was a well needed escape. Could’ve had a bigger tv, but I enjoyed the personal time away from electronics so, money well spent regardless :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Both Mathias’s place and the views are absolutely stunning! He was super responsive and friendly too. Highly recommended :)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a slight issue when it comes to viewing the video for how to enter, but after we got that squared away, we had an amazing time. The views were gorgeous, and the place was perfect for two people. Overall, I definitely would recommend this place!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very, very nice! Mathias offers an exceptional LA experience with this unique perch overlooking the city. The whole package makes for a very special stay. Definitely would recommend a return visit with this one."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A 1 of 1 space. I had an amazing time while there. The view is beautiful and peaceful . 10/10 recommended .
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this little slice of rustic paradise! The view was amazing, the bed so comfortable, the whole place was fabulous. We’ll definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A lovely retreat and view!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quaint and quiet spot right up in the hills there. We had a beautiful stay this past weekend and Mathias's space was clean and perfect for us!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an incredible place! So quiet and peaceful up in the trees. The bathtub was perfect after a long day and the view is asolutely stellar.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great time at Mathais's place. The host provided clear and detailed instructions on everything from checking in to the use of amenities.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,it’s a really cute spot! slightly smaller than I was anticipating. but very clean and charming!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay all around.
Small roads winding up to the place but once you’re there it’s nice and quiet.
Even the neighbors were nice.
The view is amazing at night and very comforting with the natural light in the morning. I think the outdoor shower was my favorite part!!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place was quirky but fun. The steep stairs up the hill to get to the house was no joke, but well worth it. The living quarters were totally stunning! The view, day or night, was absolutely breathtaking and we spent a lot of our time there just enjoying it. The amenities were modern and aesthetic. Mathias’ video communication before check in was so informative and really helped us with our stay. Without it, we would not have had as pleasant of a trip.
Overall, we loved our stay. However, it was only for one night and we probably wouldn’t stay for multiple. The toilet is outside of the living quarters, so you have to go outside to use the restroom (it’s not far, but can be inconvenient for some especially in the middle of the night.). The shower is also outdoors and, though it is mostly private, it is shared, and I didn’t feel comfortable enough to use it without clothes on. Again, these two things may not be any hindrance for others, but it could be something to consider."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time at Mathias’s place. It’s a beautiful view, very private and perfect for the trip. I hope to stay there again sometime soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mathias's guesthouse is a special stay in Los Angeles in the hills overlooking the city. The apartment is in pristine condition , the host is very accommodating, responsive , and inviting. This is one of my favorite AirBnBs I've ever been to. It is a perfect getaway that is just outside the hustle and bustle of the city with stunning views overlooking the city, and with a peaceful and serene surroundings."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Truly a wonderful experience. The space is so cozy, the view magical both in the morning and at night, and the outdoor shower is a dream. The short drive up the mountain makes you feel like you can believe you’re just a few minutes from Hollywood. This wasn’t our first time staying here and I really hope it isn’t our last!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mathias was very responsive and provided clear instructions. The place was very nice and offered amazing views.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had such a wonderful time in such a beautiful location! There was still that nice, private touch here yet you also get amazing views of the city. Mathias was extremely helpful & thorough, making the trip that much easier. Thank you!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful spot, and very conveniently located. A great view of LA. A private, home like location which is very nice to have. Mathias was extremely helpful and communicative."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice view! Good spot to stay if ur visiting LA
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfiest bed I’ve ever slept in and the views are amazing. We had a great time!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A unique and special hideaway! Just what we were looking for and needed. Thank you!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can only agree with what has been said: the accommodation was a dream, the location unbeatable and Mathias was super nice and helpful. I can recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful stay. Happy that we’ve found that. We only had two and a half days in LA, and yes, that city is huge and a little scary while being the first time in LA, but with this little gem we had the perfect retreat."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful outlook over the Hollywood Hills and Los Angeles city. It felt private, comfortable bed and pillows, and had a nice tub with a view. Overall, Mathias was helpful and gave very clear instructions, our stay was great."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space, clear check in instructions, and everything you might need for a weekend stay"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay at Mathias’s perch in Beachwood canyon. The views from the deck and studio make the climb so worth it. Clean and well appointed, quiet and serene. My only regret is that I couldn’t stay longer. Also bravo for a 3 pm check in, it’s so appreciated"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The guesthouse was spectacular! Truly unique, an aerie with a stunning view tucked away in a small & quiet private hillside oasis. The outdoor area was nestled in mature broad leaf palms and eucalyptus, with hummingbirds feeding on hanging bougainvilleas. The guesthouse itself was immaculate, smart and efficient layout capitalized on the view, with tasteful, cozy utilities and amenities. Would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Host provided clear instructions to access the home easily. Location was private and comfortable.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful home and stay. Just fyi - there is no indoor shower and you must exit the house to use the bathroom.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! I loved the rustic secluded feel although we were in the city. I would stay again. Everything was great!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The guesthouse sits on a steep hill at the back of the property and has unobstructed 180-degree views that were spectacularly magical and breathtaking. It felt very private overall, as the windows are above eye-level of the rest of the home, except for the outside shower (while there were communicated rules for using the shower to ensure privacy, the bath inside the room with a handheld shower head provided a soothing and relaxing alternative). Quiet neighborhood, and the motion lighting outside at night was very helpful to light the path to the space. I was provided with detailed how-to instructions and information about amenities, check-in and check-out were easy, and shelves and drawers within the room were conveniently labeled so I could quickly find things if needed. Note there are a lot of stairs to get to the guesthouse, so you may want to coordinate with Mathias if you need help bringing your luggage up, but it is absolutely worth the climb. Would love to visit again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My partner and I were traveling down the west coast and it was the perfect place to stay in between destinations in LA!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful retreat in the Hollywood Hills, yet central to everything I wanted to do during my time in LA. Everything is as shown in the pictures—amazing view, comfortable bed and really enjoyed taking it all in on the deck. All directions were clear and Mathias is a super responsive host who cares about your stay. A great value for the location, too."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best place to stay we've ever stayed. A great view and just a great experience to stay at this place. We enjoyed the view from the bed very much. The highlight is also the outdoor shower.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Going to keep it short and sweet like my stay, the place is beautiful, it’s up in the hills with a magnificent view of the city. I would stay here every chance I get it. Thank you Mathias."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mathias’s little hideaway bungalow was a great welcome arriving into L.A. The photos are accurate, and it had everything listed for a quick visit. It’s bright, but the darkening curtains provide shade to keep the place cool when needed. I stayed here during late August, and the AC unit was great. I never saw one bug in my living space, but (because it’s summer and there are lots of trees and shrubbery on the property) there are lots of night bugs that come out in the evening. So if spider webs freak you out, be forewarned. The outside bathroom was easy enough and the shower is literally outside with no overhead cover, so if it’s raining I’m not sure how that works? Luckily, I had great weather so it was a really, fresh & private experience. The only negative (and this depends on the person) are the stairs. If you have a-lot of luggage or heavy luggage, balance issues, or plan to have “too many” cocktails, be forewarned! There are a lot of them, even to the shower. A lot of fun overall!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brilliant space in idyllic location. Gratious host was amazing stay highly reccomend!!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The space was beautiful, however, there was hair and dust all over the room. The seat next to the bed was also stained."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dream , peaceful , oasis with a magical view !
Stayed 3 nights .
Bed super confortable , terrace with Adirondack chairs surrounded by lush vegetation.
Bathtub and Nespresso machine a plus .
Mathias is an experienced and great host !!
Favorite new Airbnb place ,will be back .

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved this place. It was peaceful and just beautiful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice and quiet neighborhood, private, and unique."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful bungalow in the Hollywood hills. easy check-in. great views.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A bit pricey, but if you have the means and you love a good view this place is an excellent choice!
Mathias is friendly, responsive, and respectful of people’s privacy.
Just make sure to watch the instructional video because the doors are a little tricky :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at Mathias’s. It doesn’t get more idyllic than this spot, which had beautiful surroundings, indoor-outdoor living with a sense of privacy, and everything we needed as far as amenities. Driving and parking was very manageable and location-wise, it was perfectly situated with plenty to do in the area and easy access to various neighborhoods. We hope to be back soon!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a relaxing stay at Mathias’ back house. I saw hummingbirds and butterflies, enjoyed the deep bathtub and the city views were beautiful. Somethings that are not explicitly stated in the listing are, that you are very close to the main house and that the bathroom must be accessed by the porch. The steps are also very steep, are of varying materials and depths, and there is not always a hand rail. I previously thought I was fit but I really struggled with a not-so-heavy suitcase in the hot afternoon sun up the steep hillside. Also, the roads to get to the location are very narrow and winding, and there is only one lane for cars to go both directions in. I had some nervous Uber drivers but it’s worth it for the view. Don’t book if you are afraid of spiders or bugs but lovely for a rustic experience."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall this hideaway in the hills lives up to its names.
If you can get over the outdoor shower and an occasional walk because there’s no street parking you will love this place .
The host is also super responsive and friendly, would definitely choose this oasis again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible view, peaceful and serene outdoor area, lovely private outdoor shower, amazing bathtub, excellent location. This place get excellent airflow for early morning breezes and stays cool enough on hot summer days with the ac unit. Overall, I enjoyed my time thoroughly."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mathias’s guest house was absolutely incredible! The view, along with the cute size of the home made it absolutely perfect. On top of that, Mathias was very helpful and had thorough instructions on how to access the location as well as clear house rules. Definitely another location worth visiting again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place responsive host
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique and cozy space in the hills. Overall enjoyed the stay.
The one thing I'll note is that the outdoor shower and disconnected bathroom are a bit hidden in the description. It seems intentional as an effort to not scare people away. If you're okay with these aspects of the place, then it's great."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location in Hollywood hills, close to landmarks and local spots in EaHo. Nice breeze in the house notwithstanding the heat wave. Matthias was a great and responsive host."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay here was amazing! I feel like the pictures do not do justice! The view from the bathtub looking over the Los Angeles nights with the marine layer was so dreamy. The windows being able to open all the way out so you can see the city from afar was so so so nice. The bed was very comfortable, I didn’t even mind the the bathroom was only like 4 steps away outside. It offers privacy for new couples. The area is so quiet and the space was set up so perfect. The lighting and all really set the mood for a peaceful and relaxing stay. Would 100% stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun and cozy setting conveniently located not far from our destination: a concert at The Greek in Griffith Park. Def follow his instruction video for entry info, and be prepared to climb stairs. Once you’re in it’s your private treehouse in the Hollywood Hills!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This beautiful back house was full of light and fresh air. A wonderful private escape, and fun neighborhood to explore."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful private and quiet retreat in the Hollywood hills. There are aspects that are indeed rustic, particularly that there is no indoor entrance to the toilet, which means you’ll have to walk onto the outside patio to get to the toilet. Refrigerator access is also outside which adds a tiny bit of inconvenience. However, it also means that the place is completely quiet at night (no refrigerator compressor noises). The views are incredible and the ambiance is crisp, clean and very pleasant. The weather was excellent during our stay but I’m sure the air conditioning would have been great if needed. The road up to the place is narrow and winding so plan on a couple of minutes to get down the hill and though it’s close to restaurants, shopping and activities, you’ll probably be driving to those rather than walking. Mathias was a responsive and gracious host. Highly recommended!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Hollywood bungalow experience. Great views of the hills and and the city.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Amazing view and close to many things. Worth the climb!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent location to explore Griffith Park and the surrounding hills. Very hilly but walking around the local area was enjoyable. Property is very cool - great views of LA from the window.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay. The view are stunning of the Hollywood Hills. Mathias is super friendly and responsive. In a great location for hiking the Hollywood sign. Will definitely stay again my next time in LA!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, great host, thoroughly recommend"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you so much!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a cool spot! Beautiful views, clean space, and great location. Thank you, Mathias!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mathias was an excellent Host! Extremely communicative and super kind. Was absolutely amazed by the view and the Airbnb was relaxing and peaceful. I would highly recommend a stay here!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is probably my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Yes, the road to get to the spot is windy and there are a lot of stairs - but it’s 100 percent worth it. The views are unbelievable - just so stunning! Loved being surrounded by plants & trees, along with the views of the city. I also loved the decorations - artwork & vibe. And of course the bathtub was just perfect. Plus, shout out to Mathias for letting me have a late checkout! I will be back for sure!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful spot in the hills of LA. Very cool experience staying high up in the hills for someone who’s never been to LA before. Highly recommend staying at Mathias’s air bnb
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mathias's spot was so nice! It's perched up behind the main house but you have all the privacy you need, even with the outdoor shower - which is great btw! The amazing views in the iconic neighborhood are totally worth the stay here. The space has its quirks(which are not bad!) but it's very homey and comfortable despite those. I had a very pleasant stay here and would definitely come again as well as recommend this place for anyone looking for a non-bland airbnb experience."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love Beachwood Canyon, forever a special place in my heart. ✨🤍"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Quiet and peaceful with incredible views of LA and the Hollywood hills. Highly recommended!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is super cute and charming! It feels a BIT like staying in a fort – eclectic and funky, but comfortable. A little unusual and very private, with a marvelous view! We would love to stay here again.
Be sure to read the description; the outdoor shower and bathroom are a little unorthodox, but it's all good if you know what to expect."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy. Vreat ciew and very peaceful and relaxing. Loved it
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for accommodating us.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So happy I found Mathia’s place. The view is absolutely breath taking, worth every penny. Sad I wasn’t able to stay longer!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As long as you’re okay with stairs, outside bathroom, and outside shower (the bath is inside) this is a cozy place, great view, and wonderful location."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The view was incredible and lovely to wake up to in the morning. Make sure you are fine with climbing steps! The climb is worth it.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a bit of privacy with birdsong and gobsmack views, this is your place! If you don’t like stairs and exterior toilet, then I would think twice. It was perfect little oasis for us in the Hollywood hills❤️"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved it! It is a unique experience and the view from the top will knock your socks off.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a nice place! Amazing views. Clean and just what we were looking for.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mathias' place was incredible! It was perfect for a peaceful getaway. The space is beautifully designed and gets wonderful light. The bath tub setting is a dream, the bed is super comfy, and the views are mesmerizing. We left feeling super relaxed and were sad to leave. We would love to stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun and beautiful stay! We enjoyed the beautiful view throughout the night! Highly recommend for a private get-away! Mathias was a great host!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in Mathias’ guest house. The view from the Hills was wonderful and we loved how clearly you can see the city from the many windows. The video instructions he sends are perfectly clear. There are a lot of steps to get to the unit, so keep that in mind when packing luggage."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nothing more to say other than don’t second guess this place it’s worth the money. Beautiful view, with more than everything you need to feel comfortable"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, beautiful place with excellent views.
Yes, as other reviewers underscored the toilet is detached. However, it’s important to know it’s literally 2-3 steps away.
The outside shower is down some stairs and the weather was too cool to use it, but the indoor bathtub sits by a window with sprawling views.
Great spot!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mathias was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. Its a beautiful spot too with amazing views. One thing to note that if you are traveling with big pieces of luggage do note that there are a few steps to get to the guesthouse so do plan accordingly or have smaller suitcases for convenience. Overall, a memorable stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. The view is amazing
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great view
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place in a cozy little neighborhood. Really quiet and high enough to see all of the city lights but far away to catch the sunset. My fav was the vintage lamp they had near the tub. Definitely recommend staying here.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this was a great place to stay. The views are beautiful and the location is great. As a solo female traveler, I wish the listing had mentioned that the bathroom is detached from the unit, and the outdoor shower is shared with the main house. This was not an issue for me because the host was out of town, but would have been good to know earlier than 12 hours before check in.
The Airbnb itself was charming, easy to navigate, wonderfully secluded, and Mathias was very responsive! It was generally very clean.
Lastly, this Airbnb is up a few flights of steep stairs. Again, not an issue for me but this would not be ideal for everyone."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"amazing views from the bath, fun little treehouse type place in the hills, would suggest eating out as the kitchen is quite limited"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun spot, and a great host with great energy. 10/10"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such cozy little highway overlooking LA! Falling asleep to the twinkling lights and watching the sunrise from bed was the indescribable. Wish we were booked for more than one night!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice private space with lovely views!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stairs were tricky to navigate with obstacles and no rails. This could easily be a safety concern for guests. Would recommend for the host to be upfront about challenges once they arrive ti the property.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely Airbnb with a beautiful view overlooking LA. Quiet, clean and peaceful. Additionally, the directions were very helpful, which made the property very easy to find!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cozy and beautiful place. Will come again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mathias was an excellent host. The home was everything we wanted in our quick trip to LA! The sunset from bed was just astonishing!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those places that is what’s best about Airbnb. A completely unique space, integrated into a neighborhood that would be impossible for a hotel to replicate."
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view and location were excellent, the latter giving the option of exploring the neighbourhood and walking trails nearby to Griffith Park & the observatory. However, this is not a pleasant place to stay during winter. Heating is inadequate, and both the toilet and shower are separately located outside. The shower being grimey and set down some rickety stairs. The indoor bathtub, however, is lovely. Mathias was very responsive and friendly, though I think the pictures make the property look a lot more attractive than it is. The decor is messy and felt dirty, while missing things from the listing like the bedhead. The main door was also stuck and made a terrible noise when trying to enter or exit. Overall I did not enjoy my stay here at all, but I can see how it would be much nicer for visitors during the warmer months."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The views were amazing. The place is a bit smaller than the photos make it seem. The toilet is outside and separate from the unit. Rustic is accurate. Great and thoughtful host. :)
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Waking up in the morning to the sun shining through the large beautiful windows and looking down from the hill out onto Hollywood & Los Angeles was magical! I lived in Hollywood for 10 years and never woke up feeling that good!
Would rent again :)"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay with a beautiful view! Got to soak in the vintage tub and it felt like home.
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The stairs are very very narrow and the place could use some TLC but the view is amazing.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Breathtaking views. There is only an outdoor shower and to access the bathroom/toilet you need to go outside first.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous home. Very easy to access. Great communication!!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Hollywood Hills hideaway!!! Was perfect for my night on the town. GREAT VIEWS. Mathias was very quick to respond and place was very clean.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a little climbe up to the guest house but absolute worth it! Lovely interior and a stunning view over LA.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space and amazing view. Mathias was super quick to respond, but honestly I didn’t need much. His welcome video was very detailed and it made the whole process really smooth"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy place with great views of the city!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a short stay in la! Secluded location and incredible views. A real Hollywood experience. Thanks Mathias!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall accurate. Unique stay with great views. Shower is shared and not entirely enclosed.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay was truly great. Check in was easy, and the stunning view was the first thing that caught my attention. It was a wonderful secluded retreat close by to everything but still quiet and enjoyable."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply lovely home up in the trees for a few days. It was glorious showering outside and waking up to the sun rising among the hills and was very comfortable in the unit- the matching towels, Nespresso machine, and small fridge gave it an easy-to-live in spot for a while. Wonderful stay, great host."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic place to stay both for its location and uniqueness. Mathias is a great host with clear, thoughtful communication and quick responses to any additional questions you may have. Highly recommend"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mathias is a lovely host and his apartment is just wonderful. We felt very welcomed and enjoyed every second in this exceptional accommodation with a fantastic view over LA. We hope to come back soon! Highly recommended!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mathias' place was a dream. Perched up behind the main house that allowed for privacy and also a stunning view of the city, with lots of breeze flowing through the large windows. Mathias was exceptionally hospitable, greeting us on arrival and quick to respond to any questions I had. This is a very special home that would be ideal for a solo getaway or romantic vacation. Will be staying here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mathias was very friendly and welcoming. The space aesthetic reminded me of a 70s artist studio. This is the kind of place I would visit if I need to write a book 🙃. It has an amazing view of the Hollywood hills. We had some trouble getting Ubers to/from the place, but totally worth for the stay. Keep in mind that the shower is a shared/outdoor shower."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful quiet canyon perch, stunning views of the city, thoughtfully put together."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautifully designed and well kept room. Mathias was a great host, his info video was incredibly helpful. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. The one thing is that we did not known the bathroom was outside as well as the outdoor shower (which is near the host’s entrance)."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a retreat! The neighborhood is adorable and the views are spectacular. The deep soaking tub was as advertised and I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Hiking trails up to Hollywood sign are within walking distance - and Ubers are plentiful if you want to leave your car as you explore LA. I'll be back for sure!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If your looking for a experience - you’ve just found it! Located in the Hollywood Hills, this little escape has breathtaking views and offers the little extra that AirBnB is made for. You’re feeling so cozy in this apartment while you can literally do sightseeing from your bed. Mathias was a perfect host, easy to communicate with and always keen on making our experience special. Thanks a lot!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a view! We loved sitting and looking at Hollywood below our rustic cottage.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely beautiful. For this to be the first time the view made it absolutely memorable definitely 10/10!!!!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such an amazing stay! The view was truly beautiful to fall asleep and wake up to and I would totally stay here again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed staying here for our first trip to LA. It felt very iconic and the view from the guest house is simply stunning. Mathias gave great instructions and was very communicative. The bed is very comfy and the room is excellently appointed. It has a lot of amenities but does not feel cramped, probably because of the big windows! The guest house also feels quite private as it is perched high above the rest of the property. I loved the climb up but my husband was a little cranky about it."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mathias' place is awesome! Would definitely stay there again :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place, excellent views!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very charming little spot tucked up in the Hollywood hills. The view from the room is mesmerising and everyday we drove from the bustle of the city to this quiet spot was quite magical. It’s a perfect spot for a quiet reprieve and beautiful views.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mathias was a great host who was easy to contact and communicate with. The treehouse is very unique and a cool place to stay. The view out of Hollywood and LA is absolutely incredible! Would highly recommend staying here!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stopped in LA while traveling and came across this lovely spot in the Hollywood Hills. Mathias was an incredible host and provided us with a comfortable environment to crash in for a night. The views are incredible and would recommend to anyone looking for a cozy weekend away in LA
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Felt very safe and comfortable! Beautiful location and view. Will be coming back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a nice treat! Everything was beautifullly decorated and comfortable. I especially liked the soft lighting and views of sunrise and sunset over the city. Truly magical.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing view. Climbing those stairs are worth it!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved my stay. The home was uniquely charming and cozy. The host, Mathias, was very friendly as well."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for little getaway. Amazing view.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything perfect.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, easy check-in and good communication. Stellar views from the living space. Location was good, just be mindful that it's at the end of an extremely windy street and in a very car dependent neighborhood. Overall though I definitely recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great location in the Hollywood Hills with a stunning view. We had the best time here.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really enjoyed my stay here, it has so much character. Such a beautiful view and in one of the best neighborhoods in LA (coming from an LA native)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lupe's place was a nice spot to stay and work from. It's very clean, with all the amenities needed. the shower is awesome, but the patio is better! She was very communicative and helpful, would definitely book again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Currently my last few hours here, just want to say the pictures don’t do any justice compared to in person! Very clean, and quite neighborhood within a beautiful piece of property I find myself writing this watching the LA night life traffic. I will forever rent with Lupe, not only was she very responsive but also honerbly friendly! Well put together / professional establishment she has made with this one property. Will be booking again in August! First time LA traveler & she made the trip helpful with a home that made me feel like I was a resident for a week.. in other words book the trip, enjoy life!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were allowed to spend relaxing 5 days in the apartment. The accommodation is spacious and it has everything you need. The view from the terrace is stunning, even though we unfortunately did not have such good weather that we could enjoy the view in the evening. The surroundings are not very nice at first, but the apartment makes up for it. All in all a great stay. We would stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, modern place with nice, private off street parking. Very peaceful at night, with a beautiful view of the city lights below. Narrow streets getting there, but I was in a large Chevy Suburban and had no problems. I'll definitely take advantage of this fine location on return visits to LA."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the nicest air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. Definitely would book this again. Lupe was such a good host and communication was superb!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing experience, beyond great host, special place! View is next level - big private patio shows skyline of LA. Inside is very clean and spacious with all amenities included. Parking was great addition as well. House is gated, safe and secure. Will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This listing was everything we could ask for and more. The neighborhood is private and quiet, and a nice little escape from the busyness of the city. The cleanliness of the studio was amazing, you can tell that the sheets, blankets, and towels are always washed. The kitchen and bathroom also have EVERYTHING that you need. The host also assures you have a smooth check in/out and communicates very well. Overall, this listing has by far been the best stay for me, we will definitely be coming back :-)"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'll always be looking for Lupe's place when I return. Out of the fray from LA traffic and peaceful, serene view before bed. Also, parking is secure for cars high enough to take the steep decline upon entry."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing location and vibes - we went there for NYE and had a great view for the fireworks. Only reason for the four star was because the entrance was so steep - it scrapes the bottom, but that may have been my mistake
Overall clean, unique place to stay. I enjoyed their propane firepit"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lupe pays attention to detail and keeps her place well maintained and esthetically pleasing. She is very responsive and clearly takes pride in providing a great experience.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best airbnb stay. Lupe was a great host and her place had everything needed throughout the stay. Would come back just to stay at her home!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The highlight of this stay was definitely the view but other than that I felt right at home. The place was clean, spacious, and comfortable and the host is really nice and responsive. I would definitely book here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay here at Lupe's place. Amazing views, very peaceful and private. We didn't have a single issue and Lupe makes sure her hosts are comfortable abd happy. Very clean and everything is described as listed. Do NOT fear the driveway and roads. Any decent or good drivers shouldn't have an issue. No lowered cars (sports/street cars fyi) though. My BMW 430i was able to make it no problem with a slightly lower front end. Don't miss out on this place, views and location. No complaints, great stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with a great view for the day or night! Lupe was also great. Super friendly and responsive every time I messaged her. Would definitely book again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time visiting LA. Might just come back a third time because of this Airbnb. Lupe is the best host! Definitely recommend don’t even second guess yourself if it’s worth it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I absolutely loved it, my partner and I felt right at home. Honestly one of the beautiful, cleanest, and comfortable airbnbs I have ever stayed in. It’s a little scary taking your car down the drive way but our car was just fine, just go slow or if it’s really low park on the street. Otherwise this place is a 10 out 10 with a gorgeous view. We are so grateful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was EVERYTHING! My partner and I had a great time. The outdoor area was beautiful, it was always quiet & peaceful, and the inside was squeaky clean and smelled good. The best parts of the room were the bed, shower, and Alexa. The bed is firm but comfy, the waterfall shower is to die for, and the Alexa was super convenient for our music listening purposes. We were extremely happy with our stay and Lupe was very responsive whenever needed! (-: 10/10 recommend! (However, only stay here if you are comfortable with driving on narrow streets! We’re used to it so we were fine, but if you have driving anxiety then I wouldn’t take the chance!)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As soon as you arrive here, the view is gorgeous just like the pictures, day or night. It's very easy to feel at home here. It's cozy yet doesn't sacrifice for niceties. Number one takeaway is privacy and location, you truly feel as though it's just you and your loved one."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lupe was a wonderful host and her place was great. The views were fantastic and everything was clean and exactly as described. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great place and phenomenal views!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing experience. Beyond beautiful views. Definitely worth it.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great View and comfortable space!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful quiet spot to stay in. The host was lovely and very helpful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for having us Lupe!
My wife and I honeymooned in Los Angeles and we loved our stay with Lupe. Upon arrival we were shocked at how narrow the streets were and the driveway is very steep. Lupe did note in the description about the driveway but I underestimated the steepness as my car couldn’t go down the driveway. Finding parking on the street wasn’t that difficult, just requires a short walk back if you can’t use the driveway.
Other than that, our stay was perfect! The view was amazing all day not just at night. The place was very clean, cozy and quiet. We had no issues during our stay and will definitely be recommending in the future!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lupe’s place was great! Very spacious for a studio, and very clean. Bed was really comfortable and the shower was incredible! As a single female scoping the area out for a week I felt very safe at Lupe’s, mainly due to the locked gate and surrounding video surveillance. Lupe was very sweet and checked in to make sure stay was going smoothly! Only downside was that it was a bit farther than I anticipated from sight-seeing LA/Hollywood/Pacific Ocean, but I guess that’s LA for you. Would still definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay. It was only 1 night but everything was good.
My car was too low to drive through the driveway so I ended up using the street parking(BMW M4). Street parking has very limited space. I did not deduct any star for this though since the host very well explained it before the booking.
Overall experience was really great!. 5 out of 5!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great! Cute place ! Super easy to get to! Loved the Vibe!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved Lupes place! Everytime I needed anything it was already supplied at the airbnb. Lupe was very friendly with checking in and making sure our stay was going good. The airbnb felt welcoming, private and at home. The outside furniture was used every night with the best view and I could definitely see myself staying here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful place to relax and feel right at home! I can’t say enough nice things about this place, and for the price it seemed like such a good fit. Thank you to our hosts, they made the stay easy and comfortable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lupe is a very good host, the neighborhood is a bit complicated walking. You can't access it easily. The house is perfect. The house is perfect"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked this location for my in laws and they loved it! They said it was very comfortable and clean!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe is a great hostess, very responsive. The parking is a little difficult because of the steep drop, but the view makes it all worth it. She had plenty of fresh towels and everything you’d expect from an East LA home with a great view.
Overall it was a great stay & I would recommend it to others. It’s just far enough out of downtown to get that at-home feel. Great set up Lupe."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it. Thank you for everything. Opening the blinds and curtains everyday and letting sunlight in was perfect. Sitting on the balcony and drinking tea while doing work on my laptop was perfect. The night views: perfect. The kitchen had everything we needed. There’s enough outlets and plenty cleaning supplies. Even some laundry detergent. We brought our own detergent and water, though. Bring bottled water if you prefer that over tap. The ice machine works perfectly! The place was very clean and me and husband both said we would stay again. 5 stars. No complaints. Thanks, Lupe & Chris!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was well organized and takes care of and the view was worth every penny
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an extremely comfortable Airbnb. The view was great and it is updated nicely. The bed was extremely comfortable. The only thing missing was a dishwasher.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe’s place was great! Very clean and easy to access. Photos are accurate. Love the patio! It is on top of a big hill that’s not really walkable, but they have a private parking spot available if you’re driving."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay ! Made our first trip to California so easy. Everything provided in the Airbnb , down to the little things that you wouldn’t think about, we couldn’t believe it. Great area to stay if you aren’t sure or wanting to stay directly downtown LA, but also not far from many areas as we easily travelled to Hollywood and Santa Monica . Thank you so much for your hospitality☺️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved lupe’s property! I would book again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe's place was an amazing & memorable stay! The place is adorable and the views are great. Can't beat having dinner on the back patio during the evening as the sun sets. Lupe is a fantastic host who also responds very quickly. This was our second time staying at a place she hosts & would definitely come back again.
The area is filled w/ so much culture & her place is 10 mins away from DTLA & about 30 mins from Disneyland. SO MANY amazing food options near by that also deliver which was a huge plus for us!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect, breathtaking view pretty quiet,clean and cozy. 😚👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe’s place is absolutely lovely. She had so many thoughtful touches and one of the cleanest places I have ever stayed. She has everything you need for a home away from home. The decor was lovely and functional. The bathroom was spa like. The washer and dryer were wonderful to have.
The view from the patio is stunning especially at night with all of the twinkling lights. It was quiet and calming.
The one tip I would give is bring a smaller car as the roads are twisty and narrow and is a little bit out from the LA destinations.
Lupe is just lovely and a wonderful host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is clean, the facilities are very complete, and the night view is beautiful"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay here has amazing views! The drive up the street is a little tight so be cautious of other vehicles. This place is very clean and private for being a part of the main home. Parking was great to have as well. Loved having a washing machine as something leaked out in our luggage and it was so convenient to be able to wash out clothing. We would definitely stay here again. Cute and quaint little spot.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great space! Everything was perfect from the views to the set up of the place.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay here! Beautiful views, very clean and everything you could possibly need to cook with."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I mainly booked it for the view for my bf & the view didn’t meet my expectations, going to the house I was alittle worried at first , the place was nice & clean , the drive way has a long dip which makes it hard to not scratch the car when coming out ."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was a awesome stay at Lupe‘s apartment. The view is amazing, place was very clean, would totally recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Had everything that we needed ! Would stay here again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very clean and bright place! on top of the hill with nice views! host was Very accomodating and responded quick for Any inquiries.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I didn’t get to meet Lupe, which would have been a plus! She was responsive which was great, but also the Airbnb is in a tight space."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is clean and has a beautiful enjoyable city view! The neighborhood seemed sketchy but the home is very secure, it’s gated and has outdoor cameras. You’ll feel safe. You get your own parking too. I love that parking wasn’t an issue. We drove a midsize truck. Even though the streets were tight we were still able to maneuver. Just drive slow. You can tell they take pride in keeping this place real clean and that’s the number one reason I chose this place. The second was the view."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay here.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,View was very nice. Life was able to accommodate us in a short time frame. The steep driveway was a fear factor. Home was clean and had everything we needed.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe was a great host. The apartment was immaculate, clean, and comfortable. It had everything we needed for our stay. The view was gorgeous. Getting in and out of the driveway was tricky because of the steep hill but it was doable. We felt safe parking our car knowing there was a locked gate. The apartment smelt wonderful, all of the linens were soft and clean. The shower was better than home. Having the washer and drier was a great perk. We loved the art throughout the space. Overall, great listing for a couple looking to explore the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location made us feel secure with the push to open gate, and the entry to get into was super easy with the code given. The roads leading up to the house are very tight and windy but I would not let that stop me from booking this place again! The view was great as well but we were just to tired at night from the day to find the time to sit outside most of the time.
Everything was clean and felt like nobody had stayed there before!
The shower is a little difficult because it seems the water comes out pretty easily since there isn’t a full sliding door but if you just wipe it down after everything should be okay.
I would and will rebook this place if I find myself in LA again! Host was great, nobody in the surrounding area bothered us and we felt safe and secure!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I absolutely loved this place. Unfortunately, the firepit you see in photo is not available so it's really cold to sit outside at night and enjoy the view. However, they have blankets you can use. Just dress warm and grab a blanket. This place makes you feel right at home. I'm a woman that prefers to cook and she had enough stuff there for me to use, with stores nearby I could go to. The shower was amazing, water pressure, and heat was perfect, and the bed was comfortable. They were even willing to bring us a propane for the grill late at night and allowed us to extend our stay. I highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"clean, comfortable , amazing views. a quiet hideaway in the city♡"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I extended my stay. Smoke friendly just keep it outside. The parking for me was a supper plus especially if you're renting a higher-end car. If it's available ill definitely rent it again. Oh and they view is a whole vibe
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This listing was awesome. You get your own private space and entrance. Beautiful view day or night! Getting up to the house is a bit tricky at first. It’s a safe residential area in east La. Host was super attentive and even allowed us to extend our stay. Everything was wonderful highly recommended.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great view! Great Location! Great stay
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lupe’s place was so cozy and the view was amazing! I had everything I needed and the place was tastefully decorated and felt homey.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Honestly it’s an amazing place everything is very accurately described. The location is amazing due to the view but the only scary part is getting the car in and going up the streets. Other than that it’s amazing!!!!!!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful spot at the top of hill! Love the neighborhood! The wooden doors that open up the view to city are an amazing touch - could have stayed on the back patio all night.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was studio was impeccable! Great taste, lovely decor and simply EVERYTHING you need to rest, relax, work, cook or Netflix and chill! I enjoyed the outdoor patio and view day and night. The private parking was perfect and I had no trouble navigating the little winding roads, it was fun! I only wish my visit was longer. Will definitely return!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,FANTASTIC
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is beautiful and the view is indeed amazing. House rules are very extensive and only given on arrival. I had special birthday plans for my partner that were almost cancelled due to the rules. However, Lupe was accommodating which I appreciated. The roads leading up to the property are very tricky and a bit intimidating. Lots of blind spots but I’m guessing that’s just LA."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Returned to one of our favorite Airbnbs and after staying once again, we were reminded why it’s the perfect stay. Everything is stocked, cleaned, and ready to go for you to enjoy your stay. The privacy and open space both inside and outside is what makes this a great stay. Fantastic host and lodging."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning, the view was even better in person and Lupe was an outstanding host. The only thing I would say is a car is needed as all attractions are going to be further away from the location of the property. CAR NEEDED!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was so beautiful and clean. Lupe was a great host, responses were quick. Getting in and out the parking can be a little tricky but if u back in it might be easier. the roads going to and from the house had a beautiful view of the city. Can be a little scary driving up and down those hills especially at night. Never the less, we enjoyed our stay very much."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Super nice home, amazing view. Very clean. Driveway is pretty steep & the roads to get there is pretty narrow. Kinda hard to get Ubers to come as well."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great view , fantastic kitchen, one giant bed, really nice shower, refrigerator’s got fresh cold water, easy entry, got blocked in by public works vehicle who parked right in front of the driveway which made it impossible to get out until he decided to come out from wherever he was. Other than that great place for a couple to spend a week or three."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful home with a great host. I’d definitely recommend it. The only issue was location. Ubers had to really navigate to get up the hills and tight streets to the home.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience. Very clean, central to everything, and the view was great. Quiet neighborhood close to the city."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked for the View and it did not disappoint! My girlfriend Loved it. Great for her Instagram :-) Everything you need is here. We enjoyed the extra throw blankets in master bedroom closet. We put them to good use in living room watching Netflix and enjoying the view. Getting to the place isn't as bad as others make it seem, roads are narrow, but neighbors all work together. Back into driveway and it's a breeze. Take off your shoes and follow house rules you will Love this place!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hey whats up Ya’ll
So to anyone thinking about staying here, Id just like to say right off the bat that you aren’t going to regret your visit!
First off, everything about the instructions were absolutely clear and just in case you had any questions, Lupe was very responsive at any time of the day!
Cleanliness factor was 10/10 and the view was absolutely to DIE for. They did a great job at providing everything that you’d need leaving you to pack only your essentials!
The only downside I would say is that the actual BNB is a bit hard to reach given that the streets were a bit narrow but honestly nothing driving a bit slower can’t fix!
Overall one of BEST Air BNB’s that I’ve stayed at and would highly recommend to anybody looking for a very pleasant and easy going experience with an absolutely amazing Los Angeles View! 🙏🏽"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend the apartment for your stay in LA. The view from the apartment is absolutely mesmerizing and Lupe has done a great job at decorating the inside as well!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Location was nice and the View was lovely. The home was very beautiful and peaceful.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing property with awesome, responsive hosts.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great experience. highly recommend!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Host (Lupe and Chris) :
prompt and clear communication.
went over and above to make the home toddler friendly.
Lupe got us a graco pack n play on request and was very thoughtful to provide toys and a play mat . This is exactly the reason we love AIRBNB - the personal touch and warmth the hosts provide along with their home .
Both Lupe and Chris are very accommodating.
my toddler thoroughly enjoyed .
Home : very clean and exactly as described . modern , bright and vibrant . kitchen is nicely stocked ,
amazing view !!
needs good parking skills !! - Parking can get quite challenging inside the home and outside as well. the road to the home is quite narrow with cars parked on both sides and the only way to park is to back up the downward slope of the house
checkin and checkout is very easy."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lupe’s stay does not disappoint! You get a wonderful view, perfectly stocked kitchen with cocktail glasses and a drink book if you’re intro trying new cocktails. The bathrooms were well put together as well as the living room. The bed is a comfortable king sized bed with a fantastic mattress. You also have a well stocked laundry room that is very up to date. My wife and I love this place and we’re sure you will too. Give Lupe’s place a try!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BELIEVE THE HYPE. This home is stunning and nothing short of spectacular. The views are insane, it’s beautifully decorated, private, and peaceful. Our favorite spots were the outdoor seating areas and the view from the living room. Lupe responded quickly to any questions we had and made everything very easy to understand. I highly recommend renting a small SUV if you can. The area is in the hills so it’s a bit windy going up and down but totally manageable. We also backed into the driver and found that to be easiest."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! Great view and nice patio to relax on. Home is very well stocked. Parking in the driveway is a bit difficult.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My bf and I really enjoyed our stay at Lupe’s place. Her place was extremely clean, was in a convenient location and she has so many essential items that comes in handy while on your stay. Plus a great view! Just like the other reviews, make sure to have a car that is good for driving up and down very steep hills. We rented an suv and had zero problems. (it’s also easier to leave out if you back into your spot)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great overall experience and excellent view of the city.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was great and she was so accommodating to our needs. Very friendly host and the view was beautiful, especially at night.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place! After a long drive from Oakland it felt like an oasis of relaxation. The house is even better in person and the view is stunning! So nice to be outside of the busy downtown.
The place felt very clean and literally had everything. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the tools, coffee, basics and more.
It was also nice to have private locked parking space. Even though the driveway was a little steep. I took the advice of the other reviews and backed in. Little scary at first but much easier to exit.
Will definitely be staying here again!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so awesome , me and the Mrs had a great experience at Lupes place ! First thing, the view is amazing , we left the blinds up literally the whole time we were there. Second best thing was the location, ubering all over Los Angeles was super affordable , we were never too far away from anything. And after a day out on the town coming back here gave you a great sense of unplugging as it is very private. Would definitely recommend"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lupe’s place was a good spot with an amazing view. We enjoyed having the private patio. The location is a bit of a drive (about 30 mins) to most of the places we visited while in LA. However we didn’t mind and actually liked being able to drive around and explore more of the area. Overall, I would stay here again. Thanks for the stay Lupe!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’d recommend this place to anyone! I loved it so much that I’ve already rebooked it!

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great far view of the city.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for a stay in LA, clean, great view, everything you need and the host Lupe is very responsive."
,,,"Invasion of privacy is pretty whack and I didn’t enjoy that at all from the host. She was snooping around with her phone out recording, like who the fu<k does that lol? I was smoking outside and she took a picture of me and sent it to air b&b and requested I left lol.
Aside from the view, the neighborhood is TERRIBLE for driving . Not to mention, parking is narrow and terrible because they park their big truck in the same parking spot that looks like it fits one, however they force you to park right next to it so you’ll have to be careful with that.
Other than that, the tv WiFi didn’t work at all. Tried to speak with the host unfortunately she had no idea how to work her own WiFi and tv, literally useless. Also the sliding ‘patio’ door wouldn’t even close properly lol. Also the house smelled musty and there were already knives and forks out when we arrived. Don’t know if they were used, either way disgusting. Would recommend this air b%b if you want to have the worst time in LA."
,,,"COME FOR THE VIEWS”
Stay for the scrupulous surveillance
FYI the space isn’t “entirely” to yourself, the property has been converted into a duplex with a current tenant.
Enjoy the mochidounts I left & thanks for your time. 🖖🏾"
,,,"Lupe needs to work on her communication skills she was very rude, unprofessional, unwelcoming and sarcastic."
