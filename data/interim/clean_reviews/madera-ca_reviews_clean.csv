2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was in a great location to bird at the World Birding Centers in the area - Patagonia, Madera Canyon, Sierra Vista Canyons. The house was clean and comfortable with everything in the kitchen that you needed. Skies were super clear and beautiful at night - stayed up to see the stars and milky way. Comfortable living room furniture, beds were comfortable, lots of towels in the bathrooms, nice toiletries for the shower! Large porch was where we spent most of our time to enjoy the outdoors."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great weekend getaway location! Outside of town just a little, easy to get to, nice and private, beautiful views. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Kim's place. The place very peaceful and quiet. The house is very well equipped, with all the essentials to have a good stay (washing machine, dishwasher, a large amount of linens)

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful ranch retreat. we enjoyed peaceful walks through the horse paddocs. stunning views and and clean comfortable home. Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Special gem in beautiful country setting, our 5 horses had big safe clean stalls. Lots of riding in different terrain.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at the ranch house! Quiet surroundings with space to walk around the property. We enjoyed our time sitting on the porch, drinking coffee and visiting. I would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at the Ranch house and we throughly enjoyed each day. We had our son, daughter in law and 2 year old granddaughter with us this time and the girls had never been to Arizona so they got to see all the natural beauty the ranch has to offer. Kim is an amazing host and was very responsive to any questions or concerns we had. The home itself was cozy and had everything you could possibly need for a short or long visit. We highly recommend the Ranch house for the privacy and true country experience. Thank you again Kim! ü§†üê¥"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So here‚Äôs the skinny, my wife and I took a vacation within our vacation. We stayed here in Sonoita. The ranch was beautiful and quiet, the home was absolutely beautiful. I would definitely stay there next time we come to Arizona."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was great spot to stay and super great last minute communication!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay for a quail hunt to the Sonoita area. The home was perfect...very quiet and secluded. The owners were very responsive and helpful to any questions we had. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Very clean and nicely appointed home. Felt like home away from home. Nice to see all the horses. Kim was very helpful even with our late arrival. Very easy and minimal check out instructions. We hope to come back in the near future! Thank you Kimü§†
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. The ranch was quiet and peaceful. We saw a few horses each morning through our windows. The views were amazing. Kim was responsive and share some great local information. We highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was our second long stay at Hummingbird Hill. We love it! In 2016-17 we stayed about three weeks and did the same again this time. The house is extremely comfortable, spacious, and well-kept up. The kitchen is excellent and well-stocked with dishes, pots, pans, and cooking utensils. The setting and the views are quite beautiful. It has by far the best library (mostly 20th century fiction) of any rental property we've ever been in. Molly also has lots of helpful books and magazines about local attractions. We especially value the location because we can just walk to many wonderful hiking trails. Molly responded very promptly and helpfully to any questions we had."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved Hummingbird Hill! the cabin is so cozy, the wrap around deck was a delight, and the kitchen is very well stocked. Highly recommend and I would certainly book again if I was staying in the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We feel extremely fortunate for another wonderful stay at Molly's gorgeous house. We are grateful to her family for creating this welcoming space to reconnect with nature
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We‚Äôve stayed here before and will definitely keep coming back. It‚Äôs a great getaway close to Tucson, and a peaceful way to experience one of So AZ‚Äôs sky islands."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Madera Canyon is one of my favorite places in Arizona, and Molly‚Äôs place is now our favorite place in a Madera Canyon. Can‚Äôt wait to go back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This jewel of a place is a little like a lost horizon Shangri La. So close to home for me, but another world entirely. If you love peaceful nature, birds and copious wildlife, mountain vistas, and cabin environments with modern amenities but no noisy technology then this is your happy place.
We had a great time watching the birds after we put out the feeders . We were visited by wild turkeys, deer, of course many birds and squirrels. We had beautiful mountain summer rainstorms.
This is my first visit to Madera canyon and it is an enchanting area so close to home but again, another world entirely. The elevation is lower than Mount Lemmon, and seemingly less travelled without the larger tourist traffic and much less populated. The canyon grounds as part of the Coronado National Forest are very well appointed with beautiful and spacious picnic and hiking areas including visitor information and restroom buildings. I look forward to coming again during the fall or Spring."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"OMG - nothing like it! Beautifully crafted woodwork; secluded w imposingly downward steep dirt driveway from main road (need all wheel or 4 wheel and gutsy driver); note 15mph road w little traffic; birds, turkeys, coatimundi & squirrels visiting balcony w deer below; hikes up mountains and by streams; a paradise for naturalists. Spacious interior w cool basement having card table. A garage! Kitchen fully equipped. I don‚Äôt like leaving such a good review because I want this place available for my future visits."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a third time I stayed at the cabin in the Canyon and definitely will not be the last. Still too many hikes I haven't done yet. Molly keep the calendar open and ready! We will be back some other winter
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The house is wonderful -- cozy and comfortable; we felt at home (didn't want to leave). The surroundings are just beautiful, spectacular views. We were visited daily by a coatimundi and lots of birds. We so enjoyed our stay -- extended it, twice! Molly is a great host, responsive and accommodating. We look forward to staying there again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique, private, peaceful. A nature lover‚Äôs dream. Worth the wait!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow!! What an incredible location to stay. The cabin has so much character that we instantly fell in love with it. The cabin has everything you could want and more with really comfy beds. We came for Madera Canyon‚Äôs birds and wildlife and were not disappointed. Of the 59 bird species we saw during our stay 54 of them were from the deck.
The Coati and Ring tail Cat were nightly visitors, what a truly amazing experience seeing them. We did not see any large cats or bears.
We wanted to maximize our birding experience, so set the feeders up right away. These are established feeders, so the birds are not shy. If you want the full Madera Canyon experience, put the feeders out and see what comes.
We were fortunate enough to see the Wild Turkeys glide down the canyon from their roost. Watching the thunderstorms from the deck was exhilarating. Highly recommend this rare gem location. We will be back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Quiet, tranquil, and beautiful. It has everything you need."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place has the most wonderful porch.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Wow! Wow! What a gorgeous and unique old cabin! The wood work is mezmerizing. There's an old mine right there on the propertey and wild turkeys visited every day of our one week stay. I'm not a birder, but I got to spend a few minutes just feet away from an Elegent Trogan up in the canyon which was a pretty cool experience. We will be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is wonderful. Clean. Cozy. Quiet. Superb craftsmanship. Clear communication. It‚Äôs an amazing place for an intentional getaway.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely fantastic and one of the best airbnbs I have ever stayed it. Great location, great value, super helpful hosts, great vibe in the house. Wildlife frequently approaches to house, so you can observe animals from within. Super nice hikes, just fabulous!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted to have the wild all around me and I got it! All while living in an extraordinary, handsomely crafted house with all modern conveniences in Madera Canyon. I have had such a wonderful retreat, no phones ringing, no doorbells ringing, no crowds, no interruptions. Hiking everyday up the stream beds, seeing the sun EVERYDAY has been a treat. This is a beautiful, welcoming, rare place."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home and location is so very special. The location is amazing and beauty of nature makes it memorable. You will have a relaxing and lovely stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,It is everything you could imagine and much much more! The cabin itself is a work of art and creativity and the location is absolutely stunning. I was able to take my dogs straight from the house to the hiking trails! It‚Äôs the perfect escape to recharge and disconnect. Molly was perfect in communicating everything I needed to know so I had no issues during my stay. Would definitely come back again:)
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a place!! An truly remarkable place to stay, not just for the location, but to marvel at Richard Lansky's superb craftsmanship. Everything was perfect, and we've already made plans to return!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful property, very comfortable with everything you could possibly need plus food for birds available. Hopefully will get to stay there again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,excellent location! great for birding. We really enjoyed our stay. Really enjoyed the intricate design of this fabulous cabin retreat. Thanks!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for hiking and to get away from it all.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I‚Äôve been wanting to stay at this cabin for a while but haven‚Äôt had 6-nights (and typically when I have that much time, I‚Äôd venture farther away than the hour south of Tucson). It was better than I expected! It‚Äôs at beautiful vantage point in Madera Canyo n where we watched the sunrise and set over the mountains. Deer, wild turkeys, raccoons and birds galore make it an amazing experience just sitting on the porch. The woodwork throughout the cabin is impressive and charming. The kitchen had everything we needed. Overall, it was a very comfortable, pleasant stay that enabled me to get out and hike around the canyon everyday. Loved it and we hope to make our stay a regular thing!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is our 3rd stay, always have an amazing vacation at this beautiful cabin. Surrounded by incredible scenery and some fascinating wildlife."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Molly's place was great. If your a birder or a bug guy you won't find a better place in Madera. Had ringtail visit us every night and a coati the first night. Tons of hummingbirds.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,beautiful place
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place with a great location near the trails in Madera Canyon. Enjoyed sitting on the deck watching the hummingbirds at the feeders during the day and the bats at night. We hope to return soon!
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a wonderful vacation in Molly's exceptionally well-appointed, and comfortable mountain home. It surpassed all our expectations and we will certainly be re-booking a longer stay when next an opportunity arises. Although the weather was exceptionally hot, we took every opportunity to immerse ourselves in the nature experiences Madera Canyon affords its visitors. This included summiting Mt. Wrightson and seeing many unique bird species which were lifers for us. Another memorable moment was watching a coati raid one of the bird seed feeders we had put out on the deck which has spectacular views. Our mom, who is 87 spent the majority of her time on the deck which gave her the opportunity to share in our family's love of birds and nature. The number and diversity of birds and critters which visited the feeders was truly breathtaking. We highly recommend Molly's home for those who are like-minded."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin more than lives up to the photos and descriptions. If you love birds,nature, peace and quiet, views, and mountain cabins...GO!"

Elorie‚Äôs place was comfortable, spacious, well outfitted, and super clean (especially noted by friends who were staying at another Airbnb). The location made it easy to walk into town for meals, groceries, or bike parts. All of the appliances worked well, including the dishwasher, washer/dryer, water heater, mini splits, stove, microwave, etc. We were pleasantly surprised to find laundry and dishwashing detergent, as well as shampoo, lotion, etc. We enjoyed the patio area and outside space for rinsing bikes, reading, and shared meals. Being able to park our car in the shade of the carport was nice too. (The very nice neighbor next-door has two big dogs that, while startling at first, were predictable and well contained.) Elorie was super responsive, organized and cheerful in response to all of my questions. We were as happy as could be about our choice to stay at Elorie‚Äôs Cottage."

Patagonia internet is notoriously spotty but Elorie even went the extra mile to install a new, better, upgraded system while we were there. Still not perfect but better. Get out and ride, hike or explore the town and you won't need it. Highly recommend this airbnb."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cottage was very comfortable and Elorie immediately answered back on a few questions we had. Highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic spot in a great location.
We had a fantastic 10 days of gravel biking from this comfortable and well-equipped home.
The house is perfect for a family or small group (maybe not for two couples, as there isn‚Äôt a door on one of the bedrooms).
Elorie is professional and responsive, so the stay was very easy.
The internet is not great - that‚Äôs true - we weren‚Äôt always able to watch movies. But the library has good wifi for those of us who have to work while on vacation. There‚Äôs a fantastic selection of books too!
Overall, the best place we‚Äôve stayed in Patagonia, and we hope to come back next year."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Cute little apartment off the main road. Private street with easy parking. Short walk to restaurants/shops. Host was very responsive with any questions we had.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elorie‚Äôs place is so great! Super spacious and clutter free; yet, has everything that you‚Äôll need during your stay. Welcome book was super helpful with local recomendations‚Äî and it‚Äôs walkable to Main Street Patagonia!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,We really really liked everything. Will do again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful host. Will be back.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elories‚Äôs place was a wonderful retreat. It was comfortable, homey and well appointed. Elorie was a gracious, responsive host and I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate for a moment before recommending this place or booking it again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the location and peaceful vibes of this cozy home. Rode our bikes right out the door to trails and walked around town. Enjoyed having coffee and lunch on the terrace. Will certainly be back to this lovely home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great base for a week of gravel riding around Patagonia. The house was comfortable, well appointed and we liked the open floor plan and kitchen. Elorie was friendly and easy to communicate with. It is in a great location and it was so nice to be able to take the short walk down to Main Street for groceries or restaurants. We would definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! The place was clean and stocked with everything we needed. Can't wait to come back. Elorie was a great host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Elorie's place was fantastic for our week in Patagonia. Very clean and perfectly appointed, we were in need of nothing. Comfy bed, great living room, perfect kitchen and great patio area. We loved the location, easy walking distance to downtown but also just far enough away to be very quiet. We'll book Elorie's place again!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"On the plus side, Elorie was very good to work with, it is a lovely property, and the location is wonderful. The kitchen and dining area are very comfortable, the sink in the bathroom very usable, and the master bedroom very nice. On the negative side, the two window units were struggling to cool the whole place, the toilet is not seated properly and is in danger of cracking, the bedroom with the day bed has no air circulation, the bedroom with the ceiling fan has 2 twin beds that are literally 10.5‚Äù off the floor, the television worked for about 2 seconds at a time then froze, the threshold to enter the home is uneven and between the two smaller bedrooms there is a small step just high enough to trip someone. That being said, I am 77 years old and my friend is 86; we do not recommend this for elderly people, but for younger, fit folks it would be OK."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for a great experience.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay at Elorie‚Äôs place. It was very clean and comfortable. Easy walking distance to the main downtown area. Great communication from Elorie. Would highly recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My first Airbnb experience was flawless! The house was perfect for our needs, beyond clean and cozy, and a short walk to the heart of the town. Good suggestions in the guest book and will most likely book the same home in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time seeing the local sites and restaurants. The cottage was clean and comfortable for the two of us. We even walked to a couple of restaurants in the town.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elorie's place was the perfect home base for us as we went birdwatching and more in greater Patagonia. Definitely will stay here again next time we're back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we stayed here for our Daughter's swine show and let me tell you, this place is amazing!!! extremely clean cozy and very well stocked. we had a very busy weekend but couldn't wait to get back to the house to relax. The patio was amazing to just relax and decompress. Every bed in the house was extremely comfortable with great blankets and pillows. the kitchen was amazing to cook in. Overall Santa Rita cottage is the BEST air b&b we have stayed at!!!!! no traffic walking distance to downtown. The new AC is amazing it will freeze you out!!! We will definitely be staying here again when we just want a outing to explore and not have prior obligations that took up most our time. THANK YOU for opening up your sweet little cottage for us to enjoy.
Thank you again,
Amber, Shannon, Hayley, and little Capri Sun (the show pig)
P.S. Capri refused to drink water we had, we took her some from the hose off the patio, and she started drinking again!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful cottage and host! Elorie was incredibly gracious and understanding when my crew had a small mishap‚Ä¶ I also really appreciated her attention to detail and communication! I will absolutely come back because I spend so much time in southern Arizona!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Don't miss an opportunity to stay here for the 4th of July! Patagonia has the best small town parade and the fireworks are viewable from the back porch of this home! The free (donations welcome) museum of Patagonia is right up the hill from this house and accounts all the rich history of the town, really fun and informative trip, especially if you love all things western. The house fits right into the small town friendly feel, making the whole experience full circle. Elorie was wonderful to work with as we had a few hiccups with air conditioning. She was very accommodating and responsive, her handling of the situation and the overall experience of the town would bring us back in a heartbeat!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elorie,
Our family had a great stay in your home. I enjoyed all the special details, down to the books. Thank you for sharing your home with us. Looking forward to visiting again!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for our needs. House was as described and because the summer heat wasn‚Äôt fully in play and we were out most of the day, the non functional main air conditioner wasn‚Äôt as much of a problem but more an inconvenience. The host was notified but because it was a holiday weekend, repair could not be performed during our stay. Assuming the repair was completed, this home is a great place for visiting Patagonia and the surrounding southern Arizona locations."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great peaceful stay, would come again."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Elorie's. It was easy walking distance to downtown Patagonia. The bedrooms were very comfortable and there was nice outdoor space. We had a bit of trouble unlocking the door with an app, but Elorie was very helpful getting us in the house without much delay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a find this is! We loved staying at The Cottage on Santa Rita. It is clean, comfortable and so well appointed. Loved how bright, sunny and airy the space is. Elorie is a very responsive and a great host. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elorie's cottage is exactly as the photos show on the listing. It was wonderfully clean and uncluttered with every small detail attended to. It is very peaceful in a quiet neighborhood but only a five minute walk into Patagonia where there are many coffee shops, restaurants and shops. There is a sunny patio off the main bedroom with a view of the mountains. Elorie really is a super host and is very responsive. We would definitely return."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming house, very quiet, nicely furnished."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It‚Äôs been a pleasure to stay at Elorie‚Äôs place in this quaint town. The place is clean, charming and peaceful. I will definitely stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elorie's home is comfy and in an excellent location. We found it to be just as described and would stay there again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I really enjoyed our stay. We moved right in for the weekend! Fully stocked, large kitchen. Cozy main bedroom with a nice view. Walkable & easy to enjoy the town. Elorie was accommodating & responsive. We hope to return!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Elorie, her cottage and Patagonia were all great. Elorie was super proactive, helpful and definitely a super host. The cottage was clean, spacious with everything you need for some time away whether it be a night or a month. It was cutely decorated and a great base camp for exploring all the Patagonia area has to offer - just keep it a secret. ;)
I highly recommend Elorie and her cottage and I will definitely return."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, comfortable, and quiet. Great location, easy communication with prompt responses, and careful attention to detail. Thanks again to Elorie, for accommodating our last minute request and for sharing your beautifully appointed home!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elorie is a wonderful host who was easy to contact and immensely helpful before and during our stay. Great space with lots of natural light. Super clean and updated. Well-stocked kitchen which made making meals a breeze. Quiet and easily accessible. Great value. Perfect spot for multi-day biking adventures.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Exactly how described, would highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay and a great host. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful spot. I loved waking up in the morning and felt the peaceful privacy of the backyard area. It's surrounded by vegetation that feels totally zen. The kitchen has everything a person would need. I was able to walk everywhere. I had a few minor issues, and Elorie was extremely helpful and very responsive. I look forward to staying there again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"a beautiful, comfortable, and peaceful place and a wonderful little town. Loved being able to walk everywhere. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming and spotless house that feels like a real home. The kitchen is fully stocked with dishes and cookware, everything you'd need to cook. Very tastefully decorated without clutter, and it has an open plan that feels spacious. Besides the nice master bedroom, however, the sleeping arrangements were not so comfortable. There are two en-suite, small rooms off the great room that don't have doors and contain small beds suitable for children. No curtains on the double doors in the back room meant no privacy from the street. That was the only downside to this place. We enjoyed the location near downtown Patagonia's restaurants and stores, but it was also quiet. Our host, Elorie, was responsive and considerate. All in all, we had a good stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cottage at Santa Rita exceeded expectations. It was so charming and had everything that we needed. Elorie was immediately responsive to every inquiry. We can‚Äôt wait to return!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home! Clean and zen. We loved it!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, friendly atmosphere, welcoming town. Great gravel riding."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful and cozy spot! Walking distance to the Main Street and the Patagonia Lumber Co for drinks, quiet at all hours and amazing bike riding right out of the front door. Our stay was absolutely fantastic and we plan on coming back. If you are looking for a wonderful weekend getaway, this is the place to book."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful home combined with the excellent communication with Elorie has made my stay here exceptional! The space is cheery, sunny and beautifully decorated in a way that makes you feel like you're right at home. Close and easy walk to town, yet just far enough away that it‚Äôs peaceful and secluded feeling. The patio and cactus garden were a lovely spot to enjoy morning coffee and the kitchen is very well equipped. Great location, beautiful home and generous host. If you're lucky enough spend an extended stay in Patagonia, I can't imagine a better house to stay in!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay and right close to the places I needed to be. quite a quiet neighborhood, which was great"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An exceptional Airbnb home & host. Walking distance to the village of Patagonia, yet secluded & peaceful. Elorie is quick to answer questions, offer suggestions, incredibly kind, & has extraordinary taste! The home is filled with light and has Southwestern flair mixed with Mid-Century Modern design. Lovely book & game nook, large dining table, fully equipped kitchen, the master bedroom is elegant yet cozy including a heavenly mattress, high end linens, and opens onto the back deck. Unique artwork throughout, beautifully textured rugs, pillows, & furniture. Elorie has thought of everything to make you feel comfortable, cozy, and pampered. I can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else in Patagonia. This Airbnb is a treasure and my only disappointment was not having the opportunity to meet Elorie in person to thank her for an incredible stay.
Heather Tay ~ Tucson, Arizona"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing! The room had an incredibly cozy feel to it - it almost felt like we had a private garden all to ourselves. The location in Madera Canyon was also amazing - we saw Trogons every single day!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Madera Canyon is lovely and Chuparosa Inn is such a sweet space. We came for two days and never once got in the car!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as wonderful as last year with the added bonus of an elegant trogon on the premises.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a unique and beautiful spot. We were only there a short while and were off birding most of the time. When I book again, I will set time aside to enjoy the beautiful grounds. In the commons area, it was nice to talk to other travelers."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chuparosa is a stunning, custom-built home in the heart of the mountains. My stay was heavenly -- all that was promised and more.
I saw so many birds to add to my Life List, some from the front patio!
Luis is a superb host, very helpful and responsive. As suggested, I bought my food ahead of time at the Green Valley Safeway, and it made all the difference to me to be able to settle in and not come out of the canyon for three days. This is a home that is well-loved, and you can tell!
The feeling there is very special."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Luis' place is paradise! Great birding, hiking, beautiful surroundings, loved it! We'll be back!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came for my wife‚Äôs birthday especially to view the Elegant Trogon reported in the area and were not disappointed. A Trogon literally flew over us on the creekside patio on its way upstream for its dinner.
Our host and his family were welcoming and very knowledgeable about the area.
The unit is secluded, romantic and comfortable. We look forward to coming back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were happy to return for another stay. The room and bath are comfortable and well maintained. The kitchenette and bath are clean and the listed supplies are there. Everything from glasses to linens are well chosen. The inn itself is a wonderful location a short walk up to the entrance to Madera Canyon trails and the creek runs behind the property. The garden, feeders and stone patios complete the scene. We were warmly greeted by Nancy and Luis and they asked for feedback if everything was good for us. This place is a gem in the Sky Islands."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay there again! Many trails are close enough to walk to. The area around the inn has many birds. The suite we had was very clean. Luis gave us many suggestions for where to go and was happy to answer any questions. Very knowledgeable about the birds and was fun to talk with. Truly a lovely stay all around.Highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay!‚Äîsurely the most peaceful of the lodgings in Madera Canyon. My room was tidy and cheerfully appointed, the gardens were charming, and the common outdoor spaces were relaxing and very entertaining (thanks partly to the birds, including RIvoli's Hummingbird, Broad-billed Hummingbird, Acorn Woodpecker, Bridled Titmouse, Yellow-eyed Junco, Spotted Towhee, and Painted Redstart, and partly to a Coati, who took over a seed feeder one evening).
I enjoyed chatting with Luis and learning about the canyon, its seasons and its natural history."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Chuparosa. Nancy and Luis were helpful and responsive throughout our stay and made sure we were comfortable. This is a great place to stay while exploring Madera Canyon. It's in a beautiful natural setting and wildlife (especially birds) visited daily. We enjoyed the private patio of the Cowboy suite. We look forward to returning!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Luis has created a lovely spot in a fantastic location. He and Nancy are are gracious and welcoming.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay. Best hosts ever!! There was so much beauty and so many things to do. Luis gave fantastic tips and recommendations. We went bird watching of course, but also hiking and sightseeing.
Our room was clean, quiet, and cozy. The tap water is delicious. We appreciated all of it. We are telling all of our friends about it, and now some of them are planning their trips. I'm looking forward to visiting again in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described and great communication.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Madera Canyon. Birding on your doorstep
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An oasis is Arizona high country but easy to access just south of Tucson.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chuparosa Inn is a perfect spot for exploring Madera Canyon. The location is stunning and easily accessible to trailheads. The room is comfortable and well appointed. Luis was responsive, helpful, and friendly. Highly recommended."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Private and perfectly located at the end of Madera Canyon. We seldom saw anyone else during our walks and felt that we had the place to ourselves. Our unit was small, but it worked well for the two of us. Everything was very clean and beautifully designed, the bed was heaven."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The suite and surroundings were beautiful and just like described. It was walkable to hikes and you can just sit and relax at the inn and watch the wildlife. Luis was very responsive and helpful with questions. A wonderful short escape from urban life.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a sister reunion in February and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, beautiful furnishings and eye to detail. We had lunch on the patio across the creek, and continued bird watching as we ate there. Our host kept us informed of the option for early checkin. The lovely bird themed bedspread in the Birdnest Room was a favorite."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Birdnest is charming and located less than 100 m from the hiking trails in Madera canyon. It is an immersion in nature in a beautiful setting. Thank you Luis for the good advice, we will try to come back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Set in gorgeous Madera Canyon - where else would you want to be? A very short distance from any number of great hikes and nature trails and a cozy place to huddle in when the weather closes in. Luis was very responsive to my questions throughout the stay, too - much appreciated!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and peaceful accommodation in a beautiful setting. This was our third stay and we will be returning as soon as possible!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A truly amazing place to stay. Luis and Nancy are wonderful hosts and provided so much great information. The Inn itself is beautiful and so serene with wonderful patios and great amenities. We will definitely be returning in the Spring. If you are interested in staying in Madera Canyon this is by far the best accommodations.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful visit; the garden is amazing; Luis has been living there for a long time and knows the area very well; he could advise on trails, where to find birds, etc.
We enjoyed the starry nights and hope to be back next year for more birding."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little spot to escape the city.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The grounds were beautiful.. the room was cozy
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in search of nature therapy and that‚Äôs what I found‚Ä¶the variety of birds, the percussion band of acorn woodpeckers, the three near-invisible deer visitors, the playful squirrels and the eight gobblegobble turkeys were a joy to experience."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When nature calls‚Ä¶.this place is heaven. Honestly I‚Äôve never had a better BnB experience. I think Luis must pay the wildlife, because they loiter around the property like it‚Äôs their career. The viewing experience was almost overwhelming. ‚Ä¶.all from the comfort of my private patio. Next to the Amazon, this is the closest to a naturalist‚Äôs pilgrimage I‚Äôve seen. The place is so beautiful even the nature trails must bend to its serenity: with access to multiple trails though a ‚Äúsecret gate‚Äù. Luis and Nancy are the consummate hosts and made me feel like welcome company more then guests, and gave me the skinny on all the intricate curiosities of their lovely space. To experience this place is to experience a glimpse of the meaning of life. There should be more stars available to review on this app, there weren‚Äôt enough! Thank you for the hospitality and grace, and for sharing the good life with me for the long weekend. I will be back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I had an amazing weekend. The location was perfect for hiking. The cabin offered a variety of options to disconnect from electronics and enjoy a relaxing weekend in nature. Luis and Nancy were amazing hosts!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have been guests at this location in the past. We love the peace of the locations, the wildlife and birds and the short distance to other trails and scenic areas. Great place to unwind a little."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Chuparosa was delightful. A great escape from the desert heat. Wildlife was plentiful and hiking right out door.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place to spend time in Madera Canyon!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Thank you so much for your kind hospitality! We would definitely book again if we are ever in the area.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Birdnest has a nice small private patio, in addition to all the other ""common"" patios."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Difficult to add much to the many glowing reviews from previous guests. In our experience, the Birdnest Suit was spotlessly clean, comfortable and included everything needed for an enjoyable stay. The shower worked great and the ""mini-kitchenette"" contained the essentials. The European-style under-counter fridge was relatively quiet and worked well. While we were happy to make do with the provided microwave and toaster, a small toaster oven would have been nice. Communication from Luis was first-rate. Valuable information and instructions were provided well ahead of our visit and I'm sure that had we had any questions or problems he would have taken care of them right away. In summary, the Chuparosa House offers a unique, comfortable and idyllic retreat where you can relax and connect with nature. We really enjoyed our visit and would not hesitate to return."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time hiking and exploring area. Loved birding in the yard!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Chuparosa Airbnb is a birder's dream. At approx 5400' elev in a magnificent sky island canyon, the site is a verdant oasis for birds and wildlife. The owners have bird feeders and water features everywhere which keeps the birds there all day. Hiking, birding and relaxing in beautiful surrounds are what Chuparosa has to offer."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cuparosa Inn is the best place to stay when going to Madera Canyon for the fabulous birding that it offers. Luis is a great host - great communication with good suggestions and very willing to meet the needs of the guests. The property is beautiful with many bird feeders to attract the local hummingbirds and seed eaters. If you stay in the Canyon, your best food option is likely to shop at the Super Market that is in Green Valley and on the way about a half hour from the place. There was a microwave in our room and a gas grill on the paito. We easily grilled meat and vegis and used the microwave for potatoes. If the weather is right, you can eat it all on the patio under Luis‚Äô beautiful outdoor chandelier to the sound of the Whip-Poor-Wills. Pure heaven!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a beautiful sanctuary in the woods. It was so lovely. I enjoyed my stay very much and would love to come back one day.
Leanne"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location at the top of Madera Canyon
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time to Chuparosa. This place is so amazing, and we feel so lucky to enjoy the natural beauty there. Everything was absolutely wonderful! we'll be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely decor, many nice little touches like breakfast bars, books about Madera Canyon, everything seemed new, very pleasant to sit creek side listening to it and the birds, saw wild turkey and a coatimundi right by my patio bird feeder, nice trails nearby. I called Luis about a checkin question and he answered right away. Beautiful rock garden with periwinkle everywhere, architecturally creative and beautiful."
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in the Birdsnest room. The room was very nice and the grounds are incredible. Our issue was the noise that came from our refrigerator and from the hosts upstairs. Both nights I was abruptly waken up at 3am because that is what time the folks upstairs get up. There was a lot of noise. the shower door slamming shutting, some banging noises on counters, water and footsteps and talking. It sounded like it was right above us. It kept me and my husband up for an hour and a half each night. It ruined a good nights sleep. For this reason I would stay in Green Valley at an airbnb were there would be just us."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay there. Such a beautiful location and a comfortable room. My one issue was figuring out parking. I arrived in the dark and all the spots next to the building wete taken. A man standing nearby said I could move a cone and park across the street. When I got out to move the cone another car backed out and struck my rental car. Luckily the damage was minor and the agency didn't notice it.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at the Chuparosa Inn. We had a private patio and the common areas were beautiful. Luis was very knowledgable of the local area and full of information and tips. We would definitely recommend this spot and stay here again! We had the smallest acommodations available there and would most likely upgrade to a slightly larger room.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at La Chuperosa. The surroundings were beautiful. We enjoyed our private patio, as well as the common areas and barbecue. The birdfeeders drew birds in so that we could comfortably sit and watch the hummingbirds at close range.
Luis was very helpful throughout the process from the time we made the reservation to when we checked in. He was there to greet us and show us around. He also offered suggestions for things to do in the area.
We highly recommend La Chuparosa"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will be back
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, lots of birds, lots of bird feeders
Access to trails very good.
Very small space in the studio.
Not much room in the kitchenette- what I call a 1/2 butt kitchen! The BBQ grill was clean and there is a selection of grilling utensils.
Owner responsive to requests.
Not a great value for the money, but you‚Äôre paying the Madera Canyon and AirBnB premiums."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and common area. BBQ was helpful given the remote Madera Canyon location
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect! The location was ideal, private and peaceful, and a short work to so many trails in Madera Canyon. I loved having a private garden, and my own bird feeders to watch! The interior was perfect, clean and neat, aesthetically pleasing, the bed was super comfy, and the owners thought of all the little things that make a stay so easy and calm, like bathroom hooks in just the right place and extra blankets. I hope to return in the warmer months so that I can enjoy the beautiful decks that are decorated with delightful handmade art, and set right near the stream that runs through the property. What a wonderful place!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Lovely being next to the rushing stream and among the wildlife.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a couple f nights in the Birdnest Suite and found it to be the perfect location for accessing the trails in Madera Canyon. The patio and garden were nice spots to relax and read up on all of the wildlife we had encountered that day. A great space with everything we needed for our stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location is part of the value here. We hiked to the top of wrightson peak from our door and were at the center of the birding hotspot along Madura creek.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place for bird lovers, hikers and naturalists. We really enjoyed this ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Luis is a wonderful host! We are planning a return trip in the fall - everything about this inn is amazing!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thought the decor was very pleasing. We enjoyed seeing birds right outside our window. Plenty of electrical outlets. We liked the fact the space had been heated before our arrival. Very nice!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing and wonderful, would love to stay again. Its so peaceful."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little gem!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You will want to stay in the Birdnest room because you have a private area to sit and watch the birds and also a gate to the wilderness behind that they lovingly made attractive to the birds and guests. There is a gate to the walking trails of Madera Canyon and another sitting area by the creek. Loved it. The Managers were very friendly and helpful with information on the area. I really appreciated her stopping and talking with us. Thank you
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful. Garden so beautiful with feeders galore.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a very pleasant stay in the BIRD NEST suite. Very clean. Located in the heart of Madera Canyon, we enjoyed the variety of birds seen from the private patio. We even saw a coati stroll by. Would recommend if peace and quiet in a beautiful natural environment is what you desire. Hope to return someday."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a nature lover‚Äôs paradise. It has been cared for with love and passion. The owner is friendly and responsive. If we return to Madera Canyon we will want to stay here again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing and relaxing place. The property was gorgeous cabin nestled in the woods with a small creek and multiple water features. Great place to unwind, relax and soothe the soul"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. A little pricey for what you get. But the location can't be beat. The water was running and it had rained recently so very green.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about it. Hope to be back again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and unique property. It's a lovely place to enjoy the canyon.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chuparosa Inn is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Madera Canyon! The host Luis is very communicative and stays in touch. We stayed in the Bird's Nest which faces the street; it's a cute room and very clean. If you'd like more privacy choose the Hummingbird or Cowboy room since they're on the back of the property and more private. We hiked and took lots of birds photos. We also saw a bear cub near the property but never felt afraid. Just be aware while you're outside. The grill came in handy since we like to make eggs in the morning and the rooms don't have a stove. We brought our own cast iron skillet since we were driving from NM which also came in handy for grilling steaks one night. Chuparosa was a wonderful place!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had the most incredible stay at the Chuparosa Inn. It was a little bit out of my price range, but I decided to splurge and it was well worth it for me for the privacy of this magical canyon garden.
I went to Madera Canyon for a few days of birding because I had never experienced SE Arizona during Monsoon season and wanted to familiarize myself with breeding birds in the area. I was the only guest staying there and had the pleasure of hearing an Elegant Trogon every morning and Mexican whip-poor-will and Whiskered Screech-Owls every evening. The property is perfectly designed to sit in peace and observe birds moving through the canyon.
I stayed in the Bird's Nest room and it was clean and cozy with a very comfortable bed. The kitchenette includes a coffee maker and microwave.
My favorite part about the stay was that I could come back after a long morning of birding and keep birding while resting on a reclining chair, porch swing, or amazing sitting rock on the slope of the property. It was the perfect way to soak up the bird life of Madera Canyon.
Luis was super responsive and welcoming and self check-in was easy. 10 out of 10 would recommend the Chuparosa Inn!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This places was pure magic! It‚Äôs very quiet and it‚Äôs hard to not be relaxing! There‚Äôs a beautiful chair swing, seating area everywhere, and an amazing grill for delicious means."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is no other place we would rather stay than the Chuparosa Inn. It is a comfortable, clean and relaxing place to unwind. The washer and dryer in the Trogon Suite was a great amenity, but all of the amenities included were more than enough to meet our needs. The home itself is incredibly charming with a whimsical and unique character and beautiful grounds. The suites have their own private patios, so you really do feel like you have the place to yourselves. We can not wait to return!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot at the top of Madera canyon. Comfortable bed and super clean. Perfect for a quick nature trip to AZ!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,simply put. it's a magical place
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a special place. Great location and beautiful bird-friendly landscaping.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in the Bird Nest Suite. Luis helped us with our reservation. When we arrived we were greeted by Diana who gave us a helpful orientation to the grounds, recycling bins, etc. The room/suite was compact but comfortable. It was wonderful to be in the middle of nature and to hear the whippoorwills every evening. From our room we could see birds in the yard. A bonus is that the Chuparosa Inn is very close to the Carrie Nation trail along which Elegant Trogons are seen. We had great views of a male trogon two days in a row!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Web site is pretty accurate
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Chuparosa Inn is peaceful & magical! Highly highly recommend!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, wonderful hikes and birding."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chuparosa is one of our favorite inns anywhere in the US. It is really special.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fabulous place to take a break from reality. Easy access to trails. The grounds are gorgeous, shared outdoor areas fantastic for kicking back to read or birdwatch. Luis is a font of local knowledge. And the elegant trogon stopped by each morning for a brief visit. Such a treat."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent property! Lovely patios!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I highly recommend. We had a great visit with many new birds!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Please repeat what we said in the private review
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit to this lovely inn in a birding & hiking paradise. The rooms are themed and everything you might need is provided as each has a little kitchenette. You can cook your meals there. There is also a very large patio with BBQ and the upper patio has a fabulous iron chandelier made by the owner - such ambiance in the evenings. And birds - lots of birds! And turkeys, and ringtails and racoons oh myüòÑ"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a birding paradise. The yard is full of birds and other wildlife. We had a very comfortable suite for two people. Also quite clean. We were there when the water pipe for many of the homes in Madera Canyon broke. Luis quickly made sure we all had plenty of bottled water to take care of our needs.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled away from the canyon traffic and camping areas, the Chuparosa Inn is a quiet sanctuary to enjoy and unwind. The hosts are engaged and accessible and the property is comfortable. We use the property as home base for our birding outings! We truly enjoy this property and cannot wait until our next visit!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great restful place !
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay for some time away! We stayed in the Bird‚Äôs Nest with a veery private patio and direct access to the Secret Garden. Peaceful, restful, soul refreshing stay in the perfect setting of the Coronado National Forest. We‚Äôre planning our next stay!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Bird‚Äôs Nest. Nestled in the middle of Madera Canyon, we were within walking distance to all hiking and picnic areas. The patio/birdwatching areas are hands-down the best part of this inn. We enjoyed several hours each night relaxing and watching the wildlife. Luis greeted us immediately when we checked in, and gave us a tour/directions. He also gave us helpful advice about best hiking trails for birdwatching."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting and wonderful birds. Bed comfortable.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful! Perfect place and Luis was so helpful in helping us get oriented to the area. Hope to return soon
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice location and friendly, helpful owner/operators. Heads up that they are responsive but not immediately onsite. With phone carrier ATT, we had no cell service almost as soon as we entered the canyon.
Also, in addition to the room, the outdoor space is really lovely but in the event of inclement weather, there is not a common indoor space--so less of an Inn and more of a nice room in a spectacular location. With those caveats, would stay again and recommend to others."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. We saw lots of wildlife and had a great time being outdoors. inside, the hot water is a 10! The patio and bbq is a 10! The swing is an 11!!! We enjoyed ourselves so much we will definitely be back. Thank you"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Bird's Nest was a perfect home base in Madera Canyon. It's a sweet small private studio, basically a bed, a kitchenette, and a bathroom, with views of the garden / feeder. We watched a Coatimundi from the bed our first day there! Recommend thinking through what food you should bring, because you won't want to leave to go shopping. The kitchen is as described, the grill is powerful. Luis responded promptly and kindly to all inquiries. The location in Madera Canyon is, of course, entirely unbeatable. This was my first time back there since 1994, and it is still a magical place."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place, accommodations so comfortable, private and necessary amenities. Definitely 5 star for us!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely room and location!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful setting with a very charming inn with lots of character. I would highly recommend it.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chuparosa Inn is absolutely wonderful. The care and attention to detail that the owners put into creating it was astounding. We loved the wrought iron fencing, the birdhouses set into the rock wall, the magnificent outdoor chandelier and deck, the handmade ceramic signs with the room names, the hanging bat ornaments, and all the bird feeders. The location in the canyon is perfect, the whole property is just magical, and we could not have enjoyed it more! The room was also very comfortable and impeccably clean, and Luis was excellent at communication. We have already recommended it to friends!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a delightful and relaxing stay at the Chuparosa Inn. Our room was charming and was as described. The inn is nestled in the woods beside a running stream with many birds and other wildlife around. A bridge takes you across the stream to a patio and common seating area to enjoy being in nature. It is a peaceful and private property with several beautiful nooks and areas to sit and read or observe the surroundings, and it also has easy access to hiking trails. Luis is a communicative and helpful host. I highly recommend staying at this lovely oasis in the woods and will certainly return."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was a really amazing property just minutes from Tubac. Situated on a hill to the west of town, this house has just amazing views of the Santa Cruz Valley. It's a pretty unique house - basically two separate apartments which share a pool and patio. One half is a two bedroom, two bath with full kitchen, dining area and family room and the other half is a one bedroom, one bath again with a full kitchen and living area. Open the patio doors and you can go between the two sides easily, but also you can have a lot of privacy between the two units. The pool and hot tub were really nice - simple to operate and there's even a full sauna! Watching the moon rise over the mountains while sitting out on the patio was just great!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the start, Alex communicated effectively and in a timely manner. He was flexible with check-in and had the premises in good condition for us. He was extremely knowledgeable about the local scene and many different things to do. The space was comfortable and relaxing with a stunning natural landscape. I would absolutely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"On behalf of the bride and bridal party, we'd like to offer tremendous thanks to Tubac Property for allowing us to create such a special memory at this beautiful desert escape. As any typical bachelorette party, we kept the location a surprise. The bride entered the home with a blindfold and was smiling cheek to cheek not knowing what stood before her. Upon removal of the blindfold, her face became flushed and eyes were filled with tears as we greeted her with a confetti gun and a ""Bride to Be"" sash. It was the reaction we all wanted! Then began the tour of the property and everyone was stunned at the beauty, tranquility, and privacy of the home and especially the pool, jacuzzi, and fire pit area! The host made our stay all the more wonderful by ensuring we had everything we needed for a successful 3-day bachelorette getaway from essentials to a full propane tank for our steak dinner. I look forward to reserving future stays at this incredible BnB!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The houses were so nice and the pool and hot tub prestine. Great location - 2 min drive to town. Every room was clean without clutter. Host was very responsive and helpful. I cannot wait to visit again!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great property with postcard views. Nice amenities ( pool, spa, and sauna). Host was very accommodating. Our children and grandchildren really enjoyed our stay."

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely the Best view of Tubac.
High elevation Sunset üåÖ
So many views throughout large glass doors.
Beautifully curated outdoor and indoors !
I will be back‚Ä¶.loved this hilltop paradise."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great and just as important the host was super responsive! Our 2 kiddos had a great time in the pool and the view is unmatched.
Thank you for having us!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was amazing and the view was wonderful! Having the pool/spa/sauna was a plus for sure. We spent a lot of time outdoors enjoying all the home had to offer. Host was very responsive and helpful. Would go back in the future.
One thing I think is important to know is that you are not able to get to the Master bedroom through the main house. You have to go outside just a couple steps to enter back into the home. This was more like a in-law suite, which can be great when traveling with another couple but not as good traveling with children.
Overall the view it has to offer and the outside space was wonderful!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This property is outstanding and the views are better than what the pictures look like! If anyone is looking for an Arizona escape it‚Äôs amazing!! Thank you Alex!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was awesome from check in to check out. Sharon was very quick to respond to any questions we had. The view is absolutely beautiful. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll stay here again. Great host!

If we're back in the area, we'll be happy to come back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I along with our small dog stayed for five nights. Everything and anything anyone could need was in the condo. The condo was beautifully decorated with many caring touches. The view from the back patio was magnificent! If you are looking for peace and quiet, I highly recommend Sharon‚Äôs place. Would definitely stay again if in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,The view of the Santa Ritas is a highlight. Comfortable and well equipped in a quiet community. Really enjoyed the Rec Center's pool and hot tub/spa. Lots of options for walking and hiking. Host was helpful and responsive. We look forward to our next visit.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Vista Flamenco. It is well located, easy to get around, not too far from I-19. The neighborhood is very quiet and the people seem very pleasant.
Sharon was very responsive to all our questions and needs. We appreciated that you provided an ample supply of paper products, and a nice kitchen with adequate supplies of utensils. We especially appreciated being able to bring our dog who enjoyed the walks around Desert Hills 2.
We think your place is great and would recommend it to others."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic place!!! From the moment we walked in, we felt the comfort and cleanliness of home. Highlights were the view from the patio (breathtaking!), the spa shower, the Southwest decor, the comfortable furniture, and the safe and quiet location. I‚Äôd highly recommend a stay at Sharon‚Äôs. The ‚Äòvibe‚Äô can‚Äôt be beat!!"

It was a perfect place for our family to stay for a long weekend of birding in Madera and Patagonia. The house has plenty of places to sit and relax both inside and outside. Well stocked kitchen and comfy beds. We felt right at home. Ken was very responsive and provided excellent check in / check out instructions.
The views from the house are beautiful, and the birding just around the house / nature trail is fantastic. Would definitely stay here again next time we‚Äôre in the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything we needed to live in the home was provided such as kitchen utensils to bathroom towels.

The somewhat remote setting is far from the hustle and bustle of city-life, but an easy drive to Green Valley for groceries and restaurants. We spent the entire month of March at Alex's place. There were no issues and everything worked great! The kitchen was stocked with most everything needed for cooking at home, which we did a lot. There are many windows in the well-lit main dining/ living rooms, and great for watching birds and critters. We rode our bikes on low-traffic roads nearly everyday right from the house. We had a lot of fun. You can't beat Southern AZ's weather in the spring!"

The wifi was very fast and efficient. The heating system was easy to operate and we needed it for the first few nights! Having a washer and dryer was amazing and very useful. What else can I say? Just that Alex‚Äôs place is the best place to stay in the Amado/Green Valley area, and he is a very responsive host. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a great base for our birding activities in the area. It was very quiet, and out in nature. Skies were dark at night and stars amazing."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Alex‚Äôs place, and we really enjoy it. It‚Äôs a good home base for us while visiting parent in Green Valley. It feels very separate without being too far away. The space is really well set up and comfortable. They were very quick and responsive to questions. Hope we can stay again when we visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was dog friendly, clean, peaceful and we felt right at home. Beds were comfortable and heater was set so we always felt nice and warm during the cold weather. Alex was really responsive and pleasant to talk to when we met him. I would definitely re-book at his place. Loved the garden patio! Very clean! Very peaceful!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Alex was a great host. The house has a lovely, open floor plan for the living spaces, and privacy for the bedrooms and baths. Beds were very comfortable, as was the furniture. The washer and dryer worked great, as did all other appliances. Artwork and other appointments in the rooms was appropriate and enhanced the space. We decided we'd like to stay on for a couple more nights, and Alex was able to accommodate our request. He was quick to respond to any questions we had. The area is quiet and peaceful, with excellent proximity to the workshop we had on Eagle Drive. The telescope was closed, but the night skies were so dark and clear that we were able to enjoy some starwatching as well. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cle√†n and peaceful.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was like a little get away.
peaceful and super comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, spacious and quiet‚Ä¶Alex‚Äôs place was perfect for us. Extremely responsive host and perfect location for our needs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place out in the desert if you want some peace and quiet. Easy drive to La Posada if you have family there. Nicely appointed, comfy master bed (did not use 2nd bedroom). Lots of light. Beautiful garden/courtyard outside house. Would definitely stay again. Alex is super nice host."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Alex is a great host. Very nice location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Look forward to staying here next year.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Perfect place to stay if you are wanting some privacy.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and private out of town but close to town.
Everything was in order and clean.
All the kitchen supplies you would need to cook and get by with a nice frig with door service water/ice.
When you got used to all the light switches and ceiling fan operations, we were so comfortable in our weekend getaway. Made ourself at home with no bother, but attention by Alex immediately when a mishap occurred that was handled urgently with no problem. He was very pleasant and available for anything if needed.
The morning rooster was pleasant to us, different reaction than previous reviews. Natural trees and plants, watching the quail family, hummingbirds, butterflies and cardinal from the living room window was so serene.
Total recommendation."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this lovely home. We were in the area to do birding in Madera Canyon. It was about 20 minutes drive to the grocery store in Green Valley and about 20 min to get to Madera Canyon. That being said there were lots of birds right outside the house. Alex had a humming bird feeder outside the living room window as well as a flowering bush. We were disappointed not to find a sports channel on the TV. Maybe it was there but we couldn't find it. We did find a rare bird (Rufous-winged sparrow) very close to the house. Also, Montosa Canyon was close by and we were able to find the Five-striped sparrow there. One morning the rooster woke us up which if you want to sleep late might be an issue. We recommend a visit to Desert Meadows Park in Green Valley. We spotted a Costa Hummingbird there."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at Alex‚Äôs place. If you want to get away from it all, Alex‚Äôs place is perfect. It is a peaceful oasis surrounded by trees that attract so many birds. The house itself is extremely comfortable and clean, with windows that look out on the trees and the private patio. We were sad to leave and hope we can stay there again. Thank you, Alex, for being a great host!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed having lots of birds including hummingbirds right our our window. The place is quiet and has easy access for hiking in the Santa Rita Mountains. The living space is clean and comfortable. We will return.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lovely place in the country
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Alex's place. Birds, deer, great windows, comfy beds, open plan. I definately want to go back."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay. Alex was very helpful. Would highly recommend. Beautiful place.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Alex‚Äôs place has great water which is hard to find in the desert. No need to buy any. It is located on a large parcel with a walking trail right out of the gate. The house is well built with lots of space. It is a bit of a drive from town but worth it for the peace of the rural setting. Plenty of wild life to enjoy, javelinas, coyotes, quail, cardinals, and many other birds. It was a short drive to many trails that we enjoyed. I had fun making friends with his goats, I fed them my produce scraps. Mama goat is expecting a baby in January. Alex had almost eliminated the rooster problem by the time we left. Alex is very friendly and quick to respond. Would definitely stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,We have really enjoyed our first month here at Alex‚Äôs place. We are transitioning from Alaska to the more populated Arizona. This was a great place to do that. The house is very rural with lots of space. Alex is always quick to respond and a very nice man to deal with. We are looking forward to our second month stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Alex is very responsive. House is perfect and great location. Will definitely stay again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect place to stay for a week-long visit to the area. Well equipped kitchen, nice big shower and the soaking tub is just what the doctor ordered. Wifi worked flawlessly. Covered parking is a great touch. I hope I can snag this place again next time I‚Äôm out there."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place in an awesome location
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house. Clean, remote. Note: no internet there yet so have to use mobile hot spot."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The bed in the master bedroom was the most comfortable bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. Property is beautiful with lots of birds that you can watch out of an expansive wall of windows. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with a quiet setting. Expect to be greeted by beautiful desert landscape and a few adorable farm friends, a couple of goats and an alpaca. I would definitely stay again!!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was wonderful!! Alex was so easy to work with. It was a nice quiet area. Very relaxing!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alex is a great host! The place is clean, comfortable, and provides a home like feeling. Price is right and communication is excellent. You won't be disappointed!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is in somewhat remote location (which we new and wanted). Molly warns renters of this and advises them to shop before arriving. However, even though we came prepared, the cabin was pretty well stocked. Although, we didn't need them, there were things like spare batteries and light bulbs."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cabin, stayed for 6 nights. Spacious, very well equipped, comfortable and a superb location in Madera Canyon. If you love wildlife you will love this place. Bird feeders provided, Coati seen from the balcony and both Elf and Whiskered Screech Owls around the property. Molly was brilliantly responsive and super helpful."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you Molly for sharing your place. We had a wonderful time in Madera Canyon and hope to come back again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our stay at Molly‚Äùs Creekside Cabin was wonderful, the only downside was that we couldn‚Äôt stay longer!
Madera Canyon is truly one of the most magical and special places on earth and what better way to experience it than waking up surrounded by quiet, relaxing beauty every morning!
Thank you Molly"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing location ‚Äî close to stunning scenery, spectacular birds and other wildlife, and great hiking. Cabin was perfect ‚Äî a well-stocked and modern kitchen, clean and comfortable living spaces, and a sizable deck off of the bedroom. Bird feeders provided! We visited for a week but could have stayed longer ‚Äî so peaceful and relaxing! Molly was an excellent host, providing clear communication, and was extremely responsive to our emails. Overall, a terrific, five-star experience!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our third time staying here so I think that speaks for itself. Will return again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Molly‚Äôs place. It was a wonderful place to relax and the hummingbird watching was amazing. We loved the secluded location and the family history of the property. Molly is super responsive and friendly.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our third time at Molly's place and we are looking forward to returning soon!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the second time that we stayed at Molly's place. We are perhaps unusual ""tourists"" because we stay there because of quick access to desert locations where we do research on insects. This year was particularly good because the greater rainfall resulted in a large diversity of flowers in the desert (great for the bees and wasps that we study). The place is a nice base for our work, so we hope to return next year, especially if Molly can arrange for plenty of rainfall again :)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place for hikers and birders!
The deck is great for bird watching. Molly provided bird feeders with seed and also sugar for the hummingbird feeder. We got to see birds come and take up close pix!
Extremely close to all hikes in the Mt. Wrightston parking area, make sure you bring good hiking shoes.
The cabin was welcoming and it had everything you needed!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely magical place in the middle of Madera Canyon. Very comfortable home with so many lovely little amenities. The description says ""fully stocked kitchen"" and they meant it! Kitchen had lots of pots and pans and everything you could possibly need.
Best of all, they provided a generous amount of birdseed and lots of feeders! Black-headed grosbeak, Arizona woodpecker, various hummingbirds, and tons of acorn woodpeckers and Mexican jays! We sat in the bedroom or on the deck and watched the birds when we weren't out hiking watching the birds. The house is right near the trailheads, closest to the Super trail but also very close to Carrie Nation Mine Trail.
Molly was super communicative and really helped us big-time in our planning -- I had mentioned to her that we wanted to drive up in our RV and she warned me against that due to the steep and narrow road up to the house. I'm so glad that thanks to her we got a rental car; our RV would never have made that road. Thanks again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We totally enjoyed our stay in the red cabin at the end of the road. There was a nice flow to the creek in late March. If you are a bird lover, this is the place for you. We shared the views with many friendly hikers along the trails."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay. Quiet, beautiful and so peaceful. Birdwatching from the back deck was so fun.
As warned we had no cell reception at the cabin (Verizon network). Wifi took care of most of our communication needs. We had reception with a 10 minute walk or even faster drive."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Molly is a fabulous host and this cabin is extremely cozy. The location is unbeatable.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Molly‚Äôs place is lovely, very quiet. We‚Äôre glad we stayed there. I‚Äôm also glad I got there before dark or it would have been difficult to find. Molly provided detailed instructions and information about the road/driveway but I‚Äôm glad I drive an all wheel drive vehicle. Lots of excellent hiking and bird watching in the area."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We spent two weeks at this wonderful little cabin along the creek with an up-close view of Mt. Wrightson. I have worked in hospitality for forty years, so I am critical. This cabin was clean, organized and was stocked with all necessities, including bird seed. All we had to do was bring our groceries and settle in. Our dog and I went on many walks enjoying the running water, wildlife, birds and scenery. Much of our time was spent on the deck overlooking the creek. I would highly recommend this cabin. There is no doubt‚Äîwe will be back. That‚Äôs a promise. Thank you very much for sharing this piece of paradise."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely cabin, well appointed with a deck that looks over the creek which was running while we were there. It has everything you need, including food to feed birds and hummingbirds. I would not want to take my Prius on the road in because it's rough, but for most cars would be okay. Molly is a very responsive host. Have stayed at her other property as well."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a fantastic location and very comfortable cabin. The driveway isn‚Äôt for everyone. We have a Subaru Outback and had no problems.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Molly's place was wonderful. Even though it faced the road to the nearby picnic area, the location was generally quiet. Birding was great, with 5 species of hummingbirds spotted on the deck (and two others elsewhere in the area, along with Whiskered screech owls and Whip-poor-wills calling at night). Other common birds viewed from the deck were Bridled titmice, Acorn woodpeckers, Mexican jays, Yellow-eyed juncos, and Blackheaded grosbeaks. The deck also overlooks a ""stream"" that was mostly dry during our stay, but there were a few small ""puddles"" full of interesting insects (we are entomologists). Many places to hike in the area, and Box Canyon Road and Florida Wash were beautiful. The lodging itself was clean and comfortable, with a nice kitchen."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in the heart of Madera Canyon. Very nice cabin with modern kitchen.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a wonderful location at the south end of Madera Canyon. We loved this well-equipped and comfortable cabin and birding from the veranda. The driveway is a bit tricky, easier if you have a higher clearance car but possible with a regular sedan. We hired a local birding guide one day which made a big difference. Molly is an attentive and kind host."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The experience was everything we expected and way more. Location [s everything and this place has it in every way. We watched a Trogon off the deck while drinking coffee. The kitchen has everything you could ever need, and the furnishings are excellent. We would recommend this place to our family and best friends."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a peaceful getaway! Right up close to the trails and creek, but away from the hub bub. I will be back."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place.
Location is awesome for people interested in Madera Canyon hiking."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was great. Very comfortable and nicely furnished. Everything you could want. Walk from cabin to many beautiful nearby trails. The driveway might be challenging for some cars with a low ground clearance. We had no trouble at all with a Subaru Outback even after a significant rain. Can‚Äôt wait to return.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house is in one of the most wonderful locations in southeast Arizona. It is beautifully furnished, and there is everything you could possibly want in the kitchen. An added plus is the bird feeders and bird food available to make your own feeding station. Hiking trails are accessible right out the door."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We may have been the first people to stay in Molly's magical cabin since its beautiful remodel. The wooden cabinets, bright draperies, granite countertops, and modern bath and kitchen, were a wonderful surprise in this cozy cabin set immediately adjacent to the National Wilderness at the top of the Madera Canyon Rd. Sitting on the shady balcony we watched the daily visits of coati to drink from the creek, numerous deer, and a brilliant array of birds, ranging from Wild Turkey and Montezuma Quail to woodpeckers, grossbeaks and a variety of hummingbirds. The Trailheads are just a short walk away, so we didn't need to use the car all week. Molly is a great communicator, responding rapidly to any questions. This is a fabulous place for a retreat."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay there was very comfortable. We got inside easily, the place was super cute, and there were several places to hike nearby. Being able to use the grill was a nice touch. Great trip all round, thanks!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at The Chuparosa Inn and definitely won't be our last! We finally got to see an Elegant Trogon. Luis is a great host and very knowledgeable of all the local wildlife and birds in particular. The Inn is always very well presented and it is easy to feel at home here. We can't wait for our next visit!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Chuparosa was truly a birder‚Äôs paradise. We got in late so it was pitch black when we arrived, but we could hear the bustling stream nearby. When we woke up, it was as magical as I had imagined. Birds everywhere. Idyllic and relaxing! The grounds are kept pristine and the staff is friendly and responsive. There are so many great spots to capture photographs and endless options for hiking and viewing nature. I‚Äôd love to come back again and get even more for my life list. And, my last day I got the Elegant Trogon about 100‚Äô from the driveway. It was perfect. Thanks Luis!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, well-equipped apartment in a beautiful setting with abundant wildlife. Hosts went the extra mile for us, particularly when we had a health issue crop up. They stepped up like family. Can‚Äôt imagine a better experience."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our two night stay was tremendous. We were there to relax and do some hiking and casual bird watching. I understand many people come to Madera canyon for its world class birding. Much to our good fortune we spotted an Elegant Trogon right from the patio outside our room !!! Wow!!!
Luis and Nancy were onsite during our stay and tremendous hosts, providing all kinds of pertinent information to ourselves and the other guests. I would highly recommend Chuparosa Inn for a relaxing stay in Madera Canyon."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,La Chuparosa is a magic place and Luis is a great host!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chuparosa Inn is everything we hoped for and more. Cannot think of one single negative. Luis was a wealth of local information about the area. He and his wife, Nancy were so friendly and we enjoyed spending some time with them. The Inn itself is amazing and the story of how it became what it is, is a wonderful story. Although we live 2,000 miles away we will go back again. A hiker and birdwatcher wonderland!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another fantastic stay at the Chuparosa Inn! Luis is the perfect host, and the location and amenities are the absolute best. A marvelous romantic getaway from the hustle and bustle of our everyday lives."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Luis and his place were great. I highly recommend staying at his place and hope to do so again in the future.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and the help looking for places to birds was very helpful. Everything I wanted.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chuparosa Inn is quickly becoming our home away from home! We knew that we would come back, but didn‚Äôt realize that we would be coming back two weeks after our first stay, thanks to family who were visiting from Texas and wanted to see what all of our rave reviews were about!! We ‚Äúlet‚Äù them stay in the Trogon Suite, because we wanted to try something new! This time we stayed in the Hummingbird Suite! It was extremely clean and well stocked! We were very comfortable! We didn‚Äôt spend much of our time inside, though. Luis and Nancy have done an exceptional job decorating and furnishing the outside of the property, and we preferred to spend most of our time there. It is very peaceful and fun to watch the birds and other wildlife! Our first night we were visited by eight wild turkeys! We were fortunate to have met Luis and Nancy on our first visit to the Chuparosa Inn. Even though they were not on the property this time, Luis was quick to respond to any questions that I had!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The lodge was clean and comfortable. Luis the host was responsive, polite and infomative when we needed his input. Al went very well and we were pleased."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Third times a charm! Love this place! Close to hiking, wildlife, great amenities & relaxing atmosphere with all the hummingbirds buzzing around, pretty flowers and other birds and even have spotted the elegant trogon in the creek. We‚Äôll be back to escape the Tucson heat! Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property!! Nancy was there to show us around when we arrived. Luis was very helpful. We enjoyed visiting with both of them! We were very comfortable in the Trogon Suite! We were happy to have a full-sized kitchen so that we could prepare our meals. The grounds are pretty and tastefully decorated. We sat outside as much as we could! We especially enjoyed watching the birds! We also saw deer, a skunk, a bobcat, and bats! Fun! SO relaxing and peaceful! I knew that our two night stay would be too short!! We will visit again soon!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Luis was very friendly and informative about the history of the area, the birds, bats and other animals and plants that we could take our time and experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My party booked the Trogon apartment, Hummingbird Suite and Birdnest Suite. The accommodations were great for our needs. The beds were comfortable and towels so plush! The kitchen/kitchenette areas had basic supplies which come in handy. We especially loved the cute dishware. The host was quite responsive and helpful with our needs. The surroundings were relaxing and serene! Nature lovers will enjoy this area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best accommodations in a lovely area of Southern Arizona known for its fine birding. The apartment is close to all the popular trailheads in Madera Canyon. The Trogon Suite is the largest of the four rentals here, with a fully equipped kitchen -- and it actually IS fully equipped for cooking *real* meals, not just making boiling pasta and warming up a jar of Ragu.
The property is bucolic. It sits immediately adjacent to a seasonal creek, bridging it to a patio with small bubbling fountains and feeders where the birds come to drink and eat.
Luis, the owner, is more than communicative. He made many helpful suggestions to aid us in locating the best places to spot many of the dozens of unusual birds in the canyon, right down to ""Take the first left where the trail splits, walk 100 yards and stop."" His knowledge of the canyon just made our stay perfect. We even saw the Elegant Trogon after which the suite is named."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Trogon Suite itself was very nice, clean, well stocked with pots, pans, plates, dishes, glasses, towels, etc. The grounds were beautiful and full of birds. I cannot overstate how delightful it is to stay at the Chuparosa -- the private patios/courtyards are so relaxing and peaceful with the water features and creek running through, that we spent hours just lounging, enjoying the birds. This place was perfect for us. I'm a hard core birder, my wife a casual birder. I snuck out at first light every morning and was able to walk up to the Carrie Nation Trail or down toward the picnic area, returning late morning. The courtyard was our destination for mid day, before we headed back out in the evening. The lovely tree canopy makes photography on the property amazing at midday. Our bird list was impressive, and included Elegant Trogons and Northern Pygmy-Owls. Luis was kind enough to email me tips about birds in the greater area, netting me some lifers, too. An absolute gem of a place!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Our place was roomy. The area is beautiful. Loved sitting outside looking at all the birds and wildlife. We enjoyed our stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Luis and Nancy were very friendly and responsive to our needs. Their property is beautiful and well kept by the two very nice housekeepers that take pride in the cleaning and care and watering of the gardens and plants. The maintenance man was also courteous and professional.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just love returning to the Chuparosa Inn- we have stayed here multiple times and there's no better place to be for birding and hiking in Madera Canyon!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at the Chuparosa B&B very much. The location was perfect and the grounds are beautiful and set up well for bird watching, which was our reason for visiting Madera Canyon."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Chuparosa is the perfect place to stay and relax while visiting Madera Canyon for hiking, nature and especially for bird watching.
We stayed in the Trogon Suite and it was just as the description and photos showed. There was plenty of space and the full kitchen was a plus (no food service onsite).
The setting and grounds were perfect. The house is surrounded by nature including several gardens with water features and bird feeding stations.
Also a great place to to access hiking trails into the mountains or down the valley.
Louis is a great host. He is very knowledgeable about the area birds in Madera Canyon and sounding amenities. He communicates well so there are no surprises and was flexible with our schedule. Thank you. We hope to return for another adventure."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot thank Luis enough. This was our second time staying at his property and we 100% recommend to anyone looking for peaceful, relaxing, perfect get away.
We cannot wait for our next trip to Madera Canyon!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Trogon Suite at the Chuparosa Inn. The suite was well set up for self catered meals. Beautiful location with many bird feeders, lots of birds and other animals visiting. Quiet and private. Luis‚Äô communications were clear and helpful. We hope to come back soon ! Highly recommended."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chuparosa Inn is a birder's and hiker's paradise. We hiked to Josephine Saddle right from our doorstep but actually spotted more species of birds while sitting on the inn's patio. This is a well run inn in a fabulous location.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As always, Luis was an absolutely wonderful host; the Chuparosa Inn is an incredibly special place thanks in no small part to the care and thoughtfulness that he and Nancy have made the cornerstone of every visit we've made. The Inn itself is beautiful, the surroundings are exquisitely peaceful and relaxing, and we had another lovely long weekend celebrating our anniversary and enjoying the Inn, Madera Canyon, and nearby Lake Patagonia."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular spot!! Near all the trails. comfortable, functional kitchen, just lovely!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved the gorgeous surroundings! A winding road led up the draw past other cottages and ours, dead-ending at a public parking lot a hiking trail head.A ravine and rock strewn creek ran just below the inn's patio. There was a bridge across the creek that led to another patio sitting area, and a trail that led far, far up the creek. Tons of hiking and bird watching opportunities. Our Trogon Suite had a full kitchen stocked with everything we needed in order to cook our meals. Luis was a great host and gave us great ideas of things to do, ect.. The cleaning staff were also extremely friendly and went out of their way to provide any other help we needed. It was quite cool in the beginning of March, so we needed the heat on, which worked perfectly. Due to the high elevation, Madera Creek is always 10-20 degrees cooler than the valley, making it a good choice to stay during the hot summer months. I highly recommend the Chuparosa Inn."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, near the top of the road leading up to the main parking lot at the top of Madera Canyon."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We origionally booked the room for 5 nights After 2 nights we decided to extend our stay even longer. The place was just what I was looking for. Close to wildlife, close to the trails and quiet. It sits on the busiest dead end road I have ever seen but still 'in the country'. The only drawback is because of it's remotness it's 20 minutes to get to the freeway if you are using the place for a home base and exploring a wide area of southern Arizona. I would stay there again. Luis was always just a phone call away."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend stay, looking forward to next time."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed for a few days at the trogon suit and we LOVED it! the room was clean, spacious but cozy, had great views from the patio area and was so peaceful and relaxing. It was the perfect getaway for the weekend. We can‚Äôt wait to come again next year!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful property and very quiet. The grounds were beautiful. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in the Trogan Suite At Chuparosa Inn. Relaxing location close to the trails with access to the nature Trail in the ""backyard."" The various places to sit and enjoy the beauty of Madera Canyon made our moments there even more special. The apartment was perfect for our October anniversary/birthdays trip. Comfy leather recliners to sip tea and coffee as the rain passes, excellent water pressure, and the bed and bedding are oh-so cozy. We didn't want to drive anywhere once we arrived, so the fully equipped kitchen worked out perfectly. Worth the extra."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a place not to be missed if you enjoy nature, hiking and relaxation."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely apartment combined homey comfort and a beautiful setting. We came to Madera Canyon to hike and bird and the Inn provided us the perfect relaxing spot as well as having terrific access to the trails. The multiple patios and sitting areas overlook a lovely stream and we sat outside nearly every minute when we were at the Inn. The birds and the animals come to you in this magical place.
The Trogan apartment itself is very well equipped with everything we needed and was truly comfortable and clean. My only regret was that the hummingbird feeders had been taken down due to a bear and cubs seen in the area. I would have loved to be able to sit outside on the decks and watch those! We had a great stay! Thank you! This is the perfect spot for birders!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, backing right up to a network of trails in Madera Canyon. Scenery is so relaxing, water, trees, and birds all around the Inn. The room was perfect for 2, clean and well maintained. A wonderful Sky Island getaway!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this place! It was our third stay here. The room is wonderful, comfortable, clean and well laid out. The property is GORGEOUS! Lots of decks and places to sit outside and birdwatch. The trees are so amazing - huge Arizona sycamores and many other varieties. It was 20 degrees cooler than down in the valley and that was a definite plus for June! We hiked and read and sat outside as much as possible. We'll be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a picturesque and private setting that is so enjoyable to visit. It has a private connection to the nature trail. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. You get your own private birdwatching and wildlife watching vantage point and nice home base for hiking. The outdoor grill and patio are wonderful to use day or night. Luis is an excellent host.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Clean room, great location. Loved the outside patios. Very relaxing."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Trogon Suite at Chuparosa is nestled in the riparian forest along Madera Canyon Creek. The first thing I heard on the first morning there were turkeys talking with each other. The whole place is teeming with birds. There are many wonderful hikes nearby, and exploring them was the main purpose of our visit. The suite had all the amenities and supplies we could think of. We were particularly appreciative that coffee was provided, because we forgot to bring them. We also liked having the hiking snacks and maps. Sitting areas for bird watching were a treat. Beautiful place. I hope we can return."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and beautiful property!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just the perfect place to stay for a few days of hiking and birding. We loved being so close to the trailheads and not having to drive anywhere. Trogon apt was beautifully decorated and comfortable. Love the outside decks!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I spent three fantastic nights in the Trogon Apt at the Chuparosa Inn. The property is gorgeous and the location is hard to beat, set right up in the canyon mere minutes from some incredible hikes. As others mentioned, with multiple trailheads so close I didn't need to drive anywhere during my stay.
Along with the great location, another of my favorite aspects of Chuparosa was the numerous wonderful places to relax on the multiple decks. I particularly enjoyed sitting quietly with a book and watching the many species of hummingbirds buzz by. I found Chuparosa to be a perfect low-key getaway to reset and take in the beauty of the surroundings.
The hosts were very helpful and informative, so I did not have any issues during my stay. I would absolutely come again to The Chuparosa.
Thank you Nancy & Luis for such a great experience!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy place, I recommend!
My gf and I spent a weekend here and hiked Mt Wrightson (it's a tough hike but beautiful even if you don't go to the peak). The trailheads are only a few mins walk away, no need to drive. A few wild turkeys hang out around the place which was cool.
For full transparency, a couple cons: Water pressure is spotty. There's a light outside the bedroom window that I'd prefer not be there.
Would stay again."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stayed for 10 days in the trogon suite at Chuparosa Inn. What a delightful place.
Luis and Nancy were super hosts. Want to know what‚Äôs available birding, hiking,
eating, etc.? Just ask Luis, he‚Äôs very knowledgeable, and will cheerfully give you
good advice. Both Nancy and Luis are extremely friendly, congenial, and accommodating.
And talk about being friendly, just wait until you meet the other two hosts, Nala and Riley.
These two canines take man‚Äôs best friend to another level. So lovable and they will get your
day started with a smile. If you just want to relax after a hard hike, the gardens are wonderful
with lots of comfy spots to sit and watch the many birds feeding. I have no hesitation in
giving the Chuparosa my highest recommendation."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Luis was so welcoming and knowledgable. He helped us make the most of our stay.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place tucked in an awesome area to go hiking (all levels-beginner to expert) and watch the wild life and multiple bird species. Disconnect from the hustle and bustle and reconnect with nature. Our room was great-all the comforts of home. The welcome basket has pamphlets to explain the trails, and a list of birds seen in the area (along with coffee and a few goodies!)The hosts are very personable and always available if you need anything. The location is great. We parked our car when we got there and didn't get back in it until we left. The trails are so close. The outdoor patio is beautiful. We will be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Everything is advertised and then some! Absolutely gorgeous place and everyone was so helpful in finding hiking trails and places to eat. Would definitely recommend this place! Quiet, peaceful, mountain breezes and great wildlife! Couldn't have found a better place to stay!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Incredibly relaxing, beautiful and convenient!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect lodging - exceptionally clean, full kitchen, very comfortable bed and tucked right up in Madera Canyon. I'm a hiker but my husband isn't so much so this was ideal for us. We could do short hikes and then return for meals and reading time out on the decks surrounded by nature. We have stayed here before and will definitely return again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful setting!
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful getaway in the heart of Madera Canyon! Located only a few steps from the surrounding trails, this pleasant little escape is the perfect location to spend a weekend. The owner's have attracted quite a few birds to the yard, so you'll be sure to see more than a few acorn woodpeckers and Mexican Jays. Highly recommended for anyone looking to either birdwatch or hike. Added bonus - their beautiful outdoor seating and patio - a wonderful place to have a relaxing dinner or wake up with a cup of coffee and watch the forest come alive."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jan's place! The home is beautiful, spotlessly clean, comfortable and well decorated. The location is great for accessing all that Tubac has to offer and for getting on and off the highway. It's situated in a quiet and clean area with great walking paths. We highly recommend Jan's place and hope to be back!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jan's place was absolutely amazing! Check-in was a breeze and Jan was communicative and made the process simple. The condo was private, beautifully decorated, pristine, and every little detail was thought of to make my stay comfortable. The townhome is located in a quiet little complex with a great view of the Santa Ritas and a saltwater pool for relaxing. Beautiful sky deck and patio! My favorite part, though, was the easy access to the de Anza trail which I took for a very quick walk to Tubac then hopped onto for a hike to Tumacacori on the second day of my stay. The perfect location and all the amenities made this probably my favorite Airbnb I've ever stayed at!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely townhouse in Tubac. Great access to the Anza trail and to town for shopping and restaurants. Pool was amazing and everyone was friendly.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, quiet, easy to get to (once you figure out the unit numbering on the buildings). Nice rooftop deck and the pool area is great. Sadly didn‚Äôt use either much as the weather was unseasonably cool and rainy, for late March in the desert. I highly recommend it..if you‚Äôre planning on visiting Tubac and Southern AZ. Jan is a very responsive host which I appreciated."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended. Wonderful and safe location. Includes washer and dryer and a fireplace. Just beautiful. Will stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Jan's place. It was in a great location with access to the pool and hot tub (which we used). It was very close to a girlfriend that lives in this area - a huge bonus! The house had everything we needed. We enjoyed the village which in within walking distance, took yoga classes, ate at the golf course and did some sightseeing. Had a wonderful time."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Just what I needed: a comfortable, clean apartment with all the necessary kitchen tools. Close to the pool, Covered parking which was really nice on these hot sunny days. Nice Fitness Center too.
I liked being able to take my morning walks into Tubac and as a Tesla driver, I really appreciated that Old Presidio Traders in Tubac has a Level 2 charger available. I charged up there three times over my one week stay (I could leave it on the charger over night and it is only a 15 minute walk from Jan's place).
Jan sent daily messages with helpful suggestions of things to do in the area. I look forward to returning."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Thank you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jan's townhome in Tubac. She communicated with us before and during our visit; her welcome guide and instructions were clear and helpful. Jan's place was spotless and clutter-free, which made it easy for us to move in with our two dogs. (We especially appreciate being able to have our dogs with us for this two-night stay over 4th of July.) The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to prepare the meals we planned to eat in. Walking in the neighborhood is easy and lovely; the mountain views are relaxing and peaceful. We will recommend Jan's townhome to others."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jan's place is a great accommodation for spending time in Southern Arizona. It is quiet, clean, and has a nice deck area above the house,
a well-stocked kitchen, and a nice courtyard. There was plenty of free parking, and I especially enjoyed using the outdoor pool and sauna daily.
A+++"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Have always heard about Tubac and wanted to check it out so we rented Jan's lovely townhouse. Barrio de Tubac area is very pretty with still alot of construction going on. The townhouses are very Santa Fe ish with beautiful southwestern colors. Jan's patio is very private with beautiful heavy metal gate upon entering and a beautiful metal entry door. The upper patio is perfect for morning coffee and pretty views. Mornings are cool there but heats up quickly. The townhouse is very nice, felt like being at home; kitchen is equipped with whatever you need; loved the under the cabinet lights in kitchen; nice refrigerator that makes ice; comfortable furniture and bed; loved the Meyer products; the shower was amazing, big tub; shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided by Jan. Plenty of room throughout the townhouse. Quiet neighborhood, friendly people; covered parking was a plus. Lots of dog walkers and plenty of places to walk and explore. Jan is an excellent host, quick to respond."

The home is in a charming community and neighbors are delightfully friendly and waved and said hi whenever we walked by on dog walks. There are a few restaurants and a market within a short walk or drive. Instructions for check in and check out were clear and straightforward.
Jan was an excellent host, she checked in with recommendations and always responded quickly to my messages.
The current photos don't do this home justice, it's a real gem. If only all Airbnbs (and their hosts and housekeepers!) were like this one! :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and spacious for a 1 bedroom! Jan has everything you need for a fantastic stay. The hot tub and pool were so nice! Watching the sunrise over the mountains from the hot tub we‚Äôre amazing!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great casita.... perfect location.
Easy walking distance to restaurants and shops .
Beware of early closings. Most restaurants close at eight or earlier if things are slow.
Gary and Kathleen were nearby to help or answer questions but were not intrusive. Very knowledgeable and professional.
Fabulous decor and art in abundance.
Birds everywhere..... especially a fabulous vulture roost show every morning and evening.
Hummingbird center is world class and short walk away.
Fabulous garden and beautiful patio.
Wonderful stay..... can't wait to return again soon ."

Gary greeted us upon our arrival and was responsive to texts when we had questions. The place was clean and had all the amenities we expected. There was ample parking for our truck and boat trailer. We will definitely consider booking again in the future and recommending this location to friends. Loved its close proximity to all Patagonia had to offer.

Thank you Gary !"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"ok, Gary's place is one of those secrets you want to keep to yourself or, only tell your best friends. Patagonia is another best kept secret too, but if you're reading reviews of rental properties there, you already know this. we loved the property -- inside and out. we loved the interior space and especially over the holidays. it was such a treat to be able to retreat into such a cozy, artful and warm space. the outdoor patio area is a literal sanctuary- and since we are outdoors types, we had the BEST of both worlds. easy walking to all of the shops/markets/cafes/birding/sonoita creek hikes, cycling routes. we honestly cannot wait to come back. Gary as a host struck the perfect balance between checking in with us to make sure we had everything we needed and giving us the autonomy and privacy of a rental when you want that too. thank you to both Gary and Kathleen for your warm welcome, and your warm send off. would rent this property again in a heart beat."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The dwelling was filled with eclectic art and cozy spaces, and within walking distance of admittedly a very small town!

If wine is your thing, do not miss visiting Los Milics and Rune, two compleyely different tasting experiences to enjoy some amazing Arizona wines!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful casita with many artful touches everywhere you look, right in the heart of Patagonia.
Great outdoor space for morning coffee & evening wine. In the fall, when we visited, the hummingbird feeders (5) were refilled daily, (thanks Kathleen, loved our chats in the garden) the hummers kept us entertained as well as the cat Sofie.
Everything about this place is just like the photos, one of the best the best Airbnbs we have ever stayed at. Thanks Gary, see you next year."

It‚Äôs right in town walkable to everything and just across the street from a large park for peaceful walks.
Gary was always available and so easy to talk to. Quick and gorgeous 15 min drive to the lake. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The setting of the casita is quite special. It‚Äôs right in the middle of town yet very quiet and private. Across the street is a very pleasant park and just beyond that are restaurants, coffee shops, and a couple small grocery stories, all very walkable from the casita. The Paton Bird Sanctuary, and hiking trails heads easily are walkable too. The casita appointed with a nicely curated collection of high quality furniture and art, it‚Äôs beautiful, super comfortable and cozy and there‚Äôs very nice patio with shade and plenty of hummingbirds. Definitely one of the finest stays we‚Äôve had. Highly recommended!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying here so much! It was my first Airbnb experience. This casita is thoughtfully decorated and has such a lovely vibe. You can enjoy watching hummingbirds in the garden. Its a few minutes walk from the main street- highway 82. Everything we could need was there. Clean towels, cooking implements, AC, water bottles, etc. It is full of antiques and handmade art but is still personal and cozy. I hope I can bring my family here sometime!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an outstanding stay at the Casita! Gary was very accommodating, having the fireplace on before arriving as well following up with any requests we had about the area or house.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Patagonia casita was a delight! It is so comfortable and Gary went the extra mile to have a small stove on to take the chill out of the air for us as we got in later than we expected. The art and decor were delightful and you saw something new every time you looked around. The furnishings were beautiful pieces and the beds were comfortable. There is a delightful private patio for relaxation and reading. We will definitely try to book again when next we are visiting our family.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, great location, cozy and well equipped with quality towels, bedding, and kitchenware. A great selection of DVDs came in handy when the town lost internet for a few hours! Gary was an A+ host üôÇ"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time at the property. Star gazing and hanging out cooking to celebrate birthdays! Got to check out some of the old photo albums and history of the house and family. So cool! The yard is not fully fenced in so dogs do have the ability to leave the yard. We heard and saw lots of coyotes! The wineries around are very fun. We had a blast!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem. It‚Äôs quaint, cozy, beautiful and just the place to relax when you need to get away. Made fun memories with my family, playing games, star gazing and just relaxing on the back porch, watching for birds. It made our stay in Sonoita truly special."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, peaceful location with lots of birds and access to other birding areas. Appreciated the bottle of wine when we arrived! Beds were very comfy so a good nights rest was had by all. Under the Oaks is a gem in Sonoita and we certainly hope to return. Also, our dogs loved running free and were exhausted at the end of the day, perfect for them.
Thanks."

The ambiance and amenities were perfect for our family of three, who love walking, birding, sitting beside the fire and star-gazing. We were in Sonoita to visit with family and this couldn‚Äôt have suited us any better. We were so comfortable and well-rested due to such peaceful surroundings. Thank you for your hospitality and we can‚Äôt wait to come back again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We run out of superlatives; suffice to say, this was our 11th or 12th trip to Under the Oaks and we keep coming back. The peacefulness of the area, the 270+degrees of views, the sightings of birds and antelope, and the comfortableness of the house and the very helpful hosts are draws that contribute to our stay.
Many thanks!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay in this comfortable home. Very peaceful setting with mountain views out the back. We would highly recommend staying here.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Enjoyed our stay despite some cold and wet weather over Easter. The property warmed up quickly and was very clean, comfortable and plenty spacious for just the 2 of us. It was a great location from which to explore southern AZ. We were aware of the neighbours dogs, which bark when they notice movement, but it still felt private and rural and we enjoyed the local wildlife, including plenty of birds and some pronghorn at dusk - the sunrises and sunsets were memorable too. Whilst the access road across the surrounding ranch is in good condition, we were glad of our 4wd vehicle on the final morning after heavy overnight rains made the surface quite muddy and slippery. Would stay again if revisiting the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third stay at Under the Oaks, we will be back."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I chose Under the Oaks as a place to restore my energy after busy shifts in our modern health care system. I was not disappointed! Being surrounded by astonishing nature, walking every morning and late afternoon with my dog, knitting in Arizona room by the burning natural wood fire place , watching birds and sunsets was exactly what I needed! Such a hidden gem! We will be definitely back. Thank you Morgan and Bronwyn for taking such a great care of this ranch house!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bronwyn‚Äôs place was the perfect home away from home. It was a peaceful and serene set up with beautiful oak trees and wild life.

We had such a great Thanksgiving celebration and the home had everything we needed to help us make our traditional meal. We had a great time and would love to come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is unique and beautiful.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Under the Oaks was everything we wanted and needed it to be. Remarkably relaxing, the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable both inside and out.
The views were spectacular and it was a great place for our small group of friends to unwind, enjoy meals together and de-stress from a crazy year. It‚Äôs warmth was welcoming and its history was wonderfully woven into the fabric of the place from the art on the walls to the photo albums on the shelf. Our friends dog thoroughly enjoyed his time playing in the grass.
This is definitely a place we‚Äôd love to return to in the future!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôve done many airbnbs over the years but this has to be in our top 5. The house is so perfectly nestled between the oak trees. The quiet surroundings, expansive vistas, wild animals (we saw deer and javelina), and not to mention the stunning stary nights. Just incredible! Our two toddlers and dogs had as much of a good as us. Cannot wait to revisit."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Under the Oaks is a beautiful place of tranquility and refreshment for the senses. Perfectly clean and welcoming, the hosts were the most communicative and helpful we have ever had. We really appreciated all of the area information and recommendations, and felt absolutely like we were staying with friends. This is truly a home-away-from-home with every amenity needed, wonderful games and books in case of a rainy day, boundless hiking/walking opportunities through the surrounding rolling hills, cozy spots on the patios for wine or coffee, and the perfect location for enjoying the local attractions such as wine country and bird watching. Can't say enough and can't wait to return!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our tenth time and one of the best visits; needless to say, we really like Under the Oaks and it works well for the three of us with 3 bedrooms, 3 distinct areas to sit, views of mountains both East and West, one of the most beautifully shaped massive oak trees we have ever seen, and peace and quiet but yet convenient for exploring or sampling. The air conditioning was an added plus this year, along with a Super Blue Moon, and the visit from two pronghorn antelope just outside the wooden fence of the yard (usually we are viewing them on the more distant hillside). And we always have a interesting selection of birds to feed and enjoy each season. We thank Bronwyn and Morgan for their hospitality.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Under the Oaks is such an amazing find! Waking to birds chirping, cows moo‚Äôing, and such peacefulness made this place a diamond in the rough.

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time at Bronwyn‚Äôs home. The location and views are beautiful. The surrounding grass and sitting areas were perfect for hanging outside. We spent a lot of time in the comfortable Arizona room with full windows. Deer and Javelina were seen from the property throughout our stay as well.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house is equipped with absolutely everything you‚Äôll need. Beds comfortable. Spent hours and hours sitting in the bright, closed-in ‚Äúporch‚Äù or shaded patio admiring the hills and trees and birds. Quiet, extensive surroundings. Hosts very helpful and friendly. Art work, books, photo albums of family and ranch history made us feel part of the family and right at home. Go!! You‚Äôll love it. Very welcoming to dogs."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an oasis! The house itself feels like a home and has all the amenities you could possibly want and need to enjoy a comfortable stay. The surroundings are breath-taking and for a group of bird-watchers, the birdlife that the owners encourage by feeding them kept us happily entertained for hours! (Maybe consider a few hummingbird feeders, too?) We loved going for long walks through the grasslands and sitting outside watching the Acorn Woodpeckers, finches, and warblers in the oaks! Overall, an unforgettable stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, would stay here again. The hosts are very nice, responsive, and generous. The house was clean and functional."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We can't say enough good things about this place. It is off the beaten path, down long dirt roads, but worth it, because the house is surrounded by some of the most beautiful country we've ever seen. If you like desert + prairie this place is for you. The house is cozy, comfortable, and adorable. We felt right at home because the house did not feel like a rental. It feels loved. Two fireplaces, a well-appointed kitchen, a bottle of wine, nothing but the sound of coyotes and birds for miles. So peaceful. Bronwyn was a wonderful host. Responsive and friendly. We could tell she cared about the quality of our stay. We even were treated to a snow storm....which magically melted the next day so we could easily drive out again. Lots of places to hike our dog too. It was all magical. Five enthusiastic stars. This would be a great place to come with family or friends."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"‚ÄúUnder the Oaks‚Äù was everything we were hoping for‚Ä¶& MORE! We wanted to travel where we could bring our three pups with us, our daughter & enjoy some tranquility away from city & life. If you want secluded & beautiful surroundings this is right for you!We only left once to go grab cash to leave for our house keeping! Other than this, would not have left during our stay! Starting w/ a welcome bottle of wine upon arrival, there was EVERYTHING you could have needed while there!! Plenty of dishes, amazing coffee maker, items to stargaze outside, little lanterns to use, plenty of blankets , games& fire places were AMAZING! (My husbands 2 hard job there were keeping the fires going to enjoy & making sure our dogs didn‚Äôt disturb the caretakers home nearby‚Ä¶ which they did once while we were visiting, So sorry again!) We woke in the mornings we were there to enjoy the sunrises, which we are so thankful we did! Highly recommend! We look forward to returning again! Thanks so much again!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is easy to recommend this airBNB in Sonoita, AZ named ‚ÄúUnder the Oaks‚Äù. It is well appointed home that is only a couple of miles from Sonoita, about 15 miles from Patagonia, and yet very isolated. Very quiet and serene location. The only things were heard were the wind, coyotes, cows, hawks/eagles, crows and ravens. The things we did NOT hear includes cars, trucks, motorcycles, chain saws, lawn mowers, leaf blowers, boom-boom car stereo, planes, helicopters, garbage truck, neighbors, barking dogs, police and fire sirens, car horns and about a thousand other things. Good for the heart, mind and soul."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This place was amazing. House very cozy exactly as described. Owners were amazing at prompt and detailed communication. House well stocked with extras.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house is set perfectly for a relaxing getaway. We enjoyed the calmness and wish we could have stayed longer!

Bronwyn is an excellent communicator and flexible with my no doubt annoying changes."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The views are beautiful, and it was fun to see and hear the free range cows just beyond the fence. The house is clean and comfortable and has a great view from every window. You can see lots of stars at night. And it's a great place to bring a dog. My favorite part was just sitting outside under the big trees and enjoying the scenery."

Beautiful area!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Under the Oaks was everything they said it was and more. It was a perfect place to getaway for our girls weekend to Arizona Wine Country. It was so nice, quiet, and peaceful. Fully equipped kitchen with everything you need to cook. The bedrooms were very comfortable and no one had any complaints about the beds (which happens too often). They had plenty of towels and additional bedding if needed. Lots of places to sit and be comfortable. Fully enjoyed the large Arizona room where we all went and watched the lightning and storms in the evening. Love the summer monsoons in Arizona. Due to the monsoon weather we weren't able to enjoy the outdoors as much. Might have to plan a couples trip here with a friend that couldn't make it last minute.
Brownyn and Morgan were amazing hosts and very accommodating for all our requests and very prompt to answer any questions we had before, during and after our trip!
Would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone visiting Sonoita, Elgin, Patagonia, and surrounding areas. The elevation was a perfect summer getaway from the harsh Arizona heat too!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I highly recommend Under the Oaks! It is an absolutely beautiful place. The home is lovely, and the location breathtaking.

The house was very comfortable and we felt there was plenty of room for 6 adults. The beds were comfortable, the showers were great, the instructions for the swamp cooler were clear. We all agree that we wouldn't change a thing and wish we could have stayed longer."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don‚Äôt hesitate, just book you will not be disappointed! Great space to enjoy the beautiful area and great location to explore all of the fun spots within a short drive."

The home was peaceful and we enjoyed all the wildlife around us. We met the horses and came up close to the cows heading out on the road. We enjoyed bird watching too!!
Inside the house we had everything we needed too. The home is comfy!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 5th time at this magical place. It is so peaceful and quiet out there, the house is fully equipped and stocked with everything you could need. I love that there is always a little bit of something left in the freezer, spices, oils, and all the little things that you might need but forgot to bring. The stars are just amazing. Take the time to stay up and experience the night sky!"
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"Under the Oaks is an extremely nice place to stay. It was clean and very relaxing to stay at after a day of hiking and birding. It was so nice to sit out on patio, drinking a favorite beverage and hear nothing but nature.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place if you‚Äôre looking for some peace and quiet. Close to vineyards. Dirt road to get to the place.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Although it is a primitive road to the home, I was very comfortable driving it in a sedan. The home was very clean. The host provided little amenities that were greatly appreciated. We had a great time. Very beautiful home."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Bronwyn‚Äôs place. The entire family loved it, including the doggo! We made all of our own meals while there and enjoyed each in the lovely Arizona room. There was more than enough room for everyone (3 adults, 2 kiddos), and the location was perfect for excursions into town and the local wineries. Would definitely recommend and happily stay again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,By far the best Hosts I have ever delt with we needed a few special accommodations and they were very understanding. The place is beautiful and such great setting. If you want a country get away this is the place to go.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was amazing - the hosts, the house, the views. Definitely coming back!"
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,This property is so beautiful and open. A great place to enjoy yourself and relax. Very cozy and clean. Fit 6 of us perfectly. Close drive to the wineries.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A short little drive off the main highway and you are in an Arizona ranch valley that makes you feel people are a million miles away. This little ranch house is so quiet and relaxing you‚Äôll never want to go home.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend this place enough! It‚Äôs set beautifully in the countryside of Sonoita and well appointed with everything you‚Äôll need to make your visit comfortable; dishes, cookware, bakeware, all the fundamental cooking necessities like oil/seasonings, coffee/creamer/sweeteners‚Ä¶you‚Äôll feel perfectly at home whether you‚Äôre staying for a few nights or for an extended amount of time! It‚Äôs full of books, board games, and charming touch‚Äôs like a blanket and tarp for stargazing. There‚Äôs more than enough room for plenty of people to fit comfortably. The house is a short drive from the local wineries, a gas station, two restaurants, and a well stocked dollar general supplied with groceries, toiletries, and even simple clothing! I can‚Äôt wait to come back to Under the Oak and enjoy more time unwinding and wine tasting"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a delightful time here! The photos do not do the property justice. We stayed during the monsoon season, everything was so green! The afternoon and evening rains are amazing, we don't get the same storms near Phoenix. Our children (5, 7, 9) loved exploring and ""off roading"" on their bicycles. Our dog had just as much fun or more! The location is central to hiking, tourist fun (Tombstone, Kartchner Caverns, Bisbee). Our recommendation - drive a 4x4 or high clearance vehicle. The road to the home will be rough on a regular car/minivan."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bronwyn's home is so relaxing and was a refreshing break for the summer. The oaks offer ample shade, the grass is cool, the many local wineries nearby offer many refreshing options. It is even more beautiful than the photos! Bronwyn was quick to respond to my questions and I appreciate that she opens her home so others can enjoy this wonderful slice of heaven."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful hosts and property. We just love it!

2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We loved the outdoor patios and enclosed patio at the back of the house. We layed on our backs under the stars and soaked in the amazing night sky. The beds were comfy and we laughed at the creeking roof as the air cooled down at night. We found the location to be convenient to go wine tasting and to go out for dinner while remote enough to feel like we were away from it all.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are returning renters, as this special property is a tonic for the soul. I love the house's character - it is not a sterile, all modern environment, but one that feels like a home. We loved sitting outside under the trees, enjoying the silence and the wind, just watching the birds and looking for cows in the distance. At this time of year the Arizona room is fabulous in the afternoon with the windows open, the breeze coming through."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house has everything one could possibly need. The landscape very beautiful with many places to hike. The birding is great with fabulous oak trees and lots of activity. We really enjoyed our stay!

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You don't realize you've been missing true quiet until you have it. Love the outdoor space, you come here for the title ""under the oaks."" I think the picture with the feet up staring out over them is what sold me and so enjoyed that in person. The place has a charm to it that takes you back. It was the rest that we needed."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful space! The yard/grill area was perfect for enjoying the sunshine and the fireplaces were extra cozy when it got chilly at night.
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great house with so much history. Loved the patio and the view, plus the house was stocked with everything you could need."
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"My fianc√©, our parents and I spent a lovely weekend at Under the Oaks! It was just enough space for the five of us. We loved sitting together outside under the oaks and in the sunroom. It was the perfect location‚Äîwithin 5-10 minutes of ‚Äútown‚Äù and within 20 minutes of all of the wineries we wanted to visit! I would definitely stay there again the next time we make it down there!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming ranch home in a peaceful location close to the wineries. Bronwyn was very responsive and accommodating. The house was perfect for our group of families.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed everything about our stay. The views showcase all the best about the beauty of southeastern Arizona. The house is clean and well-stocked. The hosts are quick to respond to any question. We truly felt as if we had entered the home of friends.
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay in a ranch environment.
2020-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Rustic house with cute antique touches in a spectacular setting. Comfy queen beds. We love to cook so wished for gas or a charcoal BBQ. Good location close to wineries. We loved going for runs along the dirt road. Below average quality in terms of appliances, tv, etc, but you can‚Äôt beat the view, the oak trees and the birds!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A slice of heaven! We enjoyed the escape this beautiful home offers. The rooms were very well decorated and we had many creature comforts. I would love to know the history of this ranch area. Huge plus was being able to bring our dog and walk him along the endless open spaces, escaping the heat. For those who like Sonoita Elgin, this has the premium view and location. Thank you Bronwyn for hosting us so well, we would like to come back!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Under the oaks is a gorgeous little getaway. Highly recommended, close to wineries, close to nature, and the hosts are marvelous. We will definitely be back sometime."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our third visit, and I can't wait to be back. There is so much to love about this place. The house is comfortable and has everything you could need. The air, the quiet, the big sky, the clouds, the hills are magic for your soul."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful Airbnb! The house is inviting, charming, and comfortable. We spent most of our time outside under the patio enjoying the scenery and the grill, or sitting out on a tarp and blanket under the oaks with our pup. Highly recommend!"

2020-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place in tranquil setting ""out on the range"". Like staying at Grandma's place off the grid. Spacious house to stretch out in. Just FYI, adequate wifi but don't expect to be streaming Netflix. Not unexpected for this area so download yr movies before you arrive. Great patio area and enclosed porch to watch the birds gather in the morning, enjoy a BBQ on the grill, or enjoy the stars in evening."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is such a nice retreat! The area is private and scenic with just a short drive to hikes and wine.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third stay at this house. The home is filled with love and care. Home is on a ranch and that is how it feels. Open air, open space and views of mountains, ranges, meadows of rolling hills as far as the eyes can see.
The bedding is soft, all Cotten perfect comfort. Lots of pillows, blankets and quilts. Plenty of soft fluffy towels.
Kitchen is fully equipped even with paper plates!
The well water is the very best, no bottled water necessary. Makes exceptional coffee.
We tried the new brewery in Sonoita. The appetizers are very GOOD. lots of home brew beer for the tasting.
This is the best place to relax. The enclosed porch invites to get comfortable, grab a book and a glass wine. Let everything else pass you by. Enjoy"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful! Peaceful! Very much reminded me of my Great Grandparents house - in a good relaxing kinda way.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"if if you're looking for a quiet, quaint place to relax Under The Oaks is for you."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bronwyn was prompt to respond and provided easy and pleasant communications. Her family house is full of soul and a wonderful place to share quality time with dear friends and relatives. The kitchen is perfectly stocked with modern amenities (Keurig coffee pods...) as well as loved utensils and dishes of the past (Mexican pottery...). The house is spacious enough for 7, has a cosy sitting area/library around a fireplace and our most favourite was the Arizona room where everyone soaked in beautiful views while sipping coffee, reading, playing games and conversing for long hours. We did not disclose to the kids there was an internet connection and the miracle of true connection happen! THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS LOVELY HAVEN IN THE ARIZONA COUNTRYSIDE!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second visit, and it was as lovely as the first time around. When you arrive, take a few moments to just take in the silence: all you hear is the birds and the wind. Amazing refreshment for your soul. Just a really wonderful place."

2019-03-01,4,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful setting and a great house to spend a week. We stayed here with kids ages 8-11 and really enjoyed getting outside, taking big walks, looking for cows, encountering some pronghorns, and seeing amazing birds. The house is very comfortable, and the Arizona room is the place you want to hang out in, unless you are outside sitting under the gazebo. We found everything we could possibly need, had a perfect stay and look forward to returning."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I have stayed at Under the Oaks for a Valentines weekend before and we loved it so much we came back again. Our families favorite part is the Arizona room which has beautiful big windows so you can watch amazing sunrises and sunsets. They have a full kitchen with all the utensil you‚Äôll need. I was able to cook every meal for all 3 days. She had pretty much everything you could think of available. She also left a bottle of wine for stargazing. The experience was even more amazing then the first time as it snowed while we were there and we woke to beautiful winter wonderland on our last day.
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful space. Beautiful setting and still close to local businesses. Perfect getaway.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you plan to explore the wineries, Tombstone, Kartchner Caverns or even the Patagonia area, Under the Oaks is a great location and very quiet. Enjoy an evening under the stars or enjoy a fire on a cold winter evening."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Under the Oaks is a nice place to stay if your down in the area wine tasting, enjoying the wildlife, or maybe a visit to Kartchner Caverns. We were pleasantly surprised when we saw how remote the property was and how dark the nights are (meant lots of stars). We saw over 30 pronghorn antelope and the birding watching was great. Do be advised that the road is a dirt road with some minor hills. No problem at all for any vehicle, unless there is rain."
2018-12-01,5,Group trip,"Have now stayed here twice, and want to do so again. Fantastic and cozy home, in a beautiful setting, perfect for a relaxing weekend."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Feels like home If home had this gorgeous view on rolling hills in the Arizona desert ! We enjoyed BBQ under the Oak and woodfire on the patio. Slept like babies. Great kitchen with all ustensils / spices needed. And stars !

2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at Under the Oaks twice now, once for a Mom weekend and the second time with my family and teen girls.
Both times were very peaceful and relaxing. The Douglas home is charming and rustic, located in the rolling hills of Sonoita. We visiting the town, winery and lake Patagonia.
The temperatures outside this weekend we‚Äôre phenomenal.
We meet three dogs and two horses and a few caterpillars in the garden. We will be back again!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bronwyn, thank you for opening your charming house to us! The location is perfect for enjoying Sonoita's sites and wineries. And before or after a day in town, you can enjoy the incredible scenery, birds, sounds of wildlife, and so many stars! We really loved our stay and wishes we could have stayed longer! Thank you!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute little place. Beautiful location.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was short but serene! Muriel‚Äôs cottage is perfectly provisioned- we forgot coffee, but there was plenty on hand!
Lots of extra towels. Sweet animals, especially Leo the big lumbering guardian. We hope to be back this fall!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second stay -- already left a very positive review March 2023, and it's still a wonderful retreat! We'll be back! :-)"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very kind host and beautiful animal farm. Very close to town as well.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I loved our stay at this beautiful, peaceful farmhouse. The house was spotless and the kitchen had everything we needed. Beds were super comfortable. Best of all, there were baby goats in the goat pen! Muriel‚Äôs place is very convenient to Tucson but feels like a different world. Highly recommend!!"
2024-03-01,3,Group trip,"Nice Cabin with gas BBQ and firepit, with good interior. However there are several tenants living on the property behind the cabin, and the cabin is basically in the owners yard. Internet seems to be a shared wifi, so it is barely usable to the degree that you can't even watch TV.
In my view the price was at a premium, and should have been cheaper given the circumstances."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muriel‚Äôs place was perfect!!just what we wanted! So peaceful and pretty!! The house was well laid out and comfortable. Loriann took morning walks each day, sometimes accompanied by our trusty white dogs from Muriel‚Äôs.
We drove to Bisbee, Patagonia and surrounding areas. Brought our own food and the kitchen was a nice size.
We had everything we needed, enjoyed our visit very much and would definitely recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a gem!! It was lovely and far from the maddening crowd! Very welcoming and hospitable. We could live there and hated to leave. Welcomed our dogs and trusted us to be responsible pet owners. Wonderful host!! Would love to stay there again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Muriel‚Äôs farm! The house was cute and perfect for our needs. The location was near numerous trailheads and good proximity to all the wineries. We loved walking around and seeing the animals, her dogs were so friendly with ours as well. As other reviews mentioned, no grocery store around so bring a cooler with some food to prepare for yourself"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time and Muriel was so kind and welcoming. We are definitely going to come back soon.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Went on a girls trip for wine tasting! We had an unexpected snow day and went in the dead of winter so didn‚Äôt get to see the lavender in all its glory. There are other people staying in the property, not sure in what capacity. There is a yurt and then two RVs on the property close to the house. House was as pictured/described, very clean. We did take a portable carbon monoxide detector. Also some of the windows had window covering and others didn‚Äôt m, we did take sheets and taped them up on the windows which made us feel more comfortable and not like people were looking in."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just what I needed. The home is just what you would picture in country home but better. She has some really nice art work, and lavender throughout the house. I recently had to send my dog over the rainbow Bridge. She has this huge white dog that watches over the property. He's very friendly, but he hung out with me, leaning into me. Very peaceful property. Will be back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Very well maintained.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"great environment, peaceful and not far from wine country. especially loved the cat that jumped on my lap for coffee outside in the morning!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Muriel's place was perfect for a 2 day get away with our kids! Our 5 year old an 2 year old loved interacting with the farm animals! We highly recommend that you ask Muriel in advance to book experiences like goat milking. The place itself is spacious and has great beds! We will be booking again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying here! Muriel is so nice! Her dog Leo was a great welcoming party! You could smell the lavender driving up. It was so calm and peaceful and relaxing there. We will definitely stay here again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Muriel was a great host and very responsive to questions. We booked this location for a family trip, which I unfortunately couldnt make it out for, but my children had a very nice time in Sonoita. The house was spacious, clean and comfortable. The kitchen had everything they needed to make meals. And the farm setting was very peaceful and near plenty of hiking spots. They especially enjoyed meeting the farm dogs! Would definitely book this house again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We just finished a delightful stay at Muriel‚Äôs farm. All went smoothly from booking, through arrival, during our stay, and at check out. We found the place very clean. The manual had useful, helpful information. The kitchen was well- equipped. Communication with Muriel was easy, with a quick response time.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice farm-stay home. It is simple but has all the things we as a couple needed.
We didn't take advantage of all the ‚Äúfarm‚Äù things the host offer but they were very nice.
It is very quiet and the HVAC and hot water are very effective. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen well appointed. The one odd thing is there are few window coverings which might disturb some, but it is so private it was not a concern to us."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so peaceful and quiet. Close to the wineries in Sonoita and fun in Patagonia. I loved sitting on the porch drinking my morning coffee and looking out to the lavender field... so special. AND the lavender smell is lovely. I needed to shut out the grind of work and home responsibilities and this place is the perfect place to do that.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had three friends staying here for a girl‚Äôs trip and I can fully recommend. It‚Äôs a beautiful setting and we were very comfortable. We definitely consider coming back. Thank you!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our 3 person group had a wonderful, peaceful stay at this farm retreat. The home was well stocked and very clean.

are stunning, and we enjoyed the outdoor firepit."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Muriel‚Äôs guest house! The house was comfortable and clean. It made for a beautiful and relaxing weekend getaway. Our daughters loved seeing the farm animals too! There were horses, goats, pigs and chickens for us to see. (There were roosters but they are a pleasant distance from the guest house. We could quietly hear the roosters but they did not wake us up.) Plus one of the dogs Leo was so friendly and great with the kids. The farm tour with Muriel was a fun addition to the stay. We had a great time and would happily return!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location! The area was so peaceful, especially in the evenings. We enjoyed the fire pit and it was so relaxing. We walked around and visited the horses, goats and baby goats! We saw chickens, roosters and pigs too. Leo is a lovely sweet beast!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! very clean and comfortable waking up to the animals was amazing.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievably nice house in a quiet location. On a working farm, but rarely heard any noise as the rooster is too far away to disturb a person. Great dogs, Leo and Lila. Kitchen full of pot, pans, dishes, could easily rent the place for a month!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little spot in a beautiful remote locations that‚Äôs still close to Tucson and Sierra Vista. Beautiful views!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay at the farm! My kids enjoyed walking over to visit with all of the farm animals and watching the barn cats from the front porch.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, cute home in a peaceful rural setting that is close to town and local wineries. Friendly and responsive host (and friendly dogs-a highlight). Enjoyed the quiet farm setting with lavender fields in our front yard. Amazing starry sky at night. So many nice wineries (Rune was our favorite) and had a great time eating dinner and enjoying music Thursday at the Cafe (Thanks for the recommendation Muriel)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wild Oak Farm is a peaceful spot for those looking to unwind and let go of the day-to-day. We went for an anniversary weekend. The cottage is comfortable and nicely appointed. Muriel is a wonderful, responsive host who does everything she can to ensure you have a great experience. Vineyards are a lovely 25 minute drive away. Bonus: Leo the farm dog is a giant sweetheart who appreciates ear rubs. :)
Tip: Sonoita is a friendly and peaceful town. Very worth the visit. It also has limited amenities. We brought a small cooler of food with us -- highly recommend bringing a few key supplies with you."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great stay! It was convenient to get to Sonoita and Patagonia. The accommodations were exactly as described and the place was cozy and private. Our kids loved checking out the animals on the farm, and the dogs on the property were so friendly."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We spent three nights here and wished we could have stayed longer. We‚Äôd happily book again! As other guests have noted, Leo ‚Äî the Great Pyrenees ‚Äî was a friendly ambassador for the property and I‚Äôm honestly going to miss him. At our request, Muriel took time one afternoon to introduce us to the horses, pigs, chickens and goats while sharing her story and casual insight into her experiences moving from city life to running a farm."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem. Muriel's lovely place was the perfect launching point for a few days enjoying the sights and trails of Southern Arizona. The location on the edge of Las Cienegas National Conservation Area was ideal, and idyllic.
The rooms, including kitchen and living room were absolutely great."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Spent the month of February at Wild Oak Farm. The house was spacious, clean and comfortable. The perfect location - close to beautiful mountains, hiking trails, Sonoita, Patagonia and even Tucson when the weather was cold. Muriel was very responsive - whenever we needed anything she was quick to help out. We had a wonderful vacation!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Wonderful place and Muriel was very helpful and responsive.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Clean. Friendly. Accommodating.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and unique house. Extremely comfortable and well equipped. It is set in the Arizona hills (something I didn't know existed until this trip). It is rural enough for a get away but convenient to towns with great restaurants and atmosphere. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Muriel's so much! Her big, fluffy, adorable dog greeted us upon arrival. The house was clean and comfortable. The kids loved walking around and seeing all of the different animals. What a fun place to stay - highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time staying here, I wanted a weekend getaway for my birthday and Muriel‚Äôs place was what came to mind! We went down to Patagonia and enjoyed the lake, stopped at a couple wineries and came back to make a yummy steak dinner! Perfect weekend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Muriel's for 3 nights and had a great time.
Muriel is really cool and a great host.
The house is spacious, clean, large kitchen, and there's a VCR!
Muriel offers farm tours where you get to interact with her sweet goats, pigs, and chickens. They are the friendliest and will come up to you for pets! She does a great job caring for them and if you want, you can help her feed and milk the goat.
Last but not least, LEO! Leo is Muriel's precious Great Pyrenees and is a sweet gentle giant. He greets you when you arrive home and will keep you company walking around the property.
Overall, it was a 5 star experience and highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home had everything we needed for our stay. The host was very responsive and helpful. Loved being greeted by her dogs as soon as we pulled up and even in the mornings when we woke and came outside! Wish we could have met the animals but time did not permit so I‚Äôd suggest leaving time for that if you decide to stay here!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,We had the absolute best time staying at Muriel‚Äôs place. Everything was very cute and plenty of space for the 6 of us. We opted to do the goat hiking with her and her daughter which was a real treat as well! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better and more relaxing time. Thank you!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"you so much Muriel for the perfect weekend. Very rarely do hubby and I have days off together, so it was such a joy to spend it at Wild Oak Farm! The house was excellent and very clean and homey. We definitely enjoyed all of the animals. The rooster made sure we were awake almost 24/7! My favorite was the goats of course. I did have the pleasure of meeting Muriels daughter who was super nice and introduced me to the goats!
The house was nicely stocked with pots and pans, silverware etc. we just brought our own food and even enjoyed some of the extras that were in the house. It was so nice to have the windows open all day and enjoy the chirping of the various birds and the sounds from the farm animals.
I would highly recommend this lovely getaway!
Thank you Muriel, hopefully we will visiting again in the near future.
Judi and Doug Day from Tucson"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, great experience overall! Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muriel‚Äôs place is a great place to stay to get away from the city and get some fresh air. The home was spacious and had a nice modern country look/feel to it. Leo (Muriel‚Äôs dog) is a huge fluff ball that was friendly and not over stepping. Muriel provided a folder with all the info we could possible need and even additional facts/events/activities to do and explore.
Thanks for everything Muriel!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful spot to take in nature and just relax.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful weekend getaway in Sonoita, AZ! If you need to unplug or if you are looking to book an Airbnb in the country, @wildoakfarm will exceed every expectation. Didn‚Äôt hurt that it is monsoon season, lending the most picturesque landscape. We had our littles with us and paid for a farm tour which was an excellent value in entertainment. We definitely want to return this fall."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely wonderful! As if Sonoita itself isn‚Äôt amazing enough, this is the most peaceful and pleasant place to stay and enjoy it. Close enough to wineries yet far enough to escape.
There are so many thoughtful things in the house - everything you‚Äôll need to keep your dog with you, the best stocked kitchen I‚Äôve seen at an airbnb, grilling tools and tons of outdoor seating.
Thank you SO much, we will definitely be seeing you again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at the cottage. It was charming, clean and quiet. Our kids loved all the farm animals."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Muriel‚Äôs place was an awesome getaway for me and my friends. We really enjoyed our stay and it was not far from all the wineries. It was a very fun and refreshing time. Thanks Muriel!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muriel‚Äôs little farm was a great little treat to get away to. It was quiet and remote, but yet close to eateries, wineries, etc.
Great host and was great with communication and getting back with us timely. Thanks Muriel !"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Muriel's guest cottage is PERFECT for families! We took our four kids (3 young children and 1 infant), and everyone had such a wonderful time. The guest cottage was private, had every amenity we could need, and was super clean. It honestly felt like we hadn't even left home.
We highly recommend Muriel's farm experience, too. Our kids loved getting an opportunity to feed the animals, milk the goats, and bottle-feed the baby goats. Muriel was patient and very knowledgeable. Her local recommendations - for food, for things to do, etc. - were also spot-on. Also, if you're interested in farm-fresh eggs or goat's milk cheese during your stay, don't hesitate to ask what she has available for purchase!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Muriel's place is great! Very clean but also rustic and farm. Nice clean updated kitchen and bathroom and clean comfortable house. Beds comfy esp the one in the ""blue room"". I had a great time petting the animals and the dogs. It is a rural setting and a farm so just be aware - I loved it but might not be everyone's cup of tea. Having the lavender plants and that scent right in the air around the farm just lovely. I think it would make a lovely writer's retreat for a longer stay - also kids would love it. Baby goats when I stayed!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay!
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This place was absolutely perfect for us on a girls wine trip! We had plenty of beds, such a great relaxing space, and lots of fun! The sonoita wine shuttle was amazing and completed our fun times. Muriel sells farm fresh eggs so we bought some for our breakfast and they were awesome! I would highly recommend this place for a couple, a family, and troop of girls on a wine tour. It was clean, spacious, and had everything we needed. Loved it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A fantastic place to stay. Easy access to wine country and a very relaxing place to kick your feet up for the stay. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a relaxing weekend.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location right in winery row. Very comfortable home.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderfully relaxing spot for those that love country living. The house set up is great for families, or travelers that like separate spaces.
My favorite time was early morning reading on the front porch with my coffee.
Close to everything, but perfectly set apart.
Great suggestions for local businesses.
Thank you so much.
We will definitely recommend!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying at the farm and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay again. The beds are so comfy, the house cozy and I love that our dogs can join us. Not to mention visiting our buddy Leo was also a highlight. Close to the wineries and Patagonia."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Muriel‚Äôs Airbnb is a spectacular spot! We stayed here with our large dog and 3 year old. Not once did either them feel as if they were in the way, and they both had accommodations just for them. There were dog bowls and a dog bed in the Airbnb. Our daughter played with the toy farm and sat at the child size table outside. As for my husband and I along with my parents and friend, we all enjoyed the quiet, the stars, all of Muriel‚Äôs animals (especially Leo), and felt very comfortable in the clean and cozy space. Muriel was very kind and approachable, and we can‚Äôt wait to stay at her beautiful place again!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Muriel‚Äôs place was amazing! We had so much fun hanging out with all the animals and the pups on the property are incredibly sweet. It‚Äôs a few miles from the wineries on a little farm oasis and we had the perfect winery getaway weekend. They are so kind and we can‚Äôt wait to visit again! We will definitely be back. :)
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! Our kids loved visiting the animals in the mornings and evenings (especially Leo the friendly Great Pyrenees) and we appreciated Muriel giving us a tour and letting the kids participate in feeding them. The area around the farm is so beautiful and it was a good central location for our day trips.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. The home is clean and comfortable. The location to Sonoita's wineries was ideal and we also loved the proximity to explore some of the Arizona Trail. We could have easily spent more time here but were just on a quick birthday getaway. The farm animals were also a highlight!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Muriel has a gracious host. She took our family on a farm tour and let the kids pet the animals and feed the goats. The house was clean and comfortable. The decor was very cute. The outdoor seating is nice, and it was great to see all the stars at night."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfy, perfect farm getaway. Kitchen is well stocked for cooking. Beds are comfy. We loved relaxing by the fireplace. Muriel was more than generous with her time to show our kid the animals. Definitely recommend!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Muriel‚Äôs place was very nice and convenient for wine tasting in the Sonoita area. It offered plenty of space for the six of us and great space outside for enjoying the yard and farm.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Flawless stay in a great location. The cottage at Wild Oak farm is very clean, in good condition and of a reasonable size. The sunsets and sunrises are fantastic, and the nights very quite. We used the cottage as a base to explore some local hiking trails and the location could not have been better. Check in and check out was very simple. Our hosts keep themselves to themselves but were available to answer any questions."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We spent two weeks at Wild Oak Farm, and except for the cooler than expected weather, had a lovely time! Muriel was an excellent host. She was very responsive when little issues arose, and went out of her way to give us suggestions for activities. One of the highlights of our stay was hiking with her and three of her goats on a section of the Arizona Trail! We also had a delightful tour of the farm, and met the goats, (pet) pigs, horses, chickens, roosters and dogs. There were lots of short hikes to do in the area (or longer ones if you are so inclined), and the farm was a convenient jumping off point for day trips - Nogales, Tubac, Tombstone and Bisbee. The accommodations were large. The two bedrooms were large and comfortable, and there were two sitting areas at opposite ends of the house that permitted the two of us (not a couple) to find comfortable spaces for our separate activities, e.g., yoga, zooming, reading, watching TV‚Ä¶. We mostly ate dinner in, and the kitchen was well equipped for cooking. The surroundings are beautiful, with mountain vistas."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is lovely and so adorable. It is perfectly equipped and quite convenient to Sonoita restaurants and wineries. The stars at night are beautiful.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were greeted by Leo the dog. Very friendly and fluffy. Directions were great we're from the area but it can always be tricky when going to a new rural spot.
Once inside a very bright and clean living space was found. Two spacious bedrooms with closet space available. Comfy beds in both rooms and a variety of pillows made it easy to have a wonderful night's sleep at this peaceful farm.
We traveled with our dog and we're grateful to have the old sheets in the utility room so he could keep the place clean.
There were board games, lawn games and cards that provided literally hours of entertainment. We really enjoyed our time here.
Our host was so kind to leave us farm fresh eggs in the fridge, and was a great communicator.
Highly recommend staying here if you're looking for some peace, out in the open space. The beautiful hills of the surroundings Sonoita area surround you."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here. The house was super comfy and well stocked. They even left us eggs from their farm in the fridge! We loved sitting on the covered porch where we got to enjoy a lightening storm in beautiful surroundings. A short drive to the wineries and a pretty drive to Parker Canyon Lake.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This a sweet little spot‚Äî newly renovated, but with great farmhouse charm. It‚Äôs an excellent getaway location. The dedicated farm greeters‚Äî a happy-go-lucky ‚Äúguard‚Äù dog and an orange barn cat‚Äî got us started on a great foot. Muriel topped it off with some great local recommendations, lovely surprise details in the guest house and a very low-key farm tour."

Muriel was also so generous with her time and toured us around the property and let us hang out with all her animals (we especially enjoyed getting to hold the baby goats). Muriel also made great family friendly/wine lover friendly recommendations (we went wine tasting one day, easy trip to the wineries). The home was clean and cozy (farm fresh eggs!) and we were made to feel right at home (if home was a cute farm). Thank you Muriel! We hope to come back one day soon."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved staying at Muriel's place. The location is fantastic, and the property is gorgeous. I had a great time petting the dogs and kitties, and enjoying the beautiful view. The house was very clean, and had everything I needed to be comfortable."

Would definitely recommend this place, and we look forward to returning!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved every minute of our stay. The cottage is immaculate and very comfortable. The hosts are lovely and very generous with their time if you so desire. I think Muriel's descriptions and instructions are very thorough and provided all information needed for a comfortable stay.
I could go on and on about how much fun we had. If you are visiting Sonoita, love animals and are interested in farm life, you will love staying at Muriel's place. Even if you are not so interested in farm life, it's still a relaxing and beautiful place to stay close to wine country. I promise you won't be disappointed!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in this darling little farm house. Muriel was a wonderful host and even gave us farm fresh eggs from her chickens.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muriel and Rob have created a beautiful sanctuary with every amenity provided. Sparkling clean with comfortable beds and great linens. We loved waking up to the peace of the Santa Rita and Sonora mountains nearby , the local wineries, the Arizona trail, the art scene in nearby Patagonia and the vast beauty of the desert prairie. A special thank you to our hosts for sharing the tranquility of their casita with us. We will definitely be back!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was exactly what we needed for a little R&R/recharge away from our normally busy lives! The house is super clean, well-appointed, and Muriel is easy to reach and super helpful. There were lots of thoughtful touches like puzzles and games, DVDs to watch, and even a white noise device (such a happy surprise since we had our 5 week baby with us and left ours at home!). There are plenty of outdoor chairs and a table to relax outside and take in the views of the rolling hills, the farm animals, and the starts! The BBQ grill worked great. We had a great stay and can't wait to return!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muriel's place is super comfortable and clean. It has sweet, tasteful furnishings and we would have stayed longer if we could. The location is very good for exploring around Sonoita and Patagonia. It was fun to meet the farm animals and we loved getting to hold the brand new baby goats. We hope to return for another visit in the coming year."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and the place was very clean. The wineries are about a 15 minute drive away which as a little further than what we would have liked but honestly not bad at all.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If we could rate Muriel‚Äôs place more than five stars we would. Let‚Äôs start with the welcoming committee of their Great Pyr Leo and cat Chochi (spelling). We literally were getting out of our vehicle and they were coming over to greet us! The house was adorable and super clean. The communication was excellent. The WiFi and even cellular reception was great. I even had to jump on a zoom call and had no issues at all with the WiFi which is surprising since the location seems so remote. We enjoyed stargazing, the fireplace outside and especially all of the farm animals. It was so cool to be able to see the new baby goat Alex and for my daughter to be able to hold him. The place is so charming, fully stocked with all that you may need and a fantastic vibe all the way around. Bonus points for gorgeous farm-fresh eggs for us in the morning. We will definitely be back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 loved our stay. The guesthouse is spacious and included a bunch of thoughtful extras like W/D plus hamper and soap, lots of DVDs, games, and crayons for our toddler, and a blender. It was colder than expected during our visit, with some snow flurries one morning, but the heater worked well to keep us comfortable and toasty. The location is hard to beat - we visited Tucson, the lake in Patagonia, and when we return hope to visit some of the wineries. Most of all, our son loved visiting the animals, especially when Muriel let him go ""egg hunting."" We enjoyed Leo the dog's friendly visits."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This has been our favorite family Airbnb experience. Muriel was kind with her time and educated my daughter about life on a farm. We can't wait to return. Leo the farm protector was a hit with the family!! The location is close to wine country and other attractions in the area like Patagonia, Tombstone and Bisbee. Ample room for our family in the guest house and super clean. Kitchen was highly convenient. Highly recommend."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of three (including our 2 year old) had a wonderful stay at Muriel's. The house was clean and comfortable with everything we needed. The farm was peaceful and quiet. Muriel is a warm, friendly host, and it was great chatting with her while visiting all the animals."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muriel was a phenomenal host and the property was equally incredible! Muriel walked us through her farm, introduced us to her animals, and answered all of our burning questions about farm living. The dogs and cats on site were so friendly and really set the tone for our whole trip!
The guest house was immaculate! Nicely decorated with all the amenities one would need. The location was very convenient to Sonoita/Elgin wine country. And at night - the stars were unbelievable!
Will absolutely stay again!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Where to start! The family, the farm, the proximity to other cities, the actual house‚Äîit‚Äôs all perfect! First, if I moved to southern Arizona, I would move to Sonoita just to be friends with Muriel and her family‚Äîthey are the coolest. And so are their animals. Every morning their 125 lb. guard dog and friendly barn cat would greet my son and I at our door and escort us over to the farm. Muriel‚Äôs daughter taught my little one how to milk a goat. We also got to touch horses, pigs, and chickens! Muriel sent us on little adventures to towns I‚Äôd never heard of like Bisbee and Patagonia. Finally, while the house is spotless (White counters, white shelves, white sheets, white floors), it does not feel sterile or unwelcoming. To the contrary, there were personal little shabby chic and artistic touches throughout that made the home feel very unique and cozy. This is the first time that I have not been ready to move on from an AirBnB after a week. The whole experience was enchanting."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Muriel‚Äôs farm was our favorite place to stay at ! The place had everything we needed and much more :) We were very lucky to meet Muriel and her family, we enjoyed interacting with the animals on the farm (our dog too!) and loved its peacefulness! Muriel gave us great tips to explore the area which were super helpful. We would love to stay again sometime soon ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location tucked away. Some minor things that weren‚Äôt horrible but just to know. Roosters like to crow at all times throughout the night (won‚Äôt hear unless you‚Äôre a light sleeper). The house heats unevenly and some rooms are toasty while others were chilly at night. Outside of that I would recommend.
2021-01-01,4,Stayed about a week,Great place and location for what we needed. Host was very nice and responsive.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Muriel‚Äôs home is exactly what we needed for a little getaway from Tucson. We caught an amazing sunset and met the farm animals on our first night. Our dog gained a new best friend through Leo, the gentle giant. The spot was spacious and very modern farmhouse. We spent the new year in Sonoita and went to Rune and Deep Sky, our favorite vineyards and not too far from the Airbnb. We ate prime rib from Copper Brothel Brewery, which we 100% recommend. There were so many added touches that made the stay great; we loved the white noise machine and humidifier- we ended up ordering the humidifier as soon as we used it! The barn cat will immediately become your best friend so be prepared, we loved him. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Muriel was very hospitable and the place was clean and cozy. lots of space for the kids and our pets to explore, and the family had a great time meeting the all the farm animals."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Newly remodeled, cute place in a location that blends a quiet, remote location with close proximity to Sonoit, Patagonia, and wineries. Muriel was terrific and my only regrets are that I didn‚Äôt get to meet her goats,horses and pigs and that a five-star review will make this place too tough to book."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"PERFECT
A clean, spacious, great location, and good value and Muriel was such a tremendous host. She wanted us to have the greatest all round experience. The cottage was absolutely perfect. All worked great and was clean and the added plus of having a full washer and dryer especially after our long dirty days of hiking on the nearby Arizona trail. And it was a great addition to be able to have ""the animal"" experience, as I rarely get the chance to, as she gave me a nice tour of her family of horses, goats, pigs, chickens, dogs, and a cat. Jan and I hope to return soon. Thanks"
2020-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,Very nice love the place would do it again
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our young family of five had an amazing time at this AirBnB. The house was comfortable and well-furnished and the location was peaceful and beautiful - with Madera canyon in one direction and the Empire Ranch historic site/conservation area the other. The highlight, though, was the farm stay experience. Our kids milked goats, collected eggs, held chickens, fed pigs, pet horses, and played with the cats and dogs. Muriel was very generous with her time and answered 100s of questions from our inspired kids every day."
