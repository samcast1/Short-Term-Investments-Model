My son enjoyed the big TV and access to all the video services and my wife enjoyed coffee on the patio in the mornings and that there was a fan available for white noise at bedtime.

Since we were traveling the week of Christmas, it was decorated better than my own home! A little Christmas tree in the living room, and other Christmas lights in our bedroom and a beautiful Christmas candle arrangement. There were also Christmas cookies on a plate waiting for us, which my husband was delighted to enjoy!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect place to get away with our family. We spent a few nights making memories with our little children.

The place was spotless and extremely family-friendly. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area."

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We stayed at the house in January. It was cozy and comfortable even with the cold and misty weather.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’m conflicted. If I tell everyone how nice this place is, and how nice the hosts are, it’ll be booked the next time we want to stay here. And there will be a next time. Nothing was bad, so not trying to pick, but the water pressure was a little low and one bedroom is a little small. But, the good is so good! Immaculate and attention to detail. The house is excellent for the number we had (7), plus our daytime visitors (6 more). The open dining/kitchen/living area is large and comfortable. The view is amazing. The amenities are perfectly thought out. The hosts have really attempted to think of everything. No details were overlooked. Every door worked, every switch, every appliance, worked. The paint and trim were good, the cleanliness was perfect. This was absolutely the cleanest and best kept property we - or anyone in our family - has rented. So well kept and organized, it felt like home the moment we arrived. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this property and the hosts."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was as described in listing. Hosts were very responsive and quick to answer any questions. Dishes and cookware was a lot better than most places we have stayed. They did good job decorating it for holidays as we were celebrating Christmas with our kids and grandkids.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house! Two Christmas trees were lit up when we arrived, wonderful welcome surprise. The place looked and smelled clean. The swivel chairs facing the lake was a favorite place to sit and enjoy a beverage and relax.
The kitchen was very well appointed and had everything you could need. It was very organized and loved the labels on the light switches so you don’t have to turn switches on and off to find the one you need.
Favorite feature that is almost never found in any rental is 3 king size beds and the bathrooms had a lot a lot of towels.
Bottle water was much appreciated."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place exceeded our expectations. It is a beautiful newly renovated location. Every room was sparkling clean and beautifully decorated. They’ve thought of everything and the kitchen was more stocked than my kitchen at home. The view was spectacular. It was private and peaceful and we basically had the entire lake to ourselves for fishing and kayaking. We had teenagers and a young one and all had a great time.

We will be back!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was perfect! The perfect size, my fiancé was home on leave from the marine corps looking at enrolling in school at ISU. What stood out to me was the full kitchen. It gave me the opportunity to make food for him that he’s been missing out on, complete with everything you could possibly need. Power went out during our stay and Billie had notified me and got it back on before I ever notice. Very successful trip!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we were very happy with the house, it was so homey! We could live there! Beautiful river view with only woods on the other side, so pretty and peaceful. We will definitely be back ( we only had a chance to see half of the covered bridges in the area!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time staying at Billie’s home. We love the area, the river is right there, it’s secluded and very quiet. We get to see fish jump in the river, squirrels, ground hog, rabbits and deer across the river. The house is always very clean, fully stocked and everything is easy to find There’s a great place to sit outside under the porch and a bench by the fire pit and recently added is a log to sit on right next to the river. This time we met Billie’s husband, what wonderful man. We had a couple great conversations and learned a little history about the area. He was also telling me about the storms on July 4th and the tree that fell. Also that he brought down window air conditioners and a generator for those guests until the power came back on. This is a great place to stay with some really great hosts!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Billie and John went above and beyond!
a terrible storm had electrical lines down All over the city of Terre Haute, trees were down and even hotels did not have electricity.
When we arrived, our host, John was installing a generator and window units for our bedrooms and turning the water on for us.
The house was exquisitely clean!
I wish I could have given it 10 stars and I would have. Everything was absolutely perfect and it was a lovely spot on the river.
Billie made sure we had everything we needed!
Fortunately, our power came on a few hours after we arrived, and John came and removed the generator and removed our window units.
We had a wonderful wonderful stay! I would not hesitate to rent this lovely Little House On the River! You won't be sorry!"

Billie's attention to the little details was one of the things that truly made the stay special- from the luxury hand soaps to the cozy towels. The shower head in the master bath is AWESOME!!!

The entire space is wonderful but, most important, ALL of the beds are super comfortable! Tons of hot water, a well-stocked pantry and all of the sheets and towels are scented! You may not think this touch is important but, after a very long day, a hot shower and a fluffy towel then snuggling into a fresh bed is heaven! Oh and the view is to die for! Nature everywhere! Jumping fish in the river, lots of birds. I can imagine it is challenging to find this little gem in the dark of night but we made a point of arriving during the day and only had to turn around once:) Once you know where it is, it is SO convenient! It feels like your out in the country but there are chain stores less than 2 miles away. We will definitely stay at Billie's place if we are ever in the area again!"
2020-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Billie's place was comfortable and pleasant, and the location by the river is lovely.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome! Came for a visit with our son whom attends ISU. Perfect location!! Place was just as described! Sparkling clean!! Very cozy!! Really enjoyed all the special touches in the home! The view of the river was beautiful at sunset! Enjoyed our morning coffee on the cute swing hanging from a tree below while enjoying the view of the water!! Would highly recommend staying here and can’t wait to get back ourselves!!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean cottage with homey touches. Difficult to find in the dark - so arrive early. Would definitely stay again."

2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful spot to get away! Billie was great and answered all my questions.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet spot by the river, but not far from downtown."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful location and was easy access to highways and Bridge Festivals. The house was spotless and the view of the river amazing. We utilized the fire pit 2 nights with the river as our backdrop.
All the beds were comfortable and we used the kitchen table for our traditional family travel activity.
We will highly recommend this host and house and hope to stay here again."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice place to stay in Terre Haute. Owner was proactive with communication and helped when I needed to book another night on short notice.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Quiet, well-furnished, and great communication from the hosts!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a relaxing weekend! Everything we needed was there for grilling out, cooking meals and sitting down by the river. The view is amazing and we saw bald eagles on more than one occasion! When we inquired about a local bait shop John brought us down some bait that he had on hand and was very nice to chat with. Everything was clean and comfy! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to unwind. Thank you Billie and John!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cute house. Clean house with all necessities . Peaceful lake front property .
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay as usual!
The bed in the master was a bit uncomfortable because of the rubber mattress protector. Besides that, it was a great stay"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Looking forward to the next time we are in Terra Haute so we can stay at Billie's Place.It is in a great location by the Wabah River; everything you need is provided and Billie is an exceptional host.

2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Billie's house was perfect for our visit. It was extremely clean and very comfortable, beautifully decorated and provided everything that we needed. Her directions brought us directly to the house. We also really appreciated the quiet and privacy. We hope to stay there again."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Billie's place was perfect for a nice relaxing weekend. It was very hot, so we unfortunately did not get to spend a lot of time by the river, but we did enjoy it as much as we could tolerate the heat! We went to a couple of museums and had the BEST hamburgers at Charlie's Pub and Grill! The beds were super comfy and the house had everything we needed. We really appreciated the cold water and diet drinks when we arrived! We will be returning to this place in the Fall when it is much cooler outdoors! Loved it!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed in Terra Haute at Billie’s place. It was our first time ever using an Airbnb and has definitely set high standards. Very spacious and clean, with a gorgeous view. We didn’t get to enjoy the river too much due to the weather, but it was lovely to look at from the hillside. Close enough tot the main road for quick access, but also secured enough that we didn’t hear any traffic noise. 100% recommend."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I were in town for a grad school residency and we were absolutely thrilled to find Billie’s place! The cottage is charming, clean, well-equipped, and peaceful. We loved the view of the river. It was the perfect place for our stay and we plan to stay here for future residencies."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! All the amenities you can imagine great kitchen to cook in beds very comfortable. Watch the sunset over the river.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very impressed with the view and the house. Very well stocked place, anything and everything a person could need. Beds were comfy, and the host warned me about GPS not being correct. Thank you for that. Recommend to anyone looking."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,Billie's home was sparkling clean and thoughtfully furnished. We enjoyed seeing the antique toys on display. We especially enjoyed the generous supply of towels. The spacious kitchen was perfect for preparing a family brunch. The view of the Wabash river was lovely! I would happily stay here again!
2019-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The blue river house is exactly as described, and located right next to the Wabash River. The house is accommodating for a short stay, tastefully decorated, and kept very clean inside."
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely place that was quaint, quiet, and really comfortable. Billie is a gracious host who responded very quickly and went out of her way to take care of anything we needed. Highly recommend!"

Peaceful
Quaint
A lovely space on the river..."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was very welcoming and very clean! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Wabash River House is extremely clean! It is in a quiet area where we saw 3 eagles roosting across the river! I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a nice place to stay in Terre Haute. Not far from the shopping areas and restaurants, either."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was very pleased with this house. Stayed here while visiting with my son who is at Indiana State University. It is only a few minutes from campus. As another person shared in their rating, the house was nicer than I anticipated from looking at the pictures. Very cute decorations (quilts, rocking chair, covered bridge photos). We had a beautiful sunset that we could see from the house one of the nights we stayed. It was very peaceful to sit outside and watch the river. House was well stocked and was very clean.Beds in the bedrooms were very comfortable. When we had trouble with the TV, hosts quickly responded they would come help, but we figured it out before they got there. On the downside, even though we were notified that the GPS would not route us correctly to the house, we got a little lost following the directions emailed to us by the host. Once we knew where the house was, it was a breeze to locate. Would stay there again on another visit."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great view of the river from the house! Exactly as pictured, and included extras like full size shampoo and body wash, nicely stocked kitchen, etc. Very pleased with our stay!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean , very nice place to stay. Had a great stay, felt very homey and sure beats a hotel room. Great view of the river, nice outdoor sitting area and grill. Super clean and relaxing a+"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is larger than we expected with beautiful views of the Wabash River and very comfortable and clean. Wish our schedule had allowed us to put and enjoy it more!! Highly recommend and hope to return at some point. Thanks, Billie & John!!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Billie,
It was a nice place, clean, comfortable, quiet, friendly neighbor and an excellent view of the river.
When I will come again to Terre Haute, I will definitely choose it."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Billie's place was great. The directions provided by Billie to arrive were spot on. The location is better than it appears in the picture, the river felt closer than it looked online. Billie's place was spotless and had tons of comforting touches. I think with AirBNB we all expect ""home away from home"" and Billie's place meets (if not exceeds) that relaxing expectation. Billie's place was close to a ton of attractions and not far from IU."
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a GREAT place, a GREAT host, and a GREAT location. You will love it!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Billie’s place is amazing, it is so cozy and stylishly decorated with great photography and furnishings.

A quiet, relaxing place to stay along the river!"

2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Billie's place was perfect for us. The house was pristine and so comfortable! The amenities were plentiful and we wanted for nothing! Billie was quick to respond anything we called, yet gave us privacy. It was a lovely stay, and we will definitely be back again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! Love the coziness and amenities -- feel right at home!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cottage was truly cozy! It's nestled in a quiet area, though super close to food/shopping, etc. Our host was very informative and nice. This home has everything you need, even keeping stock of some basic necessities, toiletries, etc., which was very helpful as we had forgotten some things. It was a great cozy place to come back to after a busy weekend with my sister's wedding. It was such a lovely stay and we would definitely stay here again next time we are here to visit family."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super adorable!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Probably our best Airbnb stay yet!! Such a cozy and charming little cottage! So clean, fully stocked, we wanted for nothing. They truly thought of everything! Very quiet neighborhood. Super pet friendly! We truly appreciated the fully fenced backyard. It was clean as well! (If you take your pets, please do your part and pick up after them in the yard)
Communication was great- just an easy stay. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The house was cozy, just as described! Travis was responsive to my messages, even on Christmas Eve, when we were planning to check in on Christmas day. Our dogs loved the fenced yard! Travis provided lots of amenities like candy, bottled water, dog bags, etc. The only suggestion I have would be to try to lubricate or replace the bed frame in the back bedroom - any little movement resulted in a creaking noise, which woke us up some at night. Otherwise, it's a great little house for a Terre Haute visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt right at home!
Lovely decorations and amenities."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I've stayed at Travis's 5+ times now and it never disappoints!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We will definitely stay again when we visit the Haute! So happy we chose this cute little cozy place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, clean, and cozy. Everything we needed was there. Quiet area—loved being on the corner lot. Would definitely stay again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful and relaxing time! It was so cutely decorated and so many details and things provided to make our stay very enjoyable. We will definitely come back!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Friendly and responsive host with a cute little house with everything you need for a weekend stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great private location, cottage had everything you could need and more. Loved it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great 2 day stay. Easy to find and get around from that location. had clear instructions in house which was nice. Everything that was listed was on site.
The only thing i would love to see is some ceiling fans to help circulate air. That is my personal prefence as i have them in most rooms in my house.
But a great stay and better than hotel as traveling to see family and area and this was the midway point to travel farther south.
Would stay again if availble."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I rode up to go to a concert and we enjoyed our stay! It felt like going to a quiet cottage! We actually never saw another person going or coming from the property. It was very easy to get to! I will definitely return next time I'm ready to rock!! LOL
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was adorable and perfect for what I was looking for. The fenced in back yard was great to hang out in with the puppers without worry of her running off. The cottage itself was clean and cute! Travis is a great host and I will definitely be keeping this place in mind for future trips!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved everything about it. Except my friend was blind and they had little rugs in a few places. They made decor so cute. But kept tripping hee. But I just picked them up until our stay was over. Then placed them back down for next person visit. Would definitely go back. The pups loved the back yard.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Quiet neighborhood with restaurants and interstate close by. The place was very clean inside and out. A storm had went through prior to my check in. Most other yards had limbs and debris but this was all cleaned up. I travel with my pillow and forgot it. Didn’t realize until I got home and Travis was willing to ship it to me but my brother was still in town at a campground with his family and Travis got my pillow to him for me. Pillows aren’t much money but it was mine and he made sure I got it back. Great stay. Thanks.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend. Great place and great host!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent host. Well stocked home and it has everything you can possibly need for your stay.
Was my second time renting from Travis and will not be my last. 😊"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and clean. It’s a nice place that’s thoughtfully put together and accommodating. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a place in Terre Haute.
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This place had everything you need they even had pet bowls and a pet bed. The location was 3 3-4 minutes away from restaurants and shopping areas. Just be aware that beds are very loud you can here someone moving in another room. And also make sure the airbnb is spotless because the cleaning fee doesn't cover dishes even its very few, also be sure to get everything out the fridge unless you want to be charged"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, everything we needed. Water bottles and some snacks a nice addition."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Helpful and answered quickly. Close to town and nice yard!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the place. My only c/o was there were no handrails to get up and down the steps at the front and back door. My son is handicapped, uses a walker. great difficulty getting him in and out. Also, due to the closeness of the furniture I walked him from place to place without his walker inside the house.
It was my fault, as I did not pay attention to detail in the pictures. I have learned something to inquire about for my next AirB&B stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My parents really like this house. They appreciated all the preparation and decoration in the house, and they thought it was the best place in Terre Haute."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for another great stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay while in Terre Haute!! We were there for a soccer tournament and it had everything we needed and more!! Very welcoming fee and lots of ‘extras’… they definitely thought of everything!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I’ve booked with Travis and would gladly book again. Home was clean and cozy. He goes the extra mile to make your stay as comfortable as possible.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Travis lives up to being a super host! The fenced in yard with no holes was a great space for the dogs! The soda and water pre-stocked in the fridge was also very nice. Having a nearby butcher shop within walking distance and a nice grill made for a good time! The dogs were very comfortable as was I and my daughter.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In addition to all the basics—cleanliness, convenience, good communication, etc., the place was so homey and had everything you could think of on hand. From bandaids to dog towels to good WiFi, it was so easy to settle right in. If you needed a longer stay in the area, this place could be your home."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I would stay here again. the place is very clean, and the spices, drinks, etc, that were provided by Travis were nice. no extra charge for bringing my dog."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay in the “Cozy Cottage”. It was perfect for our needs while in Terre Haute. If I ever return I would stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a comfortable home base while my sister and I visited family. The neighborhood was very quiet. The cottage was small, but well equipped with anything you might need, including books, games, bath products, kitchen equipment, etc. It felt like a true home and we appreciated the ability to do laundry."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fourth stay in the last year and Travis's place continues to feel like a home away from home!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Property was exactly as pictured and described. Very well stocked kitchen. Travis was very easy to communicwte with concerning questions that came up during stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to come to after traveling. Back yard was great for our dog. Everything was very easy and really clean! Recommended to others already.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Repeat visitor! We have stayed several times from 2 days to 2 weeks. Perfect size for a couple to visit college student, work remotely and have pets along for the trip. A home away from home - cozy cottage has everything needed for short stay or for longer stay. Appreciate Travis and all that he does to make the stay comfortable and convenient. Love the Cozy Cottage ❤️"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is awesome!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for my family. Quiet neighborhood, good yard for our pet to run. Travis’ place is as described and has everything you would need! We love staying here when we’re in town."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,another great stay at the cozy cottage for christmas. we were within walking distance to our kids and grandkids for christmas. they had a christmas tree and decorations up which made the stay more enjoyable.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Not only was the cottage charming, but I didn’t expect to find it decorated for Christmas. The tree was up, decorations in each room…it really felt like I was either home or in a relatives house. Just a short drive to Starbucks, Crackerbarrel , the Mall and all kinds of great restaurants. I will definitely try to stay here again if it’s available."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second stay and was just as great or even better than the first. The place was decorated so lovely for the holidays and really felt so at home. One of the best Airbnbs!!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Travis place was nice, it was smaller than expected but still manageable, the only issue that we had was that it was fairly clean but a bit dusty. I don't know if the cleaing detail didn't do a thorough job last time but it wasn't a deal breaker, we would stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’m very satisfied with this listing and will definitely book again. Just as advertised!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Travis’s homes in the past, and they are always clean, well-kept and very comfortable. You won’t find a better value for your money than this."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cozy house is the perfect place to spend a weekend or a large stay in Terra Haute. Quiet and safe neighborhood and excellent location.
The best part was the fenced backyard where our doggies were able to roam free.
Thank you Travis for having us and we will be back !!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Do not hesitate to stay at this wonderful Cozy Cottage. It sets the standard for cozy. So many extra touches adds extra charm and delight. It is centrally located In a quiet neighborhood. If I had a BNB I’d definitely model it after the Cozy Cottage.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place, just as described"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay while visiting our RHIT student. Travis went above and beyond stocking the house-- snacks and drinks, coffee and creamer, plastic wrap/foil/ziploc bags, books and games, extra towels and blankets. We didn't bring our dog but it was nice to have the option. I usually don't book pet friendly places because of allergy and cleanliness concerns, but this place was super clean and there were no allergy issues at all! Unfortunately it is not available for our next scheduled visit- we would definitely book again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the best furnished home we have stayed in! Pillows and sheets were amazing! Very convenient location. Everything you could have needed! Our grandson found the toys immediately.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have three puppers, and have stayed in a LOT of Airbnbs over the years, and can honestly say that Travis's place was one of the best ones I've ever stayed at. There aren't a lot of airbnbs to come by in Terre Haute, and especially not that live up to this one. I am attending a program thru ISU and have to be on campus about once a month. I live in Oklahoma and absolutely plan on getting this place for as many stays as possible!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very cozy place! We would recommend it to anyone!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay! He thought of the “extras” that made it seem like home. We would consider staying again.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Travis’s properties are perfect.
Just enough room.
The outside space is perfect for the pups.
And he supplies you with plenty of things you may need for your stay.
This is my second time staying in Travis’s places…and it couldn’t be more perfect!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and great place to stay! This was our second time at this house. Great!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Relaxing place to stay in evenings after busy days with 3 reunions
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was amazing. The house was stocked well and even had little extras for the fur babies. The house sits on a nice quiet street and is super close to everything.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was traveling as a single female with my daughter and felt very comfortable and safe in this home. Everything was as described, and better. Things were clean and well kept, and the towels and linens were comfortable and fluffy. There were thoughtful details around the home such as travel toiletry items in the bathroom, snacks in the kitchen, and many well placed notes with useful information (local interests, restaurants, emergency information, etc.) Travis was also easy to communicate with and a pleasant host. I plan to return when in Terre Haute again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A very comfy, well-equipped spot that was a good price. Would certainly stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have stayed at this location. before.. always a pleasure.. this time the AC went out and Travis had someone out ASAP to get it repaired. Things happen, and I understood, so it was nice he was so receptive and prompt. I travel with my bulldogs so this could’ve taken a bad turn, and I felt to be in good hands with Travis managing the property and repair."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Another great stay Best in town
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good host!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well folks, if you’ve ever wondered what excellence was like, stay here for a couple nights and you’ll never look at other Airbnb places the same. From the rapid, clear communication to the clean, quiet house to the beverages/snacks, games/books to the fully stocked kitchen, everything about this stay broke the 5-star system. AC was cold but quiet, fenced in backyard if you bring your dog and no noise from interstate or busy roads or wild neighbors.
The one thing I will caution you on, is after staying here, other Airbnb’s won’t be as appealing. Travis really did set the bar incredibly high and I miss the fun times our family had while staying here."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very pet friendly with great amenities! Onsight laundry facilities are convenient. Awesomely decorated for the season/holiday! Located next to many restaurants and other stores. There is a butcher within walking distance that has many different meats, sausages, etc. that are great to grill on the BBQ in the backyard. Travis is always available to answer questions and such."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! I cannot get over all the amenities and how well the kitchen/laundry area was stocked. It’s the best for traveling with my dogs. I’ll be staying basically all summer and the back yard is fantastic.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis communicated quickly and was so thoughtful. He left the porch light on for me when I told him I would arrive after dark. This place is appropriately named. It is cozy, comfortable and very clean. It was decorated for Easter, which was so sweet. There was candy, cokes, popcorn and water and tons of extras like condiments and spices. The bed was as or more comfortable than my own. I slept deep and woke refreshed. I originally inquired about one that was bigger hosted by a lady named April, but when I asked her if it was in a safe neighborhood, it must have made her mad because she said she wanted to wait for someone staying longer than 5 nights. Im glad she did cause I got the best deal and much cuter home. Travis is a great host and this cottage is close to everything. If I have to come back for business, I hope to stay again in this cozy cottage."

BBQs on the gas grill , too, and that was a treat! The home is close to every store and restaurant you need and is also just minutes from the university, too. We would stay here again most definitely!"

We originally planned to stay at his place on our way out to the east coast from Colorado. However, Travis told us the day before that the previous tenant had tested positive for COVID-19. My husband and I were driving cross country to see my (elder, cancer surviving) parents, and the honesty was invaluable. I know some people will value, well, location and beauty over honesty, so I put that first! But his honesty and integrity is what puts Travis over the top! Thank you Travis! Due to this reason, we opted to stay with Travis as we drove back from PA to CO."

This home was the perfect fit for them! This place packs a punch for being well equipped and anticipating a travelers' needs. My family was so happy in this space, so I wanted to share my niece's personal words for this review:
""The Cozy Little Cottage is an AirBnB gem! The host(s) have truly thought of every little detail to make your stay a truly comfortable and memorable one. Between the super thoughtful and generous amenities (and generous is almost an understatement) to the cozy and inviting decor and cottage set-up, this place is a fantastic little getaway. It’s quaint but roomy, tucked away in a quiet little neighborhood area, and everything you need (and we mean everything- the host was even generous enough to have cold drinks and condiments in the fridge!) is within reach. Every space in the cottage is well thought out, efficient and very clean! We felt like we were staying in the very welcoming, very comfortable home of a good friend or family member. Wish every place was as lovely as this one! The guest book is a testament to the amazing job the host(s) have done and continue to do! If there were more stars, we’d happily give more than 5!"""

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about this house! It’s so charming. The pictures don’t do it justice. Angie keeps it amazingly clean. She has towels, extra toiletries, extra pillows, games, puzzles…you name it. We felt right at home from the moment we walked in. We had a binder full of local places to visit. So helpful. Angie was on top of all communication. My daughter now lives in Illinois and Terre Haute is the halfway point. We will definitely be staying here again!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed in the Blue Maiden for 3 months due to work and found it had everything I needed and more. Angela was so kind and wonderful about communicating with me. I loved the beautiful touches of history found throughout the house. When I told Angela that I enjoyed cooking she went above and beyond buying pots and pans and other items to ensure I could cook at the house. I cannot recommend this air bnb stay more. I would absolutely stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home is quaint and peaceful. Being a past local I enjoyed the update of local places to visit and enjoy. When my next trip back to Terre Haute, I will definitely check to see the availability"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Angela’s place made us feel right at home! Extremely responsive host and we felt safe and comfortable. Super comfy beds and had all that we needed. Historical area of Terre Haute!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The blue Maiden was charming! As we walked into the house and stood in the living room, we felt transported back time.
This 145 year old home was spotless and cozy. it
was like we were visiting grandmother's house. The Blue Maiden is close to everything, easy to find
and clean. We recommend you try Moggers. Great food and interesting decor. Ask about the underground tunnels."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue Maiden is a beautiful home in a great location.
The decor is beautiful and our trip to Terre Haute was made even more wonderful by our time spent here. Angela was a fantastic host, making sure the home was stocked with all we needed to feel right at home. We especially appreciated bottled water in the fridge and fresh fruit. There was also coffee, milk, and creamer.
Communication was excellent prior to and all throughout our stay.
We have family in Terre Haute and we for sure will book again at the Blue Maiden next time we plan a visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice house. Enough space for several people. Easy access to everything in Terre Haute.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy in and out location off of 41. Decor was very cozy & modern. Only complaint, I like my bed softer than what was provided. Still slept well both nights."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,very clean and comfortable.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an absolutely perfect place for our visit to Rose-Hulman. The place was within walking distance of a wonderful Indian restaurant, and the home was very clean and charming. Angela was also very responsive with communication. Highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Well appointed house. Host has every detail that you might need already taken care of. Beautifully decorated. Nice quiet neighborhood. We stayed here the weekend of my son’s graduation from Rose-Hulman and I wish I had discovered it sometime in the 4 years prior. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely will book again! Very modern looking house with a great amount of space. We stayed with a party of 4 for 3 nights, and none of us had any complaints. Restaurants were extremely accessible within 10-15 min drive. The beds were amazing, so comfortable that we ended up asking Melina for the exact bedding to purchase for ourselves! Of course, she was very accessible too and quick to respond. Overall 10/10 would definitely recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,this place was amazing for our small group. great place for us to stop and relax after a long day of driving. had plenty of space and some unique spaces in that as well. loved it
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Cute place,
My son was graduating from ISU so I brought my family and in-laws in we slept there, and there was plenty of room, we had 6, great kitchen and gathering space as we able to some of my sons friends over for lunch over the weekend. it was very nice to. E able to gather there
A lot of thought went into the place with the design and finishing touches , well done like a and spacious loft area was really cute. Many design and finishing touches to make you feel at home.
Upon arrival, it looked like there was had some things was out of place. I reached to Medina immediately within 20 minutes she had her service there to put things back in place and to insure that our stay was “best in class “
Im in construction management and have build many boutique hotels in Chicago. Her product and service toward her guests was excellent and would be fitting to be associated
I’d highly recommend staying there if you’re in the area, good price, great place, caring owner."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful space for my friends and I! Match the pictures and well worth the price. Great location!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great cute home, very clean and a nice neighborhood! We would stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We stayed here at a special time of the total solar eclipse. We had friends join us and stay an extra day and that proved no problem for Melina to accommodate us. The house is unique and beautifully updated with an entire 2nd floor suite that is special. We enjoyed the deck in the backyard on a beautiful spring night. Very nice place.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully renovated home. The beautiful fireplace, bathroom, and bed are in an attic with slanted roofs. not well suited for taller individuals."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the second I booked the place, Melina was a very proactive and informative host who provided top-notch hospitality. She provided clear instructions and was very flexible with check-in. The place was impeccable and looked like a model home, just beautifully designed. I highly recommend this place and will be staying again on our next visit to Terra Haute. Thanks, Melina!!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The space was beautiful and exactly what we needed. Melina was very responsive and helpful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melina’s Airbnb was AMAZING! Beautifully decorated, clean, plenty of room, tastefully designed, and comfortable beds. It was so nice after a stressful day to go back and turn in a fireplace or relax in the gorgeous tub. She had snacks waiting for us when we arrived and was in constant communication with me. I was very impressed with the entire experience. I will definitely be booking again whenever I am back in town. Thank you, Melina for being top notch"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Melina's place was a great stay for my team who had meetings at the Terra Haute Convention Center. Excellent location not too far from anything that was mostly quiet aside from the occasional trains that run through, but that would have been anywhere in Terra Haute.
Upstairs is a bit tight, but the space is definitely sufficient and plenty of space for everyone who stayed."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Melina was easy to work with and her place was beautiful very spacious downstairs and plenty of kitchen supply but the upstairs ceiling is too low/ challenging.
It’s probably OK for children or very short people."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Melina put together an amazing place! Super clean and a great interior. The beds were also really comfortable. Melina was also very helpful and responsive during my stay. I highly recommend this place!

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Very cute and charming place. Would stay again for sure!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"I cannot tell you enough how amazing this Airbnb experience was. I have never had a host go to such lengths to make sure your experience was as comfortable as possible. From a mini coffee bar to bath salts, they made sure you had everything you could ever need for your stay. After a long day traveling we got the code and entered, and we had coffee and water right there waiting for us with clear instructions in a binder and a welcome note on the counter. I will definitely repeat my stay!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Nice area close to shopping.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was absolutely darling, very clean and we enjoyed our time."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was a perfect place to stay over the Holidays. Melina provided clear, concise, and easy to understand instructions for every detail of check in, the stay, and check out. The home has a wonderful porch and deck to sit and enjoy the evening or early morning coffee. Multiple exits/entrances so that individual family members can leave without disturbing other family members if needed. The home has the amenities that are stated in the description and are in working order."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,We liked it so much we stayed there again
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Melina was a fantastic host! House was clean and was helpful throughout the stay!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Melina was such a great host. Very accommodating, great communication, and felt we were well taken care of. As others have mentioned, the upstairs is not for taller people. What I didn't realize was there is no door in the upstairs bedroom which is quite a hindrance when you have little kids sleeping early and the noise travels so much. The floorboards were also super noisy and seem like they are a bit unstable. Otherwise, the decor is wonderful, beds super comfortable, and a great stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Very nicely remodeled home , we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again in the future. Very roomy with lots of attention to detail and plenty of parking. We really enjoyed the extra large deck that looked brand new"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,loved it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, clean house to stay! Has everything you need!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An older home with beautiful updates. The bathroom had comfort, seating toilet, which is extremely important to us as older people. The floors were beautiful, but walking in your bare feet. You can get pinched! All in all, though the home was exactly what we needed. I will recommend it to my friends and family when coming to visit my mom in Terre Haute."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Our family felt right at home in this lovely home. It had everything we needed!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cutest house to stay in! The owners put true thought into the creative layout and design of this house! It’s even cuter than the houses on HGTV! VERY spacious, spotless, and cozy! Location is great for all your needs from shopping, food, coffee shops, and more! The perfect house for our girls weekend get away! It was actually so cozy, we wished we had more time to hang back at the house and lounge around! The owner put serious thought into using the upstairs for living space! The upstairs hold the perfect cozy bedroom, writing nook, with so much storage, accompanied with the cutest full bath upstairs! I surely can’t say enough great things about this house, and our stay!! As well as the best house, the host was just as amazing! :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home in a nice neighborhood. Very clean, cutely decorated, had a nice notebook with things to do in the area and for checkout. Very easy check out instructions and Melina was always quick to respond to any communication. We came for a girls getaway and couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay. We definitely will be back. Thanks!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a cute place to stay! So clean and welcoming and felt open downstairs in the main living areas. Comfy beds and the decor was so nice and welcoming!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house! Exactly as described and perfect for our group of friends. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place!! Nicely decorated and great, comfortable beds. Upstairs is amazing! Although, if you're taller than 5'5, you probably don't want to stay upstairs. Would highly recommendand hope to stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,You can tell the house was recently renovated. Really well done and very clean.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly as described, clean, and comfortable beds. It was well decorated and without a lot of clutter. As mentioned in other reviews the upstairs can be challenging if you are tall. Upstairs is beautifully decorated, but you must be aware of your where you are walking to avoid hitting your head.
If you are driving a low clearance vehicle (like a sedan) the driveway can be a little tricky. You just need to go slow into the driveway or park on the street. Otherwise, nice neighborhood, plenty of room to spread out and nice furnishings."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melina's home was beautifully decorated and spotless. We felt so at home there. Kitchen was well stock and had everything we needed plus extras. We can't wait to stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melina's place was fabulous. It accommodated all of us very comfortably. We would rent this home again. Great host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a one night stay with a late night arrival to Melina’s place. She was able to take us same-day on a long road trip, and this home was the perfect oasis for our exhausting day of driving. Melina sent a check-in code right away but be sure to click on the link to the lock system, because it took us a little extra time to figure it out when we arrived. (I’d never used this particular brand before - it’s great, but user-error is real lol!) The floor plan is very open on the first floor and was a perfect little suite set up for my mom. I took the upstairs suite (it’s the whole second half-floor) and heads up (pun fully intended here!) that the bathroom was perfectly-sized for a shorter-statured human like myself - would not recommend for anyone over 5’6” given the way the walls are angled there. Everything is beautifully appointed, cleverly designed, and thoughtfully arranged. Melina is very communicative and kind, and we are looking forward to staying again next time we pop through!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the wonderful hospitality while we were gathering in Terre Haute!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful and extremely clean home with many nice touches. Snacks, water and coffee are always appreciated when traveling.
The upstairs is beautiful, but not functional as it was difficult to use the bathroom and walk around for those of us over 6 feet. There are low ceilings on either side of the peak of house so we hit our head quite a few times.
I would still stay there again, just would not use the upstairs.
Otherwise a perfect home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay for moving in a child to Rose-Hulman. Communication was easy, the space was comfortable and as described. We will stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was great! Beautifully re-done, decorated nicely, and very clean. Lots of space and the kitchen has everything you could need. Located close to lots of things in Terre Haute and has a private driveway/yard which is very convenient. Would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The soaker tub was a huge highlight for me! I was able to take the most amazing bath and restore to bed early so I would be fresh in the morning to go take my NCLEX which is why I was in town. She provided Epsom salt, essential oils and wonderful soaps that made it even more of a treat. We only stayed one night but it was way better than a hotel and worked perfectly for our needs. I would choose it for my next trip no matter the length of the start because it was comfy , adorable and gave us zero complaints. Thank you for having us!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for having us. Would stay again if we are in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt at home immediately, thank you again for a wonderful stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I always love to stay at Melina's place.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melina’s place is a great getaway. It was well decorated, tastefully done without a lot of clutter. The kitchen was decently stocked, the bathrooms were clean, and the updates to the home were very well done.
One note of caution, if you are a tall person the upstairs bedroom will not be for you. Other than that the two downstairs bedrooms are great so alleviates any issues for y’all individuals."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,Our needs were meet for the stay and we were able to work in the home. The home was nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable. My husband and I were too tall to fully utilize the upstairs space. The host was responsive to any questions/concerns.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The accommodations were very good. I just had to adjust to the upstairs.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! The house was clean, well organized/stocked and nicely decorated; and it was cooled well throughout (upstairs and downstairs).

Melina was very accommodating, responded quickly, and flexible with our checkout time when our travel schedule changed. We would highly recommend and would stay here again!"

Thank you so much Melina for sharing your beautiful home with us."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Melina provided a very clean and comfortable stay. We highly recommend staying here when in the area. There are other airbnbs in the area but do not compare to Melina’s house. We felt amazing when we walked in. Instantly we knew the stay was going to be excellent. Stay here no doubt.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is on a corner in a quiet area of Terre Haute. The location is very quiet during the day and night. Parking was easily accessible. Checking in/access was easy, as well. Terre Haute isn't large, so the location is easily accessible to any portion of town, but is fairly close to the local regional airport. A good place for smaller parties; be sure to pay attention to the face that there's no washer and dryer. We ended up not needing one, but I missed that during booking. Otherwise, we would gladly stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect cozy little house. Done exactly what I needed for working in the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cheyenne’s place was the perfect place for our family of 5! We had plenty of room for our two toddlers to share one bedroom, and put the baby in a pack and play in the other bedroom with us. The house was very clean and had everything we needed for a week in Terre Haute! We would definitely stay again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! A lot of traffic and train noise. Otherwise it is a great place to stay!

Jason"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. We had five people but it never felt crowded. At night 3 more family members would come over to visit and there was plenty of room. I loved that there was a crock pot. I cooked chili for 8 one night. I appreciated the small details. Lots of hangers in the closets, luggage racks, make up wipes, cleansing pads, Q tips and cotton balls. The decor is pleasant and soothing colors. Fold out queen bed in living room is good quality and comfortable. Easy check out. Some places require so many things done I wonder why the cleaning fee is high. Not here. We will stay here next time we come to town. The host is very responsive."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cheyenne's place was a perfect home-base for our visit to Terre Haute. Clean, cozy, and well-appointed, it is a remarkably good deal. One thing I'll mention that may not be evident from the description is that it was a great space for my 92-year-old mother who has limited mobility. There are three steps (with a railing) to enter, but all the rooms are on the first floor, there are no funky stumble spots between rooms, and there is a grab bar in the shower. We loved the home and would definitely book here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect size and location, we will definitely consider staying when we visit again in a couple months."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Quiet location that is a quick drive to Rose Hulman and Indiana State. Close to Downtown, Eastside, and Southside restaurants and activities. Would stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little space, very easy people to work with. She extended our checkout time with very short notice when we had vehicle issues. Hoping we can stay there again next year when we come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home was really clean, what we expected and communication with owner was A+.
Will 100% book this home again!!!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Home is beautifully decorated. We were able to reserve two nights at the very last minute for the Covered Bridge Festival and Cheyenne responded immediately! Great visit! Home is on a slightly busy street but very quiet neighbors. Would definitely stay there again.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great relaxing stay at Cheyenne's home. It was very clean and quiet. The home provided plenty of space for myself, my wife and teenage daughter. While we were visiting we were around lots of family and it was very nice to be able to unwind in a space that provided us with quiet relaxing down time from all the fun we had. We will definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great host! Absolutely pristine place! Definitely would stay again!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Having lived in Terre Haute for 30+ years I know all about the area. The house is located in a safe area and centrally located to any place you need to go in the area.
The house itself is just like the pictures show.
We stayed there in August of 2023 and liked it enough to book it when we travel back again for Christmas this year. The host Cheyenne was very accommodating and fast to respond to any questions we had. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet, cute and safe place to stay while in the Terre Haute area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great. I was taking my daughter back to college and this was very close. It was quiet and very comfortable. Well stocked for cooking and very comfortable for a quiet night in. It was close to the major shopping areas and food. It was also close to the Moonlite Drive Inn.
Cheyenne and Raj were always quick to respond including adding an extra day so I could stay longer.
I appreciate it. Next time we are in Terre Haute we will check to see if the home is available.
Thanks again!!
Lucy and Lucia"
