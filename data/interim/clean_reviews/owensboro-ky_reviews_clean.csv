2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great location for everything we went to Owensboro to do. Our little dog loved the fenced backyard. Cleanest, most comfortable place imaginable. All conveniences and more. The bed mattress was so comfortable and the linens amazing. The bath towels like a 5-star hotel. The HVAC system made it very comfortable inside and quickly shifted from cooling to heat and back as the outside temperatures shifted while we were there. It is a small house but plenty of space. All the kitchen appliances looked brand new.
Randall and Maria were very accommodating. We could not have asked for more gracious hosts. I would call them Super-Hosts. Will definitely plan to stay here again if it is available for our next visit."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Randall and We had a great stay for the holidays. The place was very clean, organized, and comfy. There was a smell of sewage when we first entered the home and off and on in the bathroom that put a little damper on the ambience. No other comments mentioned the smell that I’m aware of so this could be a temporary issue. I would just ask the friendly hosts prior to booking. This place is worth your money and very convenient."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Randall & Maria's Place is top notch. It is by far one of the best experiences that I have had. The home is beautiful, and is provided with everything you need for a short/long stay. I had the pleasure of being there for seven days and was sad to leave on the last day. I enjoyed all the amenities the home has to offer. The private personal parking is a bonus along with a very quiet neighborhood. The home is well equipped with safety measures. This beautiful home is conveniently located in the downtown area of Owensboro. This lovely home is right next door to Cruse Salon, Boutique, and Gifts. So be sure to stop in for salon or gift purchases. I promise you won't be disappointed. I almost forgot about the Coffee Bar and the refreshments provided upon arrival. After a 10 hr. drive the cold bottled water was a treat!
Thanks so much for being wonderful host. I look forward to my return!!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It’s a very cute little house on a quiet street. It’s in town so you hear town noise but it wasn’t bad at all unless you were outside by the fire pit in the evenings. Randall and Maria were very kind and responsive. Great hosts! Would definitely recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was needing a place local for my daughter while I was out of town for a couple of days immediately and booked this very last minute. Owners very friendly and helpful and introduced themselves to my daughter. Very supportive and welcoming. Thank you so much!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maria and Randall were extremely responsive and helpful! We stayed for 3 nights. We couldn’t find extra trash bags so I messaged them and within 45 minutes Maria walked over and made sure we had some AND brought us a gift from their gift shop! The house was spotless, felt at home and had everything we needed! We will definitely be back when we’re in the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed 2 nights at this very quaint, clean and comfortable home. It was spotless, linens were clean and crisp and the area felt very safe.

Cute backyard fire pit wish we could have stayed longer to use it

Liked that it was well stocked up in the bathroom too
would be nice to have scissors in kitchen drawer for cutting tags off gifts 😊
Dryer was loud (metallic noise) when drying otherwise it worked great and did the job 😊
The cool white lightbulbs were a little to bright maybe warm white bulbs would make it feel warmer."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Randall and Maria were extremely great at communicating with us. One of our guests got sick during our visit and the hosts were amazing!!

It was extremely clean, had all of the amenities that we required, decorated so cutely and welcoming, very comfy beds. It was over Independence weekend and even had a few, just the right amount, of July 4th decor. I was a bit concerned about Dairy Queen being behind us with the noise and odor, neither was an issue at all. We ended up going to two of the recommended restaurants, Famous Bistro for dinner and The Miller House for breakfast, and they were both wonderful. We would stay there again in a heart beat."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My family and I loved our stay at Randall & Maria's! It's the perfect place if you're just passing through, or if you are looking for a place for an extended stay. Their communication was excellent and extremely timely from the moment I sent them an inquiry to book their place to the moment we checked out. Their kindness and hospitality went above and beyond our expectations. Their home is clean, cozy, and includes every amenity listed. They also provided a very nice assortment of snacks and drinks. They even went out of their way to add patriotic decorations around the home, as my Mom is Navy retired. If we ever are in the area again, we will be booking our stay with Maria and Randall! They are super hosts indeed! :-)"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, little place in Owensboro. Smaller than I imagined, but it worked for the amount of time that I stayed there. I should’ve saw in the pictures and description that there isn’t a dining room table or large surface, but there is a small desk to work at. Overall, nice, small, clean place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice space! Home was clean and cozy. Perfect for the 5 of us for the weekend stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My teenage daughter and I stayed here for our annual trip to holiday world. We brought our dog too. The place was clean and very well stocked with everything a person would need. When I requested to stay an extra night, the owners were responsive and accommodated my request within minutes. The only drawback to this property is that it can be a bit noisy due to its location, and the walls seem thin. But the noisiness dies down around 11pm and for us that was ok. We were staying up late anyways. We would stay again."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay during my long-weekend visit to Owensboro! The house was comfy and cozy - perfect for a single person. The location was very close to all the sights and restaurants but still private and quiet. Check-in and entry was very simple - really appreciated the keyless entry with the keypad so I didn't have to worry about keeping up with keys or accidentally locking myself out. The house included everything needed for a comfortable stay. I especially appreciated the abundant towels and the provided snacks - which included bottled water, fresh fruit, and coffee pods. It is quite small, especially the bathroom, so I wouldn't recommend it for groups or families with teenagers, but it's perfect for 1-2 people."

Maria was a wonderful host and went out of her way to make the weekend special. We were there during a crazy windstorm and lost power for a few hours and Maria came by with candles, flashlights and some games. She was great and we have no complaints. We would love to stay there again if we are in there area."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an adorable little house! Comfy, cozy and very clean. The neighborhood felt safe. It was rainy so we didn’t get to use the backyard, but would have loved a chance to spend sometime around the fire pit. This was our first nights stay in Owensboro. We enjoyed live music by Chris Abell at Brasher’s Little Nashville and delicious beer and food at the Brew Bridge. Highly recommend Randall and Maria’s Owensboro house. Hoping to rent it again the next time we visit."

There were snacks which was nice since I was nauseous from treatment and was able to have small snacks. Thank you!!!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Randall and Maria were terrific hosts! They were very responsive and helpful. Check in was easy and we felt very secure in the house. Their home was so clean and sanitary. I am a barefoot person and the floors were a dream to walk on. The house was perfect for our needs and had everything we needed. Plenty of fluffy towels, fully stocked kitchen (water bottles in the refrigerator and snacks on the counter, too) and even had shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotions in the bathroom. Good thing, too, because I forgot my body lotion! They even offered to drop off donuts in the morning! I ended up oversleeping (nice cozy beds!!!) and they were able to give us a little bit later check out so we could get all our belongings organized before we left. We appreciated the off street parking in the driveway and the quiet neighborhood to relax between our weekend commitments. We ate at Mi Ranchito Mexican Restaurant and had ice cream at Lic’s Deli & Ice Cream, both are highly recommended. Kentucky hospitality is second to none. We will be staying here again next time we visit Owensboro!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a charming doll house. Super clean and cute. We were there for a weekend visiting family. The fenced back yard was perfect for our two small dogs.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ten-star stay if AirBnB gave ten stars. Easily one of my most favorite AirBnB stays. From booking to check-out, Lynn was incredibly responsive, and even met us to say ""hello"" upon arrival. I don't know how to adequately state how perfect her place is. Quiet and serene, peaceful beyond belief, and other than the occasional lawn mower the only sounds were birds. Heck, it was almost TOO quiet to sleep - just kidding :). Spotlessly clean, well-stocked, and the washer/dryer is a huge bonus!
I was in town for an event, and absolutely fell in love with Owensboro's waterfront. I would consider coming back even if I have NO event to attend, but only if I could say here again! Thanks for everything Lynn!"

The weather was not great, so Lynn made sure the pathway was iced and met them in the evening to walk them to the house (down a small path). This was truly above and beyond and greatly appreciated. The house was just as described and very comfortable and clean. The area is lovely and would have been a great place to relax if not for the inclement weather. My parents are already asking to come back in the spring and fall in order to enjoy all Lynn's place has to offer. More than anything, I appreciate the extra care Lynn showed my parents during their stay."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This guesthouse is lovely and was great for our getaway. Lynn provided a clean and well-equipped spot for my daughter and me. The park access at literally the end of the driveway was perfect for early morning hikes. Lynn was very responsive.

I am very cautious when traveling with just the two of us, but I felt safe and comfortable here. Thank you, Lynn!"

Location is far enough from town that you feel you are in the country, but it's easy to get into Owensboro to take in the sights there too. Lynn left us some salty snacks which were much appreciated after our hot hikes in the woods, and we enjoyed chilling in the evening watching Netflix before bed. This was the first Airbnb experience for my special needs son and me, and it was a great experience! Highly recommended!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was absolutely lovely! We stayed here while our daughters were at Girl Scout camp and I think we picked the perfect place!
The location is fantastic! In nature and outside the city, but still very close to everything. We sadly didn’t get to walk the nature trails too much, but hopefully next time we won’t have to work during the day so we can have more outdoor time.

This would be the perfect place for a romantic getaway or if you wanted to go solo, the perfect place to go and disconnect from the rush of everyday life. The bed was amazing, it felt like you were sleeping on a giant marshmallow, and you feel safe and welcome the whole time you’re there!
Thank you so much Lynn for sharing this little slice of nature with us!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I drive to Owensboro from just outside of Philadelphia. After a 14 hour straight drive it was so nice to walk into a place that felt like home away from home right away. The cottage felt much more cozy than any hotel could ever feel. Lynn was great and very fast with communication. The cottage was super clean and had everything we needed for the week. Lynn's restaurant recommendations were spot on. We ate at the Mellow Mushroom, Legends, Moonlite BBQ and O'Bryan's and had great food each time. The cottage is in a perfect area, quiet and relaxing, but really close to a bunch of great shopping centers and anything you could need.
If the cottage is available don't hesitate to book it!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Omgosh this place is just perfect! Nestled in the woods, near the hiking paths, and yet close to anything you'd need. Keep an eye open driving down the street and you might see a couple bucks in the evening just strolling around. So beautiful.
Lynn's place is adorably decorated, super clean, several thoughtful touches (coffee/snacks/Roku enabled tv/books!!) and cool! (grateful for that in KY hot, humid, rainy weather) Kitchen has anything you'd need to whip up a meal or if you want delivery doordash will deliver pretty much anything in the area.
I would totally go back to stay again!
Oh and bring firewood for the firepit!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn’s guest house is located at the head of a miles-long network of hiking trails—if you’re looking for outdoor activities, this is a great place to be. The property and the house are both lovely. We brought a bit of food in with us and made use of the full kitchen. Lynn met us briefly when we checked in and would have been available right away if we had needed anything. We enjoyed our time there."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such an amazing cottage, Lynn even leaves snacks and goodies. We will definitely be going back again in the future! Loved the trails right near her place, had a blast on the bikes."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This secluded perfect little cabin by the woods/Park is the prettiest most relaxing stay you can ask for. Anything you may need, your host Lynn, will be happy to help you with it.
Book it, check in and ENJOY YOURSELF!!!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was absolutely clean and comfortable. Everything necessary for guests to enjoy their stay is provided, from a full kitchen to a roku enabled large screen tv. The hosts also let us park in the carport, which was great because it was raining and we had bikes on the car. Tho the cottage is located next to a park on a quiet and beautiful property, it is very convenient to Owensboro Riverfront parks, the Western KY Botanical Garden,and only a short and easy drive to many attractions. Lynn is a truly special host who tries to ensure her guests have an excellent experience. Your privacy will be respected, and your comfort and satisfaction will be part of a very pleasant stay in this lovely and welcoming place. Please note, there is a short walkway to the cottage, and a set of steps up to the entrance as is mentioned and pictured, in case that is a concern."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was excellent. The Guest House was clean and organized, with all the little touches that make you feel at home.

2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location for people that enjoy hiking! We did about an hour in the woods right next to the property. Spent the rest of the day at Jeffreys cliffs not too far away and to have a nice clean place to go back to and relax on the couch and watch a movie was fantastic. Folks that prefer a firm mattress like myself may not sleep great but you’ll be comfortable enough.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynn’s place is great. She is so sweet and really cares about her visitors having a good experience.

It was across the street from an amazing local donut shop and right down the street from the beautiful downtown area.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Marla's place!! Marla was a great host and very responsive and helpful. We were in town for a baseball game at Kentucky Wesleyan and Marla's place was close to that and to really any area. You could jump right back on the highway and get to the south hotspot or the east end of town with all the restaurants with no problem. We didn't have time to go to the riverwalk, but it was close to that, too. The house was great. Wonderful kitchen and big tv in the living room. Great fenced-in back yard that we would have loved to enjoy on a warmer evening. Comfortable bedrooms. Front door glass was so clean we almost bumped into!! Great place to stay if you are in Owensboro!! Thanks, Marla!!"

I was so happy to find such a nice home on such short notice. When I arrived, check in was a breeze with key code entry. The house was EXTREMELY well accommodated with anything a person could need. Comfortable beds, very clean, beautifully decorated, off street parking, and the kitchen felt like mine at home- totally stocked with everything. Marla has a great house with a vaulted ceiling in the living area that is open to the dining and kitchen. The backyard space is lovely for entertaining as well. Marla supplied us waters in the fridge, keurig coffees of assorted flavors and several snacks.

The house was adorably decorated for the season inside and out, and easy to find. Check in with the keypad was simple. The house and yard were well-kept. The inside of the house was spotlessly clean and contained all the extra items one might need for laundry, bathroom, and kitchen. There was even complimentary coffee, soda and a basket of snacks! The beds were comfortable and the bedding soft and clean. We enjoyed the ambience of the electric fireplace while winding down and watching TV at night.

Thanks, Marla!"

I asked Marla about the cute comforters and she even screenshot the ad so I could purchase my own!"

Your the best. 😉"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was wonderful and Ms Marla was fantastic! Not only was this home spotless, it also had the cutest seasonal decorations, making you feel right at home. We had a small incident, our toddler mistakenly locked the bathroom door on his way out, locking everyone out; Mr Mike and Ms Marla were ready and able to graciously assist with unlocking it within 30 minutes. Throughout our stay, Ms Marla and Mr Mike made it known that they were happy to help with whatever they could. There was a great fenced in backyard for our children to run around in. Lastly, this Airbnb is very conveniently located, in a very quiet neighborhood but within 10 minutes of downtown Owensboro and the Lazy Days Park, which was awesome for our children.

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The BEST Airbnb I’ve stayed for some many reasons!! You can’t beat the price but usually that means the home isn’t that great or they cut corners. Not with Marla!

Cleanliness of the house was outstanding.
The Beds for myself and my Son were great, no problems and bedding’s were clean, bedrooms are good sized and the TV in the one room is a nice addition.
Kitchen is well stocked if you are cooking, I and the refrigerator was very clean and it had some drinks already in it waiting for us when we arrived. Nice touch.
Marla also left plenty of snacks another nice touch.
Washer and dryer works good and more then enough laundry supplies for us.
Back yard is nice and nice little seating area, we didn’t have time to use it this time but will next time.
Overall this was a great experience for my Son and I.
Will be back next time it has openings.
Thank you Marla"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Between the three adults who stayed for our family girls trip- we all agreed Marla’s place is the best Airbnb we’ve stayed at. The attention to detail and all of the amenities really made the difference. The location is about 8 minutes from downtown.

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Of many Airbnb stays, this was one of the best. Nice, quiet neighborhood, quick access to the bypass, or to head east into downtown. Grassy back yard, very private with the fence. Grill has a pile of charcoal already in it. Kitchen is well equipped with utensils. Also 'may' find some needed things like salt, pepper, oil, coffee, cream, butter, noodles. Nice snack basket (we didn't use the box of cheesecake muffin mix). Main area of living room, dining area, kitchen was small but comfortable, no complaints at all. Bedrooms likewise. Oh, and Marla communicates quickly. I would stay there again to visit my hometown."

We were simply grateful he made it to live to see his graduation. Marla communication was awesome. She checked in frequently. Everything you could ever need was there. She provided a grill in her amazing back yard. This house is a no brainer and where we will still when we come down if available. It felt like home and we felt the LOVE within Marla and her home. Best Airbnb stay ever! Not because of the size of the house or anything just because the feel , attention to detail and communication! Thanks Marla keep being a light on Airbnb and I’m sure in your personal life also!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a family stay, but, somehow also a great place for a business professional in need of serenity. This place is great! I had everything I needed, and a few things I didn’t think I’d need- did! The decor is setup so “homey”. It’s not over done, like many places do to appear “fancy”. Comfort was certainly a priority for this host! Each room has a different character feel to it, but all are classily done. There’s plenty of storage space for bags, luggage, and clothes. The kitchen has all it needs and then some. There’s a dedicated space for an office area if needed as well. This came in handy! I was staying with my family but during the day I worked from home. The office area was much appreciated! Everything is clean and sleek. I have this “I could totally live here” vibe! Lol! They’ve made so much of the space available. The backyard is lovely as well. With patio furniture and yard space to enjoy. We used the oven to make pizzas, and the washer and dryer as well. It was very nice having that available on site! I have zero complaints or suggestions! I’ve given 5 star reviews to places that weren’t near as accommodating, so, I’m a little upset I can’t give more than that! LOL! If you need a place in Owensboro, for whatever reason, this is the one! Thanks, Marla!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed in dozens of places and Marla has by far been THE BEST host we have worked with. Her communication from the beginning all the way to the end was amazing, making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.
The extra touch of goodies was so sweet of her as we traveled 14 hours from home for a funeral. She definitely made us feel as if we were at home.
The home was spotless, all instructions to check in and out were perfect and we could not have picked a better home and host to stay with while in Kentucky.
We will definitely be booking again with her when we come back to visit family!
Thanks so much again Marla, for being so good to us. We will never forget our experience with you! 💛"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Logan's place in a conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of everything you'd want to see. A nice place to relax after doing some exploring.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place gives you the bang for your buck. I felt like I pretty much had the entire place to myself (even though my unit was one of several in the house), as my unit had a fully furnished living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. I didn't need Logan for much since I was only in Owensboro for two nights, but whenever I did message him, he'd always reply within a couple minutes.
The house is located in a quiet neighborhood and is maybe a 10-minute walk away from downtown Owensboro and the Ohio River. I didn't get to explore much, but the entire surrounding area is super-walkable and there are a lot of restaurant options once you get to the downtown area. Will definitely stay here again if I find myself in Owensboro in the future."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, enjoyed the time. Thanks again Logan"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay. Our daughter goes to college in Owensboro and it was right next to her school. We were able to feed most of the soccer team and have them enjoy watching tv with us. Would have loved to have a few more cooking items BUT who would think about cooking for multiple girls in an Airbnb?!? We will definitely stay here again instead of a hotel….feels more homey and able to have the girls hang. Can’t wait to enjoy the porch in warmer weather.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and neat older home. Good for an overnight stay, but could use a few extra things to give it that comfy, away from home feel. Logan is very nice and very responsive."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. High ceilings. Classic feel on a pretty street. Walking distance to the Bluegrass Museum and four blocks from Gramp's donuts, for the win."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved my time at Logans place, I would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in a quaint setting. Easy walking distance to restaurants and other points of interest.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stay in Airbnb's weekly and in the Owensboro area every 6 weeks or so. This was my first stay at 603 Saint Anne. Even though it is the city, it was very peaceful and quiet. I look forward to staying here again and will recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was perfect for my husband and me in town for a conference. The rooms were airy, with high ceilings. The kitchen was spotless with all apparently new utensils, dishes and appliances. The house itself was very quiet and well insulated, with no sense that there were other folks in the other apartment. It was also easy walking distance from the riverfront."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location for an event we came to town for. Logan was friendly and responded quickly. We would stay here again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Logan was always prompt with his response and friendly. The place was clean and just like pictures showed it.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Was very happy and content with this Airbnb. Great location and quiet neighborhood. Felt extra safe with the security cameras around. Will stay again if ever needed.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you so much for hosting my bachelorette weekend!! Loved every minute in this gorgeous home! Thank you so much for your attention to detail and snacks!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The Heirloom had more character than any other Airbnb I've ever stayed at. I loved its historical vibe and it was close to downtown Owensboro. Maybe a 15 min walk at most.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Katelyn is an amazing host that is very responsive and accommodating. The home is historically charming, with a romantic quality that has modern amenities. The beds are comfortable, bathrooms clean, and there is plenty of space for large groups. The kitchen area upstairs is a great place for meals with everyone. We will definitely stay here when we come to Owensboro again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You’ll be in awe seeing this house. It’s huge and beautiful. Such a unique place to stay for a bit. Tons of space and loaded with antique ambience. Katelyn was an excellent host and genuinely seemed like she wanted to make sure our stay was great.
Do keep in mind that IT IS AN OLD HOUSE. If that sounds cool, you will love it. But know that everything creaks and you will see signs of age everywhere - a positive for me, but have realistic expectations. From a light and picky sleeper, the beds were very comfy but lots of light at all hours from the nearby streetlights and plenty of noise if anyone is awake and moving around. There is no shortage of things to admire in literally every room. We spent hours just exploring, and the hardest part was choosing which table to eat at every meal. We felt fancy during our whole stay.
Owensboro isn’t big but is a cute town. Lots of good restaurants and parks. The free art museum far exceeded our expectations, and it’s right down the road!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Very nice home. Comfortable and clean. Very helpful host. Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice comfortable house. Plenty of space for the family you relax in the living room. Home sits in a newer upscale neighborhood in Owensboro. Garage parking was a plus. House had everything we needed.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly’s place was absolutely beautiful! So tastefully decorated and clean and comfortable!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to town from South Carolina to spend time with my family that lives in the Owensboro area over our spring break. Having a place to relax was wonderful. Normally we book a hotel, but this was so much better with kids. Being able to have a kitchen and laundry made my life so much easier."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at such an adorable place. Very up to date on the decor. Super spotless clean in every room. Fresh clean towels and bedding.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed two times now & know these won’t be the last! We have friends/family in town and visit often. This space has felt like home! Very clean & well curated without feeling cluttered. It has been quiet and peaceful for being close to shopping & restaurants. I love the original details kept in the house while having a fresh & updated feel. We can’t wait to be able to enjoy the outside space once the weather permits. Looking forward to our next stay.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host who pays attention to the details. We had everything we needed for our stay. The house is beautifully decorated and clean. The kitchen furnished with essentials. An awesome back yard experience with covered sitting area. Having only one full bathroom for three bedrooms was not ideal but worked okay for us as a couple. The location is on a quiet street off a main corridor. Overall, a wonderful stay and would do it again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful place!! It was absolutely perfect for our family and they even let us borrow a high chair and pack and play!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brandon’s home is a relaxing, tranquil space that was the perfect jump off point for our family’s weekend adventures. We drove to Mammoth Cave and spent the day hiking, were lucky enough to have some time to grab a late lunch at The Brew Bridge in Owensboro, and then scooted down to Beaver Dam Amphitheater to catch a concert. For a family - this AirBNB was perfect. It’s aesthetically beautiful, in a welcoming, unpretentious way. The full kitchen made breakfast prep a breeze (it had EVERYTHING we needed), we were able to do a load of laundry to reduce the hectic return back home, and the fenced in backyard was a safe, beautiful spot for our kids to run around.
We will definitely return to this great space, highly recommend Brandon as a host, and have pointed some friends back in MO this direction for a great trip! Highly recommend!!!"

We were short 1 chair at the dining room, but otherwise this house could not have been more perfect. I wish it had been cool enough to hang out in the backyard at the fire pit.
A very easy 40 minute drive to Holiday World. Really nice Restaurants were all within 10 minutes from house! We’d stay here again in a heartbeat!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon’s home is a charming, updated home. They did a great job with the renovation. It’s clean, nicely decorated and very cute. The home was perfect for our visit to KY to visit family.
The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. There were plenty of towels and linens. The neighborhood is busy but very quiet.
This is a great home and I recommend it. One suggestion would be to provide some firewood for those that want to use the fire pit. There’s plenty of outside furniture however, it’s in need of being replaced.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again."

Loved waking up to amazing coffee each day. Super cute backyard area with multiple seating areas and fire pits. Driveway parking. I could keep going… such a wonderful spot to call home for a week.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"AMAZING, SPECTACULAR, PEACEFUL, and so many other words I could use for my 1st Airbnb experience. I am originally from Grandview Indiana and moved away in 2016 to be with my fiancé. We usually stay in a hotel when we come in to visit; however, with a 6 year old and 1 year old hotels are just a little cramped. This was our first time doing an airbnb and Rick made the process so easy. As soon as it was booked he sent a message, day before he messaged again asking about arrival time, and day before our departure letting me know how to check out. Those things meant a lot to me because my anxiety gets the best of me so knowing the expectation made me feel at ease. The location was in a peaceful neighborhood. And the backyard was so nice! We make a trip at least once a year during the summer or twice a year depending on our schedule. The honey-badger will be my first CHOICE!
Thank you Rick for everything!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick was a very hospitable host! He greeted us at the door and showed us around the house. There’s a fenced in back yard with lots of seating, a TV, and parking for your vehicle. Plenty of space, interesting decor, and comfortable beds in both bedrooms. The house is right off of Frederica Street, so you have easy access to the rest of town. Overall, we had a lovely experience while visiting friends and family in Owensboro!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean adorable home in quaint walkable neighborhood. Rick is a great host!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rick’s place was perfect! Very clean, hardwood floors, nicely decorated, in a safe, quiet neighborhood, large privacy fenced backyard with covered patio seating area including a small TV. TV’s in living room and both bedrooms, washer and dryer in basement. He even had bottled water in the fridge and a few snacks and coffee, creamer, and sugar. This is the place I will be staying the next time I come to Owensboro.
I had hoped he would have self check-in. However, it was no trouble at all to check in and out. He lives right next door and was very flexible when we called to say we would arrive way later than expected. He met us just after 10:15pm and showed us where everything was. Rick was super friendly.
We pulled into alley behind the house and the privacy fence opened up with a garage door opener and we pulled into the back yard and closed the fence behind us. I highly recommend Rick’s AirBnb."

Rick met us right before the concert and let us in so we didn't have to carry our luggage in our jeep. When we got back later that evening, he had coffee set up for for the next morning, water in the fridge and snacks on the counter. The house felt very comfortable. I'm a huge blanket person and was thrilled to find soft, cozy blankets on the couches! Perfect for watching TV and chilling. Our bed was super comfortable and shower and linens were perfect. Kinda wish we could have stayed another night. Maybe next time!!"

Such a quaint home that was so tastefully decorated and had everything you would need for a lengthy stay, we were only there one night, wished it could have been longer. The home is in a quiet neighborhood right in the middle of everything, so close to the riverfront and Smothers Park is beautiful! I highly recommend Ricks place if you are visiting Owensboro Kentucky."

The furniture was actually comfortable, not that stiff stuff 😉 The parking is awesome (wooden gate with a door opener so you can park in the back yard and lock your car in).

I’m a tall person and appreciated a taller option with regards to the shower head as well. Also having bottled water already in the fridge and snacks to enjoy upon arrival were a special and welcome touch as well! Overall 5 stars!!

He gave our 2 year old a little toy car and pulled out a high chair for us without us even having to ask. There was a stocked kitchen with water, coffee, sugar, creamer, snacks and loads of different dishes. It was such a nice stay and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay again or recommend this home to anybody in the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thanks Rick for being the best host. Beautiful home and worked out great for us for KWC move-in weekend. Thank you for the snacks and waters. Most importantly, I greatly appreciated your help getting me in the house being on crutches. See you in October!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Honeybadger will not disappoint - unless you would rather not stay in a charming and cozy cottage that is not only immaculate but well-stocked with everything you need!
What a great place to stay! My husband and I really enjoyed our time at the Honeybadger. Why stay in a hotel room, when instead you can enjoy a roomy retreat with two bedrooms and a bath, and welcoming living and dining room, plus a back porch and fully equipped kitchen, that is decorated with personality? It is still fairly close to the downtown area along the river. Five plus stars for the Honeybadger!

This quiet house has delightfully decorated rooms, fans and controllable AC, fully stocked kitchen supplies - not to mention bottled water in fridge and snacks, coffee on counter. Host even offered use of washer/dryer. And sitting out on covered patio for breakfast was lovely. Bed was very comfortable, and plenty of storage space. Very clean everywhere in the house. Wifi was strong, and Netflix on large screen in living room was appreciated - TVs also in each bedroom. But best of all is the host: of the dozens and dozens of hosts I’ve had in the last 5 years, Rick is the most gracious, kind, giving. Absolutely fantastic host. Hope we get to Owensboro again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful home in a great neighborhood. This place is a gem in this area! This spacious 2 bedroom home is tastefully decorated, spacious and comfortable. The full kitchen and dining room have everything needed including an air fryer. Rick had stocked the fridge with water and ice for us and left us a very nice welcome note and gift of cookies and candy. There is a full size coffee maker, filters and coffee provided. There is a nice TV in the living room with Amazon TV and Netflix, 2 comfy couches and a recliner with throw blankets. The bathroom has a tub and shower, plenty of towels and wash cloths, toiletries and a hair dryer. The bed in the master bedroom was comfortable. That bedroom has a TV as well. We didn't use the 2nd bedroom because it was just me and my husband. The entire house has nice hard wood floors and everything was very clean. There is also a great outdoor space in the back yard with a couch, rockers, and TV that is completely fenced in. Parking is in the gated back yard so it's secure. We will definitely stay again when in the area."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value for the quality with an excellent outdoor space.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The perfect launching pad! We stayed at Rick’s place to spend a day in Owensboro and at Holiday World. We were thrilled! Our 2 year old loved Smother’s Park (4 minutes from Rick’s) and we loved the riverfront and all the restaurants and coffee shops along it. Rick’s was a quiet respite to come back and nap at and quiet at night too, even though it’s only a few minutes from where everything is. Amazing! The house was wonderfully stocked and so comfortable. It has a great outdoor space. There was only the 3 of us but the house could comfortable fit double that with comfortable sleeping places. Rick was incredibly helpful and helped us “check in” and showed us around. The house was 30 minutes of an easy drive from Holiday World. We will be back and we have referred the house to our friends, especially those with young kids. Thank you Rick!"

This is a great place to come back to and relax after hitting the town, which is literally 5 min away!
The privacy of the backyard is great, and the neighborhood is so quiet.
Everything I could have needed was supplied.
Owners are great, communicative and very nice. I love that fact that they are close by if you need anything.
Will be saving this place on my list for future stays!

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cons-amenities list Netflix, Hulu, etc but they are not available unless you have an account you can log into. No sponge, laundry or dish soap and only a couple rolls of toilet paper provided. we were there 5 days so these are necessities I feel should be included for the price point. Stairs were steeper than I thought they'd be and upstairs master doesn't have a bathroom.
Pros- very clean, great pillows, water pressure was amazing. Lots of space and so peacefully quiet! Close to grocery store, all the dishes you need to prepare food. Plenty of towels and coffee too.
Overall it was a great stay"

Toys available for toddlers. Board games and Playstation for older kids. Easily be able to unwind in the basement lounging area, on the patio, main floor living area, or the upstairs loft sanctuary with king bed. It's definitely a favorite stay.
