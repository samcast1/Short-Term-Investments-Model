2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value, gets the job done."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cheap and convenient. Only issue I had was the fact that I wanted to extend my stay and they let someone else book my room so I got screwed. They should give you the option to extend your stay before letting someone else book it. That‚Äôs what every other motel I‚Äôve ever stayed in does.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan's place was absolutely amazing! Check-in was a breeze and Jan was communicative and made the process simple. The condo was private, beautifully decorated, pristine, and every little detail was thought of to make my stay comfortable. The townhome is located in a quiet little complex with a great view of the Santa Ritas and a saltwater pool for relaxing. Beautiful sky deck and patio! My favorite part, though, was the easy access to the de Anza trail which I took for a very quick walk to Tubac then hopped onto for a hike to Tumacacori on the second day of my stay. The perfect location and all the amenities made this probably my favorite Airbnb I've ever stayed at!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable, quiet, easy to get to (once you figure out the unit numbering on the buildings). Nice rooftop deck and the pool area is great. Sadly didn‚Äôt use either much as the weather was unseasonably cool and rainy, for late March in the desert. I highly recommend it..if you‚Äôre planning on visiting Tubac and Southern AZ. Jan is a very responsive host which I appreciated."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended. Wonderful and safe location. Includes washer and dryer and a fireplace. Just beautiful. Will stay again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Jan's place. It was in a great location with access to the pool and hot tub (which we used). It was very close to a girlfriend that lives in this area - a huge bonus! The house had everything we needed.

I liked being able to take my morning walks into Tubac and as a Tesla driver, I really appreciated that Old Presidio Traders in Tubac has a Level 2 charger available. I charged up there three times over my one week stay (I could leave it on the charger over night and it is only a 15 minute walk from Jan's place).
Jan sent daily messages with helpful suggestions of things to do in the area. I look forward to returning."

She communicated with us before and during our visit; her welcome guide and instructions were clear and helpful. Jan's place was spotless and clutter-free, which made it easy for us to move in with our two dogs. (We especially appreciate being able to have our dogs with us for this two-night stay over 4th of July.) The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to prepare the meals we planned to eat in. Walking in the neighborhood is easy and lovely; the mountain views are relaxing and peaceful. We will recommend Jan's townhome to others."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jan's place is a great accommodation for spending time in Southern Arizona. It is quiet, clean, and has a nice deck area above the house,
a well-stocked kitchen, and a nice courtyard. There was plenty of free parking, and I especially enjoyed using the outdoor pool and sauna daily.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Have always heard about Tubac and wanted to check it out so we rented Jan's lovely townhouse. Barrio de Tubac area is very pretty with still alot of construction going on. The townhouses are very Santa Fe ish with beautiful southwestern colors. Jan's patio is very private with beautiful heavy metal gate upon entering and a beautiful metal entry door. The upper patio is perfect for morning coffee and pretty views. Mornings are cool there but heats up quickly. The townhouse is very nice, felt like being at home; kitchen is equipped with whatever you need; loved the under the cabinet lights in kitchen; nice refrigerator that makes ice; comfortable furniture and bed; loved the Meyer products; the shower was amazing, big tub; shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided by Jan.

The home is in a charming community and neighbors are delightfully friendly and waved and said hi whenever we walked by on dog walks. There are a few restaurants and a market within a short walk or drive. Instructions for check in and check out were clear and straightforward.
Jan was an excellent host, she checked in with recommendations and always responded quickly to my messages.
The current photos don't do this home justice, it's a real gem. If only all Airbnbs (and their hosts and housekeepers!) were like this one! :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and spacious for a 1 bedroom! Jan has everything you need for a fantastic stay. The hot tub and pool were so nice! Watching the sunrise over the mountains from the hot tub we‚Äôre amazing!

2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was great! It had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. It was very clean and well stocked. The beds were comfortable. Safeway was close by for a few provisions. The only surprise was the steep incine of the driveway. If you drive a low clearance vehicle, you would want to be aware of this as there is limited street parking in the culti-sac. The neighborhood was very quiet and the front patio is nicely arranged to enjoy a beautiful sunset above street level. Brian was a great host! Overall, it worked well for us!

2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is exactly as pictured in the profile but has extra touches that really made our stay successful. We liked that the kitchen is fully stocked with everything that you would need to cook meals and to store supplies if you were staying for an extended time period. The beds were also comfortable and our host labeled everything to make it easy to find things including the wifi password, etc. The house sits up on a hill at the end of a quiet cul de sac. I also liked that it was one level so it‚Äôs perfect if you are traveling with older adults that need to watch their steps. We would definitely stay again if we come back to Nogales."
2023-02-01,4.0,Group trip,The house was very nice and clean however the back bedroom with single bed was very loud when the heater turned on which made it hard to sleep. We really were not there very long might have been cheaper for us to stay in a hotel to not have to pay a $60 cleaning fee but overall the place was very nice and well taken care of

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great comfortable stay. Would enjoy staying there again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perched on a hill with a beautiful sunny bay window that provides a view of mountains, sky, and the scattered homes below, this is not only a super clean, lovely place; it's an incredible value. Luanne lives up to her belief that travel should be simple, easy, and affordable. Everything one needs is provided. A compact, efficient kitchen. Plenty of space to relax, stretch out. Baskets thoughtfully placed everywhere you look, to store your belongings. Huge, comfortable bed in a separate bedroom with a sliding glass door that opens onto a back yard with another delightful view of distant mountains. This is a quiet, peaceful neighborhood with winding streets and very few cars. I appreciated most of all how fragrance free the entire home is. Free and Clear laundry products made the bedding and towels smell clean, not overly perfumed. The compact washer/dryer in the walk in closet was very handy, and didn't assault with overwhelming scent. My time there was to short, so I'll be back!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Used location for winter getaway!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a comfortable stay here. The actual unit is nicer than the photos in my opinion. The bed was soft and the mini splits did a great job warming the place (we were here for Christmas and it got down to the high 20¬∞s at night). Appreciated the extras like epsom salts and bath bombs, and the extra toiletry kits for guests who may have forgotten their toothbrush etc. Plenty of storage in the form of bins and cubbies. Kitchen was fine for our purposes (early AM coffee and midnight snacks) b/c we had all our meals at nearby family members‚Äô houses. Might have felt tough to do full self-catered meals for a family of four, but all the basics were present. We appreciated having a washer and dryer so we could do a load of clothes in the middle of our big road trip. Luanne was responsive to messages and I recommend this spot!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great and tidy place for our stay. It was exactly what we needed. I highly recommend this place.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Luanne is a great host. She is quick and attentive to respond to any messages or questions, no matter the time of day. The AirBnb is well-stocked and in a beautiful hillside where you have a 360 view of the mountains surrounding Rio Rico. There are plenty of amenities available such as a dishwasher, washer and dryer, and enough appliances for the kitchen that you can do a long-term stay without worry!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My 1st airbnb experience and exceeded my expectations and way better than a hotel‚Ä¶.

2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"Disappointed to see front yard landscape not maintained. Did not look like photos. The patio area in the back did not match photos. The grate in the grill was full of mouse droppings. Screen on sliding door difficult.
Needed help with heat function and messaged Luanne. She responded in an hour. We also said we would need more than the one dish towel for our week stay and we couldn‚Äôt open windows. She was in NM so sent her son the next day with towels and to open difficult windows.
When on the floor to level the fridge to keep it from rocking around we found debris underneath. There were half dozen mouse traps set in each room. We saw no evidence of mice in house.
The oven was very dirty and gave off bad odor the one time we used it. The two chopping knives were extremely dull. No paring knife. Hot pads dirty.
Needs TLC!
Positives: king bed comfortable. Lots of light in the unit. Lots of hot water for soaking in tub. Unscented laundry detergent as requested. Quiet location."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet, lots of little extras included, easy instructions, comfortable and felt like home."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We wanted to be in a peaceful, rural setting rather than in town, and this fit the bill. Even though we shared the house with another renter, it was very quiet.
Luanne was always available and responsive and went above and beyond. We had a particular challenging first night and day due to a county-wide blackout and Luanne bent over backwards to make it right for us.
We would vacation here again in a heartbeat as we so enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and the many opportunities for breathtakingly beautiful hikes. Thank you Luanne!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely space
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellent stay for us! We selected Luanne‚Äôa place because of the location: sandwiched between two mountain ranges that had a lot of gravel biking (dirt roads) for us to ride. We explored both sides of the valley. The place was better than we expected- always comfortable and ALL of the amenities. Pretty much a full kitchen and not a single thing was missing. We kept commenting to each other how this place was so comfortable and one of our best AirBnB‚Äôs ever. Glad we came and of course wish we could have had one more day to relax. The view out the windows is nice and there are lots of sitting areas to relax or eat your breakfast.

The house is very clean and nice inside. The house is very quiet at night. That, coupled with the very comfortable bed allowed me to have some very restful nights.

Great job. I read other reviews saying pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. That is true. The only critique is that there was an odd smell when we first arrived, but it started to go away when we turned on the air conditioning. Also, we could at times hear the tv and low conversations from the connected house. Overall, though, it was a peaceful, enjoyable stay. We would return. Thank you!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Luanne's place is a very cozy guest house. We are Rio Rico/Nogales natives but since we now live in Tucson we needed a place to stay after our wedding that wasn't a family member's house. Everything was very clean. I would stay at their place again.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect staycation getaway! We forgot we were still in Arizona! Definitely much more than we expected, so much so that we stayed an extra night! Pe√±a Blanca was only 15min away too! Super clean, brand new appliances, peace & privacy...hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"/////////a nice quiet place to stay, weather is perfect for a refreshing get away, comfortable and attractive accommodations."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Luanne offered amazing hospitality before the trip, timely communication, and left a surprise personalized birthday gift for my husband (we were celebrating his bday). The home was stylish and modern and very clean! Loved the modern sensor lighting on step and in kitchen area...lots of updates to the home that made us feel as if we were staying at a high end hotel suite instead of a home. Was remote enough to have back private patio with great view but close enough to Rio Rico for us to grab some delicious Mexican Seafood (La Bocanita) which is about a 10 minute drive.
Luanne lives in the other half of the home and is very helpful and gives you your privacy along with a private parking spot and private entry so you aren't sharing the space with her if you prefer privacy.
We have a 6 year old and 1.5 year old and she put up with a lot of noise and commotion from them and made it as comfortable for our family as possible!
We went to Lake Patagonia the next day and plan to be back on our next trip to the Lake!"

The studio is beyond cute - colorful, fully stocked with everything you need, comfortable furniture and the bed is to die for! I loved that I had my own private driveway and back door entrance as well. I cannot thank the hosts enough for their kindness toward me. Thank you - with all my heart. God bless you guys!"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"R and R was fun, the environment was warm, safe, private but inviting. It was above my expectation. The host is cheerful, quick to anticipate your needs, and will socialize with you which is a huge deal for me when walking into the unknown.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little getaway, everything was clean and looks exactly like pictures. Great host no complaints."
2019-10-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and kid wanted to leave on the first night due to spiders, a black widow spider inside the bedroom and even a small scorpion found inside. The place looked unkempt due to ""dust bunnies"" everywhere including under the bed. I called the host's number to complain about the spiders and her boyfriend or husband answered. I asked for Luanne and instead he kept talking. His response was, "" just leave, you can just leave"". That is the worst customer service that I have EVER received from a host. Asking a renter to leave in the middle of the night with a wife and a 6 year old is beyond rude. Anyway, she finally got on the phone before I lost my temper with that guy. I offered to drive down to Nogales and get some bug spray myself and she agreed to that. I came back and sprayed inside and around the outside of the house. Like I said I killed a black widow with the spray inside our bedroom. They did have a chimenea outside which we used but my family couldn't even enjoy the heat from it because they couldn't sit close to it, there were monster size black widows under the brick counter were it sat. The place was stocked with supplies well enough though. Unless these people can clean up their act, spray the place regularly for bugs and improve the upkeep I would not recommend this place to anyone with kids or family."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is beautiful and peaceful. Perfect escape from the work and city life. The back patio is great for your morning coffee or a bon fire and star gazing into the clear sky. Todd was very friendly, responsive and helpful. We would definitely love to come back if we visit Arizona again. Even my 15 year old Son loved this home and the surroundings, that says a lot! Thank you Todd and Jess."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved this place. It was a perfect place to get away for a bit and relax. The views are amazing and it‚Äôs very peaceful.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"felt remote without being inconvenient, and such a peaceful setting. we had a great time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place with beautiful views. Loved our stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The 360 ‚Ä¢ Mountain Views were amazing! It was definitely off the beaten path, which the host is perfectly transparent about, but the driving is definitely an adventure in and of itself haha! My family enjoyed the wildlife we came across, like deer, cattle and coyotes. It sits atop a hill all on its own and it is peaceful & quiet. The home was clean. The southwest character of the home was on point with its decor choices. The kitchen is stocked w/ basic amenities. If you are looking for a peaceful retreat away from it all, then this is a wonderful rental
A few things to note, the primary suite shower does have two steps down & the shower head is not positioned above you, but rather at chest level. I was traveling with my 70yr old parents, so we had to move them to the bedroom with the twin beds that was adjacent to the other bathroom with a walk in shower & overhead spray, so that might be a consideration for persons w/ mobility concerns. There is no common room TV, but are in each room"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! It is big sky, quiet neighbors, and relaxing. Kidding about the neighbors‚Ä¶there are none but the birds, rabbits and a few cows next door that might or might not be close by. The house is well set up and beautiful. We will be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôll definitely be back! So serene, so quiet, so private!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Todd's place was exactly what we were looking for - a remote location primed for stargazing and night photography. We could work remotely during the day with the solid wifi, cook in the evening and then get a good nights rest before an early morning photo session. The kitchen was well stocked with items, the 3 bedrooms gave us ample space to spread out, and the unexpected amenities inside were a treat."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay if you like to be away from the crowd. Lots to do heading toward Patagonia., and such an inviting place to return to after a day of hiking and exploring. Hosts very responsive and helpful with directions. Finished our stay with a big breakfast with the locals at Nickel Diner in Rio Rico. a nice trip."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such an awesome retreat! We loved being surrounded by the dessert and having so much space to ourselves. It was a beautiful place! If we can round up another small group to split the cost, we would be more than happy to stay again!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place. Super responsive host and team. Really comfortable house with everything we needed. Amazing views. I almost feel we should have saved this space for last on our road trip, because now we are spoiled and missing it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Todd was responsive and helpful. The house was private and had amazing views. The wine in the area was fantastic. We would love to come back!!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Awesome place! Directions are little tricky but gmaps always on point, and the dirt road kind of tuff for small vehicles."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was in a beautiful location. Definitely lots of backroads driving to get there, which made for a very quiet and unique spot, but something to plan for! Todd and crew gave very clear instructions for all of our guests. The house was very cool and interesting. Our major complaint was the amount of mouse sign when we arrived. It seemed that the house had been cleaned but then left alone for long enough to get very dirty again from mice. Also wasn‚Äôt super clean, trash left in the garage and a fair amount of dust and cobwebs. We still had a great time and Todd and crew were extremely helpful all along the way."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a perfect place if you are looking for a beautiful, quiet retreat where you find nature all around you. Not only is the home beautiful, but its private natural surroundings are breathtaking!
You can enjoy gorgeous Sunrises, Sunsets, Moon rising and the entire constellation from the large expansive back porch.
We lived our stay here! Will book again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I am a birder and am in the process of writing a book. I needed a place that was serene, quiet, naturally beautiful with easy access to the outdoors, mountains and wildlife, and this is what I got. Perfection!
The home is beautiful, comfortable and spacious. It has windows all around so one can enjoy the amazing views from all sides.
Sunsets, sunrises and moonrises are breathtaking and inspirational. It goes without saying, the night sky is awe inspiring.
The large fenced area, with the addition of a snake fence, was perfect for my two little dogs. They got to explore so many different smells and bugs they‚Äôd never experienced before, while staying safe. Both Willow dog & Jazz dog learned what cows were! So much fun!
Very grateful this beautiful place is dog friendly!
I hope other dog parents visiting this beautiful place are mindful of their dogs & pick up after them.
The hosts were always responsive, professional and friendly.
Very pleased with my experience!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded location with plenty of peace and quiet.

Garage is always a nice bonus.
Todd is a great host.
I would be delighted to return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Gorgeous home and very peaceful place. Only 12 minutes from the lake and 24 minutes from the grocery store.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a serene place to be. I wanted a quiet place to relax to read and for my dog to be away from any fireworks for the 4th of July. This place was perfect. The chairs in the den were to die for comfortable!! I read for hours every day! Any questions I had were answered immediately by Todd and his team. They were amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to go back and soak in more peace and quiet and serenity!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of our favorite trips by far!!! We loved this airbnb so much. Our dogs loved it too! The 360 degree mountain views are so beautiful. Such a quiet and peaceful location. The house itself is very cozy and clean, we felt right at home. It was really cool to see the cows and horses roaming around, along will all types of other wildlife. Will definitely be back in the future! 10/10!!! If you want to get away from it all and just slow down, this is the place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and relaxing property. 360 views and peaceful surroundings.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a last minute booking - and we were so glad we decided to do so! This is a beautiful, peaceful and comfortable space/setting! The views are amazing. The home is charming and cozy! We all found our beds to be extremely comfortable! We all plan to come back in the future! I shared that this will be a place I will return to when I need to destress!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place that is private and at the same time close enough to both Rio Rico and Nogales.
Great hosts.
A worthwhile stay"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house in a nice, secluded location. Was very quiet and peaceful once you made it to the home, and the backyard was a great place to hang out. The house was clean and had a nice kitchen and amenities. Would definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for a nice, quiet place close to Patagonia lake and/or Rio Rico."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of our favorite trips in a long time! Beautiful and quiet, outstanding for dogs, far more amenities than most properties weve stayed at such as cookware, tableware, bathroom items even a first aid kit!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I needed a quiet place surrounded by nature as I‚Äôve been grieving the recent loss of my spouse. This place was perfect! Not only does it have an interesting history with Astronomy, it is a beautiful and comfortable home.
We found many interesting & beautiful birds sitting in the courtyard & the huge back porch.
Our two smallish dogs enjoyed the large gated (and rattlesnake fence) yard. So many different and exciting smells for them!
Guests need to be mindful of picking up their dog‚Äôs poop. Upon arrival, I picked up a kitchen sized trash bag full of prior guest‚Äôs dog‚Äôs poop.
Access roads are all unpaved with steep inclines & declines. Guests should polish up on safe downgrading to lower gears while traveling on these roads.
After the first trip back & forth, it becomes much easier & even fun to make it to & from Patagonia, Patagonia State Park & Lake, Sonoita Creek Nature Preserve, Paton‚Äôs Center for Hummingbirds, etc.
I will definitely book this amazing place again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is really cool if you are looking for peace and quiet in a beautiful setting. Really unique home with a few distinct spaces for relaxing indoors and outdoors. The property could be a little tricky to get to, definitely an all-wheel drive vehicle is ideal for the unpaved roads leading up to the place, but the host provided really detailed directions and our group was able to find it without a problem. We really appreciated how well-stocked the kitchen was with cooking supplies and that there was a big pile of firewood for us to use! Short drive to Patagonia Lake, Sonoita Creek natural area, and the town of Patagonia for activities and dining."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Aside from the GPS not taking us to the correct location , this is a beautiful, remote place to relax and unwind. I think that'sprobably why the GPS was confused! You do need all wheel or 4 wheel drive as recommended . The home was clean and comfortable with a beautiful beehive fireplace and super comfortable beds! We appreciated those! Games and books and fully equipped kitchen. The patio has a fire pit ,bbq and a gorgeous view of basically nothing! Peace and quiet. Hosts responds immediately and made sure we had all we needed. Highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were seeking a peaceful, private & quiet hime to rest and we got that! Such a beautiful home with amazing views inside and out. Had everything we needed for a comfortable stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very unique property sitting on top of its own hill with 360 degree views. Neighbors are very far away and few between, which provides for a great place to relax and enjoy the views. Very quiet. The only sounds were from cows wandering around, and other wildlife. We also saw a herd of deer hopping around.
The house is beautifully furnished and decorated, with everything you could need during your stay.
From the house, you can go west and enjoy the art and food in Tubac, or east, towards Patagonia Lake and the lively town of Patagonia.
It is about a 15 min drive to the nearest store, mostly on unpaved roads, so make sure to pack food on your way in."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a really amazing property just minutes from Tubac. Situated on a hill to the west of town, this house has just amazing views of the Santa Cruz Valley. It's a pretty unique house - basically two separate apartments which share a pool and patio. One half is a two bedroom, two bath with full kitchen, dining area and family room and the other half is a one bedroom, one bath again with a full kitchen and living area. Open the patio doors and you can go between the two sides easily, but also you can have a lot of privacy between the two units. The pool and hot tub were really nice - simple to operate and there's even a full sauna! Watching the moon rise over the mountains while sitting out on the patio was just great!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the start, Alex communicated effectively and in a timely manner. He was flexible with check-in and had the premises in good condition for us. He was extremely knowledgeable about the local scene and many different things to do. The space was comfortable and relaxing with a stunning natural landscape. I would absolutely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"On behalf of the bride and bridal party, we'd like to offer tremendous thanks to Tubac Property for allowing us to create such a special memory at this beautiful desert escape. As any typical bachelorette party, we kept the location a surprise. The bride entered the home with a blindfold and was smiling cheek to cheek not knowing what stood before her. Upon removal of the blindfold, her face became flushed and eyes were filled with tears as we greeted her with a confetti gun and a ""Bride to Be"" sash. It was the reaction we all wanted! Then began the tour of the property and everyone was stunned at the beauty, tranquility, and privacy of the home and especially the pool, jacuzzi, and fire pit area! The host made our stay all the more wonderful by ensuring we had everything we needed for a successful 3-day bachelorette getaway from essentials to a full propane tank for our steak dinner. I look forward to reserving future stays at this incredible BnB!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The houses were so nice and the pool and hot tub prestine. Great location - 2 min drive to town. Every room was clean without clutter. Host was very responsive and helpful. I cannot wait to visit again!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great and just as important the host was super responsive! Our 2 kiddos had a great time in the pool and the view is unmatched.
Thank you for having us!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was amazing and the view was wonderful! Having the pool/spa/sauna was a plus for sure. We spent a lot of time outdoors enjoying all the home had to offer. Host was very responsive and helpful. Would go back in the future.
One thing I think is important to know is that you are not able to get to the Master bedroom through the main house. You have to go outside just a couple steps to enter back into the home. This was more like a in-law suite, which can be great when traveling with another couple but not as good traveling with children.
Overall the view it has to offer and the outside space was wonderful!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This property is outstanding and the views are better than what the pictures look like! If anyone is looking for an Arizona escape it‚Äôs amazing!! Thank you Alex!

The bedroom was large and comfortable, with great AC. The bathroom was very clean although you do have to go downstairs from the bedroom to use it. The hot water can sometimes run low/out. The location is very good, near the old center of Nogales. It‚Äôs about 10 minutes walk to the border. Would definitely stay again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"one of my favorite rooms so far.
I had the pleasure to be in different rooms so I speak out of experience.
It is mostly quiet here (except for the train coming by every day, but that is just something you have to deal with in Nogales) - when the air conditioner is on, it feels like you are in your own little space.
they have great air conditioners, a must
every shop is pretty close, no more than 5 minutes away from your room.
you can even walk to the stores if you feel you need to move a little bit.
it feels safe because you see the cleaning staff every day and the police station is not too far away.
this room has very comfortable beds.
another great deal is that door dash works in Nogales. there is no kitchen but a microwave and a refrigerator.
the internet is great.
the shower is hot and if you have any questions, you get a response almost immediately.
the hosts are doing everything to make you feel at home here!
every room has a roku TV with apps like hulu and Netflix.
I truly love it here.
you can get the rooms rather cheap, even for a monthly stay.
it is very close to the border, so a great place for a night two or two if you are planning to go to Mexico.
you guys are amazing!
thank you for all that you do, Kayla, Aaron and staff.
it is always a pleasure to be your guest!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a great room!
great internet, great price, good shower, wonderful bed.

One of the best prices you can get, especially when you need to stay somewhere for a longer time.
the hosts go above a beyond to make sure you have a wonderful experience.
there is a fridge and microwave and a coffee machine - and a great air conditioner!
perfect for people like us wo need to work from home.
a few restaurants deliver here with Door dash as well.
I couldn't ask for a better place...

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed our stay. Pool was heated and close to both pool and gym. Gym is a bit dated. Is some traffic noise on top deck. Very well stocked.

A beautiful bottle of wine and pecans from a local nut company greeted us upon our arrival. We like coffee, Paula had fresh ground coffee waiting, the first day the coffee maker didn't work, she had a back-up immediately. Very reasonable for the accommodations, recommend highly."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was a totally functional space.
Pros: The check-in process was absolutely ideal--our door code was sent to us in advance, so within fifteen minutes of arrival we were unpacked and in our room! The communication from the staff was great. We were looking for a place to sleep before crossing the border in the morning and that's what this was. Best prices on the U.S. side of Nogales.
What to know: This is definitely a classic motel stay. Definitely not a 'Boutique' experience, nor necessarily ""nice."" Someone had definitely smoked in our room before and the smell lingered, we made sure to take absolutely everything out of the car at night, etc. This was the most expensive night of our trip into Mexico and certainly the most humble accommodations, but that's what you get when you book in the U.S.A. And like I said, still by far the best price we found for Nogales, AZ on Airbnb."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Karla is a FANTASTIC host and I can‚Äôt say enough great things about our stay üôåüèºüòÅ the home was absolutely beautiful and even bigger in person, looked exactly like the pictures, and omg the scenery is just so gorgeous!! You can sit on the patio furniture she has set up outside and just watch the view and get lost in the hills and beautiful scenery. Absolutely relaxing and peaceful home, me and my family loved it. She had all types of things to keep the kids (including me) entertained, from games and theatre chairs that fully recline, to a big tv with Netflix and movies. She even had condiments we could use and honestly anything you could think of was there. She responded super quick and was truly an AMAZING host!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing home!
Finding places to stay around Patagonia is always tough, so when we lucked out finding this place that met all our needs, I was certain there would be a catch. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong!
First, Karla is a wonderful host. Proactive and extremely helpful, she helped us plan our trip and made the stay completely stress-free.
The photos represent the house well, so what you see is what you'll get. There were also many extras, like jars of Keurig cups and various teas, that are always very appreciated. There's also a pass provided that allows you to enter/park at nearby Patagonia Lake State Park for free (daily passes are$15-$20 per car). We ended up using the pass 5-6 times over the week to watch sunsets, let our young kids play at the beach, and rent kayaks.
The house is great for families with kids, with lots of things to keep them occupied, and the outdoor patios and lounge areas provide the adults with spaces to decompress. Can't recommend enough!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Spacious, wonderful with lots of privacy."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed at many Airbnb places, but Karla‚Äôs place is now my absolute favorite. As a host, she was very responsive and proactive and made sure I had all the information I needed.
The location was amazing! Views to die for and so peaceful. We loved sitting out back in the afternoon and evening watching the sun go down and the stars come out. Also, we were just a few minutes drive to the lake.
The house itself was so nice. Very clean and lots of space. The kids loved the games and air hockey. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen big and well stocked.
If I could give this place 10 stars I would! Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and fantastic location. Karla is very responsive and the property is always clean and stocked. We have stayed twice, highly recommended."

It's peaceful and there's lots to do! We will definitely stay at Karla's again if we're back in the area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were 4 adults looking to spend Christmas birdwatching. Although the dirts around the house are limited to a few residents, the location is near Patagonia and the lake. Karla provided a free pass to the lake, which was much appreciated. The house was decorated for Christmas, a nice touch! The beds are quite comfortable and kitchen well equipped. We loved the big views from the hilltop. The yard area is problematic due to the stickers, but the house is surrounded by concrete, so we could access 360 degree views."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay in Karla‚Äôs beautiful home! There are lots of places to explore in the area and we visited Patagonia Lake multiple times thanks to the annual state park pass that Karla left for us to use during our stay. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place! It was perfect for my friends, our dogs, and their kids. The size of the house was huge and surrounded by views.

Altogether a very memorable stay.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karla's home is exceptionally beautiful and spacious--a veritable palace! The surrounding views--on all sides--are magnificent. The kitchen, bedrooms, and living space in general are comfortable and immaculate.

There is no better place for relaxing, enjoying nature or hiking in the surrounding areas."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We felt right at home from the moment we drove in. There was an area wide power outage and Karla kept us up to date on the progress of the power company and when it was supposed to be back on. The outage lasted about 12 hours and Karla offered to take us out to dinner for the inconvenience. We really enjoyed our time there.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Karla was extremely accommodating and responsive. The house was spacious and perfect for our girls weekend. The only thing I would recommend to the host it to have a nice durable wine opener since there are so many wineries near by.

,,,Not good
,,,"There was bugs in our room which I took pictures of and even though they switched us to a different room i the middle of the night. We had water leaking from the ceiling from the rain, and the bed got wet. Then my phones going off at like 2am after all of this fiasco asking me to log in and approver an alteration to my reservation. I told the host we are trying to sleep. We also asked for some more toilet paper, and clean towels and we were told because this is Airbnb that a half a roll of toilet paper and one set of towels is enough for the whole week. Guess again no it's not"
