2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bee & Paul‚Äôs apmt was very clean & comfortable. It was a hot & humid weekend and window air conditioning worked great! We enjoyed being close to the bike trail. Location is across the street from Mayo so there is noise from helicopters and ambulances, white noise from the air conditioning kept from this from being any bother. We had our small dog with us and there was plenty of space to take her out for a walk & area felt very safe. Need to be able to negotiate stairs to access apmt - not a problem for us but would be an issue for anyone with mobility problems. We would happily stay here again if we return to Eau Claire. Bee was very proactive in checking in with us to make sure all was going well. We enjoyed our stay üòä
Thank you!
Christine, Todd and Molly"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was quite small for space but didn't bother us as we were there to stop to get some sleep before heading to our final destination the next day.
We did have problems with the TV but was able to download the Roku app allowing our phone to act as a Roku controller. We had to play around with the cords to turn the TV on. Owners did say they would look into it.
Bed was comfortable but the front room couch not so much.
We received lots of communication which can be nice if you like that.
Nice for a short stay."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just needed to stay overnight to see some friends in the area and this was conveniently located downtown. Would be great for a multi-night stay and can accomdate a at least 2 more people if needed (it was just me and my girlfriend). Thanks for letting us stay!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the equivalent to staying in an apartment! Super easy to locate, very clean and comfortable. Feels like home. It‚Äôs within a good walking and driving distance to other activities. They also provided some good local activities. You may want to bring some napkins or paper towels as there aren‚Äôt any provided. I definitely would stay here again!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this Airbnb! The location alone makes it worth it to stay here. It is very close to many great restaurants, breweries, and shops. We loved that we could bring our dog as well. The hosts were extremely friendly and communicative throughout our stay which is really appreciated.
Only downside was walking into the place it was very chilly. We turned up all the radiators and waited for the heat to turn on all night but it never did and slept with tons of blankets and our sweatshirts/beanies on. We should have messaged the hosts sooner, because they promptly had the downstairs tenants turn the heat up for us which fixed the problem for the radiators."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location for downtown activities! We loved the use of space - cozy and functional.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, had everything we needed and close to downtown and the river!"
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"In my opinion, this is not near SuperHost quality. Please read the fine print because you will only get coffee for one day, there is no cancellation fee, and we had little details like no paper towel and a guestbook that had something spilled on it that was sticky. The cleaning person offered to bring paper towel on day 2, but we found other accommodations, so it was not worth it. It feels like this space has been furnished with ‚Äúcabin like‚Äù beds and furniture. The pictures look very inviting, but the furniture, beds and bedding were awful. We enjoy staying in older homes that people proudly share with eclectic furniture and belongings, but these lacked quality, which we expect from a SuperHost. If you have a pet and are limited for spaces you can reserve, you may like this, but we did not need that, and we were sadly disappointed."

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location! Everything needed to make a meal or walk to go out. My only ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù was for the cleaning fee. Communication was excellent, everything was clean, but that extra charge seemed higher than necessary."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment/house was very spacious and had everything we needed for a nice visit with our college daughter.

2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The decor was disappointing, especially the rusted TV trays utilized as end tables. The kitchen is very outdated and small. The refrigerator was too cold and the seal is coming loose. We had to throw some produce after our stay.
Queen bed was comfortable.
The rule to not let dogs poop in the yard seemed silly, but we complied."

The bedroom with a full mattress has glass French doors that open directly to the living room. Not ideal for loud snoring.
Overall a good stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Place worked out well. Walked several blocks to a great restaurant and then returned via walking path next to the river on a beautiful evening. A bit small for the 5 of us (3 teenage daughters) but it was fine. Clean and well kept.

Out the door and less than a block away you can connect to the trail that leads straight to UWEC, Old Abe Trail, and Chippewa River Trail. Plenty of places to eat and grab a coffee within walking, biking, or driving distance. Loved having two separate rooms as the two of us friends have different sleeping habits and wake up times.

I would stay here again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was our 1st visit to Wisconsin as we were moving our daughter to Eau Claire for a summer internship.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Middle Ground is such a great place to stay! There were so many unique amenities and touches that made our stay a blast and nice getaway. The kids enjoyed the ping ping and Foosball in the basement, dad enjoyed the vinyl and endless streaming options, and mom had a good time on the hammock out back. At the end of the day, everyone had plenty of room to crash and get an awesome night's sleep in the quiet neighborhood. Great value and fun stay. Appreciate their great communication as well."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,AWESOME!!! Would stay again for sure. So much better than a hotel for a week in Eau Claire! Spacious so we could all spread out. Sidewalks got icy and Sean de-iced them before we had to ask.

The location was close to lots of amenities. We had an awesome time at the kitschy brew pub up the street called ‚Äú3rd & Vine‚Äù, don‚Äôt miss it if you like craft beer and gourmet cheese! Defiantly try the beer and cheese pairing and one of their charcuterie boards."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is a Time Machine back to the seventies or so. The home is spotless and very comfortable. It is also intriguingly older with expansions and remodeling over the years. The hosts have made a great design choice to give it its sixties/seventies vibe‚ÄîI think my favorite feature is the step up into the living room. I remember visiting houses like this as a kid‚Äî-except back then the cool albums would have been in the bedrooms of my friends, not in their parents‚Äô collections!
A ping pong table, a drum set, and a washer and dryer! It is an original Airbnb trifecta of amenities!
We loved the stay."

It is located very near the downtown area for other things we wanted to see and do. We spent lots of time on the private back deck, looking at the big yard with woods at the far edge. Lisa and Sean live next door and were always immediately available, either by message or in person."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, 3 children and I stayed at this place while visiting my in laws. It was the perfect amount of space for my 5 and 6 year old boys and my 14 year old got his own room off of the side of the kitchen which made it convenient for him. We played ping-pong downstairs as a family and were able to watch movies upstairs as a family. We also were able to make dinner and invite my in-laws over to eat with us on the spacious patio. I also was able to play old records for my father-in-law who has alzeimers. I've never seen him smile so big and so relaxed. We will for sure keep this place in mind the next time we come. It was truly like going to grandmas house but with modern twists. Thanks again Sean and Lisa. üòäü´∂"

Plenty of room for two active boys, ages 9 and 6, sisters, and our elderly father. This is a very clean, spacious home with common areas and places to have quiet time alone. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood, including the Saturday farmer's market. Nice long run through Rod and Gun and Carson Park. The boys were a big fan of the foosball table in the basement. The backyard is spacious and the hammock provided was so comfortable I slept there both nights. Hosts were communicative and responsive, letting us know about a gathering they had at check-in. Coffee and instant oatmeal and grits are provided for breakfast. The kitchen is stocked for cooking and has some species for use. Thoughtful extras - reusable shopping bags, bug repellent and umbrella in the entryway, info on local attractions. Fun 1970s theme."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place for multiple guests, with private bedrooms and plenty of space in kitchen, dining, and living area as well as basement. Great to have toys and high chair available, so we didn‚Äôt have to pack as much. Nice backyard as well!"

The price is fantastic. This is an amazing value for the amount of square footage you have. You will have no issue finding a quiet place to relax if your bring a large family.
The neighborhood is perched on a hill overlooking Eau Claire. Your only minutes away from great restaurants like The Classic Garage, Chick a Dee‚Äôs Diner or awesome brew pubs like Brew Project and The Lazy Monk.
Boom the Middle Ground. You‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôve come out on top."

Met Nick in the driveway, friendly guy!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed here as daughter was graduating from UWEC. Nice to be close to campus and downtown EC but home was in wooded secluded area with lots of wildlife viewing. House was equipped with what we needed to use as we cook all meals here. Would stay here again!
-Mpls G's"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Really nice private, quiet setting with Wild Turkeys and Deer present each day. The house amenities, furnishings, flooring, bathroom and kitchen area were all done tastefully and well thought out. The house really lacks nothing for your stay and we appreciated the kitchen being well supplied with everything to cook with and enjoy eating in.
We would stay here again for sure."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you want to feel like you are in the Northwoods with all the city benefits close by this is your spot. So peaceful and beautiful surroundings yet 5 mins away from everything you need. I highly recommend this place.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Paul's 4 or 5 times now. Every time we stay, I remember why. The house is cozy and absolutely stocked with every possible thing we may need. The beds are so cozy and we really enjoy the solitude. We will most definitely be back again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We were extremely pleased with the property and our interaction with Paul and Anita. This was the best home for us that we have rented. The home is an older home that Paul and Anita have remodeled with attention to detail. The kitchen is the best furnished as is the rest of the house that we have ever experienced. The quiet wooded area around the house with various wildlife was a pleasure to observe.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean comfy furniture and bed‚Äôs We saw some turkeys outside the kitchen window.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paul and Anita's place was as clean as the other reviewers were stating! Clean, comfortable and a good selection of amenities. It was nice to have a private spot just outside of the neighborhood, and it felt further out than it is!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean place. Being on the end of a road, very secluded. Very easy checking in and checking out was the same with easy, simple instructions. Over all, nice place for the price."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! It was secluded, yet close to town. The hosts were very responsive and the house was immaculate; almost staged with everything in its place. We have stayed in several Air B & Bs and this was one of the best! We would absolutely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect getaway! Beautiful scenery with a woodsy feel, just minutes from downtown. The home itself is clean and updated with homey touches everywhere - from the plethora of comfy blankets to the full equipped kitchen. My 2 college friends and 1 had a great time playing games, reading, watching movies, and catching up. And we loved that we each had our own room and that the toilet/shower were separate from the sink which made getting ready easy. I will definitely be renting again next time I'm in the area!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time staying at Paul & Anita's. To say that these two are the best is a huge understatement. We have been welcomed in with incredible kindness. We were in town for a curling competition, and they left a note cheering on the team. They even followed along on our progress.
The home itself is immaculate and perfectly stocked. Beds are next level comfortable and the pillows are amazing. The kitchen is laid out perfectly, and there has not been a time where they didn't have something we needed. Cozying up with a good book in the corner chair is one of my favorite things to do to relax. We have been visited by different wildlife during our stays. This trip we must have seen at least 20 deer around the yard.
We are already booked for our next trip and we cannot wait to be back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's Airbnb In the Woods was a wonderful place to reonnect with the gal pals! It is close to downtown restaurants and nightlife, while also being a peaceful, cozy respite. Check-in was extremely easy and Paul was very friendly/communicative. The house was well stocked with cozy blankets, games/movies/puzzles, and the kitchen had a fantastic selection of cookware, utensils, and glassware to make a relaxing night-in as fun as a night out."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBnB's we've stayed at. The home was in a quiet area on several acres of land, no through traffic, yet Paul's place is within 10-15 minutes of pretty much anything you needed. The home was comfortable, clean, and welcoming. I was very impressed by the kitchen and cooking tools. I love to cook and Paul's place was set up for serious cooking!
There are lots of little parks in the area (including a few in walking distance), and you are within 20 minutes of several cool attractions, including the Leinenkugels brewery in Chippewa Falls.
I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful area so close to downtown. We saw wild turkeys and whitetail deer in the morning. Very quiet and quaint and very very clean.
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"Paul was very communicative and made the stay seamless. They have a newly refurbished home inside with lots of thoughtful touches throughout the home. When I pulled up to check in, it was nightime and they had left a light on outside and inside. This along with other things really helped to personalize the experience. We loved the location. It was close to everything we planned to do on our trip but still felt very private and tranquil."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Paul's place was very nice and clean. It's a nice secluded place within walking distance to downtown Eau Claire.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great location! And a lovely interior - easy access to all of the things we wanted to do. Welcoming and comfy with ageless interior design!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This house is a hidden gem in Eau Claire. We have stayed here three times now and we cannot say enough positives about it. From the location to the amenities to the evening show of beautiful wildlife, this house truly does not disappoint. We will see you next year for sure! Thank you Paul and Anita for sharing your home with us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! The place was so lovely. The outside is very understated, but the inside is remarkably modern and there are thoughtful touches everywhere. Some examples...each piece of furniture in the living room had a blanket to use and there were extras available in a storage area; the basement contains a wide range of movies...definitely something for everyone; the kitchen contains not only standard items for cooking/eating in-home, but also an assortment of paper plates/plastic silverware/storage containers/ziploc bags for taking food with you for a picnic.
There was some interesting wildlife that entertained us in the mornings and afternoons (four deer and five turkeys). We had everything we needed to enjoy our weekend vacation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for a conference and needed somewhere to stay last minute. This was the perfect choice! It's tucked back into the woods so it's very private and quiet but it's also no more than a 10-minute drive from the downtown area. Also I didn't have any trouble getting a Lyft/Uber to the house and they were able to find it fine.
Any amenities you could possibly need are available and Paul was incredibly responsive. I would definitely stay here again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This cozy home in the woods is the nicest rental I have ever experienced. It feels remote, yet is conveniently located close to the heart of Eau Claire. The kitchen is FULLY equipped!! The bathroom is also well-furnished with towels, hooks, a bath mat, etc. The beds are comfortable and there are closets and luggage frames. The living room is a great place to relax, with good lighting and a very nice television. I arrived after dark, to find rope lights along the front path, the front porch light on, and a light on inside the house. There are nightlights to help you find your way as well. This host has thought of everything to make a stay easy and enjoyable. Very clean!! Clear and simple check-in and check-out instructions. This was the perfect stay for me with three senior adults who came to celebrate my daughter's (their grandchild's) wedding. Much less expensive than three hotel rooms -- and exceedingly nicer!! We were all thrilled!!"

The place was quiet, lots of nature around (including quite a few deer!), spotless and cozy. Not to mention all the helpful information about local restaurants and things to do. 10/10 would book again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay exceeded expectations! The host was very accommodating when our arrival was impacted by a winter storm. And the extra bonus was arriving to a super inviting space that was tastefully decorated for the Christmas holiday.
The property is very well maintained with a well stocked kitchen. It's also in a beautiful quiet setting that really is 'in the woods' complete with deer. The location also has easy access for walks to nearby parks and no doubt biking during the summer months. It worked out really well for us and we look forward to a repeat visit."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at Paul‚Äôs place. It is close to many things yet you have the feeling you‚Äôre far from it all. Very private and beautiful.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very quiet, clean, secluded house in Eau Claire! It was nicely remodeled optimizing the floor plan to make the space feel very open. Appreciated the well stocked kitchen to be able to cook meals - and the aluminum foil as we forgot ours!!
Great communication from the hosts, Paul & Anita. They are very accommodating and quick to respond.
We enjoyed seeing deer out the front window!
Thank you for sharing your place with us."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul & Anita's house was amazing. It's as-described, but better, full of amenities that make for a perfect stay in a really quiet, cozy area surrounded by wildlife. Their communication was outstanding - from making sure there were no problems checking in right down to addressing anything that needed attention; or if something was missing that we needed. It's less than a 10 minute drive to anything and everything! When we return to the area, I will want to stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! Quiet and secluded, yet 5 minutes from town! Very clean, and the hosts were very receptive to all our needs! Drive slow on the road though, you may have to stop for the herd of deer and turkeys to cross üòÅ"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay at Paul and Anita's and it never disappoints. Super clean, every amenity your could ever need and the wooded surroundings are perfect for morning coffee and night star gazing. not to mention the daily visitors; deer, bunnies and turkey!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a peaceful stay here surrounded by nature while I was in town at a funeral. One morning I woke up to see a buck across the street! I appreciated some of the fine detail put into the Airbnb, such as a clean laundry basket and folding table ready for use."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about Paul and Anita's place for our recent 5-day stay. We were a party of 4 adults who all agree that this is the best rental place out of a couple of dozen that we've collectively experienced. The house is newly-remodeled with a well thought-out design that optimizes both efficiency and spaciousness. It is very clean, well-maintained, well-appointed, well-stocked, comfortable and highly organized. The kitchen is amazing - stocked with everything you need, high quality (even sharp knives!) and easy to find to cook meals, which we did. The well-stocked coffee cart was greatly appreciated every morning. The beds and linens were super comfy, the bathroom was efficient with the vanity separated by a door from the shower and toilet. The towels were luxurious, the shower was great and all was clean and organized like the rest of the house. The living room has a nice view and the furniture was lovely and comfortable. They have an amazing collection of movies and lots of fun games, which we greatly enjoyed. Everything was in top working order, including the (clean) basement washer and dryer. The location was perfect for us - quiet and secluded, yet close to downtown Eau Claire by car and easy, close access to the highway. We enjoyed the outdoor picnic table, large lawn and beautiful wooded surroundings. We loved going on walks and spotting wildlife in the area. Paul's communication was excellent. We would definitely stay again. Thanks, Paul and Anita!"

Such a great place to stay...would definitely stay here again!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paul and Anita were incredible hosts and we loved staying at this airbnb in the woods. It is within minutes from the downtown area but you wouldn't know it, because it is tucked into a wooded area. When we arrived, we saw a wild turkey and deer waiting to greet us. Beyond the regular amenities you might expect, Paul and Anita have ""thought of everything!"" (as my mother in law said). They even have DVDs in the basement you can watch. Loved this stay so much!"

Space has been maximized for three bedrooms, a bathroom (with sink area in its own area), cozy living space, full kitchen, and dining room. Laundry is also available. We were so pleased with the location. It is absolutely silent where the house is located in the woods, yet it is still in the ""city"". We were pleased to wake up to deer in the front across the street, heard owls when we returned at night, and even saw a fox hiding across the road. Paul's communication is top notch. We will always book here when we are in Eau Claire!"

A delightful retreat within the city of Eau Claire!"

You are really in the woods here and you feel like your alone, and its really beautiful. When we come back to this area again, we will surely consider this rental. Thank you again Paul and Anita. Rebecca and Randy"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a gem in the middle of the city!
If you‚Äôre looking to enjoy a secluded, natural, clean space, look no further. We saw turkey and deer on a daily basis and were lucky enough to see a fox and beaver as well. Paul and Anita have thought of every little comfort to make your stay enjoyable, and the place simply could not have been any cleaner.
It did take some time for me to adjust to the audio and video surveillance in the front yard, but I do understand the need to protect this beautiful property. There was a plumbing issue in the beginning of our stay, but Paula and Anita were extremely responsive and made sure it was taken care of immediately.
Overall, I could not imagine a better place to call home for the summer. I hope to stay again."

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect hideaway, and Paul and Anita thought of all of the perfect touches throughout the house. The house looks like your miles away from town, but you pull right out of the driveway into the city! We brought both our mountain bikes and kayaks for an adventure weekend, and we couldn‚Äôt have made a better choice! 5-10 minute bike ride right to downtown! We took our kayaks down the road to Carson Park twice for a beautiful paddle and swim around the lake! If your looking to enjoy Eau Claire, you‚Äôll love staying here!"

We want to return to this lovely home and spend a long weekend to explore the area and spend more time at the home. thank you again"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've used airbnb in other cities and decided to stay at Paul's place in Eau Claire for a May weekend. My husband and I, along with my daughter's boyfriend's parents, shared this place. We used two bedrooms, each with a comfortable queen bed. We didn't use the twin bed so cannot comment on that one. The linens and towels are first rate, thick and luxurious. The living room is comfortable, the kitchen small but well stocked. Everything you need is here and additional amenities include K cups and tea. There's a coffee pot and a Kuerig. The yard is large with turkey, deer and rabbit seen daily. We did a little hiking through the woods and set up a game of Kubb on the lawn. There's even a picnic table in the yard! We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone wanting a place in the Eau Claire area."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Would recommend it to my family and friends.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôve stayed in homes all over the world and this was one of the cleanest we have ever stayed in and was super comfortable. Location was excellent, on a quiet dead end road in the woods with wildlife seen each day we were there and yet only a few min to anywhere in the city. We really loved this home and would love to come back to stay again! You can tell the owners really care about this place and the comfort of their renters!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul's place was an awesome find at a great price. The house is nestled at the end of a quiet street. The inside was immaculately clean and was more spacious than expected. I will definitely book again when I'm in the area!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"These hosts are amazing!
We had a loss in the family and had to book a place to stay for the weekend. We instantly feel in love with the pictures online. Paul and Anita responded instantly to our booking request and all of our messages.
When we arrived there was a sympathy card addressed to our family. It was such a small act of kindness, but it left and amazing impact on all of us!
The location was amazing! We don't see wild life often, so seeing families of deer and rabbits was fun! We kept our eyes out for Foxes as well, but no luck this trip. Maybe next time!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay in Eau Claire, especially if you are traveling with family and want some peace and quiet.
The house was extremely clean and well organized. Three bedrooms so everyone had their own room. Furniture, beds, decor, etc. all newer and made the place very comfortable and relaxing.
At the end of the road in a forested area of Eau Claire, almost feels like you are out in the country.
The location was great for me and my family, 5 minutes to downtown and/or the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.
Communication with Paul was easy and checking in was a breeze.
One of the best Airbnb places I have stayed in."

2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul and Anita's place was the perfect spot for our girls weekend! Just far enough from the city to feel like a get-away, but close enough to get to everything Eau Claire has to offer in minutes. The home and property were more beautiful (and clean)! than I expected. Would definitely stay again!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Probably the cleanest and most organized airbnb I've stayed at. The location was perfect for our needs and Paul was very responsive if/when I had questions. Will definitely be looking to book his place again next year.

2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect spot for a college reunion among friends, we enjoyed having space to drink coffee together in the mornings or put together snacks in the kitchen. We were a very easy 10 minute drive from anywhere we needed to go in EC and were able to enjoy deer in the yard. We all agreed we‚Äôd return again, this was a great option for us. Paul made it easy to check in and share what we needed to know about the house. Thanks!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a family reunion. The home was comfortable, clean and very convenient to everywhere we needed to be. Seeing wildlife each day was an added bonus."

Saw multiple turkeys, a fox, rabbits, squirrels and deer. House has been completely remodeled and updated. Great instructions, host was available but we didn't need to contact him. Will be contacting him again for the next Eau Claire festival we come to. Thanks!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul‚Äôs place is exactly as described - a wooded oasis in the city. Deer and turkeys visit every morning. We have rented many places and Paul‚Äôs place tops the list for cleanliness. It was very comfortable and had every amenity we needed for our short stay.

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul and Anita‚Äôs place is a secluded, very well maintained, beautifully updated, modern cabin in the woods down a dirt road. We saw some deer, a red fox, turkeys in the dusk and dawn. This place is perfect for a weekend getaway with plenty of sunshine. This place it a real treat, and minutes from the fun city of Eau Claire."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although I didn‚Äôt meet Paul in person, he was very responsive to communication. The place was as described in the listing. Would recommend."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's place was better than advertised. Very clean and private...no neighbors to worry about, other than the deer that would be lingering across the street in the morning. Towels were left out, beds were nicely ready for us, and instructions were clear and allowed us to relax and enjoy our time. Lot of little extras, with tips for the area and Netflix ready to go.
Will definitely return."

2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're in the area, this is the place for you. This little house is back in the woods and so private. The minute you walk in you are wowed by all the remodel and updates that have been done. The house is cozy, beautiful, and in a perfect location. We enjoyed the comfy beds and lush towels, supplies, coffee, movies, cozy feel, ideas for area activities, and the bright spot with the sunshine bursting through the large picture living room windows. (I can't even imagine how beautiful this place is in the fall with all the trees, as it was breathtaking after the newly fallen snow during our stay!) It's located so close to the UW-Eau Claire campus and downtown area of Eau Claire. I would stay again if we come back to town. You'll love all the amenities and the beauty of the place."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is truly a wonderful ‚Äúhome‚Äù to relax and be close to the city but totally secluded and peaceful. Accommodations are ‚Äútop shelf‚Äù and extremely modern. Can not recommend highly enough. You will not be disappointed!
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A cozy, well appointed home nestled in the woods, just minutes from the action in Eau Claire. Beautiful amenities, comfortable beds and spotless! Better than a 5 star hotel! If our travels take us back to the Eau Claire area we will be back for another stay."

2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay at Paul's place. The home was very comfortable, clean and beautiful decorated. The extra holiday touches made our stay special. The kitchen had everything we needed to make a lovely Christmas dinner. Our family enjoyed both types of coffee makers. We loved how close we were to Woodman's, the mall, restaurants and movie theaters. We even went bowing at Wagner's. The quiet neighborhood was a great place to return to each night. Paul was great to work with. The days passed to quickly. We are hoping to stay again soon."

2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay. Really great location but yet you felt you were out n the middle of no where. The beds were so comfortable, updated kitchen, great little living space, and there was even Netflix! I would recommend this place in a heart beat!"

So it wasn‚Äôt even a question where we would choose to stop. Collin is an amazing host and you won‚Äôt find a more comfortable and quiet place to stay.
When we woke to leave it had snowed all night and was still snowing. Collin was out snow blowing a path around our car and shoveled our walkway. Goes way above and beyond. Will definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our one night stay and found everything we needed - shower, mini fridge, microwave, comfy beds. The reservation process was easy and the house was close to the freeway. The entryway is shared with the homeowner and the rental is through a doorway separating the area from the rest of the house. A cute dog named Bella greeted us from behind a pet gate and the owner and family were friendly too!"

Would 100% consider staying again if needing a place to stay in Eau Claire for a weekend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Collins home was beautiful and very peaceful! What made it even better was it was only 5 minutes from the mall, restaurants, and other attractions. He allowed my cat and I stay and the rooms were spacious and clean.

Wonderful conversations around the fire pit, I was able to use the kitchen to bake for us all! I can see exactly why Collin is a SUPERHOST and we would love to stay with him the next time we are in the area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Collin was great about changing our reservation and allowing us to add a day. He was super friendly and nice. This is a great space if you are looking for a motel type space. There isn‚Äôt a living area, it‚Äôs just bedrooms, bathroom and huge shower area. The space worked perfectly for us. Wisconsin in October is beautiful and Collin‚Äôs property is no exception to that rule."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, looked just like the photos. Was exactly as described, it is very much part of their house. Wasn‚Äôt noisy, the space is very relaxing.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After three days on the road, it was a welcome site to see Collin's place. Far and away my best place over my journey back to MN. Large space (two bedrooms and a bathroom with rain shower and regular shower). Private (after entering through a common area. Think like a hotel lobby before entering your room). Wonderful to walk my dog, Henry in the mowed paths through the field and view the fields from the hilltop. Easy to find. A bit of a steep driveway (but easy to climb with my SUV). Collin honored my special requests re: unscented sheets/blankets/towels as well as keeping Bella in her space when requested. I would definitely book again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Collin's was beyond perfect, first time using airbnb and he was extremely helpful and the directions for his place were spot on, very flexible with me being in and out a couple times over the weekend.

his house was like a mansion and everything was pristine!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This property is gorgeous! Really lovely area.
It was a fine stay for one evening, and was my first time staying in a rental where the owners were also home. I expected there to be some kind of common area in the private section of the house, and was a little disappointed to discover that it was just the two bedrooms and bathroom.
While the space itself was very clean and tidy, it also was very much IN their home. At one point their dog even rushed us at the private door which ended up being fine, but could have ended badly if my dog wasn‚Äôt neutral with strange dogs.
For the price point, I expected a little more privacy. But it was fine for our quick stay :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Collin is a very welcoming host! Comfortable beds too. üòä
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Collin was great! He was very helpful with the check in. The rooms and bathroom were very clean. We plan on staying here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were at Colin's place for one night. He gave us an excellent recommendation on a restaurant (Stella Blue's), which was the dining highlight of our trip. The place was clean and well arranged. Colin was very outgoing and welcoming, glad to help as needed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"A cute apartment with great bathroom. You live in the house of Collin's family, but you have your own wing, which offers you enough privacy. Most of all, we liked Collin's helpfulness and friendly manner."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay and Collin was very flexible with our arrival time. Check in was super easy and exactly as his instructions stated. The bed was comfortable and there was everything we needed for a stopover stay in Eau Claire.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Collin's for a few days while we were in Eau Claire for a conference. We had a wonderful stay at his place! He was friendly, welcoming, and gave us great suggestions. The place had nice touches that make you feel at home. We enjoyed exploring EC with this as our base. Collin has a great family, and their dog [Bella] is as friendly as she is adorable! We wouldn't hesitate to book again upon returning to EC, WI!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"clean, comfortable bed, just as advertised. my only request would be some kind of water filter or a different way to get water other than the bathroom sink. it was difficult to fill our filter jugs.
wish we would have arrived earlier to enjoy the fire!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quite, and the perfect place to stay when traveling through."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at Collin's was short and sweet, as it was just an overnight visit to attend an event in Eau Claire. The space was clean, spacious, and had everything we needed for a quick one night stay. A great spot for anyone not needing a kitchen and those who appreciate some beautiful landscape."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stayed here on our way back through town and it worked out perfectly-just like the first stay!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Collin was proactive in making sure we had everything we needed to access his place. He was very helpful and friendly. My only complaint would be lack of water pressure in the shower, but that is a personal preference and not something I spoke to Collin about."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful property just outside of town with mowed walking trails to stretch the legs. Nice clean rooms
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Collin‚Äôs guest wing was perfect for us passing through Eau Claire with our dog! He was very responsive, kind, and helpful.

Handy coffee machine and electric kettle, microwave, mini fridge. We rested very well here!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is breathtaking‚Äîlots of birds, cute critters & fireflies outside in the summer. The rooms were great, everything was super clean, and the host was responsive.
You can tell they put a lot of love & thought into this place. The only bad part was having to say goodbye to the cutest dog ever :'("
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible views and very quiet rural area. It‚Äôs a family home so don‚Äôt expect dead silence all the time and you‚Äôll be happy. Everything I needed for a long weekend of work in town. Very comfortable king bed in the bedroom I used and the windows all have insulated french door shutters so it can be pitch black if you‚Äôd like! Great little kitchenette with a kettle, coffee pod maker, microwave, hot plate, and fridge. Plenty of closet space to hang cloths if needed. Met the host briefly and he was as nice in person as he was over the messages we exchanged where he gave me info on where to park."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay very much. Lots for my 7 year old son to do. Very clean and spacious bedrooms. Priced great!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Collin was an amazing host! He let us check in a bit early and we arrived to everything being set. The land is absolutely beautiful and private, with walking trails accessible around the home. We spent our time exploring the Eau Claire area and found that while the home is out in the country, there was super close access to restaurants, stores, and hikes. We then ended our weekend sitting outside in the beautiful weather by his fire place- which he has all the supplies for the guest ready. We hope to stay again in the future!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful setting in a private wing of a house. Quiet, with comfortable beds, cozy, homey vibes."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at this place. The beds are memory foam and so comfortable. The sheets are soft and there are plenty of pillows and blanket. You can control the heat in each room. We so appreciate the microwave, mini fridge, and Keurig. Our guest that joined us in the 2nd bedroom also enjoyed the stay. I highly recommend."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Collin's place. The memory foam beds were so comfortable. We slept very well. The bed linens were soft cotton and there were lots of pillows in a variety of styles for comfort. All the amenities were there as promised. They even had a cool mist humidifier running upon arrival, which is very nice in these winter months. It smelled good upon arrival because they had a scented wax burner going. The shower is the size of a small elevator. Nice! We never heard the hosts, so it was very quiet. We would for sure stay here again, no doubt. It was perfect."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for something toward the east side of Eau Claire and this fit the bill. We needed a clean welcoming place with 2 bedrooms for one night. It does not have a ‚Äú living area‚Äù or a kitchen, but again we did not need that and there was a microwave. The price was very fair. I would recommend this place for those needing a ‚Äú home base‚Äù for a several day visit to the Eau Claire area"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had such a wonderful stay at Collin and Ashley‚Äôs home. The private wing in their house was incredibly comfortable and they have a very kind family (including a sweet dog!). It‚Äôs a great spot for visiting Eau Claire because it is a short drive from the city and a lot of nature trails. We can‚Äôt say enough great things about this place! Such incredibly welcoming hosts. Thank you!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The shower was amazing and the entire space was one of the cleanest I have ever stayed in. The house and area were quiet and I appreciated having a heater in each bedroom so we could personalize our comfort. I highly recommend this place!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super convenient location for our family gathering!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My second stay was just a great as the first one. Absolutely no complaints. It‚Äôs nice to go to a room with A/C after a long day at work. A huge bonus is being greeted by a dog every once and awhile.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay!! My sister & I plus my daughter & her boyfriend were in town for a family reunion. The setup was perfect for us & more than affordable! The bedrooms were spacious and the beds were comfortable. As a coffee addict, it was nice having a Keuring in our room....along with a fridge & microwave! When we got home from dinner Friday night, there was a fire in the firepit ready for us. Collin & his wife were wonderful hosts (with a beautiful family including the dogs!). I highly recommend their home if you're looking for a place to stay."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Collin and Ashely's home is well back from the highway on a hill with a large yard. It is a beautiful location and has a large yard with plenty of grass that my dog was able to run around in. Check in was easy and there is plenty of parking space in the drive way. The guest suite is off to the side and was very clean and spacious. I only used the master bedroom, but the room was quite large and had A/C. The bed was clean and very comfortable and the room had a small fridge, microwave, and coffee maker on a desk. The desk was the perfect size to set up my laptop and do schoolwork and I could make myself coffee right there as I worked. The bathroom was very fancy, with a HUGE shower and double shower head and fluffy towels. Coffee and tea was provided as well as some cups and plates and there were shampoo/conditioner/shower gel dispensers in the bathroom. It was a very comfortable place to stay the night and Collin and Ashely were so nice and easy to communicate with. I really enjoyed my time there!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was wonderful! We weren't around much, just to sleep, but when we were there everything was perfect!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Ashley and Collin were the most amazing and gracious hosts we could have ever asked for! It truly felt like staying with family. We were in town on bereavement business which made for long days of emotionally taxing work. They understood that and were so attentive. They made us a fire in the fire pit outside, accommodated our additional requests (which were many), and communicated clearly and with such kindness. Above and beyond care and attention. Their adorable dog brought us such joy, and it was just so nice to feel like we were part of their lives for a week. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a peaceful, family-friendly spot and some quiet respite, it is right on the edge of town. The room was equipped with a kitchenette which was so helpful for us, and we also discovered a great little Finnish coffee spot nearby. Loads of space to walk around on beautiful grassy hills! During the day I spotted so many amazing plants and at night there were lightning bugs! Also, the shower was a major luxurious plus‚Äîit was just all so perfect for our needs. Very thankful that we found this family during this time, it felt very loving and aligned.üíö"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really nice private space furnished with just about everything you need. Easy check-in through side entrance to the space.

Didn't have any issues during our (brief) stay, but we would definitely consider coming back next time we're nearby"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This home was perfectly cozy for 4 family members to stay in. The beds are extra comfortable! Thank you Collin!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house offers wonderful views of the hillsides below. Enjoyed the fire pit in the yard. The bedrooms had very comfortable mattresses and nice bedding. Shutters on the bedroom windows made rooms very dark so they were great for sleeping. Rooms and bathroom were very clean. Collin and family were very hospitable. Easy drive to heart of Eau Claire.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Host served us very well. place was clean and very nice . Beds were very comfy. Would Definitely stay here again.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great experience!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Collin is a great host. He makes check-in easy and convenient, the bed is soft and comfortable, the TV has many great channels, and the room is pitch black (though you can open the wooden window doors to let in natural light during the day), making it easier to fall asleep at night. I would definitely recommend :)."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a relaxing stay in the country. If you are in need of some dog therapy Bella will greet you with a wagging tail. Watch the chickens wandering around the yard. Enjoy the fire pit and some roasted marshmallows. The house has a great walk in shower. Mattresses are all memory foam. You will have a wing of the house all to yourself with all the amenities you will need. Located conveniently just south of the interstate. You will enjoy your stay.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Unexpectedly cozy spot right outside of town, but so close to everything! And guys, if the views and beds aren't enough to have you writing great reviews, the shower set up was pure bliss and made our stay here feel like a luxury treat! Hosts are super responsive and incredibly helpful."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our GPS did not give us good directions, but if you look at the directions they give you, you will find a pleasant place to stay, exactly as they describe it, the perfect distance from Eau Claire busy life. Their place worked perfectly for our daughter and us to each have a bedroom. There was a fridge and microwave for our midnight snack, and a huge bathroom. The host family, adults, children, and pets were all friendly and welcoming. Thanks so much for a nice place to stay."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You will meet friendly chickens. You may meet a friendly and well-behaved dog. You may not have terminable solitude, but I had a great campfire, and the hosts made sure I had what I needed to grill. Comfortable beds, big screen TVs!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely a sweet gem out of the way of the busyness of the city.
It was a quiet wing of the house with a separate entrance that was easy to access.
Owners helped us find great places to eat outside of the beaten path!
We would definitely stay again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably that‚Äôs the best place i stayed in it so far and i love the shower and Collin is so helpful and he won‚Äôt hesitate doing his best to make your accommodation just perfect.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is rural yet surprisingly close to Eau Claire. The host family are very pleasant and helpful but also respected our privacy when we preferred it. With the doors shut we couldn‚Äôt hear the normal life going on in the rest of the house at all. The grounds include steep trails for walking the dogs in a natural setting, or the roads have good shoulders for longer leashed walks. For a quiet getaway with the pups this is a great spot!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fun stay ... the young family activity and rural setting were a perfect fit for us.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely and easy place to rest! Distance to the city is perfect. Check in and communication was super efficient.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a great stay! The private wing of the room really allows you to have your own space and it‚Äôs not too far from everything we wanted to do. It was also very clean and a well taken care of space! The hosts are so nice and their young kids & puppy are so cute!! 10/10
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, beautiful, and quiet place to stay. The host family is so friendly, including the puppy, the cat, and the chicken. It‚Äôs so convenient to go to dinner at local restaurants. A peaceful sunset view is a bonus."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were great! Probably the cleanest Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in and the beds were sooooo comfortable! The shower is huge with double shower heads. The setting is beautiful and Collin and Ashley were amazing! We brought our large chocolate lab with us and he felt right at home!!! (He made friends with the dog, Bella üòÅ) We will definitely be back! Thanks again!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This 2 BR, 1 bath portion of the home is very comfortable. Bathroom has a great shower with waterfall second shower head. Location is in the middle of rolling hills and we listened to roosters as we drank morning coffee at the fire pit. So peaceful."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay with Colin very nice spacious bedrooms and large bathroom. perfect for the traveler looking for a quiet comfortable place to stay. also very quick access to the Eau Claire, Altoona area as well as HWY 94 &53"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful roomy wing of the hosts' home with access to their laundry room and kitchen. Lovely quiet setting that made you feel as though you were in the middle of nowhere yet everything you needed was just 3 miles away. Collin and Ashley were very friendly and accommodating. If I ever make it back to WI, I would definitely stay there again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My daughter and I stayed at this home in July 2021. Everything was very nice. The rooms are good size and the larger bedroom has a huge bed. The location is very good for everything Eau Claire related. Seemed like a good value to me especially if you are doing a multi-day stay like we did. It also doesn't hurt that it's close to Grandma!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was amazing and super clean! Their cat is so friendly and we'll groomed. We had an amazing stay!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful, very clean, special place to stay outside of Eau Claire! Great communication with hosts as well."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Collin was a great host. My husband, brother, and I had to travel back to the Eau Claire for 2 memorial services and stayed in the 2 bedroom wing of the house for a week. The location was ideal - country and quiet but close to Eau Claire and the roads in. If you plan to cook or do laundry, be aware that it will be in the family's own kitchen and laundry room and may not be available right away. The rooms were nice and quiet. We had a microwave and mini-fridge in the biggest room. We also had a table, chairs, and basic dishes so we are breakfasts and lunches in our rooms."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place and accommodations were better than anticipated. Everything was clean. The shower was very spacious. Coming from a Chicago suburb, having roosters walking around and hearing them crow in the morning gave a nice country feeling. Don't worry about them waking you too early though, as their crow was very soft."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our needs. Beats a cookie cutter hotel experience for a simple overnight stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great home, great location, peaceful accommodations. I'd stay again"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very dog-friendly people and beautiful areas for good walks.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Collin provided a great clean and comfortable place to stay while I was in the area. I highly recommend his place to stay. Thanks for the great accommodations and I will definitely be returning soon.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best places I have stayed at.Beautiful location. The host family is incredibly nice.Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super convenient location just off of I94 and very simple access. This might have been the most comfy bed I have ever slept in, and the sheets were super soft. Also the walk in overhead shower was super relaxing. Definitely recommend a stay!"
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place was super clean! It was just what we needed for a short stay. I do think that I should say if you don‚Äôt want to be woken up by loud kiddos around 7am, this place might not be for you. We didn‚Äôt mind the noise too much and we understand we were sharing a living space, so it wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal for us. They accommodated parking for multiple vehicles, which was very much appreciated. Overall, a very nice stay!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A comfortable, clean, close to things to do place to stay. Quick overnight for us but we were very content and felt well supported."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Collin hosted my girlfriend and I in this wing over a weekend in February. We're about college student ages, and we just wanted to escape the montony and explore Eau Claire. Collin and Ashley lead a full household with very well behaved children and pets. For two young adults like us, we'd say the place had ""coming back to your parents house for a weekend"" type energy. Aesthetically, the wing is set up like a traditional apartment, with a small bedroom for children, and a larger master bedroom with fridge and large TV. Collin and Ashley are both very aware of the space they occupy and share with others; they're very keen on your comfort level and know how to respect your space and boundaries without comprising on their obligation to be excellent hosts. If you're in town and want to be amazed with the level of qualify you'd find in unsuspecting digs, head here."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful space, clean and inviting with special touches to make you feel right at home. I have stayed twice now and will definitely be back again when I am passing through the area. Super sweet family, very accommodating and helpful if you are in need."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying in Collin's guest suite for a few days while our home was being renovated. Clean, private, and conveniently located. We couldn't have asked for a better stay."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Friendly people in a beautiful setting away from the city, but super close to be able to hop on the highway and get around. Little amenities like a pull out card table and chairs, a wine fridge and coffee maker make it feel homey. Collin and Ashley are also super friendly! If you want an experience other than the hustle and bustle of the city but easy to navigate, this is it!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a charming bedroom wing of a ranch house in the countryside near Eau Claire. My two children and I were very comfortable and enjoyed exploring the expansive pathways around their property, visiting their chickens, and sitting around the fire pit. Thank you for being helpful and friendly hosts!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Collin's place is very clean and comfortable. The place has everything you will need for a quick stay in the area. Collin was very helpful with great restaurants and directions. The space is completely separate from the normal home so you will feel like you have your own place.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cant beat the location! It's so easy to get to, yet close to the freeway and college. It's such a peaceful and quiet country setting.
II loved having my own private ""wing"" where I didn't feel intrusive in their home. Everything I needed , they provided, to make my stay comfortable.
I am attending Eau Claire Institute of Electrology, which is only 5 min away. This is perfect for 2 students to rent together as there are 2 private bedrooms in the wing.
The bed is very soft and comfortable, room is spacious, its decorated very ""home-like"". Best of all... I LOVED the quiet ceiling fan, and mini fridge/ micro wave they let me use in my room.
I am staying here several weeks, and I look forward to returning to my retreat away from home."

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful family. We had an amazing time in a clean and beautiful place. Perfect place to unwind with a great view. Ashley and Colin are very nice people to talk to as well. They even offered suggestions of places to visit.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Collin and Ashley were very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. Would stay there again.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Collin was so gracious and took care of a last minute need for lodging as my ‚Äúkids‚Äù were traveling from Ohio to Minnesota. Here‚Äôs the review that they wrote:
‚ÄúCollin and Ashley were so sweet and their little children were so precious! When we arrived at the home, Collin kindly came out and helped us to our rooms and showed us where things were for our convenience. He made sure we were settled and happy. The rooms were incredibly clean, and the beds were very comfortable! The shower is huge, and there were really neat windows in all of the rooms that open out wide for a great ‚Äúfresh air‚Äù experience! If you are passing through this area this is a MUST STAY! We are already planning to go again!‚Äù"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed the tranquility here and the beautiful landscape. The beds were comfy and the huge shower was great. If we're ever in the area again, we would stay here."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay in paradise. Collin and Ashley were super friendly and accommodating, great conversationalists. The place itself is immaculate - a private separate wing of a huge house in an amazing rural area. There are 2 rooms and more than enough space with a huge bathroom and nice amenities like a coffee maker available. It is still very close to town and 100% worth driving out the extra mile or so. My only regret is that I only stayed one day!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was close to downtown Eau Claire, The house had lots of amenities and was a great price."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house has great character and is within walking distance to a ton of things. However this home sleeps 4, there is a couch and loveseat but they are not pull out beds."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you want a place near downtown, near a large network of trails, near the river, near breweries and distilleries, has off street parking, and a large private space then this is the place. Friendly and quiet neighbors. Walkability to breweries, distilleries, restaurants, coffee, parks, downtown, grocery store, trails, convenience stores, novelty shops, and a lot more. The location really is a top feature of this listing. Kitchen is full sized with some kitchen-ware and coffee maker. Car port is great for parking off street in a covered area. I traveled with my dog and he was very comfortable in the place. Rooms are very large and feel very spacious and ceilings are very tall. The house itself is a bit older; the bathroom and windows show it, but are definitely still functional."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed for a month and will likely stay again next time I‚Äôm in town!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay over Thanksgiving! Adam was very responsive, and we were especially happy to be able to bring our dog with us!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was beautiful and Adam was a great with communicating! :)
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice and clean place. In the middle of a college town so it reminded me a bit of a college house with the neighbors and everything. Nice location for going out, Very close to old downtown."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit has a very simple and functional layout, roomy and comfortable. It is within walking distance to several craft breweries and nice restaurants. The bathroom and shower was very clean and of adequate size. Being a college town, the neighborhood and town has a young vibe to it that we enjoyed but it was very peaceful and private when we returned to Adam's place. We loved sitting on the small deck in the mornings with our coffee watching the wildlife and in the evenings with refreshments.
Adam was very responsive and friendly to us via text messages. We were sorry when we had to leave since it really felt like our own home for almost a week. My wife and I would love to come back to Eau Claire and rent from Adam again! We had a great time!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with recreation and entertainment all within walking or easy driving distance. Nice clean home with very comfy beds. Easy check in and check out. Downtown Eau Claire is beautiful and all at your fingertips. Highly recommend this place!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This lovely AirBnb was booked for a family that is considering relocating to the area that wanted to be close to the downtown. Adam was very easy to work with and worked with me to drop off some items prior to the scheduled check-in. The family was very happy with everything about this place. ""absolutely 5 stars, very clean, great location, no complaints"""
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Adam was great. Our stay was only for one evening, but everything was as expected. This is an older home with many original ‚Äúantique ‚Äú features which I enjoyed seeing. Bed was extremely comfortable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Adam‚Äôs place was really nice! It was in a good location and there was plenty to do around it. On the first day we were seeing a few ants because it‚Äôs early summer, but Adam was really quick to respond & got us some baits and sprayed the exterior within an hour of me messaging him! After that, our stay went super smoothly. Beds are extremely comfortable. The only thing that was a little misleading was that the listing states it could sleep up to 7 guests, but one couch is too small to sleep comfortably and the other is only big enough for one person. We only had 4 guests so this wasn‚Äôt an issue for us, but we were a little confused where anyone else would have slept. Thank you Adam for the wonderful stay!"

The place was clean and comfortable and quiet for our mid-week stay. We'd book it again if we come back!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nick and Tessa‚Äôs place was a great place to stay for a weekend away! Very clean and inviting, good amenities, easy access with no key needed so we could check in whenever after the 3pm check in time. Close to downtown EC and the campus.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Both Nick and his wife were incredibly kind and very communicative. They were proactive in letting me know what side of the street to park on that night to avoid getting a ticket! I'm pretty sure they moved their own vehicle to give me a good spot because of an unexpected snow storm the night before. I was also very impressed with their efforts to use natural cleaning and personal products. My family has many chemical sensitivities, so it really stands out. I would absolutely recommend staying there. It's proximity to the downtown area, while still being far enough to be quiet makes me look forward to coming back to Eau Claire!"

The IKEA sofa bed is one of the most comfortable I've come across. As a tea drinker my heart was happy by the wide selection offered. The bathtub was perfect for soaking, but the shower was a little tricky as a tall person. We were excited to find a wine opener along with the wine glasses!
Both Nick and Tessa were very quick to respond when I reached out to them with a question.

The neighborhood is a bit older but the neighbors I ran into were very friendly and the unit is very secure. Overall I had a great stay. The biggest thing that stood out to me about Nick and Tessa was how accommodating and easy going they were. They allowed me to stay there with my Bengal cats and even borrowed me one of their kennels for when I needed to leave. I would recommend this unit/hosts and stay again.

I would definitely visit again.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you! We were just in and out for a quick one. Bed too small for two regular sized people I think but overall nice and clean. I would get rid of air fresheners - 1. they are toxic 2. They are so strong we had to unplug them. Thanks again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish I had been staying longer because I didn't get much time to really get to enjoy everything there was to offer. It was super clean, safe, comfortable and really close to everything without being overwhelmed by traffic. Saw an albino squirrel outside and a few deer on my way in, just a few blocks away. It's a great set up if you are staying for a few days. The only thing I would change is the scent plug ins that were strong for me, I am not used to them."

A few aspects of my experience that stood out to me are as follows: 1) The outside temperature was in the 80s during my stay and between the AC unit in the bedroom and the central AC that the hosts control, I was able to remain very comfortable. 2) I liked the products the hosts had around the space for me to use, such as the coffee/tea and the shampoos/conditioners. 3) The hosts provide a list of some of their favorite spots for food, coffee, fun, etc. in the area.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and cozy, this lodging had a great location in a beautiful historic neighborhood in Eau Claire with a clearly marked dedicated parking spot right in front of the building. It was tastefully decorated (not cluttered), and it had several nice amenities (plenty of clean, fluffy towels in the bathroom, a well-stocked kitchen with decent matching dinnerware, attractive utensils, dish towels and pot-holders, and a nice combination coffee maker with both a carafe and a Keurig-style single-cup option). There were even night lights throughout. It was peaceful and quiet, and the surrounding neighbors were respectful. The circle drive off of State Street was convenient; the lodging's location was tucked away off the busy street. The two bedrooms were comfortable and attractively appointed with nice furniture, bedding, and closets to hang our clothes. The little laundry room on the back was very handy to have (we used it during our stay). We would definitely book this lodging again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great rental for two women visiting to attend a conference. The neighborhood felt very safe (and is full of cool old houses) and we were comfortable walking to downtown (20-30 minutes at a relaxed pace) even after dark. This is also one of the best provisioned Airbnb's I've stayed in, with plenty of dishes, silverware, glasses (although the glasses were all really big!), towels, blankets, and pretty much everything else you would need."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for Rockfest in Cadott! It was about a 30 minute drive to he venue, not bad at all. Beautiful on the outside, very cozy on the inside! Close to downtown and Mall! Would definitely recommend and will definitely be staying again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chelsey (the host) & (the owner) joe were very accommodating when it came to payment. Air bnb had some difficulties when it came to that and they made sure we were able to pay as well as extend our stay flawlessly. They cared about our well being when it came to late check out due to us sticking with them through air bnb so it was easy to transition to another one of their air bnbs. They worked with us every way possible and we could not be more thankful. They were also always joyful and nice no matter the circumstances. The home was very clean and felt like home. The neighbors were also very sweet! All around an amazing stay and will book again if the chance arises. Could not be more thankful for ED J rentals. Seriously the best host you could find !! - McCarthys üíó
