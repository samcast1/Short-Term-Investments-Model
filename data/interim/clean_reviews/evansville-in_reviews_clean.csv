The pillows were very comfortable, but the mattress was on the firm side for us. Plus the bed is a bit tall; a short adult might find it awkward to get into. We thought the internet connection was kind of slow in some areas. Also the water pressure was low. But even with those down sides, we would stay here again."

Kelly‚Äôs place is in walking distance to some amazing restaurants and bars and she has some fantastic recommendations in her guide book that we really appreciated! We loved Mo‚Äôs House for cocktails and great atmosphere, Schymiks for Sunday brunch, and Bokeh lounge for live music and Sunday night Karaoke. We went to a show at The Victory Theatre which was just a few blocks away and was the perfect location for an intimate concert. Evansville really hit all the marks, the hospitality is like no where else we‚Äôve been and Kelly‚Äôs place was the cherry on top!"

Kelly has a well-appointed kitchen with thoughtful details, such as water, snacks, and coffee add-ins. The towels and bed-linens felt like high-end hotel textiles.
The neighborhood is gorgeous. The tree-lined, brick street is full of beautiful Victorian homes and it‚Äôs a close walk to coffee shops, restaurants, and the riverfront. I hated to leave!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We travel to Evansville every three months to visit our mother. We always try to stay at Kelly‚Äôs home - it‚Äôs our home away from home!

The house looks much bigger than the photos due to the incredibly high ceilings throughout. We took a short walk to parlor doughnuts where we had an amazing breakfast and even took some delicious doughnuts home with us! The value for what you get at Kelly‚Äôs place is unbeatable. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book again!

The home is beautiful with gorgeous historic homes around it on a brick street walkable to multiple restaurants, the river, and more. The furniture is comfortable and the home is tastefully decorated. Everything is very well thought out to make the guests feel at home with extra amenities. The owner went above and beyond to carry up my doordash delivery to our place when it arrived minutes before we did. I will be a repeat guest when I visit family in Evansville."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As someone who's known for being super picky and having a touch of OCD, finding the perfect Airbnb is not easy for me lol. But let me tell you, this place didn't just meet my high standards it went above and beyond. From the absolutely adorable neighborhood to the obsessive level of cleanliness, this Airbnb is in a league of its own. The quality of every little thing left me in awe.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Kelly's.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelly's home is absolutely charming: spacious, quiet and very clean. The location is excellent, within walking distance of both the river and the restaurants and shops of Main Street.
It also boasts perhaps the best stock on amenities I've encountered, such as coffee creamer in the fridge, an excellent selection of loose-leaf tea and a bathroom stocked with (among many other things) lotion and facial cleanser. It was lovely to find on hand all the things that one wants to bring but might not make it into a carry-on.
Kelly was wonderful to work with - friendly, responsive and very accommodating.
Should I find myself looking for an Airbnb in the area again, I shall certainly check first to see if this one is available!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have been traveling to Evansville for the last 4 years using the Airbnb option and Kelly‚Äôs place was by far better than any we have stayed prior.

Unexpectedly, my grandmother passed away and we had to make a trip to TX instead. Kelly was extremely kind and willing to reschedule our stay. It is a beautiful 1850s home in downtown Evansville, close to the river, surrounded by other beautiful homes on a quiet brick-laid street. Our stay was marvelously relaxing. I won't be looking for any other Airbnbs in Evansville - this is the place to stay! Can't wait for another chance to come back."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is incredible! It is in a very beautiful neighborhood and the apartment itself is gorgeous. It was really clean and beautifully decorated.

It‚Äôs sparkling clean and has a wonderful kitchen , and even a washer a dryer . The bed is high quality but on the firm side , so use your own judgement there based on personal tastes .

We definitely will be returning to Kelly‚Äôs for future stays in the area !"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jay and Kellys place is a must stay very clean smartly decorated and well equipped. If you would rather stay in an apartment with a separate sleeping area from the living area and kitchen as well as a nice sized bath this is your place.
It is very affordable and we plan to come back. The house is beautifully restored and decorated. The hosts know the history of the home and area which is nice. The gardens are amazing and the landscaping was beautiful!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I took a few days for our anniversary and our stay was delightful. The home was very clean and the space was decorated beautifully. I loved the recommendations left and we found some really neat places thanks to that! Several places are walkable...a great thing since many streets were under construction. The doors took a little figuring out (shutting and locking) but we figured it out and tried to stay quiet in doing so. Would have liked a bit more outdoor space (the front porch felt like we were being intrusive) but the inside was comfortable enough we didn't mind drinking our wine indoors. Overall A+ accomodations!

The huge kitchen opens to a living room with high ceilings, where you will spend most of your time. Quiet neighborhood that is close to downtown and event center. We were in Evansville because one of the renters was here to be inducted into The Indiana Athletic Hall of Fame. We highly recommend this spacious place. I loved both hosts Nathan and Joshua but communicated more with Nathan. They were both there whenever I needed them."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a great place and the hosts were wonderful. The location is beautiful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far one of the best Airbnb locations we have stayed at. It was exactly how it was described and it exceeded our expectations of Indiana. Location perfect, downtown IN where everything was within 6 minutes by car. You can walk around the neighborhood for great restaurants, key landmarks and a Riverwalk along the water. The home was so relaxing and modern (well decorated). The beds and furniture was comfortable. The jacuzzi was a plus but we did not get a chance to use it. The rooftop provided a wonderful view, especially at night. Parking provided was so convenient for our guest. We felt totally safe and Nathan was a very good communicator. I would definitely stay again. Thanks Nathan!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Spacious apartment! Perfect for a family like us but also for a group of friends that have some activiries planned in Evansville or nearby areas. The area is very quiet during day and night time which is an invitation to relax. You are 3 blocks away from Main St with a few great food options and in the heart of downtown Evansville, the children museum and a hospital. The apartment is super confortable. Has about everything you need to do anything. They even included tons of toys for our toddler to play. Amazing hosts in a great great confortable apartment. The roof deck is simply beautiful and has a great view of the historic district of the city. Host is very personable, instructions are clear and easy. The covered garage for us was amazing to have as its facilitates the load and unload with pets and babies. Would visit again 100%."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had never booked on Air BNB. When I saw the pictures, I thought it was too good to be true. But it was even better than the pictures.
We were in Evansville for our parents' Celebration of Life service. Nathan's place provided a relaxing haven for a busy weekend. We also had a cousins' reunion. The spacious size, including the balcony, allowed us to all have space to visit. Also, its proximity to the Ohio River gave us the opportunity to take a river walk. I would recommend it highly to anyone."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed. Hope to return for all visits to Evansville in the future but can understand if this wonderful place is booked!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"AMAZING!!! Beautiful home and had everything we could need and more. Our family had plenty of space to spread out and relax.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Nathan's place! The location allowed us to walk to several restaurants and shops. The projector and bunk beds were both big hits with the kids. We would definitely stay here again when back in town!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful property. It is a renovated animal hospital in a downtown area but it is roomy and comfortable with a great loft area for sitting. The only issue is that iy has steep stairs do if you aren't good at climbing, I'd avoid. Kitchen is well laid out and pleasant. Nice big screen TV. would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! We stayed over a four day weekend for my son‚Äôs graduation from UE. This place was absolutely beautiful. Close to everything and stocked with every kind of amenity imaginable! The rooftop patio was like an oasis retreat when it rained one evening. Nathan was the perfect host. Made me feel like I graduated to the top of the Airbnb experiences! Thank you
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"6 girls comfortably stayed in Nathan‚Äôs place for a bachelorette party and it was PERFECT! Nathan and his co-host were always very prompt to respond! The place was very spacious, beautiful, and you feel right at home with all they have to offer. I arrived earlier than the rest of the group to decorate and as a female I felt very safe with the parking situation, getting inside, and spending the first bit of time here alone. Of course, I locked every door behind me, so be mindful that anything could happen anywhere, but in general I did feel very safe! 10/10 recommend if you‚Äôre looking to stay in a great location, close to restaurants and not too far of a drive to other places, and it is reasonably priced especially considering the amount of people it can sleep comfortably!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb was simply AMAZING! Me and my kids had to leave our house in town because of a electrical issue that needed to be fixed so at the last minute I had to find a place for us to stay! I had no idea when I booked Nathan‚Äôs place just how wonderful it truly was! My kids were amazed from the retro vintage look to the jetted tub then the roof top room everything was just a dream! We had my daughters birthday there the last night of our stay and she told me she had wished that could be our forever home when she blew her candles out! It was Deff sad to leave because it was more then just our home away from home it was better! Also if you stay here you don‚Äôt have to worry about if you forgot anything they have it fully stocked for you! I was so satisfied and would do it again in a heartbeat!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a beautiful and unique space!! We used it to get ready for my wedding and loved it! Lots of natural lighting and the exposed brick is amazing for photos!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Dr. J.R. Mitchell House was a great place to stay! The space is a comfortable size with two bedrooms, three bathrooms and a set of bunk beds off of the living room. The 100"" projector screen was neat and the surround sound topped it off! The apartment was clean and well equipped with everything we needed to stay comfortably I.E. glasses, plates, utensils, towels, wash cloths, shampoo etc. The beverage fridge in the open kitchen/living room was also a sweet bonus! The rooftop deck with spiral staircase was our favorite part of the home. Nathan and his co-host were great hosts. They were quick to respond and accommodating to our needs.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic location downtown where it's easy to get to everything but off the main busy streets, so easy traffic and parking. The rental is spotless -- immaculately clean. It was perfect for what we needed for a few days. Three bathrooms, a huge kitchen and island, and big living room area for sitting and chatting. Check in was easy after you download the app. Great hosts with availability for help and clear, easy communication on the place. Would definitely recommend if you have four adults and two kids (for the bunks). Also pet friendly so we were able to have our dogs with us. Definitely a roomy, stylish, clean place for a big group. Would stay again even without a big group!"

We did not have any kids with us but noticed it is set up to be very kid friendly! Nathan and Joshua had great communication throughout our stay. We would stay here again if back in Evansville.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nathan/Josh have a special home, modern converted building. They have a lot of complimenty items for you available as well.
Duel thermostat, one for bedroom and the other foe the whole floor. You have a stair case that leads up inside the building to access. Everything is set up as a smart home, with external security cameras that you may access from the Home Panel.
A little hidden gem! Spectacular Host! I highly recommend."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Evansville at Nathan‚Äôs awesome downtown home. It was within 5-10 minutes of every place we went during our stay. He was an amazing host and we really appreciated all the communication with him. He ensured our stay was comfortable by providing misc amenities (coffee, condiments in the fridge, etc) but also reached out to make sure we knew how to work the projector screen and everything else in the house. We would definitely stay here again!"

We will think of some random reason to return to Evansville to stay at Nathans!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nathan's place is superior! Very elegantly designed, pristine, and spacious. Footsteps from downtown, Ford Center, and Casino. Although I had no need for it, Nathan has a space for kids, games and plenty of space to entertain the kids. Cooking breakfast was a breeze, the kitchen was equipped with everything you need to cook a meal, literally... everything! Very quiet neighborhood and low traffic area over the weekend, not sure what weekday traffic looks like. Everything from the couch to the bed was super comfortable. If you pass on the opportunity to stay in this place, you will be missing out on something truly wonderful."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing place to stay!!!
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brook and Hasib‚Äôs place is ok. The neighborhood is peaceful and close to downtown. They both communicated well. We did feel the devil was in the details though. Overall the place was dusty and dirty, especially around the floorboards. There were ants in the kitchen. In the bathroom, we had one giant industrial-sized container of Softsoap instead of an actual soap dispenser. The walls are pretty bare (except for the walls in the photos). Overall, this Airbnb met our needs of having a place to sleep and spread out. It just lacked those details that make a welcoming cozy five-star experience."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Their apartment is great and well-maintained, equipped with all the necessary amenities. I had a fantastic time during my stay, and if I were to choose to stay there again, I would definitely choose them."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The neighborhood is very charming and quiet. The big king bed was nice, although pretty firm. Linens and pillows were of good quality. I was surprised that only two small towels and two wash cloths for two guests staying multiple nights were provided. Surely we made it work but may want to request extra or bring your own if needed. The full kitchen was a plus, including a dishwasher which was nice. Overall, would definitely stay again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean. Decorated well and there was a cute little record player with some records. Close enough to door dash food. We had a problem with the Internet and they responded very quickly about it and got it fixed. Will definitely be back
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay, fast response would recommend if needing a place to stay!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This property has easy access, clean, new appliances, and a huge bed with a memory foam mattress.
That said, the accommodations suggest this tiny duplex sleeps 4. This is 100% NOT true.
We traveled for 11 hours to get to Evansville only to find out that this AirBNB was only set up for 2 people, even though I made it clear in my reservation/communication that there would be 3 adults.
My grown son had to sleep on a couch (not a pullout) with his feet hanging off the end. There was NO extra bedding available. Luckily, I brought a pillow/blanket for the trip.
NOTE: 2 glasses, 2 cups, 2 towels, 2 washcloths, etc. reinforced that this was NOT a place for 4.
Since the ad is inaccurate, this property may or may not be worth the price."

But overall a nice place to stay and I‚Äôd be interested to check out some of their other places if ever back in the area."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was perfectly clean and centrally located. Fun decor with record player and vinyl records (though wish I could have played Carole King!). Communication was perfect. Just 2 minor suggestions: Place an easier to read number on the front of the house. It was dusk when I arrived and a little hard to tell. Second, make some improvements to front yard. It's perfectly fine, but property would show a lot better with improvements, especially because next door neighbors have done, and so it would be consistent. These are small things, virtually no impact for me. Everything else was outstanding and highly recommend. Also restaurants short drive away, and UE is walkable if that's what brings you to Evansville. Thanks!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We've stayed in Brooke's places a few times now and everything has been consistently good. We always feel comfortable booking with her.

It is a comfortable, pleasant single room with private bath and a large closet with a suitcase stand and hooks for coats and clothes. There is also a convenient counter with sink and mini fridge and coffeemaker. Everything is sparkling clean. The bed is very comfortable. A favorite thing for me is the beautifully landscaped yard surrounding this very attractive older brick house in which this accommodation is nestled on the second floor . . . up a moderately long staircase (which to my mind adds to its charm)."

Thank you David.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing. Even more space than we expected. We especially enjoyed the indoor pool. Walking distance to some good restaurants (we loved the takeout from Sauced). Lots of food and bottled water for guests. Highly recommended.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the bath towels, the aroma of the house, the comfortableness of furniture.
We felt very welcomed and appreciated.
We loved the hot tub, pool, and sauna! The ratio of rooms to bathrooms was fantastic and the fact they were connected was very nice at night time so we didn't wake everyone else when our kids were fussing/needed to use the bathroom. Having some drinks available and waiting for us when we arrived was a very thoughtful touch as well! The working Roku systems throughout the house, the outdoor areas, and the expanded parking were all phenomenal aspects given the size of our group and our varying entertainment needs. Our 2 yr old loved being able to climb up and down all the stairs and play hide and seek with his uncle's and aunts. And lastly, the house itself was just beautiful. 10/10 would stay again."

The house itself has a unique charm to it, and makes you feel right at ease. Of course, I could talk about house great having an indoor and outdoor pool was, as well as a sauna and hot tub. But I think that the beds were all comfortable, that the bathrooms were completely clean and my party was surprisingly overwhelming by his hospitality.
Kind Regards,
Joel Tauchen"

This Airbnb has everything you could want to make a stay pleasurable from food, snacks and drinks there when you arrive to both the indoor and outdoor pools. You can walk to the riverfront or downtown and see many beautiful historic homes along the way. We would definitely return!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Nugent house was perfect for our needs and housing the family.David was very attentive to any needs and took the time to stock the fridge with soft drinks,water and snacks.We had good weather so were out by the pool most of the time and spent the majority of our time there hanging out and enjoying the pools,hot tub, and Haynies Corner.

We would absolutely consider staying again when we return to the area to visit friends and family.
The home is beautiful and perfect for a quiet family getaway or hosting a large group.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There‚Äôs not many places that offer the amenities this home offers. Beautiful historic home with unique qualities of yesteryear. The furniture is very comfortable‚Äîespecially the beds. The icing on the cake, is the indoor heated lap pool. We also loved the hot tub. If that‚Äôs not enough, there‚Äôs a sauna though we didn‚Äôt use that. It‚Äôs very unusual to have this size grounds for a downtown house. It looks like it would be wonderful to use the outdoor pool and lounge area if we visited in the summer. It‚Äôs the perfect place for a mini-staycation or just to enjoy downtown Evansville while staying in a beautiful home."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"David is everything you would expect from a top-notch AirBNB host! He was super responsive throughout our stay and the home felt extremely welcoming and had everything we could possibly need for the week.
The home was stocked with treats, including bread and eggs and orange juice and thoughtful snacks, plenty of towels for the pool -- all the amenities and some I never expected!
The home was a lovely older home in a quiet neighborhood but only 10 mins from several fun activities. It's extremely private so you can be comfortable roaming the space at will.
My partner, my two girls and their friends each had our own bedroom and private space to hang out and could come together in the kitchen or pool area to play. It was PERFECT for six people / three couples/sets of people.
10/10, highly recommend both the home and the relationship with the host!! Thanks so much, David."

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The stay was perfect! I rented out the house the weekend of our wedding. We had our rehearsal dinner at the house Friday night, which was perfect in the backyard. We had a little less than 40 people attend. ((Obviously ask the host before you have it)) this was the best house to rent for rehearsal dinner and for the groomsmen to get ready the next day!! I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other place. The groomsmen even came earlier to take a dip in the inside pool, hot tub, and sauna. You need to book your wedding weekend here."

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,I would stay here again. The place was amazing. It is an older house so the layout is much different than what is built today. You could get lost in the house. The remodeling and updating of things are done very well. I really enjoyed the modern well-stocked kitchen. Great space to feed a large group. The beds were soft and we all had great rooms to stay in. The dining room table was long enough so that our group could all set together. The family room was a great space for conversations. I really enjoyed the indoor lap pool. That was a big hit with our group. The porch off of the pool house was great for evening meals and conversations. There is an outdoor pool as well as a covered patio next to it. We would stay again and again and again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"David was an amazing host! Not only was David's communication consistent consistent but super timely. He made sure that the house was stopped with all the things we needed and more there were drinks, snacks, and other food items that were much appreciated but definitely not expected he went above and beyond! The house itself was clean large and the amenities were top notch our family and our ball team had an amazing time having dinners together, playing games out in the yard and relaxing by the pool. Thank you David for helping to make our trip memorable and comfortable ‚ú®Ô∏è"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed having this enormous property all to ourselves--if only for two nights. We loved floating around in the outdoor pool (we brought our own little floats)!
I had mentioned we were celebrating my birthday and we were surprised to see both a birthday cake and a birthday card waiting for me upon arrival. David also had some start-up groceries all set for us in the kitchen--eggs, bread, fruit, chips and snacks, candy, soda, water, condiments. We really appreciated his thoughtfulness as we had just driven 8 hours to get to his home.
The bedding and pillows were luxurious and he had thought of everything you could possibly need for amenities in the bathroom. This place is incredible as it is and I know that he is working hard to continuously improve it."

It is a very clean, non-cluttery, minimalist, but homey feeling atmosphere. It is a nice area to walk around and enjoy shops and restaurants, or walk along the lake. We enjoyed our free complimentary coffee from the coffee shop below us. Having a washer and dryer to use in the room was an added bonus. Jessica was very friendly and quick to respond to messages. We would definitely stay here again if in the area."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was perfect!

Thank you guys so much for providing an excellent retreat for people to experience your hidden gem in Newburgh!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect little getaway! It sits over a great coffee shop, behind a good restaurant, and next to a bakery."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica's place is AMAZING! You can see the river from the bed-which is one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in! The decor is bright, clean and comfortable. Perfect place for a short stay - there is a sweet kitchenette. They own the coffee shop below and provide you with a free drip coffee each day you stay - because of this there is no coffee pot, which is fine for light coffee drinkers, however, my husband drinks a pot of coffee everyday so this would not be feasible for an extended stay. He needed more coffee and we needed breakfast so we went down to coffee shop and had more coffee and breakfast, we sat outside on the covered deck and it was absolutely lovely!
We walked the lit up river in the evening, which is right outside the apartment.
It is above the coffee shop, but the noise was not bad at all and my husband is really sensitive to noise.
We absolutely loved it there! Comfortable, beautiful, relaxing... Exactly what we needed!
Thanks Jessica! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica was great- so kind and willing to work with our schedule. The place was adorable and well kept and so so comfortable. Beautiful views and the coffee shop downstairs (and its employees) are the cutest.

It was perfect and we will absolutely stay there again for a special occasion."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I just completed a 2-day stay at Jessica‚Äôs place above their coffee shop in Newburgh, Indiana. She has the perfect setting (ideal for tranquility, walking through the downtown area and a gorgeous view), impeccable design that flows well in the space with well-appointed amenities and convenience of being above one of their 4 HoneyMoon coffeehouses with access to amazing coffee and food. I live locally, but was having a plumbing problem and needed to be out of my home for a couple of days. Jessica made sure the room was ready early so I could check in before the standard 4pm. So easy to communicate with her with very prompt responses and the easiest check-out I‚Äôve ever experienced in any market I‚Äôve stayed. Had an amazing stay and I have to say, I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from small business owners whose coffeehouses are known for the quality of their coffee and food, zen-like atmospheres and above all, the people they hire to work in them. This quality is apparent in all they do."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay here and I adored it just as much this time around! Easy, clean, beautiful ‚Äî everything was consistently great. Looking forward to future visits!"

I was able to stay until the coffee shop ‚Äúhoneymoon coffee‚Äù opened and was treated to complementary coffee. I took that back up stairs and enjoyed the rest of the sunrise while knocking out several emails. Just a great place!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I wish we had known that Newburgh shuts down at 5:00 pm. The restaurants that were recommended to us were all closed. We were able to drive to a nearby pub for a hamburger. Not our meal of choice.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had an amazing stay here at the honeymoon. I‚Äôve finally gotten time off to enjoy the company of me and my partner so when we chose this place we knew it was gonna be amazing. Getting there my expectations were blown out the water with such a clean and cute place. The bed is nice and the AC is amazing. The showers are the best, and I was glad to share it with my partner with the dual shower heads. I will say I had a concern with being over top a cafe but once I visited the cafe and stayed a few nights there was little to no noise and was greatly appreciated. I highly recommend this stay for anyone who is staying within the area, not to mention the amazing coffee, breakfast and ice cream downstairs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay - close to the stores and restaurants with beautiful views of the river.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Newburgh is a fantastic area for a little get away! Honeymoon was a fantastic choice for a quick get away! The area has fantastic restaurant choices.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here during a work trip into the office and all hotels were booked. I stay at airbnbs occasionally for something different than your typical hotel room. On looking at the pics of the place and descriptions i was interested. Now that I stayed it will be my go to as long as its not already booked. Very easy to book. Accommodated a 1 night stay. Had all the amenities and the area is very peaceful river front. The front deck overlooks the river for an amazing sunset and mornings boast a magnificent glow as the sun rises. The front porch has just enough room to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and catch up on communications and be relaxed while doing it. Perfect for a couple or single travelers. Washer and dryer, small kitchenette, fridge etc. didn‚Äôt get to use all that but its there. Great area for a morning or eve walk also. Highly Recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a perfect evening at this loft! Beautiful scenery by the river and easy to walk to restaurants and shops. Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was THE CUTEST! I read all the reviews beforehand and was so excited about the shower that I arranged for my hair wash day to be when we were there! It did not disappoint, and the shampoo/conditioner, body wash and even towels smelt amazing! The bed was so comfortable, made for such a good nights sleep! You will wake up to the smell of the coffee brewing downstairs, it was a bit noisy too but it didn‚Äôt bother us. Loved the location and being in walking distance to so many cute places to eat and shop. The balcony overlooking the river is pretty small and quite a few bugs were hanging out at night but the view from inside was just as pretty so we hung out in there instead. We weren‚Äôt able to get the ceiling fan to work but the room still stayed pretty cool without it! Jessica was a great Host, I could tell she genuinely wanted us to have a great stay. Definitely recommend this place to stay at with your honey (see what I did there üòè)! We will be back again for sure!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here after our wedding reception at Preservation Hall. It was a great walking distance and super cute! Only downfall is hearing the business music early in the morning.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely gorgeous riverfront apartment loft! Super clean! Comfy, cozy, walkable to coffee and restaurants! Don‚Äôt sell yourself short looking for other places to have breakfast or brunch. Or lunch. The Honeymoon coffee co below the loft had AMAZING food. We tried the waffles, avocado toast with egg, breakfast burrito, and toast with almond butter, banana, and chocolate chips. All 10/10. Coffee was fabulous and the cold brew with speciality foam was delicious! 100% would stay at this Airbnb again! Loved it!!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location and amenties. Loved the river view, and I would definitely stay here again. You can hear the coffee shop below, but we are early risers so did not affect us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous view of the river!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I absolutely loved this little loft above arguably the best coffee shop in Evansville/Newburgh. It is modern, clean and well decorated. We started the day with the complimentary cups of coffee on the balcony that overlooks the river ‚Äî it was my favorite part. You won‚Äôt regret spending a night (or a weekend) here. There is great dining, shopping and exercise within walking distance. Jessica was a pleasure to work with and we will certainly be back."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan from Fort Lauderdale came in town for business. He was so pleased with the space. Loved everything about it. Will stay again next time in town
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely place to stay on the Newburgh waterfront. Great people watching and so convenient to restaurants and of course the amazing coffee and ice cream just below at Honeymoon. Very serene and peaceful. Would definitely come back here!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect overnight getaway spot- good coffee shop downstairs, beautiful river walk, & beautiful interior. We especially loved the tandem shower! Our only complaint is that the balcony had not been swept so there were spiders on all the chairs outside. Overall, a wonderful stay & we will be returning."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I had a marvelous and relaxing stay here. It was the perfect little vacation getaway we needed and over one of my favorite coffee shops‚Äî what more could I ask for? Jessica was helpful and kind. The decor was charming and uncluttered and allowed us to fully relax. We will be staying here again in the future. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíó
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic getaway spot! All as advertised. Would stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I will definitely be back when I have more time to explore this cute little town. It was a perfect stop for the night.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the cutest place I‚Äôve ever stayed and very clean. Such a relaxing space, just like the pictures. And their little coffee shop was amazing. The strawberry shortcake iced coffee was the best coffee I‚Äôve ever had!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An excellent space- very clean and tastefully decorated with a beautiful view of the river. Everything was as described, check in/out was easy, and Jessica was extremely helpful and responsive. a seamless experience from beginning to end!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This might be the best place we've ever stayed at on Airbnb.
The location along the river was incredible to begin with... but the space was so well designed with great, modern furniture and an incredible bathroom...
To top it all off, it's located above an incredible coffee shop that we could work out of and had great drinks and food.
Seriously check this place out if you're in Newburgh... it's centrally locared in their cute downtown and has really great, positive energy.
Also, the host was very communicative and great to work with. we are legitimately planning on coming back for a longer stay here."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed at Jessica's on our wedding night - so fitting for the honeymoon coffee co. Jessica allowed for a flexible check-in time which was easy to use with the key pad. The loft was extremely clean and looked just like the photos. We loved the double waterfall shower head. Also extremely convenient to order coffee and breakfast from downstairs in the morning. We would definitely recommend staying here for out of town folks or even a cute stay-cation in Newburgh!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I couldn‚Äôt have loved my stay here more ‚Äî clean, cozy, and so cute. Location was perfect + communication was clear and easy. Airbnb of my dreams! Already looking forward to my next visit in this beautiful spot."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really cute location right on the river! Awesome cafe downstairs with some of the best ice cream we have had (butter pecan and peach)!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean!!! We will definitely return. This is one not to be missed. Cute town with a lot of history. Jessica was a great host. Don‚Äôt miss out on the ‚òïÔ∏è üòâ!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very well appointed inside. Very clean and nice. Best view in town. Enjoyed sitting on both outside decks. Short walk to shopping and restaurants. It is located above a coffee shop so some noise while open. Overall very much enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend. Wife was really impressed with the upgraded kitchen and bath.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best rental I have stayed at within the last 10 years. I booked this place on a whim just to surprise my husband with a night away from the kids, alone. The space was super clean, the light colors and decoration made a smaller space feel way bigger than it was. Not overdone on wall decor or cluttered with unnecessary furniture. It was a perfect honeymoon type suite. It was incredibly clean. I appreciated the double heads in the shower, the most comfortable bed aside from my own that I have at home, the balcony, the view, the Q-tips for after my shower, and the water in the fridge. Literally, this place was perfect. The hosts thought of everything! A lot of little details and special things to make the stay easy and convenient. OH YEAH, And the complementary coffees from the shop downstairs were so tasty! I love a bold coffee. This whole place and the vibe it puts off is very welcoming and refreshing. Seriously thinking about making this spot a monthly visit! Thank you guys so much!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this loft was exactly as described, great location right on the river beautiful view along with easy access to shops and restaurants not to mention great coffee right downstairs...would highly recommend this place...great value for the money..."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed at a lot of places but this is by far my favorite in the community. The loft is so cute, the location is perfect if you want to be close to downtown Newburgh. I highly recommend this spot!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is a hidden gem! Plenty of room for a quick couples get away or perfect for the traveling business person.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here while we were in town visiting family. Great location and great coffee in the shop downstairs.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Jessica‚Äôs place when traveling to Alabama for a weekend get away and loved our stay. It‚Äôs quiet, easy to find, and very clean. Parking was convenient and easy. Jessica is nice and responsive. Her instructions for check in and check out was easy to follow. We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place! Enjoyed the river view!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was beautiful and loved the river view. Would absolutely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We already had high expectations, and the Riverfront Loft far exceeded them! It was the perfect place for my husband and I to get away for the weekend. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the location, accommodations, and Jessica as a host. Also ‚Äî the coffee is a 10/10!
Book a trip here and see for yourself! You won‚Äôt regret it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely stunning with the best view. Although it‚Äôs a loft, it‚Äôs incredibly spacious. The bed and comforter feel like heaven. The bed reclines so you can comfortably watch TV, the air works great, washer & dryer in unit, remote control fan, don‚Äôt get me started on the amazing shower which I now want in a home, complimentary coffee brought upstairs in the morning within two minutes of calling, etc. I could go on and on! We brought our 20 month old with us, and the coffee shop does start early downstairs, so I‚Äôd recommend bringing a noise machine. This is a busy area, with a lot of people enjoying the Riverwalk, restaurants, and shopping, but it still stayed quiet upstairs. It was nice to have a full sized fridge and freezer for our little girl‚Äôs milk & food. There were a lot of extra cozy throws and pillows to make you feel right at home. Thank you for offering a wonderful place to stay! We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was Perfect!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Surprisingly spacious and comfortable. Comfortable bed, quality appliances and fixtures.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place and great host , the place is so clean and beautiful and the coffee shop down stairs is very relaxing and had a good vibes , 10/10 with everything, Thank you Jessica!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I stayed at this location over my birthday weekend and it was amazing! This is what Airbnb is all about, a coffee snob can find a lofted apartment that sits atop a quaint coffee shop, overlooking a river, within a couple hours from home. The location is beautiful, and the space itself was immaculate. You can tell the owners spent a lot of time and resources to provide everything a guest could want. The place was so clean and the amenities were top notch. I couldn't find something to complain about even if I wanted to."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Honeymoon Air BNB was the coziest stay! We loved being able to enjoy the coffee shop downstairs and the scenery of the Newburgh Riverfront outside. We were nervous about the noise levels but it was really not a problem; the owners have done a wonderful job of insulating the room! Wonderful experience!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had such a lovely visit at the Honeymoon Loft. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the balcony‚Ä¶reading and enjoying the lovely view. The walking/bike path that goes along the river is great too. I thoroughly recommend staying at the Honeymoon Loft.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! Really thoughtful design and details. Very restful, the river is beautiful!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay and it‚Äôs easily my favorite Airbnb in Newburgh. You cannot beat the location as there‚Äôs so much to do. You really feel like your apart of the area. We got out and ran the river each morning. We love the food and drinks downstairs at Honeymoon and all the employees are wonderful. Jessica provides a stay that is 100% true to the listing. She is responsive and proactive in her communication. If I could live in this little apartment, I would. If you‚Äôre looking for a stay that is comfortable and clean while providing easy access to food and shopping that is convenient and walkable, this would be my recommendation time and time again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great, overlooking the river and conveniently close to several restaurants and, of course, the coffee shop downstairs. The view was wonderful. The bed was quite comfy and as a bonus was adjustable for watching tv. The Newburgh river walk was pleasant and used by locals all day for exercise, making the location seem very vacation like. We highly recommend for a short stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. We liked the view of the river and walking along the river and old homes. It was clean and the light switches were labeled. It has everthing we needed. There was no noise between 10 PM and & 7 AM.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfection! This is one of my favorite Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. I loved everything about this place. Everything in this place is well thought out and quality. The bed is the best, most comfortable I have ever experienced away from home. I love the location with the great view of the Ohio River, nice walking paths, and restaurants and stores within walking distance. Whenever I am in town, I will try to stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you so much for helping me surprise my husband for our anniversary! We got a night without any of the 5 kiddos including our 4 month old and it was MUCH needed time together. Very responsive and helpful!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved everything about Jessica‚Äôs Airbnb: the location was fantastic, so walkable, my new absolutely favorite coffee shop ( we went twice today!) adorable loft and the most comfy bed!! Jessica was a fantastic host and her loft had everything we could need. We hope to stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jessica's Honey Moon loft with a fantastic view of the Ohio river was amazing and so much fun. Definitely recommendable.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica‚Äôs place is fantastic and she is a great host. I would recommend it to anyone. If I‚Äôm ever in the area again, I‚Äôll definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Meticulously clean and modern. Most comfortable bed I‚Äôve stayed in away from home. My husband is 6‚Äô5‚Äù and was concerned the space may feel tight when he saw the pictures with the slanted ceilings, but he did not have any headroom issues at all. Very spacious. Beautiful view. Highly recommend and we hope to return."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here! Beautiful property and amazing coffee/breakfast right downstairs. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved Jessica‚Äôs place. It was right in the heart of Newburgh, which is a beautiful little town. The river was steps away and had benches and a walking trail for those wanting a bit of exercise.
The Airbnb itself was gorgeous. It was very clean and had all the amenities listed in the post. The bed was super comfy! Add to that a laundry set and a very nice cold a/c on a hot day and you have the makings of a wonderful place to stay.
We had a great time there!
Thank you,
Greg and DeeAnn"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica was very helpful in answering my questions and offering additional help if needed. The airbnb was beautifully situated on the river, offering a pleasant view each day. The area was safe. It was nice to see the local residents interacting with each other as they took their walks and when they entered the coffee shop/restaurant for more socializing. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay and great hosts. Clean, comfortable and spacious. My wife and I are familiar with the area, and I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough. This is hands down the best place to book if you‚Äôre looking to stay in the Newburgh area. We hope to stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful views and airbnb, we will definitely be back! Absolutely no complaints, I enjoyed the space and area around the airbnb."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay above the Honey + Moon Coffee Co.! It was such a cozy, clean, and welcoming space ‚Äî perfect for a weekend getaway. My husband and I enjoyed having our morning coffee on the balcony with a stunning view of the Ohio River. The location is perfect, right downtown Newburgh, where you can walk to the shops and a few local restaurants. The trail along the river is also gorgeous to walk! Jessica was so inviting and very responsive. I highly recommend this adorable riverfront loft!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Totally safe. Spotless. Beautiful suite. Great location. Amazing double shower. Comfortable bed. Thoughtful touches. 2 balconies. Excellent communication w/ host. What more could one ask for?
This was 1st Airbnb & weren‚Äôt sure what to expect. I‚Äôve been to 149 countries and have seen it all‚Ä¶luxurious & scary. Communication w/ Jessica & knowing she was right at hand was comforting.
The location is above a coffee shop which can be delivered in the morning. Just ask! I couldn't carry 2 cups of coffee & hold handrail. Breakfast is available as it is a coffee/ice cream shop.
There were 2 balconies: the front, a view of the Ohio; the rear, a beautiful garden. In the evening I needed a shawl. Jessica had provided one. The location is right on the water: Water Street. This is the place to be. I am not sure when this Airbnb opened, but the interior is spotless. It's like we were the 1st guests. There were no stains, frayed edges or areas discolored.
Thank you, Jessica. We loved our stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and modern, and a super comfortable bed. Enjoyed the outdoor seating. Steps away from everything in historic downtown Newburgh.
Will definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed this stay. Loved having the coffee shop below us. Everything was fresh, new and clean! Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved staying in the loft! It was so cute, & loved the coffee shop (Honey Moon Cafe) underneath! River view was an amazing plus as well!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We adored this Airbnb! We'll absolutely book again next time we are in the area. The space was beautifully designed & airy. It was spotless, the host was very kind, and the king bed was one of the best Airbnb beds I've ever experienced. The location couldn't be better either ‚Äî overlooking the river, above a quaint coffee shop with a great little breakfast menu. And it was so thoughtful how they brought up fresh coffee every morning during our stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful spot! Perfect for a stay-cation in Southern Indiana. The coffee downstairs was an added bonus! Beautifully decorated, spotless, and the double shower was so cool. With the riverwalk right outside your door, it's perfect for enjoying a coffee while getting some work done, then going for a walk along the river. A true hidden gem! I will definitely be back. Thanks Jess & Zac!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this space. It‚Äôs clean, airy, comfortable and well worth the price. One could spend a lot more for a lot less at a hotel. You can tell a lot of care went into the design and the details. The location is second to none. This area is beautiful with lots to do. We enjoyed getting up and running along the river each morning. We felt welcomed and safe which is always important. Their coffee shop downstairs has exceptional coffee and breakfast foods. I highly recommend a stay, so much so that we‚Äôll be back in a couple months. Thank you for having us and for making our first Airbnb experience exceptional. This will be hard to beat."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gem! This riverfront loft apartment above Honey Moon Coffee Company just blew us away. The apartment was beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean. Jessica has thought of everything. We had a wonderful stay and highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a unique and cozy place to stay in Newburgh.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place and these hosts! The room was immaculate and so well decorated. The view over the river is beautiful and there's a lot of cute shops and restaurants within walking distance. Jessica was super responsive and helpful and put intentional thought into the look and even the smell of the place. We ate brunch at the cafe below and it was delicious. The people were super friendly, and overall it's just a super cute and fun place to get away!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place described perfectly. Can‚Äôt go wrong!!! Great location. Restaurants close and very walkable.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is just beautiful and in a very convenient location. The hosts were welcoming, immediately responsive and very accommodating."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was so impressed by the town, the rental, the host, the coffee! Jessica was helpful and quick to respond from the moment I booked and every moment after.
My only complaint, The shower does seem to lose hot water faster than I would have expected with the water features. The first day both shower heads were on and I thought maybe that was the issue but even with only using one, the hot water ran out before I could take a 10 minute shower.
Even with this being said, I would book this rental every single year!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay! Comfy place, friendly people, very clean, everything we needed! The view is amazing!!!! Sits right on the river. Decorated so cute and comfortable for our stay. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was nice and cozy.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So cute! Just as pictured. Beautiful view of the river as well.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely charming! We live in Newburgh and chose to ‚Äúget away‚Äù for an evening. What a perfect cozy getaway. The views of the river and downtown are stunning. The room is spacious, clean, and comfy. And the bathroom was like a spa. We truly loved our stay and will certainly be back soon!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is exactly the type of place I want when choosing an Air Bnb. It was unique, clean, and in a great location. The host was prompt to respond when we had a few issues and entry was extremely easy. There are numerous steps to climb so it‚Äôs not handicap accessible. I was worried the ceiling height would be low in the loft but it wasn‚Äôt. The king bed was comfortable and placed in front of a very large smart TV. Being able to lie in bed and watch barges pass by on the OHIO river was a highlight of our stay though we would have enjoyed sitting outside on the balcony weather permitting. The shower was amazing and the kitchen appeared well supplied. The place is situated on top of a coffee shop and every morning we were awakened around 6:45 am with sounds of entry and grinding of coffee. You can smell coffee in the loft and hear muffled voices, but these things are minimal compared to everything else. If you‚Äôre looking for a great place to stay in a great town, this is it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is modern, comfortable and in a lovely riverside location. Newburgh has great walking and running along with plenty of eateries and shops. I spent the week in Evansville with my life relaxing here and it worked out great for both of us. We'd certainly stay again."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so happy to find this little gem . It was perfect! The view was breathtaking and the place was spotless and we felt right at home . Jessica was a great host, very friendly and accommodating. This will definitely be our spot when we return to the area in the near future ."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment. Everything was as described. Great communication with Jessica. I will definitely be back.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessica and her Airbnb location were spectacular. The space itself, the view and being upstairs at a quiet, yet amazing coffee shop was a real treat. In the heart of downtown Newburgh, my stay exceeded all expectations and I will return!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the best trip! We walked to Cafe Arazu and had a great dinner! I loved looking out at the river and the place looked beautiful! Such a fun time.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful simplistic Airbnb. Highly recommended. We will continue to choose this one as it is perfect for our needs while in town for family.
Highly recommended! And the coffee shop is a dream with super sweet staff!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was everything we hoped it would be and more. The room is quaint, peaceful and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony in full sun while watching people walk the riverfront. Of course, having outstanding Honeymoon coffee just a set of stairs away was a nice perk. Our only issue was not wanting to leave this morning. The combination of a comfortable bed and the refreshingly chilly air coming off the river was too inviting. Can't wait to go back."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay! It was just what we were looking for - light, bright, relaxing, and calm. It's in a very walkable part of downtown Newburgh. Once we parked, everything we needed from the shops to restaurants were easily accessible by foot. Jessica made check-in and check-out very easy and was super responsive. Highly recommended if you're looking for a downtown getaway that feels private but keeps you right next to the things you'll want to do. The coffee shop is great too! We kept it simple with a light and dark roast, but know from other trips how good their lattes and breakfast are!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this spot. Would like to go back for a longer stay. Loved watching the sun set over the water from the balcony. The coffee shop downstairs was really good! The place was very clean and relaxing. The town was one I want to go back and explore more. Amazing yarn store just up the road! The hostess was friendly, helpful, and understanding."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay & beautiful location! Sweet coffee shop too.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our stay here! Check in was simple. Parking was easy. The view of the river is amazingly stunning. The coffee shop below made the room smell of a wonderful coffee aroma. The noise level wasn‚Äôt bad at all. Turning in the bathroom fan or music drowns it out. They close at 6 so nights are quiet and peaceful. It was a gorgeous space and very cozy. The bed was absolutely amazing and comfortable. We slept so well! The washer and dryer happened to come in very handy. I LOVED the double headed shower! I did a hot/cold immersion shower and it was invigorating! Could also be used to shower with your partner without having to share the same shower head üòÇüòÇ The next morning we had breakfast at the coffee shop and it was absolutely delicious! Many places to shop and eat in easy walking distance too!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at the Nama-Stay Cabin retreat and it was just as great as the first time! It‚Äôs a beautiful place to unwind from the busyness of our daily lives while also being close to restaurants and local amenities. John is a great host and we look forward to coming back again soon!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend anyone looking for a peaceful place to get away to stay at John's cabin. This beautiful zen cabin is far enough away to enjoy peaceful nature yet close enough to go out and do things within the community. John is an excellent host!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We needed a place to stay for a funeral. John's place looked like the perfect little piece of peace you need during a rough time. It was even more then what pictures can do. All the wood floors, walls, and spiral staircase were beautiful. The kitchen has everything we needed to make a wonderful dinner and breakfast. It was voxy and just what we needed. It was way cheaper and nicer than most hotels in the area. The location gives you a feel of being far out of the city with the coty just being minutes away. Thank you John for such a wonderful place."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This will be our second rave review for Na-ma-Stay... This very charming, beautifully appointed cabin is nestled in the woods, in a very quiet setting
that sometimes includes wildlife, like turkeys and their chicks, woodchucks, songbirds and more.
It's not far from Howell Wetlands ( Google: Howell Wetlands / Evansville )
and it's a short drive to downtown Evansville, including Main Street - with its many restaurants, shops and other attractions.
We look forward to writing another glowing review in the not-too-distant future! Thanks for the hospitality, John. :-)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We greatly enjoyed our stay. John‚Äòs place provided a very relaxing environment ‚Äì the perfect place to get away for a few days. The bottle of wine left by John was also appreciated.. We would stay here again and recommend to others.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second stay at John's beautiful cabin. We really enjoy the wooded surroundings. The place feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, but it's a short drive from the family members we were visiting nearby and everything we needed."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin nestled into the surroundings beautifully. It's quaint, quiet, and very relaxing. It's 15 minutes from downtown, which has everything you need, yet it seemed like you far removed from most of society when you're there."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Johns Zen cabin is a tranquil paradise. It has everything you need for a fabulous stay. The views of the woodland from every window are just beautiful. The cabin is traditional wood and very tastefully done. The kitchen has everything you need as a cook, with a brand new fridge and smeg cooker. Space outside with a fire pit, bbq and lights for Alfresco dining and the cabin was spotlessly clean. The aircon was good and we had a very comfortable 2 week stay. We will definately return Many Thanks üòä"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dear John and Kylee,
Nama-Stay, a charming cabin tucked away in the woods, is the perfect destination for an enchanting and peaceful get-away. We loved the beautifully crafted woodwork throughout, the many windows filled with sunlit views of the lush green forest, the spacious kitchen, the lovely dining area and comfy living room, lots of plants‚Ä¶and more.
The cabin‚Äôs location made it easy for us to get to destinations ranging from the Howell Wetlands to Evansville‚Äôs charming downtown Main Street (which has several nice restaurants).
When it was time to go, no one wanted to leave. In fact, the most Zen member of our group, a yogini and plant-lover, practically had to be pulled out of the cabin!
We look forward to a return visit. Thanks for the opportunity and for your hospitality."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely love this cabin! You are nestled in the woods, yet so close to the convenience of the city! The cabin has everything you might need, and the decor is adorably rustic. Just be aware of all the steps/stairs. There are several leading up to the cabin (as shown in the photo), and there is a rather narrow winding staircase to the loft where two of the beds are. As long as you are okay with stairs/steps...this is a fantastic place to stay! No complaints! This is our 2nd stay here. Each time, we had a bottle of wine waiting for us...nice touch! Very pleased!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything the listing describes and ten times more. We kept discovering new interesting little surprises and personal touches. I cant say enough to describe how perfect this place was. Loved it.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and private cabin! John was a great host. Our family throughly enjoyed our stay. John‚Äôs cabin was very clean and fully stocked on any amenities that you may need during our stay. Yard was perfect for the kids to spend the evenings throwing the ball and enjoying the fire pit. Great location in Evansville and everything you need is close by yet the cabin is nestled away in a quiet area. We will definitely be returning next year for our yearly visit to Evansville.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for two days. It‚Äôs a beautiful cabin. I‚Äôll just say for people with knee or mobility issues that it may not be the place for you. I ended up staying in the full-size bed on the first floor, as I just could not climb the spiral staircase due to my bad knees. So my husband stayed up there by himself. But that is on me, because the listing did have this information. Also John has a Keurig coffee maker. There was coffee pods there thankfully. I had brought ground coffee because I couldn‚Äôt find the info on the coffee maker on the listing.
Overall, it was such a beautiful, quiet, peaceful setting. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the security lights at night, but surprisingly they didn‚Äôt bother me when I was trying to sleep.
The decor and setting was just cozy and charming. I saw lots of squirrels and birds outside, including a hummingbird. The bathroom was nice and had body wash, shampoo and conditioner.
I would definitely stay here again! Thanks, John."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property with everything you posssibly need. Thanks so much!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and easy to find. Good amenities and very close to city limits. Also having real house plants of interesting variety was a nice touch from other stays. I didn‚Äôt necessarily like not having blinds/curtains but other than that everything was pleasant and I would recommend staying.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful place. Close to everything yet quiet and secluded. Loved it here.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little spot!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! The pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice. It‚Äôs simply gorgeous. Though you‚Äôre mere minutes from stellar amenities, the cabin itself feels secluded and peaceful. The space itself is thoughtfully laid out with everything you could need to be comfortable, and John provided excellent and clear instructions. We had a wonderful time and will definitely return the next time we need a little break from the bustle of normal life!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! Clean and the outdoor fire pit was perfect! Would recommend. Driveway is steep coming in, but easy to maneuver. Thanks John!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nama-Stay is a Perfect place to get away. It‚Äôs nestled in a beautifully wooded area. Close to downtown Evansville, but far enough away to feel removed from any hustle and bustle. The cabin is very nicely done. Clean and well kept. Peaceful, serene. There is such a calming energy throughout the property. There is plenty of space inside and out. You‚Äôll find books, board games, and yoga mats (with cleansing spray). There is a nice tv, although we never turned it on. There is a fire pit outside. We saw the biggest squirrels and beautiful birds. Be sure to get up and head outside to catch the sunrise. You‚Äôll find everything you could possibly need here. They offered a bottle of wine, coffee, paper towels, bath tissue, shower soap, shampoo, conditioner and so much more. The host is very attentive without invading your space. I highly recommend this beautiful cabin. I am very particular about where I stay and this little gem checked all the boxes. Enjoy! üôè Namaste"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I'll be booking this again. Everything was beautiful
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Second time at Zen Cabin and it didn‚Äôt disappoint . Beds are very comfortable , landscape is amazing, kitchen is ideal and the woodwork provides a very cozy ambiance . Love that it is plucked in the middle of the city , yet feels isolated . Perfect Combo. Very easy to read instructions. We had a great Mom /Daughter trip with family üíï"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,John‚Äôs place was wonderful! And he helped us last minute late at night when my wife and I and needed a place to stay because all hotels were full! I appreciate it very much! Wonderful host and very responsive.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay at the cabin, perfect location and a peaceful place to hangout for a few days or longer! Lots of amenities, ample space in the kitchen, complementary bottle of wine! Fire pit area with string lights and free wood.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The nama-stay cabin retreat was incredible. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. It‚Äôs a beautiful property and has everything we needed for our stay in Evansville. It was stunning and just minutes from downtown!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was as lovely as everyone else has mentioned. We loved the views out the many windows and doors. The beautiful house plants are a wonderful touch and add to the serenity of the cabin. We enjoyed sitting by the fire pit and hearing the tree frogs. The place is very clean and extremely well stocked for cooking. It was a charming Spring Break get-away.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place! I got this as a weekend getaway from my 2 full time jobs as well as a gift to my family for Christmas. When we got there everything was perfect, reminded me of home even. However something to note is that during stormy weather, you will likely lose power due to the amount of trees in the area. I recommend bringing some candles and charging banks during storm seasons, or if the forecast looks dicey. Also the windows are OPEN, so bring a sleep mask if you‚Äôre like my mom and need it pitch black."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Johns place was amazing!! Highly recommend!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John‚Äôs cabin exceeded our expectations! We loved staying here. It was clean, charming, and a great place to unwind and relax!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our family to stay! Everything was great!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We Absolutely Adored this sweet cabin. From the architecture and windows, to the plants inside and the fire pit outside! Every little detail was perfect and we felt so at home.
The location was perfect. Secluded in the woods, with just a couple minutes drive to everything Evansville!
The icing on the cake, my favorite part, when outside, was frequently hearing a faraway train, that I hope I always remember.
Thank you John for letting us and others enjoy the comfort of your Namaste!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Not enough can be said about Nama-Stay, and John.
My only wish was to be able to see it in the green of summer‚Ä¶we were there during the grey of January.
This did not hamper our stay in the least, because we got to enjoy the full scope of the wonderful space for what it is.
The structure it self has been well cared for, and the workmanship is far above what one would find in the area.
DO NOT miss a chance to stay here, if you admire the quiet and solitude that can be had. Almost like stepping back in time, but with modern conveniences."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall great stay. Would definitely visit again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My mother-in-law and I stayed for the weekend. We enjoyed how cozy it was. It was an awesome get away to relax. We stayed all day in the cabin in PJs and relaxed and ordered a door dash. I will definitely be coming back.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at this cabin. We couldn't love it more. We will stay again. Description and pictures are spot on. The Tennessee vibe in Evansville IN, wooded private setting is what you are welcome to."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my favorite Airbnb I've ever stayed at. The cabin itself is a work of art and was just absolutely lovely to stay in. It was so quiet and had the feeling that we were out in the middle of nowhere. BUT we were just mere minutes to everywhere we wanted to go to in Evansville. This will be my go to cabin for future trips to the area. I absolutely loved it.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Zen Cabin was so nice and relaxing. this is a great place to stay and still close to anything at all in Evansville.

The location, layout, fire pit, grill etc. It had everything we needed. Super close to downtown yet quiet and tucked away as it backs up to woods. We even watched deer walk right through the yard while enjoying coffee at the firepit. Super comfy beds, plenty of linens and lots of extras including a bottle of wine for my husband and I to share. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing home. Perfect for a family in a quiet area. Will definitely book again in the future.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing place! It is the best place to go when you want to get away from the world. The only time we left the property was to get food. We will for sure be looking to go back at a future date.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The Zen Cabin truly lives up to its name! Namaste indeed! We had a week long grind at a major tournament and this cabin did exactly what it promises and more. The hosts John & Kylee were amazing and they made sure we felt at home the moment we open the door. It was everything we have asked for and much more! I highly recommend this place to all travelers and would definitely stay again! Too bad I could only give five stars as this is a 10 star place.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Perfect mixture of nature and things to do pretty close!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most lovely hidden gem in the woods! Hilly area makes it feel like you‚Äôre nestled in the mountains even though you‚Äôre in Indiana. Very clean, comfortable, and lots of amenities. It was perfect for our girls‚Äô weekend and I can‚Äôt wait to go back!"

Hands down the best place I've ever had the pleasure of staying in."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful outdoorsy getaway. It's beautiful inside and out.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We had wonderful time! Very relaxing with beautiful views. John & Kylee are excellent hosts.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is better than the pictures show. It is a very well kept true log sided cabin. I could not be happier with our stay there.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by FAR the best Airbnb experience I have had YET. I live in Mooresville, Indiana, which is about a 2 and a half hour drive from Evansville where this cabin is located. The reason I decided to take this trip is because I wanted a rare weekend to myself, in the middle of ‚Äúnowhere‚Äù away from my day to day routine, because I desperately needed a break. Being a full time working mother of a toddler gets exhausting, and though I wouldn‚Äôt trade my life or child for the WORLD, I think it‚Äôs important us mommas get a break away from the kiddos even if just for a few days once a year ! üòòüòç no shame ! That being said, I had never gone on a ‚Äúsolo-cation‚Äù or any trip by myself before so I was a little nervous . Kylee made me feel so much better about it, letting me know plenty of single females have stayed there before with no issues, and there are security cameras on the outside of the cabin that are motion censored, so even though I was there alone, I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe or scared the whole entire time thanks to that reassurance from the host ! The view was BEAUTIFUL. The cabin was cleaner than any other place I‚Äôve stayed at through Airbnb, I was SHOCKED with the cleanliness of the place . The guidebook that the hosts send you with food and attraction recommendations was PERFECT as well, and I went to almost every restaurant and cafe that they recommended! Lol. Only thing that I had wished was that it was a little more secluded than what it was, I didn‚Äôt realize there were neighbors on both sides ( not super SUPER close but quick walking distance for sure and I could hear their kids screaming the next morning, but no big deal) :) all in all this stay was everything I had hoped for ! I highly recommend Spankey‚Äôs pizza , I ordered this my first night there and they delivered to the cabin and it was AMAZING. ‚Äúnamaste‚Äù really is the perfect description for this beautiful cabin, and I hope to make it my annual ‚Äúmommy‚Äôs solo time away‚Äù destination annually !"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,awesome place awesome accomodations clean !!!!!!!!! peaceful all around A+++++ beutiful place well upkept couch is very comfortable just a great place In every aspect
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful spot in southern Indiana. Feels super remote because of its placement in the woods and up on a hill. Very close to nightlife and any conveniences you could want. We wanted a quiet weekend where we could unwind by the fire and enjoy the outdoors. This was the perfect spot. It feels remote even with neighbors located fairly near, but no one bothered us and it was a very peaceful stay. Cabin was beautiful inside and out. The woodwork on the inside is an amazing feature. Great hosts. We will definitely be back."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great place to stay! Communication was awesome and the place felt super comfy and well-kept. Have plans to return in the future.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Will definitely return
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As someone who‚Äôs stayed in a handful of Air BNB‚Äôs, this is easily one of the nicest, most beautifully located ones I‚Äôve ever seen! It‚Äôs isolated enough to be quiet, but close enough to eateries and touristy spots to be appealing. The amenities are also to die for, since the cabin offers a well stocked kitchen, a small entertainment center, and a lovely fire pit outside. The hosts are communicative too, offering suggestions and tips when needed.
All in all, I can absolutely recommend staying here, and my husband and I are eager to plan our next visit!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent little spot for a few quiet nights away from home. If you want a relaxing place to get away, this is it. Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A diamond in the rough! What a wonderful place to relax and experience a real get-away. I‚Äôve stayed several places and have to say they had more than anything we needed to enjoy our stay. The place is beautiful and cozy. The snow we ordered up also added an extra special touch to our stay. Lol! Definitely a memorable stay!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The photos are 100% accurate!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this rental was perfect. The location, how adorable it was and how well set up it is for guests. I will definitely be a repeat traveler to this location."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We didn‚Äôt ever consider Evansville a getaway destination for us but it slowly became one of our favorite stops, most of it because of this cottage. We highly suggest anybody who is married, is looking for a writers retreat, or has a family to come and enjoy this place. If you are staying in Evansville, this is where you will need to stay to maximize your trip. We ate at the F and F in Henderson. The burger was worth the drive! You must go to see the war ship, and you must stay here! You are welcome."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing time, beautiful scenery and very clean and accommodating."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our time at the cabin. We will definitely stay here again. The husband loved the wine (i can't drink). The bedding felt very high end and the view was perfect. The power did go out due to the power company working nearby and the John was very quick to respond and let us know the status. Highly highly recommend! I wish i could give more than 5 stars!
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lovely cabin, very cozy. Would love to stay again"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is beautiful, and the surroundings very quiet and peaceful . The bed was very very comfortable, and we like to cook on vacation so the kitchen was very modern and well equipped for everything we needed. We also took advantage of nature based activities quite close to the cabin, the arboretum and wesselman woods as well as the wetlands were the highlights of this trip. Also enjoyed the African American History museum. This was the best airbnb experience we have had so far! You won't be dissapointed."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you would expect from these two super hosts! Exactly as advertised!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No complaints about our stay. It was as advertised. The cabin was clean, cozy and quiet. There‚Äôs a feeling of seclusion even though you‚Äôre only minutes away from everything. Given the opportunity, I‚Äôd stay again."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a beautiful, peaceful nicely decorated cabin like described in the pictures. The road leading upto the cabin is nicely hidden in the trees. This cabin does not feel like you are in Indiana. The cabin is stocked with the things you may have forgot."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place and super therapeutic. Would highly recommend staying here!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place highly recommend!!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was amazing and John and Kylee were great hosts.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented this place for our yearly girlfriend reunion. John and Kylee have a great little spot in the woods, but still close to town for shopping, eating out, etc. This place is so relaxing and peaceful. We loved the little fire pit area, as well as the interior. There are several steps leading up to the cabin, and the inside staircase is very narrow and winding...however, it was worth it to stay here. The full bed upstairs is the most comfortable bed in which I have ever slept. We would definitely come back here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay at the cabin. Great location with privacy but still close to everything. Very relaxing, would definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were impressed from the moment we walked in. The cabin is welcoming and looks great. Clean, comfortable and the property feels so private. My teenage daughter wants to live there! If our family of five ever ventures to Evansville again, we will be sure to stay at this charmer."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our weeklong stay in the area was due to an out-of-state youth softball tournament and we were thrilled to stay at this home away from home. A delightful cabin full of character, it provided solace and a place to cool off after long, hot days. We found the rental to be better than advertised, however would more clearly note that the beds are located in an upstairs loft and bedroom without a door. The open space layout worked fine for our group but might not for others. Thank you John and Kylee for the subtle touches like bottle of wine and abundance of books. It was a lovely stay."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This property was picturesque and cozy! The trees and hills complimented the cabin and its aesthetic magically!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the cabin. Took the kids to Burdette Park during the day and grilled steaks at night. The kids liked roasting hot dogs in the fire pit. Hit the zoo the next day. Nama Stay made a welcome base to come back to after our activities.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place to stay. My kids said csn we stay forever that says it all. All you need and more. Even wine and a kitchen with few items . We can highly recommend it.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John and Kylee‚Äôs little slice of heaven is exactly what everyone needs as a get away. They were extremely accommodating and created such a stress free environment to stay. Great place if you need a break from the hustle of life.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John and Kylee‚Äôs cabin feels like a little escape from the world. It‚Äôs very peaceful and secluded even though you are not far from the city. Everything was clean and organized. They even had games that we could play. We loved being close to our destination which was Burdette Park. We would highly recommend and definitely stay again in the future.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Checking in is very simple, and the decoration in the house is very warm. The host was very considerate and gave a bottle of red wine as a gift."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for an end of semester quick getaway from Bloomington, and this was the perfect spot.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely cabin for a girls weekend. We loved the fire pit relaxing by the cozy fire and visiting late into the evening.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying in this cozy cabin in the woods on the west side of Evansville. Our young son loved looking for bugs and salamanders outside. We would stay there again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a must stay. The cabin is close enough to local amenities, but far enough away to enjoy some quiet. Great hosts!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I always tell my husband that you can judge an Airbnb by its toilet paper! And in this case, I give them five rolls! üßªüßªüßªüßªüßª this cabin is adorable, and it is packed with everything you need to have a comfortable stay. Kylee & John have gone way beyond providing what you NEED, and instead make you feel WELCOMED, starting with a bottle of wine! The location is easy to find, but private and peaceful. The cabin was sparkling clean and SUPER comfortable. We spent our ‚Äúgirls weekend‚Äù sitting by the fire with wine, laughing, and reading curled up in the soft chairs and couch. We ordered dinner through Door Dash without any problems or delays. Would definitely recommend & stay again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect place. Very beautiful cabin while still being very close to town. We will definitely be back.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cabin just in the outskirts of the city!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place that is extremely close to everything in town but gives you that out in the woods feeling. It was a wonderful way to enjoy the holidays and we got to enjoy some snow with the amazing views. Having the ability to cook our own food during our time there was extremely helpful and very much appreciated. Will definitely consider coming back next time in town. Only tip would be to be careful on the gorgeous wood spiral stairs. They can be a little slippery.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin offered everything promised in the listing and then some. It is a wonderful, quiet cabin in the woods with several little touches to give it a homey, welcoming feel. Perfect for a getaway! The host are also very responsive. We had a question or two that were answered within minutes."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This cabin is soooo cute and cozy, and clean"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, provided with everything we could need and more to make our stay comfortable! Easy to find, and still close enough to town for shopping. We had pizza delivered one night from the pizza place close by, it was excellent!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are very pleased with our stay at John and Kylee's cabin, very very cozy and comfortable! It is roomy and offers exactly what you'd expect for a quiet and peaceful getaway!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing cabin in a beautiful setting. Visiting in fall was perfect, but I would also like to see it in Spring, Summer and Winter. The atmosphere is enough to keep you coming back, over and over! The location was easy to find and access. You are 5-10 minutes to shopping, local dining and walking trails. The kitchen is very well stocked with everything you need to cook and serve a full meal. The beds are comfortable and linens made us want to go home and replace our own. There is a twin bed on the lower level, perfect for an afternoon nap. There are two beds in the loft. This could be a small family getaway or a romantic getaway for two."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those places that you don't want to write a review of how amazing it is because you don't want it to fill up! It was such a beautiful oasis for our family and the teenagers loved it as much as we did. They are already asking to go back. The kitchen is stocked so nicely with everything you need to cook all your meals and even a few spices readily available. The atmosphere wraps around you and is so cozy. Great books on the shelves, and the craftsmanship of the cabin is so unique and something to be admired. The outside area is so nice as well and wood is even provided for the fire pit. Great grill and outdoor lighting for night time. The area is secluded and lots of windows to brighten the cabin up with great views. Although secluded; it is very near to stores, restaurants, and parks with nature trails. The hosts were so very accommodating and help us with every text question immediately during our stay. Thank you! Love all the personal touches that you have been so intentional with in this beautiful oasis."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second trip to John and Kylee's cabin, and we can't wait to come back again! The cabin is very private with beautiful views of the fall trees. We had a great socially distant escape, visiting local hiking spots, and grilling out at the cabin. John and Kylee also went above and beyond to obtain some dry firewood for us to use on the fire pit. Would definitely recommend this spot to anyone!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nama(stay) INDEED! I can not do this stay justice with words. You simply have to come and EXPERIENCE this cabin for yourself. From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted with the most inviting aroma. You feel like you are in the middle of no where while being just minutes away from entertainment. Kylee and John have created such a wonderful get away. Everything I could have thought of, was in the cabin. EVEN YOGA MATS! Our only regret was that we didn't have time to have the bottle of wine they set out for us. But it's the excuse we will use to come back. Namastay again real soon!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Kylee's cabin is warm and inviting with lots of fun details to explore. How did they know we like turtles so much? If you're looking for a clean send cozy space that's still close to things to do and has its own unique charms, look no further. John and Kylee were excellent hosts!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We truly enjoyed our stay at the cabin. We were in town for a wedding but wanted time to relax and just get away. This was the perfect spot. The decor was beautiful and the cabin had everything we needed from bath towels and toiletries to everything we needed to prepare food for the duration of our stay. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for more and look forward to one day staying again.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was my second time staying at John and Kylee‚Äôs cabin and it was another wonderful stay! Lots of thoughtful amenities and touches (including yoga mats and family games). Very quick responses to questions. Great place for a little family getaway!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved how private the cabin was! So close (only 10 minutes) to shopping and restaurants--yet when you are at the cabin it was SO QUIET. That was exactly what we were looking for!
There are a few things we specifically want to know when we go stay places--so I want to include them in our review!
1) The bed. My husband and I stayed and we slept in the queen sized bed. For us it was the best combination of firm and soft. Wasn't too firm, but wasn't too soft either.
2) The sofa. I found the sofa to be quite comfortable for napping. It does sit low to the ground and is on the soft side.
3) Kitchen. While this trip we didn't utilize the kitchen besides storing drinks in the fridge--there was PLENTY of items to use had we wanted to cook meals at the cabin.
4) Proximity of Neighbors. While the cabin is secluded from the road and the hustle and bustle of the city--the property does have neighbors on both sides. There is a LOT of space between the cabin and the neighbors and you cannot see into the windows of either house etc. and it was super quiet. No noise was noticed from the other properties. We did see them leave their house a time or two, but nothing that bothered us in anyway.
The hosts were so responsive and kind! We asked for ideas for thrift stores/resale shops etc and they were so kind to give us suggestions! If you do head the the Evansville area, be sure to treat yourself to COMFORT by the Cross-Eyed Cricket. It is a restaurant in the downtown area and it was very good!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely beautiful cabin on a quiet and peaceful wooded lot. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! Excellent communication and guidebook. Pizza delivered from Spankey's and curbside pick up burgers from Bru-Burger both awesome. Secluded but conveniently located to a number of local sites. We checked out USI, Burdette Park, Evansville, New Harmony, New Brunswick, the John Audubon State park in Ky, and walked nearby trails. Everything we needed for comfort was well thought out and provided. So many details to enhance the Zen experience-artisan woodwork, decor and design elements, Alexa, the book collection...All in all a truly wonderful stay! Sandy, Larry and Eric"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most peaceful and relaxing cabins I‚Äôve ever stayed in! For sure a must if you are looking to disconnect and unwind. Their cabin was so cozy and quiet, and they really did a great job of making you feel at home here with the fire pit outdoors, yoga mats for your use, games, movies, indoor plants, and a bottle of wine for your stay. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay - we could not have picked a more homey space to stay for our cabin getaway! Thank you for a great experience!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John and Kylee's cabin was the perfect place to get away. They had thoughtful touches like extra towels and a bottle of wine. The cabin was extremely clean and super cozy. A stay at the Zen Cabin is a MUST!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best airbnbs I have ever had the pleasure to stay in! The fire pit was a great place to hangout with our friends after hiking in Shawnee National Park. The hosts gave us some great locations to check out! We took advantage of the free bottle of wine they provided. We were very happy to see that there was coffee and creamer available! The last one we stayed at didn't even have a coffee maker and we need our coffee in the morning. The outstanding hospitality, the beautiful cabin, and amenities made our trip perfect. Thanks so much!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was absolutely beautiful and surreal to us. It was our first Airbnb travel as a family and it was definitely the best choice as a first family vacation with our 2 year old. There‚Äôs stores not too far in case you need to get some stuff, so it‚Äôs a nice little cabin not too far from the city. Thank you so much for the wine, my wife loved it and we loved your cabin and hope to come back soon!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a cozy little cabin to unwind and relax! It was easy to find and was not far from things to do in Evansville. Nice and secluded!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for our family and we didn't want to leave! Our first AirBNB experience a d it exceeded my expectations. I would stay here again in a heartbeat if we ever go to Evansville again. It was very nice and the kids LOVED the soft blankets. Everyone had a relaxing time and we enjoyed the firepit each night, used the grill a couole of times, and it was so just perfect."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Cabin. Beautiful. The wooded setting is perfect. Loved the fireflies. Everything was so homely and comfortable. It was spotlessly clean. Loved the bottle of wine and the choccies. Will definately stay again.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay. Cozy and spotlessly clean. We appreciated the bottle of wine and especially appreciated the clear COVID-19 safety protocols that John and Kylee have implemented. We were able to stay with confidence and that made it all the more relaxing.

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John & Kylee's place was exactly what we were wanting for our girls weekend! The cabin is clean, cozy and beautifully decorated. We had everything we needed in the kitchen to cook with. It rained most of the time we were there, so we didn't get to use the firepit area, but maybe next time....we would love to come back again!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, comfy cabin . It seems completely like you are in the wilderness - yet literally minutes from everything to do in Evansville .

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect little home for our stay in Evansville.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you look up the house, you will find a house that should have been condemned....it has been totally restored and is an up-and-coming neighborhood. The photos on Airbnb are exactly how it looks now. It is homey and very comfortable."

Nestled in the Haynie's Corner area of town, their house is within walking distance of a coffee shop and a couple of restaurants/bars. The location felt safe and quiet. The house itself is beautifully designed and decorated, complementing their residence next door. While we never met them personally, they were friendly and quick to reply in their messages. I feel their place was accurately represented in their listing and is a great value. I would easily stay there again and would recommend Haynie's Hangout to anyone looking for lodging in Evansville."

During our stay we did some light cooking and everything in kitchen is labeled and readily accessible such as; pot, skillet, toaster, etc.. and we really enjoyed making coffee on the Keurig each morning. We got great sleep in very comfortable beds and we were conveniently able to wash our laundry the night before our departure since there is a washer & dryer onsite.
This location is only 2-5 mins away from the Ford Center which is why we stayed to attend an event. Next time we visit Evansville Indiana we will definitely stay here again!
Thanks Tony & Jill for being Awesome Hosts!!

The location is a quick, easy, walk to everything our towns Art District has to offer (great cocktails, food, live music, coffee) and you‚Äôre only minutes from the river front. The home is very clean, comfortable, well furnished and they‚Äôve thought of everything you‚Äôd need. I am often alone during my Airbnb stays, so it was nice knowing they were just next door (they communicate well but you have plenty of privacy as I never saw them during my stay). I recharge with a quiet staycation in the area every couple months, but my usual place was booked. I‚Äôm glad it was and I discovered this gem, I will be back!"

It's close to downtown restaurants -- a walking distance of about 5 to 10 minutes depending on where you want to go. Even less if you go to the one directly on the corner. The house was super clean and seemed more spacious than what we saw in the pictures. There was plenty of room to spread out. There was even enough space to have a few family members over for lunch one day.
Tony and Jill were also very accommodating, and check-in was super easy.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super comfortable, clean and great location. Tony and Jill were very hospitable and kind. If you want to experience Haynie's Corner area of town, this is your place. King size bed and queen size bed were both super comfortable. If you want to sit around the dinner table to eat, there is a place outside on the patio. But the three barstools are super comfortable and all that we needed while staying there with our daughter.
We will book here again when we come back into town."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tony and Jill‚Äôs house was perfect for our family of four, and our two boys (ages 9 and 12) thought the house was pretty cool. Whether you‚Äôre staying for one night, or longer, you‚Äôll have the perfect accommodations. The kitchen was stocked with the basics, and both beds were comfortable. Quiet neighborhood with restaurants within a short walking distance, and concert venue was a 10-15 minute walk. We will definitely book here again if/when we return to Evansville"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm a business traveler that has been all over the world. 30 years of it to be exact. I stopped using hotels when Covid hit and started with ABB exclusively. I‚Äôve seen good ones and bad ones. I‚Äôm getting better at spotting the bad ones even if they have good ratings. I‚Äôve found that most people are nice and don‚Äôt want to say anything bad about a ABB owners place. I can tend to be that way too I suppose. So I reading between the lines of ABB reviews I‚Äôve discovered that short one line reviews aren‚Äôt necessarily a good sign. Example.
Clean
Quite
Friendly host
Those are all good but they didn‚Äôt tell you that yes it‚Äôs clean but the bed sucked was in a bad neighborhood and there‚Äôs no place to park. Anyway my point in this whole rant is to give my honest opinion about this ABB. It‚Äôs truly one of the best I‚Äôve ever stayed in. There attention to detail is unparalleled to any I‚Äôve stayed in. Park right in front of the door. 1 step up on the porch and your in. Once your in you will see just how cool this place is. You can definitely tell the owners lived in the space at one point. All the light switches are labeled. The bed is amazing. Better than I have at home. I even asked them where I could buy such amazing pillows. I could go on and on but I think I‚Äôm done here. Thank you so much for letting my stay in your great little ABB. Whenever I‚Äôm in Evansville this will be the first place I‚Äôll look for."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing house! Plenty of street parking as well as a spot in the back if you prefer.. so close to Ford Center and yummy restaurants (Walton's just down the street was a favorite!). This place felt like a home away from home.. very relaxing and exactly as advertised.
Thank you, Tony and Jill!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home in a quiet neighborhood. We have stayed at many Airbnbs and this one thought of everything! Such a comfortable space.

The bed was comfortable and the white noise machine a nice touch!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I was here on my own for the first part of the stay as a travel nurse. The house was clean, bedding and couch comfortable, tv easy to use, and wifi had plenty of speed for me to work on school work. The shower was amazing and the laundry room was fully stocked. The area seemed safe and was quiet at night for a good night great. My husband and kids joined me later and loved it as well. There was plenty of floor space for the kids to spread out their toys and they enjoyed looking at the decorations around the house. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone looking to stay in Evansville."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Tony and Jill‚Äôs was wonderful. I have family in Evansville and have been coming here since I was born. This was my first time not staying at our recently sold family homestead when visiting so I was a bit of a fish out of water.
This home is in the cutest part of town that I never knew existed, it was immaculate, and was the perfect place to have family gather for an evening.
Tony and Jill were beyond kind when I told them this visit in town was a sad one and were quick to respond to any questions that I had. I will definitely stay here again and make sure that my family members know to stay here as well.
* Beds were cozy and comfortable.
* Had sufficient necessities for serving food.
* Has an outdoor area although no shade.

I‚Äôm currently 6 months pregnant and can‚Äôt remember the last time I slept so well! Also, the shower was AMAZING! Super clean, spacious and the water pressure was perfect.

The pictures are accurate and the home was warm, inviting, clean and had everything we needed to spend our 4 nights comfortably. There are two bedrooms, one on either end of the home with comfy beds, bath with shower, kitchen had enough utensils, pots/pans to make our meals, laundry room. A very cute historical home, which we love. It is right in the middle of Haynie's Corners art district with a few restaurants and bars within walking distance. The neighborhood is full of old homes with amazing architecture. Makes for a fun and enjoyable walk. We stopped in at the High Score Saloon for a drink and to play a few video games. If you like old-school arcade games and pinball, this is the perfect place, plus the games are free (pinball 50 cents). Ate at Bru Burger at the old Greyhound. Very good food. Also ate at Gerst Bavarian Haus - if you get the pretzel.. look out! it's HUGE (and delicious). Communication with Tony & Jill was easy and quick. They were kind enough to accept our last minute request to book arriving late that same night. Tony met us outside and welcomed us. There is a car slip behind the house for one car and street parking available. We would definitely stay again and recommend Haynie's Hangout to all. Enjoy!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We can‚Äôt say enough about the charm and comfort of Haynies Hangout. It is a space that is loved and it shows. The home has been beautifully renovated while maintaining much of its original character. The beds were ultra comfortable, high quality linens, great pillows, slept like a dream. We had a chance to meet Tony this morning before we departed and was a pleasure to get to talk to him. Was also very quick to respond to our questions during the night about the television. This was a great stay, plenty of room to spread out, quiet neighborhood, would love to return to explore the area a bit more."

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Haynie's Hangout is a beautiful rental in a great location! It is near several restaurants, the Riverwalk, Downtown Evansville, and a short drive to USI. We enjoyed Walton's and the Pampered Pig for supper. they both have great food, cold brews, and friendly service. The rental is clean, recently renovated, and loaded with character and comfort. The neighborhood was quiet and safe as well, for those who like to walk. My husband and I took an afternoon stroll to downtown Evansville along the river to the casino and back. It was a very enjoyable walk with the river and stately historical homes on either side. We truly enjoyed our stay!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic place. Better than advertised. Great home with excellent updates. Very central to the downtown area. Bonus: it's literally a block from a casual independent restaurant called Walton's Comfort Food. Strongly suggest you stay here.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was an excellent place for us to stay. We were there to see our daughter at USI. It was close enough to campus for us to see her inbetween classes. She stayed with us at night and was able to get back on campus pretty quickly. The house was very clean. The beds were comfortable and the added touches were fantastic. We highly recommend a stay here. We will use this house again in the future.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If we ever have to come to Indiana again, I hope this Airbnb is available."
,,,"The house was as depicted in the photos so there was no complaint there. Unfortunately the house is on a busy street and also backs on a highway. The traffic was loud and relentless until later in the evening when it tapered off but still any vehicles that did go by, dogs that barked, sirens or motorcycles, were very loud. Around 4am the traffic picked up again. We checked the windows to see if they were properly closed because the noise was so loud. They were but just dont provide the insulation needed for such a high traffic area.. My husband enjoyed the lap pool but the dry sauna wasnt working but the host did come over and got it working. Would not go back because of the noise otherwise everything was fine."
