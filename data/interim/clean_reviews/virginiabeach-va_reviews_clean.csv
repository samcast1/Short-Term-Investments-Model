2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and comfortable place with a beautiful nature view. A peaceful and private escape, only a 15 minute drive to the beach and local shops, with cute farm stands selling fresh produce along the way. This place had everything we needed and wanted for a weekend getaway. A lovely place to grill and sit outside. The bed, sofa, and recliner chairs were all super comfortable. The kitchen was well supplied and the bathroom was spacious and clean. The hosts included nice details throughout including a chess board and drinks for sale in a fridge in the connected barn."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly hoping to come back again
and stay longer. It was beautiful area and the barn was such a cute place to stay. The views were astounding from the deck. 10/10 would recommend if you’re willing to try something a little different than a regular plain Airbnb."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place! Very convenient location and had everything you’d need for a perfect stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay!!!
I don’t even know where to start.
I adore that the connecting door to the house locks from the guest side, added security always feels good!
The details the host family thought of are AMAZING. Down to the settings on the Roku TV ( you input your checkout date and it automatically erases your streaming data on that date)
The towels are so clean. I’ve never been at an air bnb that I KNOW cleans their towels correctly.
The water pressure in the shower is astounding. A true treat.
As someone with a family member with special needs, i noticed the accessibility additions to the bathroom almost immediately. The weight bearing bars and plentiful room and tiled in seat were an amazing touch for any traveling families who may have wheelchair users or anyone with other mobility aids.
This is a lovely stay for anyone who is looking for a clean, quaint spot close to Virginia Beach with all of the essentials. Amazing stay."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were very nice, but it would have been better to have had the chance to meet the host. Then it would have been a more personable experience. The space appeared to be clean and had most everything you’d expect for this type facility."

If and when visiting the area again will look for this availability before others. Also being pet friendly was a huge plus. Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBnbs I've stayed at over the past ten years. It was so well-stocked, pristine, and well-ventilated that it seemed like I was the first person who had ever spent the night there. The bed and furnishings were very comfortable. There was plenty on hand in terms of coffee supplies, cookware, toiletries, cleaning products, linens, and household accessories like an iron and lint roller. If I had scheduled time to go to the beach, they also supplied towels, boogie boards, and a picnic basket! The owners live on the other side of the wall, but I felt perfectly at home and private. Would definitely recommend."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has everything we needed or expected. It is in a residential area, we felt completely safe.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cozy getaway was perfect for a long weekend in Virginia Beach! The room was comfortable and spotlessly clean, with lots of thoughtful amenities. The hosts responded to any questions I had within minutes, and they even reached out to suggest some fun ""rainy day"" activities for us when the weather didn't cooperate. We found it was equally easy to get to the oceanfront as it was to travel to Norfolk/Portsmouth for nearby activities. We highly recommend this hidden gem!"

Norman has thought of everything. The pictures do not show how spacious this place really is. The bathroom feels like a spa, the bed and pullout couch are super comfortable and the place is stocked with everything you need. I mean everything- even beach towels and boogie boards. There are helpful notes everywhere indicating what switches control which items. And the place was immaculate.
Fantastic location in a very quiet area. This will be the first place I check when I am in the area."

Every little detail from the ability to use our Netflix and Hulu sign in info, the good quality mattress and pillows, and the USB ports in the bed headboard makes the stay more comfortable and enjoyable.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place to stay! CLEAN, looks exactly like the pictures."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was great! You have three floors to yourself with bathrooms on every level. Only a block away from the beach and not at all crowded as it is away from all the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk which was still only about 10 minutes down the road. The place was very clean and I highly recommend. The host was awesome too.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful location for the Shamrock Marathon. Close to the beach and walkable to the boardwalk. Highly recommend.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"this townhouse is well situated a short block and a half from a beautiful and spacious, clean beach. easy access to the water. The home was certainly clean and presentable and the host was very responsive in all communications. My only drawback about the space has to do with the pictures of the common area appearing to be larger than they actually are. additionally, there are limited views from inside the house. mostly You see townhouses on either side, giving a little closed in feeling once inside the house."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great location in proximity to the beach !! The couch’s needed to be vacuumed under the cushions. We loved our stay there !!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason was amazing and very accommodating when we had to extend our stay due to unforeseen circumstances. I would highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying here. I had such a great experience the first time that I came back! Jason was super helpful and friendly. The house is lovely and quiet with plenty of space.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space and location. The first level living space was bigger than we imagined, so it may it all the better having our littles with us. Easy walk to the beach and less than 10 minutes from the oceanfront. Perfect little getaway spot."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed with friends for a long weekend. All rooms were clean and comfortable. The first bedroom/bath was on the second floor and the second bedroom/bathroom was on the third floor which wasn’t an issue for our group but something to keep in mind if you have trouble with steps. The house was a shorter walk to the beach than we estimated it to be which was a big plus for us. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As described, clean, comfortable, quiet, enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"House is in a great location and I can’t say enough good things about Jason’s quick response to questions/needs. The stairs are very steep and you get a workout going to the master bedroom! 😅I didn’t consider that when booking. The house could use an updated mattress in the master and some new thicker towels throughout. Also, some kitchen towels would have been nice. Besides all of these minor whines we would definitely stay again. Would be a great place for a beach week with family. Lots of space."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason's place is in a great location, and Jason was super helpful and responsive to everything. The place itself could need an update and a deep clean."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice well equipped house - just as advertised. Plenty of space for my wife and I and could have easily also accommodated a few grand kids or another couple.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"awesome location close to the beach,cozy secluded back porch, excellent ac on the main level. fully functional kitchen, tons of room inside to congregate. parking for 2 cars. the main strip is a short bike ride away."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot for a family vacation! Wonderful host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is our 2nd summer at a row at The Beach House and it won’t be our last! Not only is the house more than spacious enough for our group, but if you have an infant, it has everything you need. Our son was 6 months old last year, thus 18 months this year and we loved the games, space in the master bedroom for the crib, and the highchair! We loaded him up in the provided wagon and walked the 2 minutes across the street to the beach. The place is clean and has everything you might need! Jason is a great host and easy to get ahold of if need be. He helped us find fresh seafood for our dinner and responds quickly. The 2 parking spots are clutch at well! We’ll be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location near a nice beach. Clean house. Responsive owner.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is our second time to Jason’s place. It’s clean and comfortable and in an awesome location. The north beaches offer more room and less crowds and Jason’s place is an easy walk to the beach. It’s also the perfect amount of space for our family of four. Great stay!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, nice place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason was an excellent host. The house was just as described and ready when we arrived. It was in a great location with an easy walk to the beach and an easy drive to restaurants.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,nice and clean and good location.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was quiet and paceful. House design is a bit awkward. main room on the 3rd floor that can only access through a noisy and tight stair. When i entered i found 4 half dead cockroaches i had to clean so not the best arrival. Other than that the house is well equipped but with excessive and wrong furniture. For example there is a sofa on the kitchen but no dinning table.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit itself is very beautiful, and situated close by the beach. It was very spacious and comfortable, and could easily sleep more guests than we had (4 total). Some slight issues with bugs on the first day, but no major problems after that. Had a stranger attempt to enter the back door in the middle of our first night there, which was a little scary, but possibly just a mistake from someone at the wrong home. Would have loved to take advantage of the home’s other offerings (beach gear, bikes, grill) on our visit, but the weather was uncooperative. A severe storm (with nearby tornado) knocked out power for several hours on our final evening, and unfortunately there were no emergency supplies (flashlights, lanterns or candles/matches) in the unit, so we had to make due with our phones in the dark. Overall, it was a decent stay in a really lovely place. As someone who lives in a “smart home”, I loved the high-tech touches."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a beautiful and cozy place. Perfect location, close to the beach. We had everything we needed. Jason was very responsive and friendly. We highly recommend this place!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chose the property as it was so close to family we were there to visit. It was exactly as described. We had a little trouble with the temperature as I was unfamiliar with the thermostat but I received a very quick response to resolve the problem.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great time staying here. Walkable distance to the beach, comfortable beds and peaceful location. Jason was a great host and my family would love to stay again next time we visit"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Will stay again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a three-story condo with both bedrooms and bathrooms upstairs, with a third study/bedroom on the first floor. The place is spacious and nicely furnished. It was near everything and the beach. More importantly, there's parking and its easy to get to. I highly recommend it for large families/gatherings. We arrived late, and Jason kept the lights on for us, which made it easy to find in the dark. We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience at Jason’s place and was much bigger than we’d realized! Host was communicative and helpful. Would stay again! Thank you for hosting!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described. The place was actually bigger and had more rooms than we initially realized.

Everything was clean and Jason communicated well, even helping us when we were having trouble getting the door locked. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this place to others."

The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pots, plates, and appliances. We appreciated the hard plastic plates for our kids. We also appreciated that there was detergent for the washer/dryer. The owner was very responsive when we had any concerns. We will stay there again!"

I highly recommend anyone to stay here!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was wonderful to stay in! Exactly as pictured/listed and was a short walk to the beach. Exactly what my group and I needed for a short getaway. Thank you!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was very accommodating for our last minute trip. We were super close to the beach, and the wagon was a life saver. The condo was very clean and spacious, and had a lot of extra amenities. We will definitely be coming back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great stay! Jason was very responsive and flexible, which made a world of difference for us with two toddlers.

Thank you Jason!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Jason’s beach house was the perfect spot for our family in town for a wedding. The walk to the beach was easy and the cart he provided was perfect.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice place to stay in Virginia Beach's quiet North End, away from the boardwalk crowds. The house was comfortable for three people, and the neighbors we met were pleasant. We didn't have any problems requiring Jason's attention during our stay. We were happy to discover that it's possible to bike along the Atlantic Avenue access road/bike path, then cross over almost seamlessly to the boardwalk bike path. We also discovered a nice bike path into First Landing State Park off of Atlantic at 64th Street. The ocean beach was a short walk away, but we also enjoyed the bay beach at First Landing State Park. For dining, we ventured twice to Tautog's, our VB favorite, and found it to be just as good as we remembered. All in all, we had a very nice time!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was clean, and listing was accurate. It was close to the beach and convenient for us since we have small kids. We loved staying here, and def would love to stay again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay at Jason’s home. Space was plenty big for our group of 5-7 people. We enjoyed access to the residential beach and utilized beach essentials in the storage shed (wagon, umbrella, body boards). Jason’s communication throughout the stay was excellent and would love to stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house and wonderful location within walking distance to a great beach that wasn't busy at all. We'll be back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, tranquil location at the northern end of Virginia Beach. Lots of space. Jason was quick to communicate and very helpful."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was awesome! It had everything that our family needed for a fun few days at the beach. We rode the bicycles quite often and used the chairs at the beach. My nephews lived in town so we even had a corn hole tournament on the nice grass between the two houses one night. When we first arrived the Wi-Fi did not work and Jason went out of his way to check with the Internet company as well as letting me know what to do to get Wi-Fi. It worked thanks for him. I would definitely stay again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Jason’s. He is super easy to work with, accommodating and friendly!!! Clean, well equipped kitchen, great layout!!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason’s place was great and the location was ideal for us! Super spacious with a TV and pretty much every room which was a huge plus for us! Check-in was easy Jason was very accommodating. Great place to stay
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved staying in this beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood. We did meet a few neighbors who were so incredibly nice and welcoming. The home has everything needed for your stay.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable stay and responsive host. Walking distance to a quiet portion of the Beach as well. No problem recommending this Beach House!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot! Only a short drive to downtown Va Beach and the beach access from the house was so close! Would stay here again!
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location. Little path into First Landing at the end of the street (only six houses away) and the beach is just across Pacific Avenue. Also, there’s a feeder road that runs parallel to Pacific that is perfect for running/walking/biking. A few issues came up during our stay and Jason was very responsive."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would recommend to everyone who wants to travel to Virginia Beach to stay here.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location. We enjoyed exploring First Landing Park, the North End and the resort area beaches."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely spacious condo just over a block from the beach entrance. The condo has a well-appointed kitchen with plenty of appliance options for meal and coffee prep. We comfortably housed five, two of whom worked from the condo part time. With a game room, living room, and family room/kitchen all on the first floor, there were plenty of options for finding a quiet place or spot to enjoy being together. The beach access is just over a short block away, and it's a quick drive to the boardwalk area of VA Beach. I communicated several times with Jason. He was always quick to reply and extremely helpful. We are grateful for the opportunity to stay there and thankful to our host for a great getaway!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My brothers and I flew into Virginia Beach for the memorial service of a family member. My aunt lived not too far from Jasons for the last 40 years so it meant so much to us to be a block and a half from the beach where we were able to walk and watch sunset every evening. The house itself is great and had everything we needed to make meals and spend time together.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, plenty of space and being at the North End is the only way to go!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time and would definitely stay there again!! The layout of house was perfect for our family and very clean. Communication was excellent!!!
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for any season. Keyless entry makes stay very easy. House is very spacious and has all amenities. Kitchen well equipped. Televisions in each room. Jason was quick to respond and easy to deal with. Only caveat is for those that might find stairs a problem, Master Bedroom is on the third floor. Otherwise, would certainly return again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely enjoyed our stay and loved the beautiful house. Was exactly what we were looking for and was in a good location
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I highly recommend The Hunt's Beach House in the North End of Virginia Beach. The house was great to stay and Jason was extremely accommodating . The place was very comfortable with plenty of room. The north end of Virginia Beach is our favorite beach location. Very quiet, large beaches and dunes. Yes thing to do and places to eat are nearby. We like taking advantage of the bay side up Shore Drive for First Landing Sate Park and restaurants."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place - on the North End, two blocks from the beach. Quiet, well decorated beach spot. We loved it, and will definitely look to stay again!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place! Location was perfect. Definitely recommend staying here and we hope to be back!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time and the location can’t be beat! We had one incident with the shower but Jason responded quickly and refunded money as a result. Would certainly recommend this location to anyone. Especially families looking for a beach vacation.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very spacious and great location. High tech home and access to the bikes helped us find a wonderful trail and amazing forest nearby. Nice kitchen and well designed space.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location at the North End of Virginia Beach with easy access to a massive, beautiful and peaceful beach. Huge property perfect for family/friend gathering. It was like being in your own home with everything you might need to cook even a more elaborate meal. Beach equipment was provided as well. A smarter Air BnB with high-tech touches throughout geared towards comfort. Excellent parking with room for FOUR cars. Supreme value!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason’s place is a perfect spot! He is very easy to communicate with and a joy to speak to. The condo has tons of space with everything you need to be comfortable and have a good time! It’s in a beautiful neighborhood and is close to multiple grocery stores, shopping, sight seeing, First Landing state park and of course, the beach! My family and I had a blast. We highly recommend this property!!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Location can’t be beat. Townhouse was large and sound didn’t carry from one floor to the other which was great for napping kids. Everything you need was in the house. Cleanliness could be a bit better but the communication and hosting was great.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled on the North side of Virginia Beach, this vacation home is a very short walk to the beach... Literally crossing the street and you are there!!! There is more privacy as this spot is located away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds, but just a 10 minute drive away from 21st and Atlantic Ave. and all the major restaurants located on the boardwalk and other great places to eat on Laskin Rd. I would definitely recommend this place. The house was clean and offered tons of space for comfort and relaxation. Loved the fact that there were no keys to pick up as the home offered up an electronic locking system where you put in a code to open the door. No more lost keys!! Cable, ceiling fans, three televisions, and 2.5 bathrooms to make sure everyone has that opportunity to use the facilities when needed. I'll definitely look for this place when I'm planning my next trip to VA. Beach."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place one and a half blocks from the beach. Very nice clean beach and not crowded. Perfect if you want to be away from the touristy area of the boardwalk. Low key quiet neighborhood. The rental had everything we needed and just as pictured.
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great great great location for a quiet Va Beach experience. Avoid the boardwalk crowds. Beach access is right across the street, and no crowd. Grocery is 3 miles towards bay bridge. Easy bike or drive. Parking for three cars in the drive. A duplex with 207b, so keep that in mind. Front game room can get a little noise from neighbors - but overall you can’t beat the value of this place. Fully equipped kitchen. Nice deck sitting spot. Easy beach access. TVs everywhere. Comfortable and plenty of space. Would stay again in a minute! Great communication from owner."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This was such a great place!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location just 1.5 blocks from the beach. You have to cross a bit of a busy street, but we did it multiple times a day with ease. Very spacious home with plenty of room for a large family. We brought my in-laws and our one- year-old son, and all five of us enjoyed our stay.
A friendly tip: bring a few cozy throw blankets with you for the living room areas - there is appropriate bedding on the beds, but the downstairs couches can be chilly when cozying up to play games or watch tv in the evenings.
Appreciate the prompt and thorough communication of the host. He even offered to allow us an early check-in. Great experience working with him.
Thanks again for a great first trip to VA Beach!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I rated the home for cleanliness of 3 stars. There were some ant issues. It’s the beach so sand is unavoidable. But the location and price and other accommodations were great. I highly recommend this home for your next beach stay.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was a perfectly situated on the northern end of Virginia Beach. We felt like we were on an exclusive beach resort as the visitors in this area were minimal by comparison to the southern end/ hotel area of the beach. The Hunt's rental property has EVERYTHING you may need for vacation and lots of extras including smart tvs, playing cards, board games and video games. It was immaculate, adequately maintained and well kept. We were able to walk a short distance to the beach everyday to enjoy fun in the sun. The home was even equipped with bicycles and a beach cart. All the restaurants and attractions were just a short drive away."
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Great home
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean and spacious place. Great location - short drive from restaurants and shops but quiet with almost empty beaches. Definitely recommend.
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,If your looking for a place close to the beach and well maintained “The Hunts beach house” is it. Great host and Fantastic house!!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The property is in a great location but you need to cross a busy road to get to the beach. Overall we had a good stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a beautiful family vacation at Jason’s Beach house! It’s close proximity to the beach, short drive to the boardwalk shops and activities was awesome. We went with our kiddos ranging 1-17 and it was fun/comfortable for everyone. Thank you for a great stay!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is in the perfect location. Almost everything is within 6 miles. Loved staying the north beach area.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a fantastic rental! The place is just the way it looks -- no ""fish eye"" lens to make the rooms look bigger. We had more room than we needed and the beds were super comfortable, the living area, outstanding. Well equipped kitchen, and talk about location -- we loved walking that short distance to what was basically a private beach. So much space, so many wonderful sunny days. It was a great vacation and I heartily recommend this airbnb."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Super close to the beach! I walked over every day. Plenty of board games if traveling with kids. We had to Uber to hit the Boardwalk, was usually a 10-15 minute ride. Very safe neighborhood. Jason is communicable and very friendly."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an excellent stay! Super responsive host! First stay since Covid and we really enjoyed it!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful home with all the comforts of home. My husband and I stayed here for a week and loved that we could take a walk on the beach or just chill on the deck with a beverage. The location is very quiet and peaceful but also a short drive to the Oceanfront. The host was very responsive to any questions we had. We will definitely stay here when we visit Virginia Beach again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and very responsive host! Highly recommended!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay. I worked through much of my stay, doing many video conferences. Internet access was perfect. Area was very quiet. We could hear the ocean at night while outside."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This spot is a gem! Away from the trafficky areas of the Oceanfront, but you still have a beach practically to yourself. Ropes course at the aquarium, beach days, TASTE and Smartmouth Brewery are a must! Also, the house had -tons- of board games and a Wii. We will be coming back 😊"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was past our expectations. Jason was very responsive to us and accommodated my large family of 8 and plenty of room for us. Pics of the place doesn't quite do it justice. It's absolutely gorgeous and clean, very well maintained and stocked. Just all positive vibes from us. My kids loved the bikes and the beach is across the street. Very secluded. Just amazing and we will be returning there 😁"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Gus was a welcoming and very gracious host for which we are very grateful. (Others have Not been so) The house was welcoming and very clean. We felt very much at home the minute we opened the keypad and stepped in to the lovely house. The neighborhood was great for running/powerwalking and the beach was just a few houses away. The Cavallier Hotel was a nice surprise, as well as other restaurants that were also walking distance. Thank you, Gus!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I will check for availability here for all future Virginia Beach stays! I sent the listing to my VB family to give to their visitors. The house was perfection! The space, vibes, right next to beach access, the back deck, AND the rooftop deck! This place has dedicated parking and a laundry room which we're more good bonuses. I also took advantage of the soaking tub. Gus was super friendly, and it was easy to communicate with him. Highly recommend this awesome house!"

Fireplace and rooftop deck made our visit to our son extra special. The kitchen had all the basic amenities, plus a well-stocked freezer. This home is so special and we hope to be able to stay there again, soon, Gus. Thank you."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was beautiful and much more spacious than the photos. It was only a 2 min walk to the beach with plenty of reserved parking. As a local to the boardwalk area, this is the best location to rent by the beach and a steal with the amount of parking and rooms.
My family LOVED their beds and slept so well. There were also so many unexpected extra amenities and large beautiful spaces that our 6 person family could be together.
As a host, Gus was incredible! He responded in 5 minutes! He allowed us to do an early check in and a very late check out so that we could work at the house the last day."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gus’s place is the most perfect location for a beach vacation! Close to restaurants, shopping and a safe area for walks. We went for a week with our baby and we were looking for a relaxing beach getaway. We got that and more. Gus goes above and beyond to make sure everything you need is at the house! Even coffee for the coffee maker. I’ve never had a host ensure that you have all that you need. He has a book of restaurant recommendations which was so helpful. He is super responsive if you have any questions, the house is spotless and spacious and only 3 houses from the beach!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Beautiful and spacious home on the north end of VA Beach. Could ask for a more ideal stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gus was an excellent host! He communicated with us very well. He even checked to see when would be best for the landscapers to come by and not disturb us. The house was as advertised and a short walk from the beach. Great location for a family with children and the house had plenty of room for everyone to relax.
The beach was clean and not overly crowded. Va. Beach has lots to do and a lot of good family friendly restaurants."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time at Gus’ beach house. The house was amazing with a short walk to the beach. We felt right at home and everyone had plenty of space to relax and decompress after a day at the beach. We would absolutely stay at this house again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My family just spent a week at Gus’s lovely home. Everything about it from the location to the accommodations and amenities were as depicted. It is a beautiful and comfortable space that includes everything you might need during your stay. The location is perfect as well. Half a block from a beautiful, peaceful and private beach. Everything was so easy. Gus is also very responsive and quick to address any questions that one might have. We are sorry to leave but have every intention of returning in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Gus's place. The house is beautifully decorated, clean and in a lovely location - just a short walk to the quiet, gorgeous beach! The beds are comfy, the bathrooms are spotless, and the kitchen is well equipped. The large garage was ideal for storing our beach items and bikes. We biked to the boardwalk, went to nearby First Landing State Park, and found plenty of great spots to eat. We were a bit disappointed about the rooftop deck, though, as it did not live up to the pictures and there was no mention of the tricky spiral staircase. Nevertheless, we did manage to venture up there one evening to play games and take in the stunning sunset. Overall, a fabulous stay! Would definitely recommend it to friends. Thank you, Gus, for sharing your beachside home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We thoroughly enjoyed out stay. A perfect setting for a week at the beach with family.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great home. Rooftop wonderful for fireworks. Easy to and from the beach. Lots of available parking. Gus was great to work with.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There may be equally as excellent places to stay in VA Beach, but there are surely none better than Gus's! We were able to check-in as early as we wanted which gave us basically another whole day in VA Beach. There is absolutely zero to complain about. The house seems as if it was just built. The kitchen is beautiful with top of the line appliances. The microwave slides in and out of the cabinet which my 5 yr old loved. The master bedroom is huge! The deck on the roof has an amazing view. The master bathtub you can just about swim in. Guest rooms & bathrooms were beautifiul. Every single room was spotless. Famiily room was very big & had a fireplace. As soon as you walk in there's a huge closet for your beach gear. Sky light in the guest bathroom was really a nice touch. A short 30 second walk to the beach and the beach was beautiful and not crowded. Gus answered any & all questions within minutes. I cannot say enough about this house and Gus. We cannot wait to go back & stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved the house and will definitely be back! It was steps from the beach and a nice walk to the boardwalk. Gus was very quick to reply to my questions while at the house.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"No need to take pics for this review. It literally looks AS described in the app. Just like described, the name of this home is nothing less than immaculate. My parents, my husband, my two yr old and I truly enjoyed staying here.
Beach access was ideal! We came during the off season so we had the beach to ourselves and the traffic outside the house was minimal.
Gus was quick to respond! We had a hiccup with my daughter locking the bathroom door and he was super helpful, and stayed in contact until the issue was resolved!
My only complaint would be that I can’t gatekeep this house and I can see it getting booked over and over again! I know I will look forward to trying to vacation here in the future!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This was an amazing stay. Gus was extremely accommodating and very helpful. You can’t beat the location. The home was warm and inviting. Made for a very memorable trip for our family. Plenty of room to relax and a great atmosphere for family time.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Gus’s beach home was exactly what we wanted! Clean, cozy, and right by the beach. It almost feels like a private beach since its not connected to the boardwalk which is what i liked. Not too packed."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Gus is an outstanding host, extremely prompt communicator, with a super property for lucky folks to enjoy. Beautifully furnished, comfortable beds, huge master bathroom, a cook’s dream kitchen…but the real prize is the rooftop deck! Watching fireworks from there on July 4th was SO great.
Also, a super short walk to the beach which is lovely. Gus provides some beach chairs, boogie boards and one cruiser bike.
We stayed a week with three of our adult kids and had a happy memorable vacation. No one was ready to leave when the time came!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a lovely vacation at Gus's beautiful beach house and would rate our experience there an 11 out of 10! Perfect and quiet location with the beach access steps away.

This beach house spoiled us and we hope to go back there often! Thank you, Gus, for making your beautiful beach house available through Airbnb...absolutely perfect!"

We appreciated the safe and peaceful location. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The place was perfect for what we were looking for.

It was also very easy to get in contact with him, and he was quick in his responses. Our time spent there was incredible, and we’re excited for our next stay there.
Thank you Paul!!!!
Sincerely,
Mr. & Mrs. Tracy Ramos"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wonderful space, well appointed, great location. One of the best airbnb's I've visited. Paul checked in to make sure I was having a good visit and I appreciated the notebook he put together with his tried and tested recommendations for restaurants and seeing the sights at the beach. The weather was cool and rainy but the space was so beautifully decorated and peaceful, it did nothing to dampen my visit."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul is a great host. Answered all our questions and was very responsive. The bungalow is close to many restaurants and walking distance to the boardwalk. Very charming bungalo

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay for all things, Virginia Beach, especially the beach. Paul was very easy to work with, and took care to be sure or stay was enjoyable."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's place was great! We walked to the beach every day we were there. I will say there are a couple spots that don't have sidewalks and are on a busy street, so it was hard to walk on that part, but it wasn't terrible! The space was great, very roomy! The bed was a little harder than what we are used to, but everything else was great. Paul was also nice enough to let us have an early check-in so we could drop our bags off and go explore!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the Villa. We love how peaceful and comfortable it is! It's definitely our go-to place at Va Beach. Paul is a wonderful host who has well-thought amenities and excellent communication. Don't miss this gem while in the VA Beach area!

It was quite obvious from the start that a great amount of thoughtful planning and decorating went into this space in order to create a relaxing setting for guests. Paul’s communication was excellent and he presents as eager to please guests. The location was wonderful. Visiting the Cavalier Hotel for dinner, drinks, or whatever is a must.
Overall, this space is highly recommended!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty place with nice view of golf course, within walking distance of Cavalier. Location is convenient to VB and Norfolk. Newport News was an hour drive due to tunnel traffic.
We used both beds and they were comfortable. Unit is very cool, with good A/C and plenty of extra linens to keep you warm. Jet noise was minimal here, and seemed to end over weekend. Didn’t use the bikes but there were one male, one female, which is good to know. Also there is a five gallon water dispenser, which was very helpful!
The only real downside is the bathroom size, which is on the small side; and the hot water takes awhile to reach you, but once it does you’re fine.
Paul was great host, very responsive and quick to address any needs or questions."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying at Paul’s place. It’s very spacious and the patios are lovely. It feels private and secluded while also being close to the beach. Highly recommend!

The Va Beach oceanfront is very busy and crowded in the summer, but this is a wonderful hidden spot: quiet, secluded, peaceful, off general tourists' radars, yet close to the beach and attractions. Very comfortable, welcoming and relaxing alternative to hotels on the strip. Paul is always friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and beautiful surroundings. Updated and well appointed. Paul has thought of everything you need for a stay near the beach with a lengthy list of recommended activities and restaurants. As a former native of VB myself, Paul has captured an experience of what it is like to live like a local. Will book this one again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place! I don't know which is more distracting-the beach from the villa or the villa from the beach😀 It's a cozy, peaceful, beautiful place to stay. So close to everything but it feels secluded. Paul is a great host, quick to respond and easy to chat with. I certainly hope to return and relax on that porch again😀"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,When we go there paul pulled in and was very friendly! He told us just to text him if we had any questions. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful. So grateful we found this place to stay and for such and awesome host!

Paul is such a friendly and helpful host, quick to respond and gave us recommendations for his favorite spots to eat. The location is convenient, very close to the beach area-walkable (or bikes) or a short drive away."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul’s VA Beach getaway was just perfect. From the moment we arrived we were grateful for the peaceful surroundings and thoughtful details. Paul’s space is immaculate and cozy. I hope we will have the opportunity to visit again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul’s place was perfect! We had a wedding at the cavalier and we were able to walk there very easily and quickly from Paul’s. His place was convenient to multiple restaurants and most importantly the beach! Would love to return in the summertime. Best deal as well to be so close to everything.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Backs to a golf course and yet so close to the beach! Two great porches, two coffee machine options, comfortable beds (even the sofa bed), beautifully tiled and spacious shower. Oh and free driveway parking for up to two vehicles!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very beautiful home with nice furniture, fixtures, and art. It feels secluded off the road due to greenery. My only suggestion would be for a small table for coffee or eating takeout food."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The villa was lovely - absolutely clean and very comfortable. Paul, the host, is great with communication. He called me immediately after I made our reservation to inquire about what temperature we would like the house to be when we arrived. He responded to my texts within a minute or less. He had really good suggestions for places to eat, and brought some bikes out of the garage for us to use. I'd definitely stay here again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nicely decorated, relaxing place on a country club golf course fairway only a few blocks from the beach. The touristy boardwalk is within walking distance, but you have the peace and calm of a quiet neighborhood. It was the perfect rental for our Virginia Beach get away."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, more then spacious for up to four people. Only a 5 minute walk from attractions and food. Beyond peaceful nights, you are sure certain to get a great night sleep here."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, it’s larger than it appears in the photos. Enjoy the porches and proximity to the beach."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good place for people on the go since it’s walking or biking distance from beach and does not have kitchen. Host is a great communicator and although we needed nothing I am sure he would have accommodated in minutes if we did.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my first time staying with optimal weather and I just could not get enough! If you’ve loved a previous stay here then the upgrades make it even better. Great communication and welcoming environment! I could go on and look to stay again soon!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul has created a charming little oasis in the heart of VA Beach. It almost feels like you are in a tropical paradise. It's convenient to the ocean, restaurants and other VA Beach amenities such as the VIBE District, the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art, and loads of parks. He provides bikes, beach chairs, private parking and other extras that add to your comfort."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 3rd visit at Paul’s space and I had a quiet and wonderfully relaxing time. The N. end location is perfect and a bit calmer than the southern end. It is always very clean, great AC and his communications were right on time. All of the appliances were easy, bikes available and great restaurant and activity suggestions. Everything a person could need!
I plan to return in August and can’t recommend this space highly enough."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and host.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Agree with the prior reviews - great location & attentive host, clean & comfy, excellent value. There's enough kitchen for handling take-out & leftovers, and having access to a bike is a delight. Notes I'll add since I've not seen anyone else mention are that the wifi is more than strong enough for work / video calls and it feels safe staying there as a person travelling alone. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay & recommend it!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice and clean place to stay. The bed is very comfortable. The small bathroom is up to date and clean.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul was great and checked in on us after check in. The area was very quite and the house was cozy! I wished we stayed longer. The place was within walking distance to the beach. The entire experience was good!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's place is a relaxing and quiet respite in busy Virginia Beach. The view out the back is beautiful with a lovely patio for lounging. The living room and bedroom are nicely furnished. The beds are very comfortable, and, while there is no kitchen, his place is well equipped with a small refrig and food prep area. The provided bikes are fun and convenient. The location is ideal--near the beach, restaurants, groceries and more but far from the maddening crowd. Parking is easy, which is important in Virginia Beach. Paul was a very accomodating and helpful host. We highly recommend a stay at his place!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at the villa. I especially enjoyed the front porch. minimal road noise, just a chill spot to put on good tunes and relax. Never even turned on the TV: living room and decks were great retreats to just mellow out. comfy bed, nice amenities and personal thoughtful touches. super chill and responsive host. thanks Paul.✌️"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, attentive, thoughtful hosts. Beautiful, comfortable, private spot, just close enough to the boardwalk, and just far enough away. You will be pleased if you stay here!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely place to stay on a fairly quiet street. Our host allowed us to check-in early, which we appreciated. It was very clean and charming. The bathroom is newly remodeled, but a bit small. It would be difficult to have two people in the bathroom at the same time. It is a great location, within walking distance of shopping areas, a grocery store and restaurants. We highly recommend it!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great location! The villa is bright and comfy and the patio is wonderful. We look forward to returning."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul was the perfect host. He has put a lot of thought into the comfort of his guests. Would suggest this place to anyone!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this private location and clean, cozy place! Not only was the living room huge, it was well-appointed with plenty of seating, tables, and a big TV. We used the fireplace on a chilly night and sat outside on a sunny afternoon on the back patio, overlooking the golf course. There was coffee for the mornings, a mini-fridge, cups, glasses, utensils, and a microwave...just what we needed while on vacation. The Murphy bed, bedding and size of the bedroom were quite comfortable, and the remodeled bathroom with huge shower was great. It's a quick walk to the beach and boardwalk, too. Paul was a great host!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for a few days at Virginia Beach. The area is walkable, and it has a beautiful view of the golf course. We enjoyed our stay here."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay for a weekend get away close to the beach. Everything was a described, just a short walk to the boardwalk.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay. Very cute place, private but also convenient to the boardwalk, beach and Cavalier Hotel. Hope to stay again next time we visit Virginia Beach! Thanks Paul!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great little bungalow! Good location and spending the evenings on the porch was amazing!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul is a friendly and warm host!..always quick to respond and kindly offered suggestions where to eat. We took him up on eating at The Atlantic on Pacific….excellent, especially the raw oysters, homemade cornbread and Asian dumplings. Paul’s place is within blocks of the “must-see” Cavalier Hotel. Brunch on the garden terrace was perfect. Part of the Cavalier Resort is the unique Orion rooftop restaurant which specializes in Asian-fusion cuisine and handcrafted cocktails. Paul’s studio apartment is very comfortable, immaculate, spacious, and tastefully appointed. The walk-in shower, with it’s beautiful tiles, is a good size. Paul kindly said we could park our car at the villa while we waited for check-in. He kindly texted me when the studio was ready for an earlier check-in. Loved we had a coffee maker for mornings, and small refrigerator for snacks, and drinks. Nice touch was a television in the living room, and one in the bedroom. The WiFi was strong. We used the complimentary bikes to ride the 3-mile length of the Virginia Beach boardwalk. I would recommend Paul’s place, and hope to take advantage of his lovely villa studio in the future. Paul will not disappoint."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with an excellent outdoor, shaded living space!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a peaceful getaway on a golf course. A few blocks from the beach. Decorated nicely, clean and cozy. Great front porch."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed with a pair of friends for a weekend getaway at the beach. The house is beautiful, the location is seriously convenient and just a few blocks from the beach, and the host is super-laid back, friendly and easy to reach.
Zero complaints :)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m not sure I can add anything other reviewers didn’t already say but I can say they are all correct, Paul’s place is immaculately clean, comfortable and exactly as depicted!! We walked to the Cavalier in 5 minutes, we walked to the boardwalk/beach in 10 minutes and we used the beach cruisers three days in a row. They were probably the highlight of our stay, I hadn’t been on a bike in forever! Paul is so friendly, we got to chat for a few minutes and he also checked in with us through message a couple of times to make sure we had everything we needed. We didn’t hear any noise from the other side of the house our whole stay. It felt very private. If you want a very clean, relaxed place to hang out that’s still close to everything and owned by a good person then stay here!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool, comfy, cozy, and very clean!
Would highly recommend and my parents look forward to their next stay when back in the area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location two blocks from the beach. The bikes, beach towels, and beach chairs were great touches! Paul was very responsive and the space was really comfy to spend an extended time in (except you don’t have a kitchen) but we were able to eat out and save food in the mini fridge for the next day. Mattress was really excellent and we got great sleep! Loads of sunlight and sunny areas to relax in which I loved."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home with an upscale beach vibe in an unbeatable location! Private and scenic, this is the only place I would consider staying near the boardwalk. Was even lucky enough to spot a bald eagle while catching some rays on the secluded back porch. Paul was a phenomenal host and went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and fun as possible. The classic beach cruisers were the icing on the cake! We truly felt like locals staying here, which was a welcome relief in this area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul’s Villa is a charming place to relax at the end of a busy day. It is convenient to all the activities that Virginia Beach has to offer yet it is nestled in a serene location that offers verandas to unwind on with golf course views. Paul was an extremely responsive host and obviously takes pride in making sure your visit goes smoothly and that the Villa has what you need for a comfortable stay. I loved having bikes to cruise around town on since I did not rent a car. He even provided beach towels for those who are traveling light! There were plenty of towels and comfortable linens. I appreciated the extra fans for those of us who are “hot” sleepers! Great water pressure in the shower is always a bonus! I truly felt pampered. Paul reached out to me on my final day to offer me a late check out when he realized that my flight was late in the evening. He had a cancellation that day and simply thought I might need some extra time with my family. The fact that he would do that speaks volumes to the type of host/person you will be working with.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, great place and highly recommended!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place close to the beach and dining areas. Beach chairs and bikes for us to use were a nice touch!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This location at Virginia Beach was an absolute treasure find. It was very closed to the beach and attractions, yet still felt private and all to ourselves. The Villa itself was spacious, very clean, and well put together for all our needs, plus more. Paul was a great host, with quick and efficient responses. He provided us access to bikes to get around easily and supplies such as towels for the beach. I strongly recommend this place for anyone who wants to get away for a peaceful stay, and still have close access to the beach, restaurants, and enjoyable attractions at Virginia Beach."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is the perfect beach escape! Wonderful decor, art work and the location is exactly as stated. Close to everything from golf, restaurants, of course the beach and a world class spa. Paul was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely book his home when ever I’m traveling to Va beach."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location is very close to the beach, maybe 2-3 blocks away. For part of the walk, there is no sidewalk, but it's a short, residential street, so it's not a big deal. It's situated on the side of a golf course so it's quiet at night, which was great for our baby to sleep peacefully. It's also at the upper end of the beach so the traffic and volume at the immediate beach is less, which is nice. Everything was clean and as described with extra linens and household supplies. Paul gave great instructions and a nice insider guide as well. Thanks!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures are very accurate. Beach is about a 10 minute walk. Front porch is unique and spacious. Provides bikes to get around town. Bathroom is beautiful. Overall a good stay, close to town but away from the business of downtown."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect private space for reuniting with my military daughter. We were able to relax and enjoy each other in comfort. Slept great. Great location, just as described. Thanks Paul for a wonderful stay and great communication."

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great private place minutes away from the oceanfront highly recommend
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay. It was a rainy winter weekend, and thanks to the fireplace the living room was the perfect relaxing spot. We didn't walk much given the weather; it was really conveniently located for the errands we ran by car. Our Uber Eats delivery driver also found it easily. We don't usually cook on vacation, so the microwave, mini-fridge, coffee pot, and water cooler were all that we needed; Paul had a few dishes/glasses/cutlery available to use. The bed was comfortable and had plenty of blankets so you could adjust to your preference. If you're really tall, the bathroom/shower might be a little cramped, but at 5'10"" it was fine for me and my spouse. Paul was also quick to answer questions. I would definitely stay there again."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul’s place was wonderful. Amazing location for seeing the area. We loved walking to the beach in the mornings, grabbing a pre-dinner drink at the Cavalier Hotel (also walkable) and ending the night with a fire back at the apartment. Would 100% stay again."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a gem is tucked away in va beach with access to everything. The fireplace in the winter alone is worth every penny. Great host. Best.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I had a great time staying at Paul’s. Easy check in and good communication. We also enjoyed the cozy fireplace and comfortable bed. Great location near Virginia Beach amenities. Overall highly recommend

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paul's place was great and in a very nice spot.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"paul's apt. is very neatly put together, quite spacious -- especially for a twosome -- and nicely located in a tucked-away setting but very convenient to boardwalk and beach..paul was responsive to the one request we made of him and followed up to check on our comfort -- nice guy!.."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and much more spacious than I expected. Very pretty place with a great porch and fireplace. Note that there isn’t a kitchen and not very much in the way of kitchen amenities so you might want to bring a few things. Overall very pleasant and would be great in the summer.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,really cozy and comfortable. It’s close to the beach and is located in a really nice area. Paul also let me check in early and was really easy to communicate with. Definitely recommend (:
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A cozy stay that is relaxing and comfortable! Enjoyed being here
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love this place , so comfortable and cozy . A 3-4 walk to the beach ! I’m planning my next trip back down there!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paul’s home is clean, stylish, and cozy. Everything about his home was welcoming!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family really enjoyed our stay with Paul. A rock skip from the beach, this guest suite is perfect for a weekend getaway. Plenty of outdoor and indoor space for a relaxing beach trip. Clean, comfortable and family friendly. Surfs up"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely stay in this apartment adjacent to the house. Beautiful space with many classic Virginia Beach touches, and comfortable bed. Thank you Paul! We would love to stay again in the future."

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time here very much! Great location for getting to the beach, but also a very pleasant and easy bike ride away from First Landing State Park. Comfy accommodations all around."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Guests will be pleased with the location, condition, cleanliness and peace and quiet of this villa. We want to come again and stay longer."
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is spacious and has a great location near the Cavalier Hotel and the north side beaches. The main house is also a rental and is separated by a large barn door that blocks some potential noise. We had some rowdy people next door during out stay, but Paul was very responsive (within minutes of messaging him) and the group quieted down for the most part. Obviously, this was just random and I'm guessing isn't an issue most of the time. We really enjoyed staying here."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place, hope to stay again sometime. Thoughtful touches, such as bicycles, a coffee pot, and binder with local tips written by the host. Great place to kick back and relax."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay with a wonderful view of the Princess Ann golf course. Very clean.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in Va Beach- quiet location, within walking distance to activities and the beach. Relaxing and comfortable destination!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Now, more than ever, when you want to spend some time at the beach you want to also be in a location that is clean and safe -- and also close enough to walk to anything. This place was in a perfect location, just a few blocks from the end of the boardwalk, so you could wander farther afield on the beach and still be close to home. The separate bedroom and huge living area were great and we loved having both a sitting area outside facing the golf course and the wonderful breezy front porch. Bikes were provided and everything was super clean and nice. You will love it."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul’s place was great! We really enjoyed our stay and used the bikes, perfect for the three of us. We did forget to pack basic things like shampoo and body wash, so we had to pick them up at the local pharmacy, but overall the space is stylish fun and comfortable, and extremely close to the beach! We would’ve stayed longer if we could have.
One note is that the bathroom is in the master bedroom. We are all close friends and it wasn’t a problem for us but it’s something to be mindful of when traveling in groups."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Great location! Bathroom is a little cramped, but very clean and comfortable home. Paul is a great host and very accommodating. I’d recommend this place to anyone looking for a good stay in VA Beach."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Brief walk to the beach and restaurants. Nice path for a run right behind the house.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay. We enjoyed the villa tucked away but so close to the beach. Decor is so inspiring. Historical picture of the cavalier hotel and the front porch swing was a great touch. I loved it!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations are fantastic and super clean. Easily fits 4 people and lots of space to move around. You are literally about a 5-10 min walk from the ocean front and he provided the beach towels & chairs. I mean, really all you have to do is bring yourself. 😉"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in an exclusive and quiet part of Virginia Beach yet close to everything. Very comfortable for 4 adults. Enjoyed it very much. Highly recommend. Paul is an excellent host
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great beach spot, just a quick walk or bike to the oceanfront. The place was exactly as advertised. It is connected to the ‘main’ house but we never ran into the hosts, although they were really responsive by phone/text for questions. The pullout sofa is more like a real bed, really solid and comfortable. Good sitting and viewing spots exist in front and in back. Nice view of the golf course although we don’t play. The addition of the bikes were great as we used them for transportation and site seeing. Really good stay."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful, clean, and spacious suite with a fabulous location. Be sure to take advantage of the bikes to ride down the Boardwalk. Paul is a great host, and extremely responsive. I had a restful and enjoyable visit. Thank you, Paul!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul’s place is great for a quick getaway! It is about a 7 minute walk to the beach, but actually a really easy trek. Paul was super responsive the entire time, and the place was super clean. The sofa bed was already pulled out and made which made it super quick to get settled in."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay. Just a couple blocks from the beach, but quiet and charming. We loved both patios, especially the covered porch during a rainstorm. Paul had amazing recommendations for the area, and his classic bikes were such a blast to ride and explore the boardwalk and First Landing State Park. The place is right around the corner from the Green Cat - acai bowls, smoothies, toast, etc, perfect for our (mostly) vegan lifestyle. All in all, a quiet, relaxing way to visit an otherwise touristy/crowded area. Only thing that would have made it better would have been a kitchen; also, like the description says, there is some noise transference between the shared wall with the main house. Otherwise, everything was great. Thanks, Paul!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul was an amazing host he made sure we were good and had everything we needed. He made sure we knew the local places to eat. The place was clean and very spacious the home is very beautiful..would definitely come back
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay and would book this place again if visiting Virginia Beach.
The walk to the beach is an easy 10 minute walk. Even with carrying beach items, it did not feel like a long walk.
A great feature of this place is the front porch. It is totally shaded and has comfy seating. It's the perfect place to relax, or to eat some take out/delivery if you want to avoid eating inside at a restaurant.
Paul was great with communication. He was able to accommodate my request for an early check in as well as a late check out. Those extra few hours meant for a much more full day in Virginia Beach both on the day we arrived and when we left.
You'll have a lot more space here than at a hotel on the beach that will cost the same (or even more). Plus you get access to two bikes, beach chairs, and that lovely front porch. I cannot imagine you'll regret your choice if you decide to stay here."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here! Paul is a great host, very responsive. It’s about a 5 minute walk to the beach. We especially loved unwinding on the back patio at night. Would recommend!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Villa was excellent and so conveniently close to the beach and 7/11 for certain amenities. The bikes were a great touch for exploring the local area.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely & charming home! We enjoyed playing golf, biking to the beach, and enjoying the outdoor patio."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, awesome location and excellent communication with the host, Paul."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay immensely! Paul was a friendly, responsive host. The location was quiet and a short bike ride to the beach. We look forward to returning."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked last minute when other plans got cancelled. Paul was very responsive, place was sparkling clean (especially great during COVID), and great location. Enjoyed being just far enough off the strip to feel secluded, but close enough to walk/bike to the beach. Also, enjoyed watching some golf with a glass of wine."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Close to the beach and great restaurants. Paul was so friendly and helpful. Very welcoming and helpful.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Quaint place with great outdoor spaces! Short walk to the beach. Love the water cooler and having two separate indoor sleeping spaces.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Paul’s place! We could easily walk to the beach and having access to the bikes was really helpful. Would definitely go back!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was a gracious and welcoming host, greeting us upon (early) arrival and offering his contact information if we had any questions. The place is pleasant and reasonably private, and just a short walk to the beach, restaurants, and bars!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul's place was even better than expected and pictured! My friend and I went for a girl's weekend and truly loved it. The area with the couch and the pullout bed was so much larger than pictures can do justice to, so we were able to leave the bed pulled out and made (which it already was when we got there, thank you, Paul!) and still use the couch and walk around freely. Both beds were super comfortable and everything was very clean. Having both the front and back porches was fantastic because if it rains the front porch is covered, and if it's sunny the back porch is a great place to sit and enjoy the weather while looking over the golf course. Paul was a great communicator, left perfect instructions for us, and responded to any and every need we had. He even provided bicycles for us to use while we were there, and gave great dinner recommendations. The location was exactly as described- two short blocks from the beach. I will DEFINITELY stay here again!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was great. Place was perfect. Great location and value. Paul also provided us with bikes, beach chairs and an umbrella at not additional cost. I would definitely stay at Paul's place again."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul’s place was amazing! Clean space, great location (just a 5 min walk to the beach) and he was very quick to respond to any questions as well as check in to see if we needed anything. There was even a little binder with suggestions for hot spots near the beach, activities, and good restaurants! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived, Paul's property exceeded our expectations. You won't be disappointed!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"recommend to everybody! its just perfect for a weekend getaway, or even a nights stay. paul was more than nice, and made sure to go out of his way to help us!!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul was a fantastic host. The place was exactly as it was pictured, with comfortable beds, plenty of supplies, and nice places to relax both in the front patio and back on the course. He was very quick with responses, a pleasure to talk to when we ran into him, and clearly went out of his way to make our stay nice. I would recommend to anyone! Don’t forget the amazing location close to some great restaurants/bars, the Cavalier and the golf course, and the oceanfront. Great place to stay when you visit VB. Thanks Paul!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was absolutely immaculate and Paul was an incredible host! Location was perfect and the stay was even better than expected! Would love to stay here again!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the great place to stay Paul! The decor and furniture was so nice! I loved the chair and swing on the front porch!

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Pauls place was an excellent experience... Its beautiful, both in and outside, and much more spacious then what the pictures imply. He was accommodating, offering recommendations for local eats and activities... Even during a global pandemic, he was sociable. The place was immaculate and carefully disinfected. The location is perfect. Just a few blocks from the oceanfront and a beautiful back patio overlooking a golf course. You wont be disappointed with the accommodations, or the host. This will be my first choice time and time again during my Virginia Beach visits."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are very satisfied with our whole experience to in this vacation amenities were very top notch the view is awesome the skyline with the moon was also
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place, loved having a patio overlooking the golf course, gives you an awesome view. Other than that, the location is supreme in that it's less than a 10 minute walk to the beach, but not in a crowded area. Paul was an easygoing dude, and didn't have a hard time accommodating my late check-out. I would definitely stay here again."
2020-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul is great 👌🏼👍🏼
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed this cute and comfortable space. We especially liked the 2 rooms so that one of us could sleep in while the other could have coffee and watch TV without disturbing the sleeper. Beautiful views of the 18th hole. Stylish and relaxing! We will certainly book on our next trip.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very nice space, comfortable, and as close to the beach and amazing restaurants as you can find in Virginia Beach without staying at a hotel. Definitely will book again."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed a Paul’s place for a few days while I was attending a seminar in VA Beach. Paul’s place was perfect, great location, very clean, and more than enough room for my needs. Paul was also very good with communication. He called me once I got settled to see if I needed anything. I arrived very late the night I was suppose to check in, Paul was understanding and flexible. Paul was very friendly and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend this place and I would stay here again."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Paul for having me and my buddy stay at your airbnb and having the sleeper pull out sofa ready to go. Great place, cool location on the golf course, easy walk to the beach, cool decor and lots of fun books and magazines to browse. Your quick responses made our stay even easier."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a great place to relax and it feels just like home. The house is amazing and it’s very quiet which is a plus. And if you have any questions, Paul would be sure to help you out. 10/10 would come back for another vacation!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic. So clean and Paul is a great host. He provided bikes, beach chairs and towels and umbrella, and a binder of suggestions which was great since the weather was not the best but we found great things to do thanks to him!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul is an amazing, attentive host! The space is super clean, stylish, and comfortable. Paul is kind enough to provide beach umbrellas, chairs, and bikes! I think everything there was in very good condition and he was great at letting us know about local events going on and was always ready if we had any questions. If you’re looking for a touch of luxury while you’re relaxing, definitely come here!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul’s place and service was great! Cute place just blocks from the beach and shops, location right on a nice golf course. Paul was attentive with questions and allowed us to check in super early and check out late, which made our trip so much better. If you’re staying in va beach and want a good price, cute place and great service - stay with Paul!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul’s place is in a great location! You can expect peace and quiet at the house but will be within walking and biking distance from great restaurants and the boardwalk. Highly recommend.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paul’s place is great! Extremely short walk to the beach, and he let us borrow some bikes, chairs, umbrella and towels. He is an incredibly kind and attentive host."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little home base for a couple for a weekend in VA Beach. It's located in a quiet area, but still close to the beach. The living room is cozy and includes a mini-kitchen area with a small fridge and basic cups/bowls. The bedroom is comfortable. Everything is clean. Paul is super fast with communication and made check in easy."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul was a great host. Super attentive to our needs and the space was perfect. Great location and super clean.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy walk to the boardwalk and beach. Cute decor.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet and Scott are fantastic hosts. Parking space is great for those driving in because pay-to-park is everywhere (~$15). The space is fresh and clean. Comfy bed and especially enjoyed the little nook to read. The electric fire pit is a plus and easy to turn on and off. It’s a great home base to rest and get ready. It’s walking distance to the beach and restaurants. Five stars.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place for our first visit to Virginia Beach. Cozy, comfortable, and walking distance to so many restaurants, coffee shops, shops and the boardwalk. If you are looking to feel like you are at home while away, this is the place. Scott’s garden is pure serenity and peace. Bikes were provided at no cost. We even paid a visit to their wellness spa, The Beauty Tree, the best massages we have ever had. Scott gave excellent recommendations for food and more. Their place will be the reason for us coming back at the end of the summer. Can’t thank them enough for the delightful stay! 🤍"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In a neighborhood surrounded by a lake, we woke up to the sound of geese. So fun. It was a little cool while we were there, so we didn't get to take advantage of the wonderful outdoor patio and sitting area. I hope we get to come back and utilize that."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Scott’s Garden was an oasis of peace and tranquility. It was exactly as pictured and described. Super clean. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for calmness and serenity this is the place! I could tell Janet put a lot of thought into creating a space for her customers. Starting with an inviting garden, filled with well maintained flowers and plants. The inside was just as magical, with welcoming notes and instructions. Loved the painted walls and the spa experience of the diffuser. Highly enjoyable stay. Wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy the fire-pit."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Janet's place for one night. We went to First Landing State Park and the beach. Both are close to Janet's place. The beach is about a 10-minute walk to the beach—very manageable and easy to navigate.
We were mesmerized by Janet's little garden. A lot of birds frequented it in the morning as well. I'd be happy just sitting there all day without going anywhere.
The place is adjunct to the main house. You'd access it from the backyard, where you'd see all the pretty flowers and plants. The main room has a queen bed whereas the other room with a single bed sits next to the small living room and it doesn't have a door but a curtain for privacy. It didn't bother us at all, though. We heard footsteps early in the morning, which woke us up. But it's no big deal. I wanted to point these out in case you have specific expectations.
Janet provided clear and helpful information. They were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at Scott's Garden. The surroundings were absolutely beautiful ... the flowers in the property were all in bloom. The place was just what we needed ... a well appointed accommodation with a comfortable bed and enough space for our luggage and other belongings. The area around was full of local eateries. We enjoyed walking the 'boardwalk' on the oceanfront. The rip roar of the naval jets was exciting .... (at first). It did get old after over 15 flights, above, during the day ... though ... comes with the territory. I'm glad Scott recommended a hike at First Landing State Park. We hiked there for 3 hours and really enjoyed both the history and the beauty of the place."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was probably my best airbnb stay ever. I will definitely look for Janet & Scott’s place 1st if I’m back in the area. I loved the outdoor sitting area & doing my yoga in the garden. The place was clean & peaceful, and Janet & Scott were responsive to my needs, providing me with a cruiser bike to get around & refills on filtered water in the pitcher. What a lovely place!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My daughter & I enjoyed the last 2 nights of our Virginia Spring Break trip here. It was cozy & comfortable and we loved the fact that a great restaurant was a walkable distance! The hosts were great with instructions on finding them and local recommendations too!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful bungalow! Quiet, great location and beautiful garden."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great lil diamond in Virginia Beach. Beautiful garden with plenty of seating and fire pit. Wonderful bungalow with personal touches that make you feel at home.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fun space to enjoy Va beach! Super clean, great directions for arriving and entry. Nice walkable location, close to everything, and parking was so great! Would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this abnb. Great location close to the beach and places to eat.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Utterly Charming! From the first look at photos and descriptions online to the actual arrival and experience, this sweet, cozy place just kept getting better. Our hosts could not have been nicer or more accommodating. Plenty of thoughtful snacks and hot and cold beverages available. Janet was even so kind as to loan me a treasured keepsake (signed book) when she learned I was an Edgar Cayce Fan. Scott made sure the firepit was functioning and available to keep us toasty on cool Spring evenings. The decor and artwork were outstanding and so charming, I kept waiting for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to arrive. Truly as delightful a place as one would find in a Disney fairy tale. One tiny annoyance (not the fault, by any means, of the wonderful, gracious hosts): The location is very near a naval air station, so expect to hear a lot of small planes going in and out. This didn't take away at all from a pretty darn perfect experience. I highly recommend and hope to return."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect spot for a couple or small family. Extremely clean, quiet neighborhood, and a short walk to the beach and restaurants!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Such a convenient location and a beautiful outdoor area!! Loved it
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a beautiful time at Scott and Janet’s place. They have everything you’d need for a stay and even included a few free snacks! Hopefully the next time we return the weather will be nicer and we’ll get to enjoy the garden to its fullest extent. The location is amazing and in a very nice and quiet neighborhood as well as it is in walking distance of the convention center.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, clean and charming suite in a very walkable neighborhood. Many restaurants and shops nearby. Loved the reading nook.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time! This was the perfect place to just get away and relax! plenty of amenities like provided coffee and tea and there was even a reading nook that I spent most of my time in. Overall a way better option than most places around that area 10 fold
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Loved everything about the stay minus the noise level from upstairs movement and planes flying over head. Room was beautiful and spacious. Would definitely book again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place to stay very quiet secluded and a great get away very good at communicating if you have any questions
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A pleasant place to stay. ClLean and well equipped.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Due to a travel delay, I had an unexpected 2 nights in Virginia Beach. I booked Janet's place at the VERY last minute. She was very responsive and flexible. The apartment was very cute and cozy. Perfect for a chilly February stay. It was not a problem that I did not have a car. It was an easy walk to wonderful several coffee shops, bakeries, and restaurants in the ViBe district. I felt very lucky to get Janet's place on such short notice and definitely hope to stay there again next time I am in Virginia Beach."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,highly recommend! superb location and communicative hosts!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were only briefly at Janet's place but it was lovely and quite clean. Recommend.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet and Scott have created such a beautiful abode; they are great hosts that put heart in every little detail. The Crooked House is a great location, with lots of space and lovely interior. Parking, checking in and out, and communicating with them were all so easy, and we would love to come back. It was hard to explore VA beach when all we wanted to do was stay home and enjoy the garden! Thank you for having us!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely spot with so many personal touches. Felt like staying with friends.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"beautiful apartment very close to the beach! wonderful hosts, left the fire on for us to enjoy, perfect location"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Scott’s garden. The suite is cozy and thoughtfully decorated. The outdoor space was a beautiful place to enjoy a morning coffee. Janet was a wonderful proactive host. Having a designated parking spot was much appreciated. We hope to return if we are back in the area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cosy place for our stay in Virginia Beach in November. As it was November the weather had turned but the accommodation was warm and welcoming on our arrival. Especially beautiful artwork by Janet on the bathroom walls! Also the kind addition of drinks and snacks in the fridge on arrival. Great base for our travels around Virginia Beach. Scott very accommodating lighting a fire outside for a cosy chat with my husband the fist evening and also organising the loan of a bike for easier sightseeing around Virginia Beach the following day. Thank You!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing garden, space, and hosts. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect stop during travels to a big event a the Virginia Beach Convention Center. The surrounding water and area is peaceful and walkable but close enough to the beachfront for the best of both worlds. The garden has everything that you would need to relax outdoors in a private setting. Adding this listing to my favorites for my next visit.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet's home was so cozy and had everything we needed. She responded quickly and was flexible at checkout. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely outdoor space — wish we’d had more time to use it. Very friendly and helpful hosts. We got a kick out of the electric fireplace.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The shower head was a bit finicky, came off a few times but the pressure was great. We loved using the bikes, take advantage of that! Especially because they light up, riding on the boardwalk at night was so fun. It's true we came at a great time. Scott was friendly and helpful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little spot was perfect for my wife and I during our vacation! It's perfect for a couple with 1 child, or even without! The space was beautiful, clean, and cozy! The outdoor area was gorgeous as well, even though we got rained out of using it. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Scott's Garden Suite is conveniently located; we were able to walk to the beach on the sidewalks, and it felt safe. Finding the place was a little tricky because we followed our GPS at first, but then we read the welcome message from the host which provided detailed instructions about navigating the neighborhood. When we arrived, we appreciated the clearly labeled designated parking space. There is a beautiful, well-maintained garden that you walk through to go to the Airbnb, just as described - even in October! The Airbnb itself is uniquely decorated without feeling cluttered. We liked the fresh flowers in the vases around the space and the painted wall details in the bathroom."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cozy little garden cottage, perfect for a couple."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"nice spot in a great location! walkable to coffee, food, and the beach, but tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. great directions and communication - and a lovely porch area to hang out in the morning/evening."

When we have to be in the VA Beach area again we will stay if available."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was even better than the listing! It smelled nice, pristine cleanliness. The location is amazing. Scott was friendly and greeted us. Both Scott and Janet communicative via messages. This is one of my favorite air bnbs, highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our weekend beach get away here! The space was exactly as pictured and super cute and cozy. Janet and Scott were the sweetest hosts. We started our trip at the beauty tree spa, which they own, and got the best massages. Janet gave us excellent dinner recommendations and Scott had the fire pit lit for us when we returned. We loved it here and will definitely stay here again on our next beach weekend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay! A beautiful outdoor area, super close to the beach, just what we needed. Thank you! ❤️❤️"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host is so friendly and great, the place is exactly like the photos, which is suitable for a break in the beach. We will back next time."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, private, and as described. Great places to eat within walking distance. Friendly hosts and neighborhood."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet and Scott were amazing hosts! They were very kind and helpful. The Crooked House is a beautiful place to stay in with an amazing outdoor living area. Also a walkable distance from the beach and local restaurants. Would love to stay here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet's place was great! We felt right at home and there were lots of thoughtful little touches. The location was nice and quiet, but easily walkable to the strip and the beach. Highly recommended!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The crooked house is the perfect space for two people. We had an excellent time in VA Beach. Janet and Scott are great hosts! Janet was responsive through the whole booking process and during our stay, which made the place feel like home. It was a quick walk to the beach and many local restaurants. We will certainly be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and really appreciated the snacks and water. We liked having a spot close to everything but just far enough away from the boardwalk area. Overall, a lovely stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is definitely my permanent go-to home whenever I visit the area! I loved it!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fantastic experience. Highly recommend. Very responsive host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Your artsy aunt's guesthouse. This quirky little garden retreat has a surprise around every corner. You arrive through a tunnel cut through willow branches, find a small residence with personal touches from hand-painted walls to bead-lined closet entries to clever space maximiers in the kitchen and beyond. You will spend most of your time in the ""outdoor living room"" topped by a patio that stops most but not all of the rain and over which fly loud yet reassuring Navy jets (""Talk to me, Goose""). This is not a place for people looking for a beige box with stock wall art, or oversized Mediterranean villa with more square footage than taste. If you're looking for a smallish (ok, tiny) artsy-craftsy retreat in a great location adjacent to friendly folks and dogs (hi, Seaweed), this might be the place for you."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet’s and Scott’s little garden hideaway was so comfortable and inviting! We will definitely book again. They were super helpful and responsive and the location is right by the beach and one of my favorite coffee shops, Three Ships. They had a fire going in the fire pit when we returned from our evening out with decorative lights in the garden for a super relaxing spot to unwind for the rest of the evening. The fresh tomato’s from their garden were just the little extra touch that made our breakfast a treat before we left. Highly recommended for your stay in VA beach!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There are no words to describe this wonderful place. From the garden to the whimsical decor to the unseen hosts there readily available and truly accommodating. With little additions like fresh tomatoes on our doorstep to a discount at their spa. If I can’t go back I will send others . Everything had a useful purpose but was an interesting piece of brightness to the eye of thought fir the heart. I can write forever. About this crooked house and it’s owners. A must experience
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the Crooked House. Janet and Scott were so friendly and helpful! They were always responsive to our questions. The space was perfect for our family of three. Very clean and cute! Knowing we had a child with us, they even set up a neat water slide in the front yard and showed us the swing. About 10 min walk to the beach. We loved our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott’s garden was an absolute oasis! The place was quaint with everything we needed for a weekend getaway. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little area
would definitely come again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Janet & Scott are fabulous hosts. Their garden suite is perfect for a little family.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and super cute! Would deff stay there again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time at VB. My friend and I decided if we ever came again, we would rather be a little further from the beach and stay at Janet and Scotts, than be in a hotel right on the beach. It was a beautiful spot and Janet and Scott were amazing. Definitely recommend!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place for a couple, or a family of 3 like us. The beds were comfortable and everything necessary was there. Definitely recommended."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was fantastic! Everything in the suite was decorated well, simple, and super clean. The surroundings are relaxing and beautiful. We only wish we could have stayed longer. We used the bikes to ride the boardwalk which was close and fun. Our hosts have thought of everything. We will be back again for work travel and relaxation."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying with Janet and Scott. They are absolutely amazing hosts. We always feel so welcomed when we come. The bikes are a huge plus and something we look forward to every time we come. We had the opportunity to visit the spa they own as well, and again, they always pay such close attention to detail and care about their visitors’ experience. I highly highly recommend this airbnb. We will definitely be back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is such a cute little place and it’s right near a lot of popular attractions Va beach has to offer. Only about 5 minutes from the beach! It was super clean and everyone was super friendly! Definitely a great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After struggling to find a hotel for hours The Crooked House saved me and my boyfriends' vacation!
The home was utterly beautiful- exceptionally clean and all the rules were clear and concise!
I reccomended this location for anyone looking to spend a night or few in VA beach!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet and Scott were both AMAZING hosts who did not miss any details for a spectacular get away. They give so much to their guests and take so much pride in their beautiful home and it shows through and through. I would not be able to recommend them enough to anyone traveling the area it is a class above all and cannot thank them enough for allowing us to be able to book there. HIGHLY recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for my mom and I to enjoy a weekend at the beach! The space was so comfortable and cozy, and the garden was beautiful!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super convenient location to the beach and the cutest space! It was well taken care of, clean, and exactly what we had hoped for."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here. The flowers and plants were beautiful. The inside was nicely decorated and had all of the amenities we needed and more. We got to meet their dog, super sweet pup. The owners gave very detailed instructions, but i always second guess myself...they came out and showed us exactly where to go. FYI the single bed is not for a super tall person unless you dont lay streched out, but it was super comfortable. Very lovely place and very nice people. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, and very nice and responsive host. Would definitely come back and recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet was a very friendly, responsive and helpful host, giving clear and concise instructions for everything. Their backyard is a beautiful place to relax.

We would definitely love to stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay! The place is as it appears in photos and super clean. Also loved that we could use the bikes to get around!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful area and the home has a homey feel to it that just makes you not want to leave.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was super cute, comfortable and cozy. We enjoyed the indoor and outdoor space very much. The private outdoor living room with fire table, the gardens and the outdoor fire pit was amazing. The host supplied firewood each evening! Janet pays attention to details and assures you are comfortable. We had a great time!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great outside patio seating with propane fire pit. Located on a quiet side street. Beautiful flowers. Small bed needs a privacy curtain or door. Does not have an indoor living room/couch so that is the trade off for having the outside seating.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage is located in a quiet corner, very close to the beach, and has a great seafood restaurant nearby.The cottage has a beautiful garden and is comfortable to sit and chat over tea in the evening. The landlord has a super cute dog Seaweed, and we love it very much."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely stay here again- a beautiful private little spot with an amazing garden. Every night I came back, the fire was on for me. Janet was super responsive and helpful. Even got a massage from her spa and it was fantastic!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a wonderful few days in this space! The beds were comfortable, the space was clean, and we enjoyed the additional touches that made it feel special (snacks, games, beautiful outdoor space). A short walk (10-15 minutes) to the beach. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Way way better than staying at a hotel! There was a nice attention to detail making it feel just a bit extra. The location is just a few minutes walk from the boardwalk and lots of restaurant choices. Pleasant neighborhood next to a small lake. For the most part it was quiet but fighter jets fly low overhead all hours of the day and night. If you are sensitive to noise I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The backyard is even prettier in person.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay and would book again in a heartbeat!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott’s Cottage was perfect for my stay with my daughter. Super cute cottage with thoughtful amenities including snacks, robes and games. Janet was communicative and responsive. Would definitely return. Thanks for the wonderful stay!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place! Lovely inside and out with great location. We especially loved the backyard oasis.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great hospitality, allowed us to borrow bikes to make our way to the beach and around the neighborhood which saved us gas and gave us a nice bike ride to check out cool stores and spots in the area. Lit us a firepit, although the weather did not allow for it. An overall nice secluded place, great homebase for exploring the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay was extremely welcoming, and it felt very family oriented. The house itself was immaculate, appointed perfectly, and the outdoor space was an absolute oasis! We were also obsessed with their dog Seaweed- such a sweet, loving, and well-behaved pup! The location was fantastic- close to the beach and boardwalk, as well as the aquarium, restaurants, etc. I can’t think of an area for improvement. We absolutely loved our time there. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful alternative to the hotel scene. We were in town for a wrestling tournament. While we did not walk to the convention center, it was definitely within walking distance. Enjoyed the stay. Would highly recommend."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cozy nice space! I wish the weather was warmer to enjoy the nice surroundings. It is a great location not that far from the beach indeed.
A little tricky to find the back of the house, but not that difficult once you read Janet's instructions. Once you get to the back, everything is easily marked for you, nice easy access.
When the warmth and the sunshine come back, I would love to come back to this house as well!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,From the parking spot to the complimentary drinks and snacks. I really liked this home!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable little place. Would like to go back when the weather is better and the garden is blooming. I’m sure it’s beautiful.

I can’t recommend this stay enough."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I stayed for a Christmas getaway and had a fantastic time. Janet understood our late arrival because our train was delayed for 5 hours. She welcomed us with a warm and homey suite once we came in at was very welcoming. We hope to visit again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A private tiny home that may be a little difficult to find. But, it's a jewel once found"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy and very close to the beach and cute shops. It was freezing outside the night we checked in and when we arrived the electric fireplace was on for us. Truly appreciated it and a very nice touch!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and great hosts! Super responsive!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely stay, even though we were only there a few hours. Would love to book again and stay longer!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Scott’s Garden! The best location of the places we’ve stayed in the area—a short walk from the VIBE district which is filled with great restaurants and coffee shops. Less than a 15-minute walk to the oceanfront, too. The guest house itself was perfect. Nicely decorated, very clean, with thoughtful touches like filtered water and snacks in the fridge. There’s even a patio and electric bonfire for guest use, which was a lovely touch (although we sadly didn’t have time during a family wedding weekend to use it). We appreciated that the place came with a parking spot, too! We would love to stay here again. Thanks, Janet!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet place was great and we would definitely stay there again!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott and Janet’s little getaway is wonderful. We wish we could have stayed longer. The garden is absolutely beautiful. They are both very nice. The inside of the Airbnb was thoughtfully decorated. We felt right at home. The outside living room was great. I would totally stay again if I ever have the chance! Thank you!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is what I want in an Airbnb experience. The atmosphere, the location, and the privacy provided are top tier. The hosts are experts in their craft of providing a warm environment for you to enjoy your stay in. The outdoor living room with the fire pit and hammock is just perfection. Should I ever be back in the area, I'll be sure to come back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very homie and private. The outdoor garden was very nice and Janet was a great host.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janet’s place was awesome! Scott was very kind and accommodating and Seaweed was a cute dog. I can’t wait to book this place again! It was perfect for three people.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay here! Janet was amazing, very communicative and helpful, and had thought of everything with how the cottage was appointed. It was comfortable, cozy, decorated beautifully, clean, and the perfect getaway spot! Super cute yard as well!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a lovely little space that was perfect for my girlfriend and me to spend the weekend. Very clean and the hosts were super helpful during our stay. The power actually went out in the neighborhood on our first night and within minutes there was a knock at our door offering us lanterns and candles which we really apprecieated.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janet is a great host and extremely accommodating. Her rental is cozy and well equipped.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was very beautiful and relaxing. The Host also was very kind and accommodating to our needs. They are wonderful~

Thank you so much for a satisfying stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful and simply adorable, close to beach and restaurants. Very clean and better than pictures. I can’t enough good things! Hope to come back soon!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet and Scott were the best hosts we could’ve asked for. They accommodated us in every way. The space itself was cozy and beautiful. They even went the extra mile with offering water/tea/coffee and snacks. We loved the location and how close it was to everywhere! We would definitely come back!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a perfect little getaway for me and my two boys. The place was immaculate and exactly as described, and the beach was just a short walk away. We appreciated all the small touches which really made it feel like home. Hope to return again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here and wish we could have stayed longer! The hosts are so communicative, nice, and helpful. The place itself is so charming and it is so close to everything…walking distance to the beach and lots of restaurants/shops. Such a wonderful experience and I hope to be back again one day!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had such a wonderful time staying at the Crooked House guest suite! The suite is beautifully decorated and thoughtfully arranged, it instantly felt like a home away from home. The gorgeous backyard is a cozy outdoor oasis and as others have commented resident pup Seaweed is the sweetest bonus! Walking/biking distance to great food and the beach. Whenever we vacation at VA beach this is where I will look to stay! Thank you for a lovely stay, Janet and Scott :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"HANDS DOWN! One of the top airbnbs I have ever stayed. Janet and Scott are amazing. They are so thoughtful and accommodating. I have never had such attentive hosts before, and it was a dream. Also, Seaweed is the cutest pup in town. The bikes were a HUGE plus and made the trip that even more nostalgic. The location is another plus, perfect distance to walk to the boardwalk and also have a quiet night. The patio is so peaceful and inviting. If you are coming to VA Beach, you have to stay here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Hosts were easy going and easy to reach. Great spot in terms of small businesses in the arts district and distance to the beach. The garden and cottage are beautiful. Way better value than a hotel room!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at Scotts Garden Suite. It was just as great as the first time! Scott and Janet are great hosts that make sure you are taken care of.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect little suite for our quick trip! Thank you!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay, ten minutes from the beach and we appreciated the kid friendly amenities."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place! Scott and Janet were great hosts. Great communication and so helpful! I know other review mention the size of the second bed but we did have a dull grown adult sleep in it fine, it was just a close fit but very comfortable! I would recommend this to anyone!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The AirBnB was close to the beach. The room was a perfect size and the host had all the ammenties available. Loved the decor of the rooms. It was truly a great get away and great location! We had a great time.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janet’s place is in such a great location. Sooo close to the beach and oceanfront restaurants. The home offers a great little space for what we needed. Honestly bigger then we expected and the bathroom was very spacious. It’s great for a couple and 1 child or in our case 3 ladies. The outdoor seating area is really so cute, wish it wasn’t so hot this week so we could have used it more. The neighborhood is very quiet with the exception of the occasional military planes flying over head. Janet is so considerate with the amenities inside the home from a keurig, air fryer, electric pan, beverages and even full size protein bars/snacks in the fridge upon arrival. Such an adorable place to stay and the pup seaweed was a fun bonus!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet and Scott’s place is so great! The backyard pictures do not do it justice! We ate breakfast outside just to enjoy the garden! We took the bikes out one morning for a spin and it was so easy to get to the beach. Scott and Janet were so responsive and communicative. Would definitely stay again! Like some other reviews said the second bed is definitely best for a child but a small adult who doesn’t want to starfish would fit well! Can’t wait to come back here and spend more time with seaweed too!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and we’re very comfortable having three of us for our stay. The house was clean and the amenities were more than we expected. The beach was only 1/2 a mile walk from the house. We highly recommend a stay at this beautiful Airbnb.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hosts were very accommodating and made sure we were well taken care of while also providing restaurant recommendations. The sleep was comfortable and overall a cozy little getaway!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was simply perfect. Although it looks cute online, the pictures don’t seem to do it justice! Love this little spot with the beautiful garden. It was a close spot to the beach. Janet and Scott were excellent hosts and responded very quickly to any request. We used the bikes they have available and Scott gave us advice on a cool spot to ride to. Seaweed (their dog) was a cutie too! Thanks so much! We only stayed one night, but we will definitely be back if we are ever in the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect place to stay if you are visiting Virginia Beach. It’s close enough to the beach that you can walk, but far enough to where you aren’t in traffic all the time and gives you space to relax. The hosts were quick to respond and were very pleasant.
My 4 year olds review: “This is the prettiest house eber! Look at it, it’s got a real microwave” 😊"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the most wonderful time and Janet and Scott had great recommendations for restaurants as well! I highly recommend a spa treatment as well! It was amazing!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Comfortable place and great host
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Scott’s Garden Suite is in a great location and was very clean and inviting. I was traveling with a coworker and she found the second bedroom, which is in a small nook area, to be cramped. She’s 5’3 and said she kept bumping into the wall during the night. I would stay here again as long as I could have the bigger bed again, but she definitely would not. It would be perfect for a couple with a child. Other than that, this space is top notch."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Nice amenities. Quick communication. Very nice people.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved everything about our stay! 10 min walk to the beach, clean and very welcoming. The garden is beautiful and the outdoor patio was a nice area to relax, especially at night!
Thanks Janet & Scott"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the garden and just chilling in that space outside. Being able to borrow and use the bikes to head to the boardwalk and nearby restaurants made the location even more accessible than it already was. We appreciated the reserved parking spot just for us as well.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host, Definitely recommend her. Cozy area with great amenities. The common area is a plus.
Host is wonderful and very respectful"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 so so happy we found this little gem it was perfect for my husband and I for our honeymoon Janet was so responsive and answered all our questions they even surprised us with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne since it was our honeymoon. Beach super close about a 10 min walk really happy and would stay again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have nothing but lovely things to say about Janet and Scott as hosts and their cozy, comfy, convenient beach-town cabin. The place is great and very close to everything. But more importantly, Janet and Scott went out of their way to make sure I felt welcome. I look forward to returning. Also, make sure to save some time during the trip to get pampered at their spa—The Beauty Tree. Totally worth it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful accommodations...the location, vibe and decor were perfect. We would definitely stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful rental! Loved the attention to detail and cleanliness. The thoughtful complimentary items were a very nice touch and very appreciated. I'd definitely stay here again and highly recommend.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful spot. Walking into the garden was absolutely breathtaking. I highly recommend a stay here. It is a cozy quaint neighborhood and you can explore the beach close by or drive to other beaches. I loved all of the murals and trying new restaurants. Janet and Scott are incredible hosts and make you feel right at home. Seaweed is also the cutest dog and loves attention. Can't wait to come back.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I loved our experience at Janet and Scott’s place! You can tell they put so much effort in making the nook a cozy, clean, and welcoming place to stay. The outdoor garden was beautiful and a perfect place to hangout and with their dog, Seaweed, when he comes out to say hi. There are many restaurants, and shops that are walking distance to the beach. Great stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of my best Airbnb stays! The patio is top notch, and the hosts are very thoughtful (+ have an amazing dog!) and communicative. Would definitely recommend to a friend, as well as come back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay amazing people
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying at Scott's garden was truly an experience. The space was perfect for our small family. The decor was indeed as charming as others say it is, and the outside patio space with the garden was very tranquil. Janet and Scott are very friendly awesome hosts as well as their dog seaweed. If we were to return to VA beach we would definitely consider staying here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I loved the place! It's within walking distance to the beach, the area is quiet and the hosts are very friendly and helpful. The airbnb was very clean, cute and cozy. It's very small, definitely not for more than two people. There is no door on the small bedroom which was a little odd and didn't provide much privacy. But other than that it's a nice place at a great price!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the BEST Airbnb I have ever stayed at. Janet's place was spotless, and she literally thought of everything we might need. The ""nook"" was so cozy, and my favorite part! My mom and I loved our (very brief) stay, and we would totally stay there again next time we are in the area.....hopefully for longer!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This location awesome and was located close enough to our planned activities for the day. the garden was gorgeous and it was nice to get some sunshine and rest on the hammock.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was great. Scott, Janet and seaweed are very welcoming :-) Place was very cute, clean, close to the beach and great restaurants. We really enjoyed staying at this airbnb."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect mix of safe happy super comfortable neighborhood vibes— just blocks from the beach and restaurants and music. The VIBE art district— especially the food— amazing!! Janet is a supreme hostess— the details of the suite were fabulous and we got to go to her spa for facials and massages— highly recommended!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janet was great! Really clean and cozy.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet’s place is simply adorable! It’s the perfect size for a couple’s getaway for a night or two, or for a small family. The small bedroom is a cute little space - perfect for a young child or a tween. The kitchen is small, but stocked with small electrical appliances should you want to cook. The location is delightful - and we just loved it. So much so, we’ve stayed there twice! 😀💕"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay! Such a cute and quaint place to stay on and it was just enough space for our weekend girls trip!
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place just a few blocks from the beach. The Naval Air Station is close by and jets were taking off and landing all day, which can be quite loud. Otherwise very clean and easy to find. Would definitely stay again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and cozy space steps to nice coffee shops, restaurants, and a brewery close to the Vibe district. It's also a short walk to the beach. Outdoor space with fire in the evening is very relaxing. It's a very clean apartment with everything we needed for our time there. Janet, Scott, and Seaweed are great hosts!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A small space with lots of character that was great for the 3 of us. It is just a short walk over to the beach. Given the cooler March weather we especially enjoyed evenings on the outdoor patio with a fire.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This airbnb was amazing! It was very clean & is located in a nice quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay .
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location was spectacular! Also, what a comfortable and clean home! 'Twas infinitely better than a hotel stay! We enjoyed the fire in the outdoor living room and felt at ease the whole time! 11/10 will stay here again soon!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and cozy! This space has a perfect location, is in a nice neighborhood, and is within walking distance of the beach. I am 5'6"" and fit comfortably in the single bed. The space was very clean and well equipped."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, cozy, accommodating and responsive. Close to beach and in a nice neighborhood and overall location. Would stay here again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful spot. The outdoor patio was amazing - rocking away on the glider even in cold weather was wonderful. No real living room but the layout is beautifully set up if you're on your own, or as part of a couple. Tons of little touches made it a wonderful spot - coffee, cream and sugar, as well as a few snacks in the fridge, wonderfully comfortable bed, great reading lamps... an amazing find!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have been on the road for over a month, and this was one of the cleanest and most comfortable Airbnb's on our trip. Our stay at the Crooked House was exactly what we needed right at this moment of the trip - uncomplicated comfort and relaxation. The bed was amazing, and did I mention how clean it was! The outdoor sitting area was absolutely lovely. The location is great - everything is within walking distance and there are some great restaurants and eateries just down the street. We don't have a lot of reasons to come back to Virginia Beach, but we might just do that so we can stay at Janet's place again! 5 star+"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay here! Scott was very welcoming and friendly and we loved meeting their dog. It was such an adorable little place and very clean and well maintained.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for our girls’ getaway! The hosts were very thoughtful and provided a great comfortable cozy place to stay. It was very quiet and great place to get away to.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, conveniently located, check-in/out was easy and frictionless, communication was stellar. It's always such a pleasure to stay in an AirBnB where the host is communicative and has clearly considered everything you might need. The snacks and drinks in the fridge are such a lovely touch and much appreciated. Would stay here again for sure."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is such an adorable place to stay - perfect for a couple or a small family! Thoughtful touches abound, and the organic skin care and shampoo / conditioner / body wash were divine!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Crooked House was perfect for our family of three! Janet and Scott (and Seaweed, the dog) are amazing hosts. They have added a whole slew of extra touches and treats to what is already a very sweet space and outdoor garden/courtyard. We had a wonderful stay! Super close to the beach and all the Vibe Arts District has to offer. We cannot recommend this AirBnB highly enough!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in town for a collegiate 🏑 tournament and this was the perfect place for our group. Everything was spotless, parking was easy, and had everything we needed. The bedroom on the 3rd floor came in handy when my daughter and her friend needed a place to crash after checking into a disastrous hotel room. Thank you for your great communication."
2024-04-01,4.0,Group trip,"It was a wonderful stay as we were a family attending a wedding. So beautiful, clean, walkable, close to everything. It was noisy at night in the front of the house bedroom. This can’t be helped due to the proximity of the thoroughfare outside. This would be an issue unless you are heavy sleepers. Various snacks were such a welcome and extra touch. Thank you so much!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kara's place was lovely, we would highly recommend choosing this house. Very comfortable and clean; living spaces and bedrooms, felt right at home!
Kara was a pleasure to communicate with, very responsive. You will not be disappointed renting here!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Place is clean and beautiful and honestly looks better than the photos. Had everything we needed especially when it came to cooking. Host was helpful and responsive. :)
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kara and Jessi were incredibly responsive. The home was amazing and spacious. We were able to quickly coordinate on check-in and check out times that were fluid because of our kids sporting activity in the area. it was nice to have a quiet, clean place to hang out in between activities. We even made a wonderful home-cooked meal with all of the equipment in the kitchen."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was great! Comfortable beds and the kitchen was great and even had Tupperware!
Kara was very responsive to anything we needed."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for our trip to visit family and friends! We literally never even used the third floor which would have been perfect for teenagers or young adults!!!! The third floor has a separate entertainment area plus room and bathroom. I have already recommended it to other travelers I know!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was incredible, and we loved it so much. Kara was very responsive and helpful. We would absolutely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"absolutely wonderful location! 15 mins from work, minutes away from the beach front, and amazing local restaurants within walking distance!

I definitely recommend staying here and will be doing so again in the future!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was beautiful, easy walk to the beach and had everything we needed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Phenomenal. Pet friendly and easy access to beach. Well stocked kitchen and comfortable beds and furnishings. Very responsive to minor requests, especially a late evening smoke alarm battery too high for my reach. Will definitely return."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot! Perfect location, beautiful spacious home. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great place to host Thanksgiving with family from across the country!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautiful new townhouse -- a short walk from coffee shops, restaurants, and the beach. In warmer weather, we would have enjoyed spending time on the back patio and 2nd story deck."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kara’s home was so beautiful !! The first look of the house was amazing. It didn’t seem big on the outside looking in, but once I saw inside the house it was HUGE ! Very clean and had such a cozy and homey feel. I would highly recommend bringing your family there ! I definitely had no issues with my stay and any questions I asked Kara answered immediately. This was a lovely home, I for sure plan on coming back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lots and lots of space, had everything we needed for dining in or heading to the beach! Very convenient parking and access to everything on the boardwalk."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was great! Close to the beach in walking distance and close to many restaurants. Everything was clean and organized when we arrived and there was plenty of space for our whole group. If you have more than two cars, you will need to find additional parking so just be aware of that. Would recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is exactly as described. Modern home with all the amenities needed for a family or friend get together. We used the entire home including the Simpson arcade game which was a nice touch for the kids. Came here for our first annual trip with the kids and had a wonderful time. Clean, spacious and had most amenities such as shampoo, conditioner and soap etc like a hotel which was wonderful for us. It is about 5 blocks or so to the beach so definitely walkable and they did provide two parking spaces. My favorite part was that the house was nice and cool even on top which sometimes is a hit or miss. Would definitely recommend to book again but this time with friends! Thank you to Kara and Jessi for responding so quickly."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great stay here!! Super close to the beach (about a 7 min walk), comfortable/clean home, good amenities. Great memories for our family."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is spacious and comfortable. It is perfect for a family getaway/gathering. It is centrally located to get to downtown and beach locations without being wedged into the busy and noisy boardwalk life. The neighborhood is peaceful and clean.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great and spacious.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Kara’s place is really beautifully decorated. It is spacious and in a great location. Checking in and out was easy. With taxes and cleaning fee it ended up being pretty pricey in my opinion but that may be bc it was also BA beach in July when I booked it. Overall we had a wonderful stay and I would book with her again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kara and Jessi are wonderful. They accommodating and very quick to respond to any questions. Considerate with our checkout which was extremely helpful. The space was very clean ,spacious and had all of the necessities for an overnight stay with my whole family. Highly recommended and would surely book this place the next time we will visit Virginia."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kara’s place was easy to get to and in a convenient part of town. We enjoyed being able to have a short walk to beach and mini golf. The house is spacious and she provided great amenities (shampoo, soap, detergent, towels, linens, etc). Beds were very comfortable. Kitchen setup made it very convenient for us to have coffee and prep meals. Our family was very comfortable staying here.
Kara and Jessi were always just a short message away if we had questions or needed anything.
The house is on a main road, so during the weekend there is a lot of traffic making it noisy for the bedroom facing the front late at night. But that did get better during the weekdays.
This was our first trip to VA Beach and we enjoyed our stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful property and an end unit. Tastefully furnished and the bedroom spread was great for four couples. We were able to gather in the open concept downstairs but have privacy, when it was time to turn in. A quick 10 minute walk to several eateries. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay! Everything was very easy! I felt the cost with fees was higher than expected, but worth it to not have to worry about the pets or stripping the beds, etc. Would stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home! Modern, clean and so beautifully decorated! Our host Kara responded very quickly if we had any questions. Virginia Beach was beautiful and relaxing. Only regret is that we didn’t stay longer! We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had a wonderful time at this home filled with a lots of good memories during our stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My stay at Kara and Jessi's Airbnb was nothing short of exceptional. The well-kept and fully equipped property, coupled with its perfect location near the beach, made it an absolute gem. The convenient parking, tasteful decor, and welcoming atmosphere made me feel right at home. I wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb and cannot wait to return for another unforgettable stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house in a great location. The host was extremely helpful, highly recommend this place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great home- 4 bedroom, 3.5 bath about 4-5 blocks from the boardwalk. It is very walkable to the beach as well as restaurants. The kitchen is well stocked and we felt very safe here. The home is a 3 level home. It was nice to sit outside on the front and back porch when we weren’t at the beach. The beds were comfortable and it was clean. We found extra towels and linens as needed! Plenty of hot water. We had a few hiccups (code didn’t work at check in, wifi was out, couldn’t locate pack n play) but Kara, our host, was quickly responsive and very helpful. She resolved our issues almost immediately! My only con to this house is that it is located right off a busy road (22nd st) so it is very loud when sleeping at night due to sirens and loud engines, but sound machines were helpful. Other than that, would highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,loved the home! & loved the neighborhood! great for family trips!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thanks Kara, for you help and it was really nice meeting you! I appreciate you being flexible and allowing us to check in a bit early. Everything was exactly as described and that was comforting to know being my first time booking and staying at an AirBnB."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was great! Lots of room for everyone, a nice living room and kitchen space, bedrooms all had comfortable beds. Definitely worth it for the price! Would recommend"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This crew was very responsive and helpful when trying to coordinate our arrival. They were very positive and friendly.
The place was beautiful. Three crisp and clean floors of a truly inviting home.
Plenty of parking, within walking distance to great coffee shops, restaurants and the beach. Really a great location.
Couldn’t have asked for a better experience for our special occasion."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was just as beautiful as the pictures! Rooms where great . All the bedrooms where nice and had bathrooms. I stayed in the master bedroom and loved walking out and sitting on the balcony from the bedroom. The front and back porches were nice to sit out there and enjoy a cup of coffee. The best part was the close walk to the beach. Kara was a great host who checked in on us to ensure we had made it in smoothly! I definitely would recommend staying here for your stay in Virginia Beach.
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Beautiful, clean place for two families to stay. Perfect for what we needed it for."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice clean space, lots of steps and the bedrooms are split on the 2nd and 3rd floor.
Don’t book this place if you think there’s going to be any change to your trip, host was not helpful in accommodating unexpected changes."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home! Close to the beach, about a 5 minute walk. House was very clean and spacious. Quiet neighborhood. Host was responsive to questions/requests. Would love to stay here again. Thank you for the experience!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I loved the house. It was clean and very nice.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this location. Traveled with a family of six. The house was immaculate, excellent bedroom layouts and size. Easy walk to the beach and grocery store. Will absolutely look for this rental when we come back to the area."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Kara’s place was walkable to the boardwalk and provided lots to do. The home was clean and I loved the thoughtfulness of the amenities to include the organic detergent and hand soap! The home is beautiful. My only complaints are the sound of the traffic (which is to be expected being so close to attractions) and the smell of the carpet while lying down in the bed. The home is near the beach and I’m sure may contribute to the smell of mold/mildew. There were no curtains in the master bedroom upon our arrival and the microwave went out on the last day however Kara was very responsive to fixing both issues.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful. Kara was very responsive at all times. Made me feel right at home. Will book again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a lovely spot—lots of nature, warm and responsive hosts, very close to Cape Charles. I highly recommend if you appreciate the opportunity to stay in a well-maintained and welcoming space that is unto itself but very close to both town (Cape Charles) and park (Kiptopeke)."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful location away from the city. Loved the night stay! Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful, beautiful private getaway for the weekend. The ducks like to hang out by the lake, there are turtles that pop their head out of the water occasionally, saw a couple different types of frogs. The walking trails were awesome. They smelled like the freshest flowers you could imagine. Did I mention it was peaceful? The orchards & gardens also beautiful. My boyfriend & is really enjoyed our stay here & will definitely be back."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Arlington Farm, and Naomi and her family, are just lovely. From the moment we drove down the long road to the heart of the property, Buddy the dog and Farmer Paul gave us a warm welcome and showed us to the cabin. The place looks just like the photos, and though small is extremely well equipped and lovingly furnished. Highlights of our stay included walking around the farm’s extensive trails during the day and enjoying the fire pit in the evening. This place is my Happy Place. Loved seeing Naomi’s shop in town, too. Fantastic wares; even better mission. Thank you for everything!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We didn’t want to leave and missed it when we left ❤️ the most beautiful property and such friendly and nice people. Truly their own little slice of heaven. friendly farm animals, active wildlife, peaceful surroundings, walking trails, beautiful blooming flowers, luscious garden. Great location in proximity to Cape Charles. I don’t like to visit the same place twice but we definitely will be back!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing as always! Hosts are lovely and we always love seeing the animals and Buddy :)
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Naomi’s cabin is quite the weekend getaway! We were welcomed warmly and found the cabin and walking trails to exactly what we wanted. The cabin has a great front porch to watch the sun rise over the farm and great afternoon sun on the back porch and in the cabin. We’d definitely love to visit again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely lovely
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful and beautiful!!! I have stayed in numerous Airbnb’s and this is one of my favorites. Having the pond and birds right off the deck along with a cozy, clean, and comfortable inside made this cabin a five star stay! I hope to return!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for 2 nights. Place was cute and easy to find. Gentleman that greeted us was nice. View from the bed was nice to wake up to. The description of the home stated privacy which we did not fully have. One of the days there were other visitors on the farm who were walking through the trails that the back porch looks out at and they were looking and watching us through the windows. All in all it was a cute place and Buddy the dog was the best. They did a great job at creating a cute home, I would just liked a little bit more privacy away from others."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place with my 2 kids, 8 and 10! Love all the animals and nature around."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved this little cabin. Everything was clean and nice. They were very respectful and nice. Overall an amazing time and I will be back again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed here with my best friend on a girl’s trip. It was PERFECT! The hosts were so nice and friendly, and the place was so cute and quaint. We loved sitting on the back deck listening to the frogs at night and seeing all the animals on the farm (including our guide dog host, buddy!). The cabin was so homey that I plan on coming back in the summer to stay! Even though it’s secluded, you never felt unsafe or anything!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a peaceful and restful stay. We felt one with nature and enjoyed the extensive walking paths through the woods, and the goats, chickens, ducks, and especially Buddy the dog. The fresh eggs were delightful!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is truly a magical sweet space. The natural surroundings and the animals were so lovely and I could have laid in the loft bed and watched the trees sway in the wind and the ducks float by for hours. It was also only a short drive to the town with a grocery store and gas stations only a quick drive as well. Highly recommend this spot, and hope to visit again soon!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a peaceful, relaxing place to stay and unwind. I loved hanging out in the reading nook, watching the ducks swim around the pond, and listening to music on the record player. There were many trails to walk around the farm and enjoy nature. Buddy the dog was the sweetest, greeting me as soon as I pulled up. Perfect place for a solo or couples getaway!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've visited plenty of airbnbs and this one was one of the best. The cabin is super charming but that's just the beginning, the whole property and atmosphere is awesome. Paul was the most welcoming host we've ever had, spent a lot of time showing us around the walking trails, the gardens, the orchards, the animals, the beehives, etc. with his golf cart. Enjoyed the sound of ducks and hens as a background noise for our morning coffee while staring at the little lake. We will definitely come back next year with our little daughters, I'm sure they'll enjoy the farm vibes."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had the best one night getaway. Host were amazing. Our daughter had so much fun exploring the farm and watching the ducks swim by the house. Easy drive to Cape Charles. Can only recommend.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time and the cabin was beautiful. It was clean, peaceful and just what we were looking for. The farm was fun, and everyone was so friendly. It’s just a short drive to downtown Cape Charles and they provided lots of great recommendations."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had an girls getaway and it was absolutely lovely. Naomi was always available with information. and Paul was always there to help us and was a wonderful person to get to know thank you for giving us such a special time. It was the first time we had seen each other in over 40 years and your place was the perfect place to spend time, laughing and sharing old stories, and I personally fell in love with Buddy.."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend get away! We enjoyed the peaceful area. Would definitely stay again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was very nice and clean. Our dog had a blast as well.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,First time traveling long distance with my pup. We were looking for something different. Outdoorsy. I made the reservation a few hours before we hit Cape Charles. Naomi responded and accepted within an hour. We enjoyed the beautiful cabin and trails. We were greeted by Paul and Buddy the farm dog. Buddy and my pup got to roam trails. He was a great addition to our stay he even slept out on the porch to keep an eye on the wildlife. I enjoyed the birds in the pond and the Victrola with great selection of vinyl. The bathroom was clean and hot water was a bonus. This was my first time booking abnb so I learned about cleaning fees and taxes so it was a bit pricey for me but I'm glad I did it we deserved a treat. It's perfect spot to enjoy quiet and listen to nature and the farm animals. Nothing like sitting on a porch with a hot cup of tea in February. I love the simple basic kitchen. Thank you so much. If we ever end up in area I would totally stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Serene, beautiful, and comfortable! Perfect escape for the weekend! LOVE the loft windows and private deck :) Can’t wait to visit again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The farm stay was deeply tranquil- just the ticket! Paul was a very gracious host and Buddy was so kind and welcoming to my own dog. The walking trails throughout the property are idyllic and peaceful- and the cabin space was perfect for some creative writing/reset time while listening to records. The town of Cape Charles is also not to be missed- especially Deadrise Pizza (seriously good). Thank you for a lovely stay- I will definitely be back to such a special spot!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful, great property, lots of walking trails, loved the farm animals, and the cabin is adorable. Loft bedroom with the view out over pond is cool feature, and very peaceful, got a great night sleep. A true gem of a place."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were supposed to only book the airstream but with Naomi’s recommendation we decided to add the cabin too. It was the best decision as we were able to experience both places during our stay, they are walkable so it’s easy to go back and forth. This cabin is facing a pond where the ducks are and watching them is really entertaining. Other farm animals especially the chickens go in this area as well in the morning.
The cabin is small but has a good sized shower area and the bedroom in the 2nd floor doesn’t feel claustrophobic. There’s much sunlight that comes through the cabin which makes it brighter. Paul and Narelle made sure we are comfortable. Buddy the farm dog is the best and most adorable. Location is also about 12-15min drive to restaurants or main street/downtown.
We are coming back for sure! :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a fantastic little property outside of Cape Charles. It's a tiny home on a lovely little pond in a super cool little farm. The goats, chickens, ducks, turkeys, and the dog Buddy greeted us every morning and evening and we're great hosts. The property is very well kept with a fun maze of trails cut out from the surrounding woods. Buddy will take you on a tour while you're having your morning coffee. It's and easy 10 min drive to the restaurants and shops in cape charles. We're definitely coming back here. Make sure to read the description before booking. It can accommodate a small family but it is a tiny home and the ladder to the loft is steep. But it's very well appointed and super cozy and cute. All and all one of the best Air B and B experiences I have had."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The cabin was wonderful, and its location was perfect. We loved seeing the animals on the farm and got to enjoy a nice walk with the farm pup!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was wonderful! The cabin was beautiful, cozy, and very peaceful. We brought our dog who can be reactive with some dogs but we were able to bring him for walks without worry. Buddy the dog was around during our check in but otherwise was doing his farm duties."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Naomi’s little cottage!! Truly one of the nicest, most well-appointed AirBnBs we’ve stayed anywhere! It was clean, tastefully designed, and peaceful. There’s not much to do in Cape Charles, but if you’re looking for a relaxing, quiet getaway for a few days - this is the perfect place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I booked Naomi’s place for some business Visioning strategic planning, and it was the perfect choice! We were able to get out of our normal environment and expand our perspectives in this great, unique spot :) Super friendly and responsive host! Highly recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage was a perfect overnight escape. It was cozy and private. The space was clean and inviting. The hosts were responsive and Paul did a great job of making sure all our questions about the property were answered. Especially enjoyed the farm animals, ducks, and Buddy the dog was a perfect gentleman escorting us around the grounds."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"this was by far our favourite stay ever! Naomi’s home is so quaint and lovely and we immediately felt right at home. we were greeted by Buddy the dog and Paul who were the coolest hosts we could ask for! Waking up to roosters and goats on the front porch was so fun and we enjoyed the vinyls & tea too. we were pleasantly surprised with how spacious the loft was, while still feeling cozy and comfortable. the views from the cabin and the entire property are so beautiful and refreshing. we even extended our stay we enjoyed it so much! would highly recommend :) thanks Naomi & Paul!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at this adorable little cabin! Just what we needed for a weekend getaway. Cape Charles at the holidays was amazing. Our dogs loved having Buddy show us all around the property. We will definitely make it back here again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay, very peaceful and Naomi was very friendly and responsive to any and all questions. Wonderful stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was an amazing experience and stay! Beautiful place, super peaceful! We went for a walk and met Paul, he was very nice and introduced us to all of the goats and even let us feed them! Buddy, the dog, was a super nice host and companion!! We will absolutely be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Charming, peaceful and cozy spot. Wish we had had more time to enjoy it!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our weekend in the cabin! The farm is a beautiful property to get away. We especially enjoyed seeing all of the animals and getting to feed the ducks.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved our stay here. Very quiet place with plenty of walking trails outside your front door. Very close to Cape Charles for dinner and shops. We will be staying here again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small interior space, no real kitchen, steep ladder to sleeping loft, so not for everybody. But a unique stay in the woods at the edge of a working farm with great hosts. We really enjoyed it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a relaxing stay & just what we were looking for. Very helpful staff, and the cabin was clean. Awesome recommendations, and was just 15 minutes from downtown. Will definitely book again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stayed here for a two nights and were SO impressed. Rarely have we booked an Airbnb that has blown us away - but wow. The farm is adorable, with goats and chickens running around; Buddy the farm dog too. Check in was simple. The cabin was secluded from the rest of the farm and peaceful, with two sweet ducks that we were able to feed from the front deck. The interior is impeccable! And so, so clean. The sheets were comfy. The design of the cabin is well thought out. Tiny details like plugs on both sides of the bed and a light switch by the bed for easy shut-off. Great curtains for privacy when needed. We just loved sitting by candle light at the end of the night in such a cozy/stylish space. Thank you for sharing it :)
Oh we also had our two small dogs with us and they loved it too. No issues at all. They loved saying “hi” to Buddy when he was roaming around."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Naomi’s place was magnificent! Nice and secluded, but only a 12 minute jaunt into Cale Charles proper. The goats, chickens, ducks, and pigs were all excellent hosts as well. Buddy, the dog on the property was super friendly and properly socialized; he even led us to the cabin! Super clear instructions on anything you need, responsive and kind host(s). Definitely will return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A unique and serene place. Even the farm dog gives you a warm greeting. It's definitely a good place to unwind and slow down a little.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will stay there again in the future if I just need to get away
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I will recommend this stay to everyone I meet!!! What a magical place to stay. We can’t wait to book it again!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our favorite Air bnb experience yet thanks to Paul and his wife. What a beautiful and peaceful time we had getting to know their family and exploring their property. They were so friendly and accommodating and the cabin was perfect. Hoping to visit again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great place to stay. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for an unplugged get away. Not only is it right by Cape Charles where there a bunch of cute restaurants and shops, but you can have a great time without even leaving the property. There are animals and gardens all over. You can even buy fresh duck eggs right there from the very friendly family that runs the farm. Will 100% be coming back in the future."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was so cute and perfect for a mini weekend getaway when I had a wedding to attend. Naomi, Paul and Narelle were all extremely helpful and kind. They were very responsive and welcoming."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and peaceful! Wonderful way to just “check out” from life.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful cottage on a great farm! We loved our stay and Cape Charles was a nice town. Hiking in the state park was beautiful, lots of wildlife. Be sure to visit Cape Charles Brewery!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so relaxing and the pictures don’t do justice. It’s so quiet and peaceful. We loved our visit and the back porch was so enjoyable! The rockers were perfect and truly enjoyed the ducks and loved having treats to give them. Plus, Buddy greeted us, the family farm dog, was just the sweetest puppy. Can’t wait to return for another weekend. Thank you for a tranquil retreat!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most lovely little farm cabin! We had a warm welcome from buddy (the farm dog), the goats, and the ducks! Although small, the cabin was thoughtfully designed/decorated and had everything we needed. A great escape! The hosts were very hospitable, and kind!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay in cape Charles was wonderful! The little cabin was perfect and my dog loved the outdoor areas! Buddy, the owners dog, was so friendly and played along with my dog so well! We went on many walks all together. The cabin was exactly as described and so homey. Paul greeted us many times and was so kind. 10/10 recommend staying at this Airbnb!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an amazing hidden gem. We had a wonderful time relaxing in the cabin. The farm was beautiful and we had a great time walking around visiting the animals.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely incredible little cabin - a “she shed” as one of the owners calls it. It felt brand new too as you can smell the fresh wood paneling, which was crafted on the property itself! Farm animals, walking trails, friendly hosts, beautiful private view… this property has so much to offer! Will be coming back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Naomi's place was super cute. It was in a very quiet area.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely small cabin with all the amenities I needed in the woods on the peaceful VA Eastern Shore.
Perfect for a one/two person getaway. Loved having my dog with me. Buggy but that’s the area in the summer; bring bug spray. Nice area restaurants, Cape Charles is just ten minutes away. If you are a bike rider or birder this is a great area; hiking trails are sparse, however. Next time I am bringing my kayak.
Lovely hosts, helpful and kind and a friendly menagerie of animals on the farm."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful gardens! Had a wonderful stay with gorgeous walking paths and lots of fun animals. Would definitely go back!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This converted birdwatching loft facing the pond/woods was a pleasant stay with a sense of quiet, peace, and truly wonderful and responsive hosts! We parked our car Thursday evening and didn’t get back in until Sunday, just hung around the property and totally relaxed. Three notes for future guests:
1 - Heads up, we were able to stream a movie without any real issues but the WiFi is a little weak (which is in the house instructions after you reserve). Hopefully you’re not choosing this serene property because you need to work, it would be a waste of a great experience.
2 - The farm dog (Buddy) is SUPER friendly and definitely a working free-roaming dog, which was only a challenge for us because our puppy absolutely would not go to the bathroom with Buddy around for the first 48 hours. The hosts were so understanding and helped coordinate with us so we could get our girl out while Buddy ate.
3 - FYI, if it’s bug season, you’ll have a hard time being outside without lots of bug spray!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"More than just a bed to sleep in, to say the least. This is such a lovely cabin on an incredible property! The hosts are responsive and welcoming and the farm is beautiful. This is such a peaceful getaway, we would absolutely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking for a place to get away from the busyness of life, this is your spot! The cabin is the perfect location to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings! Buddy (the dog) was an awesome companion, walking along the property with my husband and I! The hosts were so kind and responsive! This was our second time staying on the property and it was delightful! We can’t recommend this place enough!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in the Farm Cabin. It was so close to Cape Charles, and was also perfectly private. We enjoyed having coffee of the deck each morning and watching the ducks swim around the pond, walking the paths around the farm, and being welcomed each time we drove up by Buddy the farm dog!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Genuinely one of the coolest experiences I’ve ever had. Upon arrival, Buddy the dog greeted us as we pulled in the driveway, and he even led us down the road to our cabin. There were ducks and chickens hanging out around the cabin the whole time during our stay, and there was so much to see on the farm. The interior design of the place was 10/10, If i could give this a higher rating, I would. Definitely blew me away, cudos to the hosts. 🙏"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to get away for a private retreat, but still be close enough to downtown Cape Charles this is your place. The grounds are beautiful. We enjoyed all the animals on the farm and trails throughout the property. Great recommendations for food in town and very sweet/hospitable people. Would absolutely stay again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely little tiny home feel on a small pond with ducks that came and went. Would have liked a little more privacy in that there are no curtains on the bottom windows at all and because it is a working farm, people on golf carts rode past quite a bit.
Great history and surroundings. We enjoyed our stay with our dogs and walking the trails on the property. Great little place to get away from the hustle and bustle."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin and its setting were the perfect place for an Eastern Shore long weekend with our pups. Loved Buddy, the farm animals, front row seat to the pond and the company of fellow campers."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I got engaged two weeks ago and had this vacation booked prior. This cabin was exactly what we needed.
We arrived in Cape Charles early (about 3 hours prior to check-in at 4pm). We messaged Naomi to see if the cabin was ready and if we could arrive earlier. Naomi responded quickly and we were allowed to check in around 10 minutes after our arrival to town. Once getting to the property, we met Buddy who showed us exactly where to go.
We stayed for 5 days and truthfully, I could have stayed longer. Paul and his wife, Narelle, were incredible hosts, and honestly, truly incredible to meet and hear their stories. I would definitely stay here again. BUDDY WAS ONE OF THE BEST PARTS.
Kelly's Pub was amazing! We loved going to the Coffee House for breakfast and lunch. Definitely stop by the shop, Naomi owns -- Voiajer. Dead Rise Pizza was excellent! If you have a chance, visit the Wildlife Refuge for some incredible views.
Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was exactly what we wanted. Close to restaurants, state parks, and the beach. Would definitely stay there again. Buddy the farm dog was a helpful tour guide."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This secluded cabin was perfect for me and my girlfriend’s 1 year anniversary! When we arrived on the property, we were greeted with goats, chickens, and ducks roaming on the farm. Their dog, Buddy, was a friendly tour guide and led us throughout the trails on the property. The animals provided some pleasant entertainment as we would watch the ducks swim in the pond each night on the back porch. The cabin itself had all that two people would need for a long weekend including a record player, which we greatly appreciated as music lovers. The small details throughout the cabin like candlelights, a rustic mirror, and a vintage-looking microwave all added to the overall atmosphere of the cabin. The hosts were very responsive when we had a small concern and were also very respectful of our privacy. We did have some trouble with the smart lock working but because the cabin was out of the way from the main house, we felt safe and did not feel that this issue needed to be resolved."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Naomi's place was beautiful! We loved the cabin, walking around the farm, and the friendly farm dog Buddy :) We had a minor issue that Naomi resolved right away, we can not recommend her enough as a host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a peaceful and very private stay in a woodsy environment, look no further. It is camping with amenities and a wonderful shower. Naomi was a great host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. The location is perfect for a quiet get away. Naomi’s Dad, Paul, was especially hospitable and friendly."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"How nice to stay at a cool place, perfectly described, and meet nice and interesting people as well. The little cabin is adorable and the deck over the pond is great. Our dachshund was fascinated by the frogs and pond noises. Super nice private getaway from the hustle and bustle of Cape Charles ( ha ha). Special thanks to Paul and Buddy for their attention and assistance!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Arlington Farm. The cabin has been thoughtfully equipped and decorated, and the surrounding land is pristinely kept. This was, by far, the most enjoyable and welcoming stay my family has ever experienced. Buddy is a sweetheart and probably the best tour guide ever!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it. Needed a quick escape and this was perfect. Thank you for the wonderful place to stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a perfect little trip! We were in town for a wedding down the street and enjoyed having a super comfortable and private retreat for just the two of us. Such beautiful and serene surroundings. We’d love to come back when we have more time and walk the property. Got a visit from Buddy the dog and that was awesome!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience at Naomi’s cabin! We loved the trails and peaceful setting of the cabin while still being close to Cape Charles.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this little cabin! It was so charming and the perfect getaway from our busy lives. We’d love to find the time to come again.
A big hit was that Kiptopeke State Park was only a 20ish min bike ride away…we were able to go to a lovely beach via bike on quiet back roads.
Reading on the back porch by the busy pond was so relaxing. Everything was comfortable, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was here for a girls' weekend with my best friend, and we had the best time! the place was absolutelybeautifuland peaceful. it was just 15 minutes away from town and the beach. Loved all the animals, especially one of their very friendly dogs (not sure of his name, but he eas black and white).
we would 100% recommend this place if you want to be a short drive away from things, but still would like some peace and quiet.
We would definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Naomis pond side farm cabin was a wonderful overnight stay for our Anniversary! We were able to bring our pooch with us and felt right at home. Buddy the farm dog was happy to greet us and walked with us around the property as we met the chickens, pigs, goats, and ducks.
The space was well laid out and all the little touches were welcomed. We loved sitting on the deck listening to the frogs after sundown. I would highly recommend a stay and would love to go back for longer."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"There is sooo much to this Air B&B. The property is a paradise in itself. Hosts was very friendly, privacy was respected. Plenty to do around the property or around the cape/ in town. Definitely recommend for couples. Peaceful"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was absolutely adorable! The air conditioner worked great and the farm that it sits on is just beautiful, peaceful, and really puts a smile on your face!!!
We loved seeing all the wildlife and farm animals!! This cabin is very peaceful!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came for a spontaneous little getaway for the weekend and this place was PERFECT. We had the best time exploring the farm, going into the town of Cape Charles and overall, the experience and atmosphere of being in the cabin. Buddy the dog was also the greatest addition! Would recommend to anyone."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at the cabin and on the farm. The cabin is about 7 minutes from Cape Charles' shops and restaurants. The hosts were great - Buddy the dog was our best friend while we were at the cabin. The surroundings were beautiful, peaceful, and the hosts respected our privacy. There were a lot of trails to walk on the property, and we enjoyed going to see the goats, chickens, pigs, etc. A great place to visit if you want to be a little outside of the bustle of the town but close to the Bay, Kiptopeke State Park, and be able to see the stars at night."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a hidden gem this little cabin was! I was in need of a spontaneous trip that would provide instant peace and allow me to clear my head & let me just say- this exceeded my expectations for that!
I had my one year old daughter and dog with me and we spent all day just roaming through the grassy trails right outside our door. They were just covered in wild blooms and beautiful gardens left and right, it was truly a dream.
& not only were there goats, chickens tons of creatures among the land but there was BUDDY the sweetest pup that kept us company throughout our stay & made us smile constantly.
I can only hope to keep returning & make this my new home away from home!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time at this lovely cabin! It was super cute and quaint with beautiful scenery/surroundings. Hosts were extremely friendly and hospitable, and Buddy the dog was such a delight to have as a little visitor:) We also liked the fact that the place was not too far from nice shops, bars, and diners. Thanks so much."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If we had to describe it with one word, that word would be exceptional! The cottage is private and tranquil. The farm is lovely. The farm dog buddy is lovable. And we enjoyed an evening fire around a fire pit with Naomi, her partner, and her very cool father who also assisted us when our car broke down."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very accommodating no surprises - incredibly restful setup and the area was amazing to explore driving around all day knowing I had a great place to crash - grateful to be able to experience the area and see the farm with goats, chickens, a great dog! Short trip this time but hope to visit again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped here in the way to Savannah GA with a 3 month old, 6 year old, dog and two adults. We loved the cabin and farm so much we’ll be back on our drive back from Georgia. The family at the farm is so friendly and helpful with a few of our requests and our kids loved the animals! Awesome experience"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We came here to celebrate our anniversary and it was so relaxing. Paul was very welcoming and nice by showing us the animals. We were able to take the dogs to a beach within walking distance. Would stay here again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time for this anniversary getaway! The weather wasn't the greatest, but certainly was a beautiful, peaceful and relaxing experience."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enchanting farm, wonderful hosts, beautiful and peaceful setting!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The little home is beautiful and super peaceful. Buddy the dog is available all the time to lead you down the various trails leading throughout the back of the farm. There is a nightly fire in the backyard that is cozy and warm. Wasn’t too far from Cape Charles and Kitopeke State Park.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"First let me state that Naomi is great. We ran into an issue when we first arrived and she was quick to address the issue.
The tiny home is absolutely adorable and its location is wonderful. Laying in the bed at night staring out at the forest was great. It is so peaceful that you are able to relax. There are lots of trails for walking (it rained so it was a bit muddy, so bring shoes that do well in mud) and it was great for walking my dogs around. The place is dog friendly, no pets allowed on furntiure, which we just put our suitcase on the couch so our pups weren't tempted and the dogs are unable to get to the loft area. The people on the farm are so friendly and the farm dog Buddy loved going on our walks with us. He is super friendly and my dogs loved playing with him. I would highly recommed this place to anyone traveling to the area. Its only about 12 minutes from Cape Charles and 11 minutes from the state park."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a relaxing night away at Naomi’s farm cabin! We enjoyed the beautiful views and exploring our surroundings. I can’t write a review without mentioning our tour guide, Buddy the farm dog! Buddy made sure we didn’t get lost on the trails and he came to check on us every so often. I found him laying outside the cabin in the morning, waiting to say hello. The cabin was extremely clean, comfortable and decorated so nice! We will definitely be back. Thank you, Naomi!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful property, great house, and Buddy the dog is the best."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent a long weekend in Naomi’s cabin. Overall, we were pleased with our stay and felt that the basics that we needed for our stay were there (towels, blankets, water). The cabin itself, however, is very small. Although this listing says 3 people can stay here, I would advise only 2 adults to stay here comfortably. Lastly, Buddy the dog is also a great, welcoming tour guide!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely incredible! We will 100% be going back. This small little cabin was beyond perfect and Naomi was extremely responsive. (It helps that they had a cute dog to greet us too!!) definitely worth the trip!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place for relax and recharge.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an amazing stay! It was a surprise trip! My boyfriend proposed on the porch over looking the water! very private and absolutely perfect!!!

Thanks for a wonderful stay,

We appreciated her going above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed the weekend for our Anniversary, and had everything we needed for a restful getaway, including the ability to make breakfast in the morning. The neighborhood was quiet, and just far enough away from the beachfront to escape the busyness.
The space itself was neat, clean, and comfortable. The bed is very comfy, even though it’s just a daybed. But the deck was amazing! It was wonderful to be able to sit outside(although it’s July) and be near the water.
All in all, a great weekend of relaxing!"

For me the location was perfect with very comfortable accommodations! Can’t be beat!!!
Melissa was wonderful!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely recommend this AirBnB to anyone looking to stay in the VA Beach area.
If anything, the description and pictures of the of the cottage underplays how big it actually feels inside and how close it is to the beach and main restaurant/bar strip.
Me and my girlfriend didn’t want to drink and drive, and we’re glad to see that ubers to most of our destinations by the beach we’re typically less than $8 and we’re only a 7-10 minute drive.
The patio and view of the lake is absolutely stunning and is a great way to wake up or drink a glass of wine with dinner. 10/10 stay for sure!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice open space, very clean. The patio on the water was very calming."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much. It was very peaceful and relaxing. I loved sitting on the deck looking at water and just clearing my mind. I would definitely recomnend.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed ours stay at Melissa's Airbnb, the cottage is very cozy and set right by the water in the back yard. The only complaint is that the counter was extremely dusty when we first used it, after a quick clean up the place was wonderful to stay in for the weekend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thé bungalow was well placed to visit the area of Virginia Beach, Chesapeake and Norfolk. Everything was perfect, thank you so so much!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an enjoyable experience. It felt like a bit of an oasis which was appreciated for the limited amount of time spent there. Relaxing & scenic. Appreciated the accommodations and her responsiveness
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The setting is lovely, right on the water’s edge with a nice spot just outside. You feel like you are miles away, but it’s a short drive to the beach and attractions. We hope to return when it’s warmer."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay in Melissa's Airbnb. The guest house was very private and had a beautiful view of the water. Melissa was very helpful and responsive during my stay. The bed is cozy and comfortable, I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodations and great location
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was lovely. So relaxing and removed from the hustle and bustle. Melissa was also kind and helpful. And it was so close to the beach. Great location. It was an amazing get away.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best Airbnb's that I've stayed at. The space is super cozy and inviting and it has all the essentials. The neighborhood is quiet and in a convenient location to everything you'd want to do in the area.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my weekend stay at this very serene cabin with a beautiful water view. Relaxing on the deck with coffee was a highlight. I appreciated that the Wi-Fi was seamless out there as well. There was plenty of hot water available for showers. The cart to transport my belongings to the secluded site was a welcome touch. Melissa was in contact to ensure I had everything I needed. I highly recommend this rental.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’m convinced Melissa should have a regular bed and not a futon bed; it was just horrible for my 60+ year old back. I ended up sleeping on the floor which was very comfortable and there was plenty of blankets I could use for padding. The quaint outdoor area is the selling point and is incredibly cute, but bring a citronella candle!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, peaceful, and quiet. Looks just like in the pictures. We loved our stay here, it was perfect for a weekend getaway. The host was very accommodating and the check in/out process was smooth and easy. The location is great less than 10 mins from the beach. Also right down the street from several stores and restaurants, everything you need is just minutes away."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little bungalow tucked away in a nice residential area. This was perfect for 2 people for a weekend getaway, and the host was communicative and kind! I never have great luck with beds on Air BnB - the day bed was a little slanted and whoever sleeps on the outside may feel like they’re sliding off the bed."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the most wonderful time at Melissa’s! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to stay, we didn’t know it’d turn into a place we love. We Will be looking for a house near by and using Melissa as our air BNB every time. I highly recommend this clean, peaceful, relaxing, and absolutely gorgeous little hide away. Thank you for everything. You were wonderful!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly, beautiful scenery, close to the beach!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little cabin with amazing views. Cabin was clean and comfy. Melissa was always fast to respond to questions and concerns! Would definitely recommend!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first vacation together and we couldn’t have asked for a better place. Beautiful place to stay. It was very clean and comfortable. A great place to relax after long days of exploring. Melissa was amazing and was available for any questions we had.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa did an amazing job with this quaint cabin in the woods. My husband and I got away for a birthday weekend and loved the location. It is a guest house but had excellent privacy and Melissa did a great job with communicating for an easy check-in experience. The location is great, about 5-10 minutes from the beach depending where you park, and close to stores and restaurants. We hope to return, book with her today!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is exactly as described and more! It is such a nicely decorated and well kept space to stay in. Melissa was so helpful a attentive. The outdoor deck by the water was very relaxing to get away from things. Once you walk into the room you can right away feel the coziness. Also there are plenty of great food options in the area and you’re right by the beach. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb if you are coming to VA Beach.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little spot to stay. The view on the lake great. It’s fun to see various birds and you have a patio right out the door. Listing is accurate and everything was well detailed about parking, check in, Wi-Fi. Shower is small but that wouldn’t stop me from staying again. Melissa was fast at answering any questions."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s place is a little gem. We usually stay at my sister’s in Chesapeake & this was located in the epicenter of everywhere we typically go. It is comfortable, in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood, and perfect for two. I do think it would benefit people to know that the shower is VERY small, but it works and the water pressure is phenomenal (it’s the little things!) I would be remiss not to mention the view. It’s very peaceful, and you can see right down the bay. It’s awesome and makes for a perfect way to start the morning. Thanks again Melissa."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked Melissa’s cabin for my son and his new wife for a long weekend away. They loved the cabin. They said it was so nice and perfect! Melissa was a wonderful host and very accommodating! They said they would stay there again unquestionably.
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice view of the water. Convenient to the sights of the area. $188 a night (with all charges) seemed a bit much . Something in the range of $95 would have been reasonable. I missed having a source of ice. The sound of being in the flight path of F18 Super Hornets thundering over head reminded me of living near PaxRiver NAS in MD.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay. Less than 10 minutes from the beach and the boardwalk and many great restaurants, and about 20 minutes from the botanic gardens and the aquarium. The place was clean and quiet and very peaceful. It was so pleasant to sip coffee on the patio by the canal. Couldn't recommend highly enough!"
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very serene, quiet stay with beautiful scenery. Great place to get away & reset."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a lovely weekend destination-very private & right on the inlet. Melissa was very responsive.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had such a lovely stay here! Clean, quiet, and the location seemed perfect. Melissa was a thoughtful host and communicated with us throughout our stay which we appreciated. I'd strongly recommend this place to anyone :)"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place. Nice deck right on the lake. Perfect for reading or morning coffee. Melissa was always available and answered any of my texts within minutes.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, stocked with all the essentials, and very quiet! There is a bug problem, so if you don’t want to vacuum dead bugs on the floor multiple times per day, this isn’t the spot for you. Otherwise would recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy getaway
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect weekend getaway! The place couldn’t have been any better. We had a great time and can’t wait to come back one day!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is a great stay for couples trying to get away! Lovely view and gives a great nature vibe. Be sure to dress warm because it can be a little chilly on the water.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and quiet! The view in the morning is spectacular and even saw a Herron which was a nice way to wake up and drink coffee. Very easy to get to places and check in was a breeze.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and cozy... look forward in visiting again... great stay!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a weekend getaway, beautiful view and good location!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was very clean and super cute. It was conveniently located to beach/shopping area.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet spot right on the water. Very close to many fun things! We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful spot and stay! The cabin felt like worlds away from it all! Appreciate the details in communication and instructions from Melissa. Really pretty towels and cozy linen and blankets. Thanks for allowing us to stay on this getaway and even the warm greeting from your mom!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing to sit on the deck by the water. The cabin was very clean and the perfect size for 2 guests. We loved our stay here. Would definitely recommend it and look forward to staying here again.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time. The place was quiet but still close to everything. Would definitely recommend.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for visiting VA beach. Easy, short drive to 30th street parking lot which was right on the boardwalk.
Place was clean, and perfect size for the two of us. The best was the private deck overlooking the inlet."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couples Weekend Retreat!
This has been an amazing get away. We will miss the view of the water, the sky lights in the cabin, and the peaceful, safe neighborhood. Melissa was amazing! She even had a cart ready for us upon arrival so we could put our belongings and prevent having to walk back and forth when we were unloading. We highly recommend a long weekend plan because theres so much to do in the area and just being at the cabin - it makes you want to stay in and be cozy - slows down time to really help you relax. I truly hope one day we can come back!
Note: if you want to stay indoors to watch movies, bring a Roku or fire stick or come prepared with a hdmi cable to connect your laptop!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean & perfect little spot with lots of privacy
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was an awesome view to watch the lake from inside or sitting on the deck with a cup of coffee. We enjoyed the perfect size for 2 people.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was very easy to communicate with. She was able to help us out with all our requests. The place is great for a nice little couple getaway. It is in a prime location, there is everything you could want around the place, including the proximity to the beach. The place was clean and very welcoming. We can’t wait to stay again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Loved the deck and the location to the beach while still in a quiet setting. We would definitely stay here again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The perfect getaway for me and my 11-year-old son. The place was very clean and the host kept a great line of communication with me. Melissa recommended some good fishing places in the area.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing find! We loved our stay here. Would recommend to others for sure
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place to stay for a couple looking to explore VA beach. The cottage is so cute and cozy and there’s nothing like waking up to the beautiful view of the river. We would definitely stay here again.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My Boyfriend and I stayed here for a quiet weekend at the beach, and our expectations were exceed! The cabin itself is the perfect size for an intimate getaway, and offers so much natural light and beautiful scenery. It is private, safe, and above all, BEAUTIFUL. Melissa was a fantastic host who’s generosity and attention to detail made our trip more than we could have asked for. 10/10 will definitely be back!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely a 10/10! The cabin was exceptionally clean, conveniently located within minutes of activities (beach, shopping outlets, etc.), and the overall scenery was absolutely gorgeous. Melissa is an exceptional host, and was super easy to communicate with. Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little waterside spot! Melissa was so nice and great with communication. Lovely little retreat. Close enough to drive wherever you’d like to go, but quiet enough to relax. Would much rather stay here than a hotel chain! Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place! Perfect for our weekend getaway. Close to the boardwalk and easy access from the driveway.
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The setting of this cabin is beautiful. Very private with a lovely water view. Great location a short drive or bike ride to the oceanfront. But without the hubbub of the resort area. Near restaurants and shopping.
The cabin itself is a converted shed or garage. Basically one 18 x 25 foot room and a small bathroom. It was very clean. Melissa, the host, is solicitous and helpful. So there is a lot to like.
An issue to consider is the bed, which is a pull out couch. It was okay for one person for a couple of days. But it isn’t as comfortable as a regular bed. Another issue is the heating/air conditioning unit. It is a window unit directly over the couch/bed and is pretty loud. I turned it off at night.
It is a nice spot and certainly more enjoyable than staying at a typical Virginia Beach hotel."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is easy to find, completely private, clean, cozy and relaxing. What made it even nicer was the fact that it is on the water and a very short distance to the beach."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The little cabin is so cute and has a great view on the water. Melissa was so nice and accommodating and very quick with responses! We would definitely stay there again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The patio, overlooking the river, is a little slice of absolute heaven. We enjoyed our coffee there in the morning, a glass of wine there in the evening, and looking out the huge, gorgeous windows over the water from everywhere inside the cabin. The description of Serene was spot on and exactly what we needed for my birthday weekend-away. The location couldn’t be better, close to Hilltop shopping center with Target, The Fresh Market, Trader Joe’s and more, and the oceanfront is just a straight shot down the road for dining and night-life. Melissa was an excellent hostess, she checked in on us via message to make sure we had everything we needed, and gave us her contact info if we had any questions. I would recommend this stay for anyone who needs a relaxing getaway!!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a private getaway this is the perfect place. The bed was the only thing I wish was bigger, but other than that it was prefect!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is super cute and was super clean. Loved all the windows and view of the water. Deck is really nice and would be wonderful in warmer weather. Melissa was a great host and very responsive.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a great spot! Perfect for couples that want to get away. Waking up to the view of the water and having a coffee on the deck is the perfect way to start your day. Your close to everything in VA Beach and Melissa has a great list of suggestions under the ‘guidebook’ tab. Melissa was very responsive and great throughout the stay. I would definitely come back. To sum it up, if you’re considering, book it."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thoroughly enjoyed Melissa’s place right on the water. Would definitely like to return again and make more use of the water.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, beautiful location. Melissa is also fantastic with communication and making sure you know everything for your stay. My girlfriend and I had a great time staying there and the memories we made there will last a lifetime."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Guesthouse was extremely private and the view was astonishing. Perfect for a couple’s trip or a solo staycation. Everything was super clean and super easy and I’d def book with Melissa again!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely guest house on the edge of host’s property. Very private and comfortable stay. The waterfront deck is stunning and perfect for enjoying a cup of coffee. It’s ~8 min drive to beach front.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"adorable and charming!! only thing was because this is a guest home, their dogs would bark like crazy if we entered the yard at night. it's expected though as it is a guest home in someone yard. pups were adorable!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space with an amazingly peaceful view. The space was comfortable, efficient, and very private. We stayed for a COVID weekend getaway and appreciated being away from the hubbub of the boardwalk, but also just a few minutes drive from the beach - best of both worlds!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is very welcoming and clean. We spent a lot of time at nearby beaches and enjoyed coming back to the canal view. Owners were very kind - cottage felt very private while being near the main house. Had wonderful stay and experience.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! At first it was hard to believe that you actually were as close to the water as it was advertised, but indeed when we made our way down way down to this oasis the deck was but 2 feet from being right on the water! It was a picturesque view from early morning through to dusk and through the dappled light you The cabin face looking up the waterway and could see a meandering lagoon setting with boats docks and ducks. There was a gracious deck with setting to enjoy all of this and it somehow managed to be very private and quaint well still at having all of this surround of you.
The cabin was well appointed with two extremely large windows facing in teo directions both up the water way In front of you with the bed/couch face it. The side window just as large was but a few feet away from the water right there. There points when small fish were jumping etc. and at times I was surprised a place like this even existed!
Coming from Washington DC I was also happy how quiet it was and at times absolutely silent. Yet ironically literally about three minutes away from the main strip with great dining and shopping etc. and the main road lead directly to the beaches.
The owners were respectful and discrete and we did have a chance to speak to both which turned out to be a pleasure. We were treated like family and they continually inquired whether we needed anything and were ready to make our stay as enjoyable in anyway they could.
I’m going back to this solace soon perhaps just for some quiet time to reflect."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa is a great host and the cottage is cute and clean. We stayed for a weekend and explored Virginia Beach. The cottage is a short drive to everything you want to do in Virginia Beach. The cottage is private and looks right over the creek. The deck is a great space to enjoy the nature. We went on a very rainy weekend and the walk from your car to the cottage can get a little muddy - no problem when wearing shorts and flip flops. We slept in the double pull out couch and it was comfortable. Bedding and linens were all in good condition. The shower was pretty tight, but had good water pressure and was nice and hot. The kitchen was limited to a mini fridge and a microwave - but Melissa recommends so many good dining spots you won’t miss cooking for a weekend. Make sure to hike the first landing state park and go to chicks beach! Fancy drinks at the cavalier were also great!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa is a great host! She was always very friendly and responsive. Made everything so simple and . The place is kept very clean, comfortable and the patio is a delight."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Conveniently located to VB, the aquarium, and amazing restaurants. Enjoyed the fresh flowers and decor. Host hand-delivered a corkscrew when I had forgotten one. Gorgeous views out floor-to-ceiling windows to wake-up and wind-down to in the evening. Highly recommend."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Welcoming, and just extremely charming! From the host to the space, my partner and I had a cozy time. Thank you for the hospitality and good luck w future stays! I’m sure with what it has to offer, you folks will do great.
Thanks again,
Melissa"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Andrew was an incredible host. He was very communicative in the days leading up to/the day of our arrival. His instructions and guide were clear, concise, and very helpful.
As for the property - 5 out of 5! Very clean and accessible. I was in VA Beach for the Shamrock Marathon along with a large group (8 of us total), and we were very comfortable. All 4 bedrooms were spacious, and with 3 bathrooms in the house, there were never any issues in that regard.
The location was incredibly convenient. within walking distance of numerous restaurants (we thoroughly enjoyed Repeal as well as Barrel, both great burger spots) and convenience/grocery stores, not to mention two blocks (literally less than 10 min walk) from the boardwalk and beach.
The only concern I had was parking (we had 3 vehicles total), which is slightly limited, but Andrew gave me the heads up as well as a tip/suggested solution should it become an issue (it ultimately worked out fine).
I highly recommend this property!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,It was just as Andrew described and it was perfect for our small group of ladies that came in to town for a conference at Wave Church! I'm sure we will be rebooking for next year! We loved it.

2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"This house has ample space for the number of guests allowed, not cramped at all. Its location is extremely walkable; the beach, restaurants and stores are all within walking distance, or a quick drive. The house appears to be of relatively new construction, so no issues with climate control, kitchen appliances or bathrooms/showers. The gas fireplace was very nice for keeping the living room warm and toasty; we stayed there for New Year's Eve weekend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a pleasure and very positive experience staying in Andrew's property. He was very responsive and flexible on our check-in time. The location was convenient, quiet with ample parking. Andrew did an excellent job at describing the property and he provides very fair pricing. It was a great choice for a home to spend the holidays in."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a lovely house. Great space and amenities offered. The only problem we had was the bedding and floors were not cleaned and we had to wash ourselves. Other than that the house was tidy. The house is close to oceanfront and ducked off on the half street which gives nice privacy. Even with the bedding mishap i would book again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Immaculate property. Andrew was beyond responsive and helpful. Location is not only great for VA Beach but is completely accessible for visiting the naval base in Norfolk as well. Great host; great experience.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Andrew’s place was great! Close enough to walk to the boardwalk and beach. The house had tons of room for our traveling party of 4 adults and 2 younger kids.

My family is already thinking about planning a trip back to Andrew’s house next summer!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house has so much space!! We had 4 adults and 4 kids and it was perfect! Andrew answered all of my questions very promptly. This house is perfect if you don’t want to drive anywhere during your stay. The beach and boardwalk is less than a 10 walk!

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Newly renovated 4BR house, was clean and an easy walk to beach. Beds were comfy and baths nicely done. Excellent supermarket very close by. Neighborhood was a little more urban and congested than I expected, but did not hamper our long weekend.
I think a few more pieces of furniture inside/outside and some additional kitchen items are needed if the 10 people the house can comfortably sleep want to relax. However, for the 4 of us we were very happy and overall I would recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Andrew’s place was perfect for our family-friends getaway! We had 3 toddlers and 6 adults! The place fit us all perfectly and it was adorable. The neighborhood was extremely walkable and friendly. I will definitely plan to book with Andrew again in the future!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and was our home away from home during Christmas. Andrew was awesome and communicated immediately from the first question asked about his property and answered all our questions and made booking easy. The communication continued right through to the end at check-out. The home is spacious with 4 beautiful bedrooms (the beds were amazing and comfortable), and 3 bathrooms that had everything needed including ample tp, body wash and shampoo. We hosted Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner (our son returned home from deployment) for our family and it was all made possible by having a home that was comfortable and beautiful. Our Christmas morning complete with a fireplace! Although the weather was windy we still enjoyed the awesome backyard for some air. The location perfect as it was blocks away from the beach and boardwalk, and all of the stores for any last minute things, like gas and groceries, steps away from a 7-Eleven store too! Awesome home and owner!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just have to say this is one of the coziest airbnbs I have ever stayed. Nataly is communicative and always willing to help. Beautiful little room with its own bathroom and super close to the beach. Definitely worth the price and nested in a peaceful part of Virginia Beach.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly’s place is very nice. It is better than the pics, and it was really clean (the best) with a great backyard going to the water and view.

Would definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Me and my wife Love it. Only little thing was me and my wife are hot nature and the room doesn't have its own temperature control it only has one for the whole house but the room did have a ceiling fan and a desk fan to use in the room. Would definitely stay here again though. Room was extra clean and just as described in the description.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location. Peaceful atmosphere. Very clean. She provided some of the items that I would need like coffee, creamers, plates and cups. Refrigerator. Toaster. Paper towels. Clean linens. Shampoo in case I forgot mine and makeup remover wipes. Comfortable bed and sofa. Plus use of the streaming services for the TV. I highly recommend this place."

Nice quiet location but walking distance to the main street and beach. House smelled so clean when we walked in. Bed was super comfy!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place! Perfectly tucked away in a calm neighborhood but very close to the ocean front. I felt at peace with a nice little balcony over seeing a pretty lake. Great comfort, perfect size and had all the amenities I needed for a weekend getaway. Plus, Nataly was extremely helpful even ordering a new Roku control for us so we could use her TV. Would definitely come back! Thank you so much!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing! We both felt super safe and close to things we wanted to do. Quick walk to the beach, amazing porch, 10/10!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic AirBnB with friendly host who went above and beyond with amenities! Super cozy suite within walking distance to boardwalk, beach, and other attractions at Virginia Beach. Well worth it for everything. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cozy spot to stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful room with very detailed instructions. Definatly able to walk to the beach from this location.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Nataly’s condo. It was very clean and within walking distance to the boardwalk along Virginia Beach. The neighborhood felt safe and was quiet. We arrived earlier than expected and were allowed to check in early, which was greatly appreciated."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly's place is walkable to the beach and to surrounding restaurants. Very quiet, peaceful, and relaxing. I loved the bathroom because it was newly remodeled with upgraded fixtures. When I woke up in the morning I made coffee in the Keurig and walked to the beach to watch the sunrise. Would stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly’s place was very cozy and relaxing. The home was very clean with plenty of space for two people. Our first day was rainy but so relaxing. I was able to stay up late and read while enjoying tea without disturbing my husband. The next day we hung out at the beach which was within walking distance to the beach and restaurants. We truly enjoyed our stay. This is the perfect place to unwind and relax!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The OCEANA NAS is very close and one night you could hear jets in late night training or deployment. Not a fault of the Host just to let you know it is like that all around VB. You do have to climb a couple of floors to get to the apartment in case you have any difficulties doing this. Host asked us to walk softly on top floor as the steps make the lower floors shake a bit.
A nice place at a good price. Super clean."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly's place is immaculate, yet cozy and very comfortable. She definitely goes beyond to make everything perfect for your visit.
The only downfall for us was that it was a very HOT weekend and we were staying on the 3rd floor, so it was a lot warmer than I'm used too. She does provide a ceiling fan and stand alone fan, but heat rises.
Would I stay again at her place, definitely yes!
Thanks for a wonderful weekend stay!
Steph and Darnell"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The description does say a few blocks from the beach but they are long blocks so just be prepared.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very close to beach and boardwalk. Very walkable area with great local restaurants and coffee shops. Back deck is very peaceful. Good wifi and space for doing some work. Second time staying here. Perfect for us as a couple. Gringos is great place for Mexican food.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great location, great space."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly was very friendly and helpful. We also had a perfect room - very nicely furnished and very clean. The beach is quickly and easily accessible on foot. I would definitely book this room again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are pleased with our stay. The accommodation matched the description well. It is larger than a hotel room and it is 8-10 minutes from the beach. If you plan to eat, bring plates, there are only small cardboard plates. But otherwise, several things were provided (2 cups, utensils, keurig cup, body cleaner and shampoo, demacquillant, hydrating cream, beach blanket, etc.). Our only downside is that we couldn't control the air conditioning. It wasn't hot in the property, but we wish it were cooler for the night."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good, new, well maintained and comfortable place... I wish I stayed longer."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay that’s walkable to the boardwalk! It was also nice to be able to easily drive into places like Norfolk. Clean and comfortable place with a great host!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Nataly was communicative and informative. the room was private and very clean - we appreciated the special touches like coffee creamer, microwave, utensils. The space was welcoming and nicely decorated. We hope to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for 2 nights in July 2023. It was a 5 minute Lyft from the Virginia Contemporary Art Museum where I was attending a wedding. Very clean and well stocked. Bring an eye mask if you're sensitive to morning light coming in. Big TV with Netflix. Comfy bed. Nice big bathroom with shower only (no tub). Balcony overlooking backyard. Mini fridge, microwave, and Keurig with lots of coffee pods but only 2 tea bags. It was very hot & humid when I stayed so it got pretty warm in my room at times. A window AC in the space would be great to supplement the central AC. Overall it fit my needs for a 2 night stay and I would recommend it to others."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, well appointed, and very clean accomodation close to the beach but in a quiet area. Thanks Nataly!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The place was spotless. Can easily walk to the beach and to many restaurants. We were visiting family so spent a large portion of our time at their house and didn’t miss a kitchen. Comfortable bed and couch area was used for some remote working. Wifi worked well. Nice place for a couple.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very wonderful. I loved the whole layout. It was very clean and classy, and I absolutely love the patio outside with the scenery in the back was so relaxing I got to do some writing and we had a wonderful celebration of three years around the sun."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Nataly’s place, very comfy, great location, beautiful backyard.
Nataly is an excellent host, friendly and helpful. We would come again if we had the chance."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a brilliant stay at Nataly’s. It was super comfortable and peaceful and clean, and so well located for the beach and lots of excellent restaurants and bars all within walking distance. Nataly was very helpful and kind and we would definitely stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly’s place was amazing! The beach was right down the road and there were so many places all around. Very close to everything! The only downside was the room gets a little toasty at night. Even with the fan on it was still pretty hot in the room. Other than that it was perfect.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nataly's place was as described - perfect place to stay while in town. It is the top follow of a duplex unit, so you do have to climb up 2 flights of stairs (1/2 utside, and 1-1/2 inside, but that wasn't a deal breaker for us.
Keurig style coffee maker in the room, plenty of coffee was a nice touch. Was pretty peaceful, and Nataly went out of her way to make sure the temps were to our liking when we arrived.
She was also very flexible with our arrival time, and very accomodating.
We would definitely consider staying with her again when in the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay for a long weekend at the beach. The unit was very clean and tidy, the space was a decent size for one or two people. It had a large bathroom area that also served as a mini kitchen. Convenient to walk to the oceanfront, and there are relatively cheap lunch options and bars even closer. Accessible to everything yet in a peaceful neighborhood!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly's place is very comfortable and is well-located by a few great restaurants and near to he beach. Highly recommended!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was so pristine and comfortable. Nataly was very responsive and kind, and the view from the balcony was beautiful!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, comfortable, clean and conveniently located. Nataly’s place was perfect for our stay. Walked to the beach, great restaurants and fun coffee shops. Quiet and so lovely to look out over the bay. Would definitely stay at Nataly’s again."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean. Kind. Peaceful.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly’s the perfect place to stay! This is our second time staying and I hope to have the chance stay there every time I come home to Virginia Beach! Her place is so spacious, beautiful, clean, and peaceful! The balcony over looking the water is the perfect way to spend the morning! Honestly, so better place to stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place for a weekend stay. Walkable to the oceanfront beach and restaurants, but far enough away to not have all the noise and traffic. Parking space was key! Happily stay again if we are in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, this was my first time using airbnb and I felt at home!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"In town for work. Great place to stay! Cozy setup! The place was spotless! Hosts were extremely helpful during checkin, as I’m not too good at following directions on GPS 😊
I look forward to staying there again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our third stay at one of Natalie's AirB&B's. We always find her places to be clean, quiet, easy to locate, parking is available, and is close to walking distance of the boardwalk. She's always responsive to any questions I might have had. We always feel right at home when we're there. Our favorite AirB&B in Virginia Beach!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly was an amazing host. Attentive, great at communicating, and was quick to point out that I had left some items at her house shortly after checking out. The room was honestly perfect. Beautiful balcony and room. Overall 10/10."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed a relaxing weekend at Nataly's. I thought entrance outside but go into front door and she rents 2nd and 3rd floor. Quiet...beautiful. Each time looked for something...a cutting board, knife, it was there. She replied quickly. We loved the private balcony overlooking pond...would be lovely in warmer temps. We will be back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly’s place was perfect for my trip. Very clean, good location to Rudee’s inlet area and the beach. The stairs up to the 3rd floor had good lighting available and hand rails. This apt is close to a military base, but the planes that flew over head did not bother me and seemed to stop during the night. Everything in the description was provided.
If you drink a lot of water like me, you might want to remember to bring some bottled water.
I would definitely stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our short trip. Sweet little place. Perfect for a couple.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly’s place was lovely! I was in town for a convention and loved having a serene retreat to escape to.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I enjoyed staying here and the room was very nice and clean. The area is amazing and the walk to the beach was about 10 minutes.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly is a great host! The place is spacious and cozy at the same time. It is well stocked for longer stays and the host is prompt in responses.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly’s place is perfect for couples! Plenty of open living room space and kitchenette space. The balcony overlooking the water was a nice surprise, perfect for the sunrise. The place was extremely clean and very cozy, would love to stay there again!"
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Natalys was overall pretty nice. It looks exactly like the pictures and was very clean. Nataly was very responsive to our messages and assisted us when we needed help. She also gave good recommendations and was very friendly when we spoke to her. The one thing that we didn’t like was we were not under the impression that
Nataly lives/is very often at the place of rental. As this was our honeymoon, we frequently saw her when we would have preferred to have been left alone. There was also an occurrence where she rang the doorbell late at night when we were both in bed and had to get out of bed to answer the door. She was also adamant about removing shoes in the door which I could understand if it were summertime and we were tracking in sand but we were not. I also didn’t love the area, there was a nice lake view on the balcony but the neighborhood itself wasn’t the best. Overall, our stay was pretty good at Natalys and the price was very reasonable."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was very friendly. We had a misunderstanding and she was very nice and explained it carefully and we were able to go on with our day. Every time I asked her something she was quick to respond and was always helpful
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly’s place is in a great location, the room has everything you need, and it’s a great value. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly was a great host, easy to communicate with, and was accommodating. the room is spacious and feels like you're in your own studio. you have your own balcony that overlooks the lake, and the beach is only a few minutes walk away. it was a great space to getaway and work remotely. Hope to be back again"

The place was very clean.
Room was very beautiful and well maintained."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was very nice and clean. Perfect for a short a trip.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a very clean, comfortable and perfectly located home. Close to the beach, with a nice view in back, and all the necessities. The bed is super, and the interior is stylishly furnished. Flyers and travel information, large TV screen, cushy sofa, nice coffee maker. All the basics plus some!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly’s place was the cleanest we have ever stayed at! We loved the quiet location close to the beach and biking trails. It was cozy but had everything we needed for our stay. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The quality of the building and furniture were great. And the place was very clean. But there was construction going on in the owners suite next door and I was unaware of that. The carpenters music was blasting and made it very uncomfortable to check-in and relax.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very spacious and clean room. Very quiet on the top floor with a large, comfortable sitting area. I met Nataly on my way out and she was very friendly and told me where to find 2-hour free parking near the boardwalk. Thanks Nataly!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We definitely recommend
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Location is awesome. Easy walk to the boardwalk and beach. Plenty of nice food places nearby.
Parking was convenient, easy, and safe.
Place was so clean you can eat off the floor.
Check in and out was easy as well. Balcony was a nice touch and upstairs was huge! Tons of room. I recommend this place for anyone going to Virginia Beach."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a find. It really was 3 blocks and 10 minutes to the beach. It was beautifully decorated and everything was new and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable. And, as a single woman, I felt completely safe in both the apartment and the neighborhood."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nataly provided a very nice place to stay while I was visiting. The room was clean and ready to go when I arrived. Everything was as described and check in & check out were very easy. It is a bit farther down from the main attractions then I realized but otherwise a good location with a nice view of the lake.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nataly is a great host. Her listing was accurate. The accommodation was cute and super clean. Well taken care of. We loved being able to walk to the beach and restaurants
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space was perfect for my husband and myself for a weekend getaway. It was clean and nicely appointed and the bed was very comfortable. You won't be disappointed.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly's place was spotless and cozy. It has everything you would get from a hotel and very neat and clean. Also location, location location!! . The area was safe, you are like three blocks away from the beach and several restaurants. The major hotels like Marriott and Holiday Inn which are on the boardwalk are probably a lot more expensive. I recommend Nataly's place in order to save money. I had an easy check in and check out and was never disturbed while staying in her place, her family is also very quiet.
However, my only criticism is that we stayed there two days. On each day we noticed while we were gone that someone came into the room while we were out. Which I did not like because it's an invasion of privacy. I do understand that the room is in her home and not a separate space, however if she had any concerns she should have reached out."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful! Not far from the beach, within walking distance. Nataly was very friendly and helpful pointing us in the right direction when it was time to eat. Directions were perfect, checkin was easy. Lots of stairs as it's on the 3rd floor. We had everything we needed. We look forward to another stay in the future! Thanks Nataly!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly was the perfect host for our trip to Virginia Beach. Her loft style apartment was very clean, had essentials for our stay, and was walking distance to the beach. Additionally, she let us use her beach chairs and umbrellas. She easily communicated with us regarding check in and other necessary instructions. I would stay at her location again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and great host!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for our short stay in Virginia Beach.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great. Super quick walk to the beach and close to other shops.
I love the area"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and comfortable, very spacious room on the third level of a townhouse. It is about a 3 block walk to the beach - which is very easy. Very responsive host - Nataly is prompt with communication. The space was very clean and nicely appointed. You have a toaster, microwave and small fridge and plates etc for use. All toiletries there as well."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The room was just as described and had everything I needed. It was also within walking distance to the beach. Great stay!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect stay to unwind after a day of festivities! Super clean and easily accessible. The hosts were very welcoming in passing and readily available based upon need. I highly recommend this stay to others!
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute and private, lovely view of pond from balcony. Good location- close to all the good restaurants but also tucked away from crowds. Super clean and well appointed. One off-street parking spot and truly awesome suggestions from Nataly for local restaurants that fit our dietary needs. Overall it was just what we needed for a short stay.
The internet was a bit spotty one day but Nataly was quick to communicate and tried to help us resolve it immediately as I had an important presentation, and she made it work!
Only thing is to control the temperature we had use a thermostat downstairs and it took a long time to change even a couple degrees, so it was quite hot for me through the night and I kept waking up."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was there for july weekend everything was in place she got everything you need in this room very clean with alot of perks like tv, micro, small fridge , balcony. Very clean place . Looking forward to
Stay in this place again , highly recommended .thank you nataly for your hospitality 🙌🏻💯"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay in Virginia Beach. Roomy, nicely decorated, and immaculate. Room is on 3rd floor of townhouse but has separate locking door and feels completely private. Nataly was a great host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, very very clean and nice location"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot! I enjoyed watching the birds on the pond with my morning coffee. Walkable to the beach. Very clean and comfortable with all the essentials. Only downfall is lots of stairs. For a shared space it felt very private. Definitely a good spot!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb stay was great! Stayed the weekend with my boyfriend and loved the close walk to Tad’s Deli and the beach/boardwalk! :)
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay! A few minutes walk to the beach. It was nice because it wasn’t to far from the beach but away from all the traffic! Would recommend.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay while visiting family in VB. Clean, quiet, and the location is perfect to walk over to the waterfront."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was just what we needed.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nataly’s top floor room was the most ideal for us compared to similarly priced hotels. We attended taco fest at the beach, and it was an easy walk. We were able to go straight up to the room which had key access, so basically it’s own apartment. The neighborhood felt very safe at all hours.
The room was immaculate! Not one speck of dust, which is always comforting and appreciated. We enjoyed the balcony overlooking the pond. The screened slider was a nice bonus. The room was stocked with more than the standard toiletries and there was a small fridge, microwave, toaster, and dishes. There was also a Keurig for coffee and tea. The size is perfect for a couple. We only stayed one night but could see ourselves coming back."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Best of both worlds - close to the beach but private and peaceful with a great balcony view on a little river inlet. Really enjoyed our brief stay. Clean and comfortable.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely, comfortable and very clean space. Perfect for our brief stay but would work well for longer stays (if you don’t need a full kitchen). Walkable to boardwalk and restaurants, free parking and TV. Nice balcony overlooking stream. Would stay again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed for one night in April 2022, and had a great experience! The place was very clean and had a very cute balcony to sit on. The area is peaceful and it’s easy to get to beach!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very comfortable stay! Exactly as described and looks exactly as pictured. Extremely clean and lovely suite on the third floor. I was traveling for work and it was perfect for what I needed. I would definitely stay there again. If you are looking for the ceiling fan remote, it’s in the bedside dresser. :) I had to do some searching for it."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for one night as we live in the area, but it was perfect! Will book again if we just need another night or 2 away from home. Very clean & homey feeling!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Room , Highly Recommend, 5 Stars"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice cozy place with a beautiful view of the lake. We went to Virginia beach when it was chilly and so spent a good chunk of time in our airbnb and it was comfortable. Its not too far away from the beach and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. We met Nataly for a brief second but she was very considerate. Overall worth the money.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice location and space, you will enjoy this reservation!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I found the place easily. Everything was clean upon arrival. I especially liked the patio overlooking the lake (although the geese and frogs were quite noisy at night). My only issue was finding my way inside after dark. I wasn't sure where the light was and finding the keys were a bit difficult. Also it got quite warm in the middle of the night and could not get the fan to work. It wasn't a problem as I just opened the window. The coffee maker and mini fridge came in handy. Check in and check out were both very smooth.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice and reasonably private. Good location.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a comfortable and clean place to stay. Minutes the ocean and breweries.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and private suite on the third floor of a beach townhouse would be a great place even without the beach and boardwalk so close. Hosts live off-site, but were very fast to respond to our every question. You will be very fortunate if you manage to stay here."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I enjoyed our stay here. We were gone all day sightseeing so was nice to come back and relax in an enjoyable space. It was conveniently located walking distance to the beach in quiet neighborhood. I will book again if I come back!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed myself, highly recommended. Everything you need for a perfect vacation get away."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely love this place! We will definitely be booking for our trip to Virginia Beach next time! Great location, beautifully remolded and very cozy. Just as great if not better than my expectations from the pictures."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a nice, quiet location with a lovely balcony. Great for my quick trip to VA Beach."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After a long, 11 hour drive from Boston to Va Beach on Xmas day, I was gifted with an Xmas meal from Nataly. I can't say enough about how wonderful it was to land in Nataly's home. Besides her being a warm, and kind soul, her place is immaculate! Also, it has an incredibly peaceful feel, and the view from the room is so serene. If you are traveling to Va Beach, do not hesitate to book with Nataly. You will be quite happy!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for the one night we stayed. Nice and clean! It was as described.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, enjoyable stay. Exactly as advertised."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are wanting a private little getaway then this is the perfect place. It felt as if we were by ourselves completely so the privacy was a big plus. You are in walking distance of a lot of restaurants and the beach. This place was just amazing all around.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place w beautiful surroundings and also very close to the beach. Highly recommend

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it was amazing, Nataly is the best and the room is just amazing."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nataly’s Airbnb in Virginia Beach is beautifully decorated with a modern beachy vibe and very tidy. The location is within walking distance to the beach area. Great for biking too. She suggested a few very nice restaurants when I asked. The bed was very comfortable. Nice shower too. Lovely stay.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great sweet lil spot to unwind and relax after beach time and/ or shopping nearby. Beach towels and accessories not provided but they have rentals at beach. Check out 19th st on Saturdays for fresh market and tag sales/ murals..
bike rentals a must as you can enjoy riding on boardwalk. Doc Taylors is great for eating out, and if your into spanish food, Criollo is a must!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nataly was very communicative and helpful. Our stay was seamless from checking in to checking out. The room itself was extremely clean, well kept, and private. It felt like the whole place was to ourselves rather than just a private room, and the location is amazing."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is very nice and spacious. Everything is squeaky clean and Nataly responds to messages quickly.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Room For A Great Price Would Highly Recommend 5⭐️
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No surprises & a lovely little suite with everything I needed to enjoy a couple days at the beach! Would love to return. There is no real freezer for anything other than ice cubes, so I had to polish off the entire pint of Ben & Jerry’s the first night. Darn! Thanks to the hosts!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nataly’s place is great! It’s in a great location, and the price is a steal. There were tons of supplies offered, and the room was spotless. We will definitely be back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,just what we needed for a quick trip! thanks Nataly ☺️
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nataly's place was the perfect getaway spot. It was immaculate and everything we needed was available. The 3rd floor was perfect for us . We ate dinner on the balcony and enjoyed the landscape and the ducks on the pond. Very quiet and peaceful. We do plan to return if possible next year. Only 3 blocks from the beach.
Stephen and Velma Oct. 1, 2021"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful room on the top floor, perfect size for two people. The room is on the top floor which means there are a number of steps to climb to get to it but I feel as though they added to the sense of privacy. The shower had nice hot water when allowed to warm up. The fridge kept things nice and cold. The parking space was a good size, could be a little cramped for bigger cars but our mini van fit perfectly fine. Over all a very good stay."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a gorgeous, quiet retreat Nataly’s place is the one. The entire space is clean, neat, and stocked with all the amenities you could want. The lake view from the upper deck is absolutely gorgeous. You’ll enjoy watching the waterfowl everyday. Nataly was a gracious and welcoming host. We will definitely be back again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place easy to get into
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great space. Very comfortable, very clean, designated parking space. It was a great location, just a quick walk to the beach/dining/activities."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wayyyyyyy better option than the resorts on the beachfront! VERY clean and spacious enough for 2 people. My friend and I thought this stay was very good value for our money! Nataly was also very accommodating in letting us leave our luggage to explore until our evening flight.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely, quiet space. Walking distance to the beach and Rudee Inlet. Lots of nice, simple touches to make it a perfect space for a couple's getaway. We'll be back."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay with Nataly. Everything was as described. Convenient location within walking distance to the beach/boardwalk, marinas, and restaurants. Nice to have the fridge, microwave and coffee maker!
Nataly was very accommodating and flexible, kindly allowing for early check in and to leave my bags after check out time until departing for a later flight.
Would definitely recommend and would stay again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is perfect! Just a 5-10 min walk from the beach! There is a lot of food around but just not quite anything we fully enjoyed. People in the nearby areas such as food places were a little rude as we are Hispanic, we didn’t want to think that was a factor but we could tell it s definitely was as other people were treated differently! Thankfully Nataly was amazing always so quick to reply to any messages sent. Overall this place is amazing would have to definitely recommend and just if your looking for a good place to eat
Beach Bella pizza 2 is just a 3 min drive and the good here is amazing also workers here were very nice."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Not only is this place a very short walk from a great area of the beach, but the small balcony off the back looks out on a creek. We really enjoyed watching the herons come in early in the morning while we drank our coffee. The short walk was perfect to spend a day lounging on the beach with multiple different shops and restaurants nearby. The apartment was just off the main street and there was very little noise from the traffic and other tourists."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about this property. It was beautiful, clean, secluded, close to the beach and offered so much more. If you are looking for a great place to stay, you would be extremely satisfied staying at Nataly's!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! A nice distance from the beach so it was in easy reach but we weren’t overwhelmed by the boardwalk. The apartment was clean and easily accessible, it suited us perfectly. Nataly was easy to get in touch with and provided clear instructions."

Definitely recommend this place!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is super cute and cozy! The best part is that it’s only a short walk to the VA beach boardwalk! On the boardwalk there are countless amounts of restaurants and shops. It was a great place to stay for a mini vacation. I would definitely stay here again!
