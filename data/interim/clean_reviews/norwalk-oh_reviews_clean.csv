The is an extra mirror in the hallway that helped when we were in need. Kitchen is stocked well and we had a cute little welcome basket when we arrived.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place to stay in and very commutative.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,There's no thermostat. Very inconvenient to contact the host to change the temperature or even see the temperature. Folks in the other unit in the duplex were loud.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,This unit is in a great location in Norwalk. It’s close to restaurants and shopping. Adequate parking and easy access inside with a keypad.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay at Steve’s place. He was very responsive to questions from the beginning to end of our stay. We will be back to stay again!
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Steve was nice and accommodating.
Unhappily though house was disappointingly dirty and was my second worst bnb stay in ten years.
I am particular about things feeling clean. There was mouse dirt along the baseboards in the bedrooms, bathroom, and laundryroom, which we vacuumed. There were no plates, a cracked glass was in the cupboard and the cupboards were sticky, we had wash everything before using it. Thankfully there was a washer and dryer because the comforter on the bed had food stuck on it, and chips and crumbs fell out of the extra blanket on the couch. We washed everything before using it.
As a super host myself, I know rodent and pest control can be a challenge but the lack of cleanliness made it feel like no real effort is being made to make guests comfortable.
If you need a place to stay, the house was in a nice neighborhood and Steve was nice, just bring your own bedding and prepare to do some cleaning or be willing to overlook some dirt."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cute little place was perfect for what we needed. We were visiting family for the holidays. Traveled with 4 bigger kids and 2 infants. There was ample bed space and a decent sized kitchen. Steve was very responsive any time I needed something. Check in and check out was very simple. We felt very safe in this neighborhood and any shopping or food you may want is very close by. We would stay again. If I had to give the place a downfall, I would say it's not having temperature control in the unit, we were a little chilly, but I just put the kids in warm jammies and have them blankets."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great Airbnb to stay at. Everything was exactly as stated in the description! The host was awesome and very responsive I would definitely book Steve’s home again!

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We only stayed one night but it was close to the area we needed. The house was clean and it was everything the description had indicated.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We had 5 total in our party and the sofa bed didn’t have its own linens, I had one sleep on the blanket provided, but for the cost and that it’s advertised as being useful for those visiting parks 1/2 an hour away it seemed a fourth set of sheets and maybe a pillow was warranted."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean , close to Ohio Turnpike, a little distance to Cedar Point. Neighborhood’s quit , very dark and standard. Steve is great at responding to your text."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was nicely furnished, however, it would have been helpful if the post informed us we would not be able to control the air or heat. When we informed the host we were cold, he informed us there was no thermostat and never resolved our issue. We used the oven to warm the unit as it was unseasonably cold. There were also areas such as the door (covered with grime), trash can (lid was covered with food drippings) and light switches which were dirty. The lack of a curtain or shade on the front door that had a large window was a concern for us and we made a makeshift one with a towel. The owner was gracious enough to allow us a late check out, but unfortunately forgot until we provided screenshots of the correspondence. We didn't have an awful experience, but it wasn't what we expected."

If I could post pictures on here, I would show for proof ."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another good stay at John’s place. Only issue this time was the wash machine leaked while running a load.

I still feel the place is a good value, it’s a whole house for a minimal cost, and would stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I enjoyed John’s place! The area was very quiet and peaceful. It was clean and just enough for our little family. Ideal if you are traveling alone, with your significant other or a few friends. Small and cozy. Minutes away from shopping outlets, Kalahari & Cedar point, and various food places. Check in/out was easy and seamless. I wouldn’t mind staying in John’s place again! I definitely recommend checking it out!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John's place was just the right amount for our quick stop during a long trip. Self check-in made our late entry, early exit smooth and convenient."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,As advertised
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Traveling to Sandusky Ohio for a weekend of fun at Kalahari, decided to spent a night the day before after traveling. Chose to stay at John's place with my wife and toddler, found the space perfect for our needs and had the essentials we needed for our stay provided. Very close proximity to everything you could need, would absolutely stay again in the future."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for great stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value and another great stay in Norwalk!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John was super quick in his communication and made our last-minute stay very seamless. Cleanliness was 4.6 out of 5 stars, but all in all it was a good place for us to stay the night on our trip. That’s all we needed. Location is very decent for traveling across I-80/90 and even closer to US-20."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for our needs.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as advertised!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place for an overnight stay! Close to cedar point
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great space for our one night stay. They were able to accommodate our last minute booking and was a great price. Space looked exactly like the photos!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great experience. Nice place to stay in a nice location.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Pretty good place for the night
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,John’s place was perfect after a long day at Cedar Point! It was very clean and had everything that we needed. I’d definitely come back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, responsive"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,clean and it all works
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little 1 bed room house. Perfect for a couples trip to cedar point!
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place is not bad overall, but it probably should not be listed for 4 people. Our children are teens and the pull-out couch is not quite what I expected for a pull-out couch. If you have 2 toddlers or are just a couple looking for a place for a few days it would be fine.
Bathroom doesn't have much privacy either, slotted folding door and right off the living room and bedroom so if you're doing your business everyone will know. Again, for just a couple probably not a big deal.
Overall it's a decent place and pretty well maintained, just didn't work for a family of 4 with 2 teens. John did accept a refund request for the second night that was enough to get a room at the local holiday inn express."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy to find, clean and a great pit stop after the races."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Suited our needs for the weekend! Thanks!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Is just what I needed a simple place for a few days. Gelt cozy. Unassuming Great restaurant literally steps away across the street. Very nice. Would stay again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This spot was close to everything we needed to be at and the host was very responsive!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"John was an amazing host, he responded very quickly. I would stay again and recommend anyone to stay there."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Easy check in. We noticed the bed sheets were dirty with short dog hair, and the pillow cases looked dirty. I notified John and he called me right away. He stated his cleaning crew are excellent but would offer to have sheets brought to us or we could wash our own and he would refund our cleaning fee. We decided to wash our own. We also noticed there was no dish towel to dry our dishes, only paper towels which was a limited amount. There were no salt and pepper to cook with or a large mixing bowl for making scrambled eggs.
John did refund our cleaning fee. For being a small cottage, it worked for our trip to Cedar Point."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute smaller rental. Perfect for our quick stop while passing through.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay after the races
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks for the stay! Had a great time and great location, close to the track"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John was fantastic as a host! He was extremely responsive and even had his team bring us an additional sheet set and towels within a half hour.
The place was really cute. We had a family of four. I personally think the space would be best for a family of two, as the couch wasn't the most comfortable for two.
The grass was a bit overgrown, so we couldn't get out and play in the backyard. I also didn't see any corn hole boards or chairs in the back, which I thought was in the description.
All in all, the house was great! It was really convenient and located close enough to all the festivities. It came in handy for us.
I would recommend this house."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John was a responsive host and the property was perfect for the weekend
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,John was super responsive for a last minute stay! It was easy to find and check in. The place was perfect for my travel needs.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host is VERY responsive with communication. The place is adorable, clean, quiet and the perfect place to stay for a couple to stay. Definitely would rent again!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very nice host, very beautiful place the backyard was something else entirely, absolutely breathtaking trees, it’s so cozy and wonderful"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect place to stay during a Cedar Point trip. The bed was very comfy and our son slept well on the pull out couch. Kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed to feel right at home.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Kitchen well-stocked and host responsive. Was great to have AC.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Jon is a great host. Place is a little small
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying and was as good as the first. Yes it’s a small space, but yes it is a great value and has everything you need for a good stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would absolutely stay here aging.
2023-03-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"John was a responsive host. The house does have a musty smell that hits you when you walk in the door, and the standing water from outside may have permeated the floors inside as they felt wet as well."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It’s a tiny home! It’s so adorable. I would guess it was just built. It’s well laid out. Perfect for a couple or small family. John is super responsive… matter of minutes or even seconds. I asked a question and put the phone down. He responded and then called when I didn’t respond right away just to make sure I was taken care of. I would stay here before any 5 star hotel.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quick night stay, it was a nice little place"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place to stay 20 minutes away from Kalahari which is where we were visiting. Only stayed for two nights and it was great 👍🏼
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John’s place was a bargain. Sure it wasn’t big, but it was a private place all to yourself! Probably the only con was it seemed like the auto function on the heater didn’t work well to keep the whole house warm. Note that there is just a wall mounted a/c and heater so if you’re staying in summer it may get a bit warm in the bedroom. But again, it was definitely a bargain for having your own place and I would stay there again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy place it was a a great place to just get away for a few days very relaxing
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"my husband and I visited kalahari and decided to stay at John's place instead of the kalahari resort.
perfect location, the house was cozy just like the pictures. easy check-in. John was very responsive, he answered us soon after messaging.
we will definitely be choosing this place when we are in town again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was great! John was very accommodating on short notice.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love the privacy and it was clean and just I needed to get away the host was very responsive and nice thank you
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice place to stay. Very cozy and clean. Only thing i would mention is to bring your own pillows as the ones there were on the flat side. Over all we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great weekend getaway place. Place was perfect for two of us. Spotless too. John was easy to get in touch with for any questions. Would definitely stay again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John's place is a great find for the price. The apartment is simple and adequate for 3, it would be a tight fit with 4. Everything worked and was as described online. Check in/out was simple and easy."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"John was a fantastic host. Very responsive and easy to communicate with. Super friendly and flexible. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a remote, quaint place to stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little cabin, nice and clean."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check in, great communication, & very cute place in the perfect location!
John was extremely helpful for this last-minute booking. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really cute place and close to a lot of things. Perfect stay!
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The owner was kind and very responsive, and the place was relatively clean with a smart tv in the living space as well as the bedroom.
However, this space is not what was expected. From the description and photos on the listing, it appears that it is a house in a relatively secluded area with lots of open room (outdoors and indoors), but that was not the case. The place is more like an in-laws suite, and was on the same lot as another house, meaning it was basically smashed in between two houses. Additionally, the bathroom didn’t have a real door on it. It was just an accordion style closet door, so there’s limited to no privacy."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean , cozy and comfortable. I really liked it. I will visit again next year. The area was nice quiet. However we can in late and only stayed the night but all went well😁"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Delighted to find this comfy, cozy, dog-friendly place to call home for a few days! Easy access, easy parking, quiet neighborhood. There’s a train beyond the woods but I think I only heard it once. Smart TVs, so I could “cast” from my devices. All the amenities I could want. Thanks a bunch, I hope to be back!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Worth the money! Cute and has all the essentials
2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"There was a wasp infestation when we arrived late in the evening with our two children. It was a dismal situation and a difficult night. We ended up staying less than seven hours. John's solution of having us leave the place at 11:00pm was unattainable as our children were exhausted after a day of driving and were already asleep. There was also hair in the shower. I didn't even ask for a full refund just a token of recognition for how difficult this was for us and he would not accept that responsibility. I ended up calling Airbnb and they assisted me with a partial refund and also told me what to do incases like this.
So if you ever find yourself in an airbnb place that feels:
Unsafe
Unclean
Has a pest problem
Or does not meet with your understanding of the description
You should document it with photo's and a video and leave immediately, contact the host and airbnb as soon as possible and get a hotel if no other solution is found.
I love small places and enjoyed all the airbnb we have stayed in on this trip but this was a real let down."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay if road-tripping with your pup! This comfy little house is well-appointed with everything you need for a night or a few—I was very impressed with the kitchen especially! The backyard is a great quiet place to play with your dog and potty them, especially if your dog has a bad habit of getting distracted by anything and everything (like mine does). The bed was SUPER comfy. John’s responses to messages were nearly instantaneous and we so appreciated how easy he made booking/checking in. We will definitely book again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place with everything we needed. We had a great time!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, cozy place! Easy to find. John, is a great host! Would recommend! Such a cute little place!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place. Well stocked kitchen. Quality bath towels, nice pillows. Initially I was concerned about the neighborhood however it was a quiet area and we were able to rest well at night."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was perfect for our trip to Kalahari and Cedar Point. It is cozy, clean, and comfortable. We had 4 people stay, two slept on the pull out couch (which was comfy) and 2 slept in the bedroom. No complaints here and the host was always quick to reply."
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most noticeable thing about this listing is the size. For the price, I feel like the listing and the amenities offered were absolutely not worth it. The bathroom was okay but the door isnt a ""real"" door so there is really no privacy when using the restroom and the shower was so small that it was uncomfortably cramped. The floors had crumbs all over and the rug that was definitely supposed to be white was a grayish color from not being cleaned in so long. Luckily we brought our own sheets and blankets because there was a gross white stain on the blanket. And the bedroom was incredibly small - you cant even open or shut the door properly. The host was very nice and communucated well, but offered to let us check out 3 hours late at a rate of $20/hour if we left cash on the counter, which he texted me about rather than message me on Airbnb since thats not allowed. Definitely would not stay again unless the price was maybe half. I've paid way less for much nicer listings."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A cozy and clean place to stay. John’s communication was excellent. Check-in and check-out was great and easy to do.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great! Was the perfect size for my boyfriend and I for a 2 night stay! Close to a few restaurants and grocery stores! The unit was very clean and organized and the host was very easy to communicate with!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. We both enjoyed our stay. It was clean and comfortable, so overall we were happy with our stay and would recommend it."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place! Comfortable and well kept 😊 ac worked great! Hot water for the shower and nice water pressure. Best for 2 people but 3 or 4 could work on couch/bed
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great last minute stay after cedar point! Very helpful and responsive.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay !
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and updated place. John was quick to respond and very informative. The place is very clean and relaxing. Loved sitting in the back in the evening watching the fireflies.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was great! The location was perfect for the events we were going to and it was very cute and clean! The host was very kind and communication was great! Answered all of my questions. It was much appreciated!
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A nice cozy space and the perfect landing pad for a convention. Hope you don't mind train horns.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give a 10/10 on any Airbnb listing, it would be this one. We walked in as guests & left feeling like family.
As soon as we arrived, Annette gave us a lovely tour of her beautiful home. She welcomed us with a contagious smile and such a friendly personality. She cooked us lovley breakfasts every morning and we spent hours chatting about traveling, food, life & other fun topics!
Annette’s Airbnb smelled wonderful, its was pristinely clean, and her two kitties Luna & Evie were so loving and friendly. She was extremely quick to respond, gave amazing restaurant recommendations, & went above & beyond to provide dairy free options at breakfast.
If you are looking for a safe, clean, warm & delightful place to rest your head, I highly doubt I can recommend a better place. Thank you for being so welcoming to us Annette, thank you for all of your kindness.
We will absolutely come back & look forward to it! Give Luna & Evie some pets for us until then! <3"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, Anette was a wonderful host who went above and beyond to make me feel welcomed."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Annette was so sweet and friendly, she thought of everything you could possibly need and put it in her home for you. For example, she had a little go box of stuff in case you forgot something from home and a counter with snacks. The breakfasts she provided were homemade and so yummy. Her home is beautiful like a farmhouse theme. Provided comfy blankets and bedding. Everything was so clean and organized. Thank you for your amazing hospitality! She also gave me traveling tips to other countries and states! Thank you again for everything! I would stay here again 100%."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Annette is super friendly and her home is absolutely beautiful. She did a great job modernizing the old house and turning it into her home. Every morning she makes a different breakfast at the time of your choosing and she never disappointed. Annette is big into “farm to table” and try’s hard to show that in her meals. With farm fresh eggs, to sausage links from a butcher, and an assortment of jams that were made fresh. As stated previously Annette is super friendly and we had a lot in common. Every morning we talked for an hour over breakfast. Her friendliness is obviously contagious because her cats Luna and Evee were also friendly and just wanted to be petted and cuddle. Annette also had access to different streaming services like Netflix, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime if you just wanted to relax with watching something after a long day. And go ahead and ask her for recommendations because she has some great ones. Even a show that I will be watching at home now. I highly recommend 10/10"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Absolutely phenomenal. Annette went above and beyond to make sure to make me feel at home and always made sure I was comfortable. Whatever supplies I needed, she had. Communication was very timely, clear, and concise. Never once felt unsafe nor stressed here - in fact, being an anxious person myself, I found myself quite calm and relaxed while staying here. Wholly the definition of vacation! I would absolutely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Came to Norwalk for the solar eclipse. Had a fantastic time staying with Annette as well! Very friendly, gave lots of good, local advice, and had a nice clean house.
She made great breakfasts with fresh ingredients and even offered dinner one night since the restaurants in town were expected to be full. Knew the best spot to watch the eclipse as well.
Norwalk is a nice small town. Some good restaurants within walking distance."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Turned out we had lots more in common with Annette than we expected. The house has been very tastefully and conveniently remodeled; very comfortable--hey, we even enjoyed for the first time picking our favorite tunes with Alexa! We look forward to returning (s0 we can visit our middle son who lives near by)."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was lovely staying with Annette! Her house was welcoming and the cats were super friendly. If I ever comeback to Ohio I would love to stay with her again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect in every way....charming room and house, delicious breakfast, Annette is both personable and discrete. Near Edison birthplace and the Osborn Metro Park for Saturday parkruns."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Annette is a fabulous host. Her house is very clean and organized. She prepared a great breakfast. Annette is very kind and helpful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The hostess was very welcoming as well as accommodating. I really loved the décor design and the interior was beautiful. I will definitely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our time here. Just great fun with all of our older children who took advantage of the fishing, kayaking, and hot tub and just spent entire weekend outside and really enjoyed it. This is our 2nd time renting the same cabin. Middle of nowhere but right around the corner from everything you need."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,It was wonderful!
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,What a great little spot. The lake is beautiful with fantastic fishing. We really enjoyed the sunsets and grilling out back. The hot tub was also a great touch. Would definitely come back.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay, it’s beautiful out here. Had a Great time fishing and cooking out on the back patio."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful place. Even better then the pictures. We loved waking up in the morning to the view of the lake.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a hidden gem. Would recommend to anyone wanting a family getaway.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A truly extraordinary experience! We had the best time staying here for a few days. It felt like the most peaceful getaway. The cabin is so lovely; it’s clean, cozy, and had everything we needed for our stay. The views are simply incredible too—the private lake right out the back added to the serene experience. And my husband was thrilled to catch a large mouth bass while fishing! We will absolutely be booking here again in the future! Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice place, enjoyed the extra firewood and early check in time. Thanks so much!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and so peaceful. Will rent again!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is insanely beautiful. The cabin is lovely and brand new. The lake it’s on is so beautiful, and hanging out in the hot tub was a highlight for us. It’s a great spot to host a small reunion or gathering. The beds were all very comfortable and the hosts were responsive. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the second time we stayed at Colecreek acres , and it was even more fun the second time . The hot tub was relaxing , we made s’mores , and sat around the fire. The kids loved the 18 acre lake, and were so excited to catch some blue gill. Larry is a great host. He is always a message away with a very quick response. He even was flexible with our check in time . We will definitely be returning again ."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,this is beautiful place!! 😍 we didn't use the hottub but it was a nice feature! as soon as we got there we felt cozy and relaxed! place was clean and had everything we needed! deff would love to return here some day!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cabin is new and very nice, the quarry is amazing."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was the perfect cabin for a getaway. Very clean, peaceful and beautiful. I recommend this spot to anyone!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Had a very nice time. The cabin had a lot of space and also felt cozy. The area felt tucked away in nature but was also very close to conveniences and attractions. Having only one bathroom without a tub wasn’t ideal for my family of 6 with young children. Overall it was very enjoyable.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family of 10 very much enjoyed our stay at the cabin. We walked in the woods. Drove to nearby towns. Played games and relaxed inside. He was very responsive to any requests we had and went out of his way to make sure we had a smooth stay. The cabin had a nice division of space so kids had an area and adults had their own space but also plenty of room for all of us to be together- and even space for everyone to sit to eat which can be hard to find for a group as big as ours. We found a little winery near by and went to see Lake Erie too. Overall a very relaxing weekend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of the best places we stayed. Very peaceful and my family love every moment over there. You forget about all your problems when you’re there looking to the lake. Thanks for everything we can’t wait to go back on Summer.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. It was a nice peaceful area but you could go 10 to 20 minutes into town and where you would have lots to do. Nice little town with little shops very cute.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, would come back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,I thought the cabin and the lake were absolutely beautiful and serene!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quaint cabin with a lake view you can’t beat. Waking with that beautiful view was worth while. Very clean and nice cabin. Got a little chilly in the living room at night but nothing a warm blanket can’t fix. Overall a very nice stay that I would love to do again
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a grand old time
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect for our stay - highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"5 stars - would stay here again and would recommend. Really beautiful well built cabin.
Some of downsides: Only 1 bathroom. Would have been close to perfect with another one in the walkout basement. Also, there was some noticeable dust and hair in the drawers, but would not deter me from staying here. We did notice some sort of sulfur smell in the air outside the cabin. I’m not sure what that was. It was December and cold, so we were not outside much.
Positives: Beautiful cabin. Beds are comfortable. There is sufficient storage (empty dressers, drawers all around bed, lots of coat hooks). Some basics (olive oil; S&P; lots of pans: coffee and filters). There is a small shampoo, soap, etc. provided, but I would recommend bringing your own. Hot tub was a nice feature (there was some sand in it from previous guests). Upstairs is a fun getaway for children. I would say ~5 kids could probably sleep up there. Watch your head on the wood beam from the top bunk though! Lots of games too!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cute, cozy cabin in a rural setting was a fun stay for our family. The host was responsive and the cabin was well stocked. We had fun paddling on the lake, skipping stones along the creek, and firewood was provided for a nice campfire in the evening. We had a great time and would highly recommend this property."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful and beautiful retreat…snuggled in a quiet place that is near to everything….the cabin was beautiful and well appointed with all of the amenities…with a soothing and relaxing view of the lake….near by to Norwalk for restaurants, shops and grocery store even though it feels worlds away….the host was very communicative and most accommodating….we will most definitely be returning…this weekend was a very special weekend for us and this was the perfect place to spend it…"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I rented out the cabin last minute for my boyfriend birthday. It was amazing our favorite area was the hot tub and the views of the lake.
Would definitely come back when cedar point opens and recommend to others"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This beautiful house was the perfect Thanksgiving getaway for my family. The open concept led to lots of fun together with just enough spacing that we did not feel like we were on top of each other. The hot tub was great and we got to watch a bald eagle catch some dinner! Thank you for providing the perfect space!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely marvelous!!! Will be staying again! This was a great space to relax after work.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Girls weekend, very inviting and relaxing, thanks"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We're back after 3 wonderful weeks at the cabin and still blown away by the experience. The property and the host were perfect in every way! The cabin is cozy, well-equipped, clean and perfectly situated by a beautiful lake. We enjoyed sitting by the fire pit in the evenings and soaking in the hot tub. Although there is a tiny house on the property, it felt very private and peaceful. It's just the right place for a quiet getaway. And Larry is the perfect host: communication was great, he was always quick to help and very friendly!
We came all the way from Germany and found the cabin perfectly situated for doing lots of day trips: We went to the Holden Arboretum, several state parks, Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the National Museum of the USAF, Kelleys Island, the Ohio State Reformatory, Cedar Point, Columbus & Cleveland. And we fell in love with the beautiful town of Norwalk and met a lot of lovely Ohioans. Can't wait to be back in the U.S. next year!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a beautiful place very hard to drive down to and at first a little hard to find. Otherwise it is a beautiful place.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and beautiful Location.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay! Beautiful area!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely stay. Everything was as pictured or described. Plenty of room, personal driveway for our car, great hot tub, good kayak, and canoe and a great porch to sit up and relax. The lake was big and we had fun paddling across it.
The neighbors are visible but not super close so it still felt private and relaxing. The driveway had plenty of room for multiple cars. The kitchen was well stocked and had everything we needed. The town of Norwalk is about 10 minutes or so away and there are places to eat, Walmart is also close. I recommend walking around downtown Norwalk they had great antique shops and boutiques.
We would come and stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"I'm from Norwalk originally. We were in town for my niece's wedding and needed a place to stay. The cabin far surpassed my expectations. We took full advantage of the fire pit and hot tub. It was a busy weekend, but we managed to fit in some canoeing as well. Very comfortable. I think we found our new place to stay when visiting family!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful setting! Our family of 2 adults and 6 kids enjoyed a wonderfully relaxing stay. The kids fished for hours and also enjoyed kayaking and swimming. We walked the trail and spent some time at the creek on the property. The hot tub was great, too! The cabin was clean and had everything we needed. We hope to visit again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place was beautiful. The tiny home next to us was no bother at all, still felt private and peaceful. Great place for friends to kick it. Fire wood was already there, hot tub was clean and ready to go, would highly recommend!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Second time staying here!!! Great stay both times. Love the area, extremely clean home, beautiful views, everything you need, 100% accurate listing.. this place is awesome!!! Highly recommended!! Larry is a great host!!! Super responsive and helpful with everything, definitely goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great stay!! Thank you for everything!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome cabin to stay in! We had a group of friends come to celebrate a life milestone and it was the perfect place to connect and relax. Beautiful natural area close to some fun wineries and very relaxing. Larry was also very quick to respond to my questions and so willing to go the extra mile when we left a piece of luggage behind. Will absolutely recommend and stay in the future!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place to stay with family. Water was beautiful, wouldn’t recommend swimming with all the rain. Trails are awesome house was super cozy deff a place I would come back to."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place! We really enjoyed using the kayaks and the canoe. Our biggest regret was not bringing some fishing poles! The house was very nice, clean, and was what we expected based on the description. Thanks for providing a beautiful home fornus to stay in."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful cabin on a picture perfect lake. We loved floating in the lake all weekend and relaxing!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful place to stay. Great fishing with an abundance of fish. Peaceful up to date home in a quiet location. Lived everything it had to offer. From the fishing, kayaking, and relaxation time in the hot tub, this luxurious cabin was far better then a 5 star hotel. Recommendations of a 10 out of a 10."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had an excellent stay at the house. My three kids loved it and took advantage of the fishing and kayaking. Everything was clean, comfortable, and well maintained. The property was beautiful and was exactly what we were looking for. Larry was super responsive and had great communication throughout the stay. He even gave me and my two oldest a tour of the whole property and area in his UTV. Overall, it was one of the best Airbnb’s we have used and would go back in a heartbeat. It was the perfect place to go back to after a day of activities or just to chill out and relax there for the day. It was a really great and memorable family vacation. Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was so great! The cabin is gorgeous and comfortable. We had 4 adults and 5 kids and all fit perfectly. The property was amazing and we spent most of our time outside enjoying fishing and swimming. We grilled, made s’mores and loved soaking in the hot tub. Our hosts were great and brought us more firewood. 10/10 recommend. We would definitely return!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Wow what a great place to stay! We had seven people total and we could all comfortably fit there. Lots of fun things to do and the place was beautiful. Would definitely recommend!

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Larry was easy to talk to and communicate with! Loved the pond, hot tub, and fire pit."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was a great location for what we were looking for! Beautiful place with lots of space and amenities. The whole place was very clean and the kitchen was well stocked with helpful supplies. We had a very unexpected tornado warning while our stay and the place felt very solid and comfortable to weather out the storm. Larry was responsive and considerate concerning the situation and through the rest of our communication.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Me and my family had a great time!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved the cabin it was so peaceful and relaxing!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We wanted a beautiful, peaceful environment to enjoy some intimate family time and we were not disappointed. Absolutely zero complaints about this 'little-big' cabin on the lake! Our group consisted of 9 people and we were quite comfortable. From the young adults enjoying the kayak and canoe, to my 5yr. old granddaughter's desire to get in the hot-tub even before breakfast! I was concerned that one bathroom would be a problem but it was not - not a single emergency occurred 😊 We found the people in the community to be very friendly. There is a nice park a few minutes away. It was equipped with plenty to do for all of the ages in our group. They enjoyed playing basketball with new friends and the youth wore their uncle out! The big plus is being close to both Cedar Point and Kalahari. However, I believe the best memories were made on the lake around the bon fire.
Thank you Larry! This was the perfect place to celebrate the life and cherish the memories of my daughter."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely beautiful cabin! Water on the lake was beautiful and the cabin itself was amazing. Definitely going to be back.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home and location were great. Felt like had enough privacy and got away from it all but yet still around the corner for everything you needed if forgot something. Accommodations were comfortable for our large family with only exception is one bathroom for a group of 6 was kinda rough, especially when all adults. But wouldn’t let that deter another stay in the future, was great fun! Loved the hot tub with the view! Owner is close by and stopped a few times to ensure we had what we needed. Would recommend for sure."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a 5 star place! Very relaxing and peaceful setting, beautiful views, fishing was great, nice trails to walk on. The cabin is clean and spacious, everything worked perfect."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would recommend this cabin to anyone. It was super clean, secluded but still close to restaurants, & everything is very well kept. The kayaking was a blast on the beautiful lake & the hot tub was an added bonus to sit in & relax in the evening. There was no traffic noise or noise of any sort which made for a very relaxing & peaceful night! I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place and stay! Larry was a great communicator. Enjoyed our time immensely!
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was nice and it was fun to have access to the lake and kayaks, but there is a tiny home on the property that was not mentioned in the listing anywhere. The last night we were there they had a small party which made things not as relaxing and secluded as we were expecting. The access road to the tiny home passes by the cabin so between people coming and going, the noise from the party and the fact that it was close enough with no trees or anything to block the view (we could see/hear them, they could see us in the hot tub, at the fire pit etc) it seems a bit over priced for how secluded the listing makes it sound. With all the rules they have in place for noise and parties it would have at least been nice to have been given a heads up about the tiny home and the gathering there."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Having the lake right there at the house made activities so easy and affordable! The kayaks were fun, too. I liked not having to leave the house to fish and get some sun. Didn't have time to explore the woods but definitely nice to have that all there! It was so peaceful and would love to plan another getaway in the future."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay at the cabin for a girls getaway weekend. The lake was so peaceful and serene for kayaking and just viewing from the hot tub or fire pit. Larry was very helpful and responsive to questions leading up to our visit. Did not expect such a hidden gem so close to home (Cleveland and Columbus).
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our little getaway. Larry was very attentive, he brought us fire wood. He was even able to accommodate us when we wanted to stay an extra night. The cabin was stunning, the lake was a perfect view. We utilized the kayaks and went fishing. We will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We truly enjoyed our stay. The cabin was clean and had all amenities we needed. The landscape and scenery were beautiful. We loved the privacy. Perfect place to fish, kayak, hot tub and relax. Highly recommend. Thanks so much Larry. We will be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,went to the cabin with my family to celebrate my 30th birthday . very quiet and beautiful location. the hot tub was very relaxing :)!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry's place is peaceful and beautiful. Everything we needed was in the house, and we had a wonderful weekend. Everything was clean and as described! We hope to return. Thanks Larry!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The property was gorgeous and the house was well taken care of. Great quality air bnb.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I brought a few of my Girl Scouts here for a couple nights over Spring Break, we loved it! The girls played in the sand and the lake most of the time. The kayaks were a great activity that comes with the rental! I thoroughly enjoyed the huge and relaxing hot tub. We all loved the looks of the cabin and the layout was perfect with separate hang out rooms and plenty of beds/sofas. We are making plans to go back. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a serene quiet get away! The cabin is spotless and is stocked with anything you would need.
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed with some friends here and we had a great time. House had everything we needed and everyone enjoyed the lake, fire pit, and the hot tub. Larry was responsive and even dropped us off more firewood without us even asking for it. Thanks, Larry!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay. It is a beautiful cabin and very peaceful to stay at. The lake was beautiful. The whole family had a blast at the beach, fishing, jacuzzi and kayaks. The hosts were always quick to answer any questions and help in any way."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow!! This place was by far one the nicest places (airbnb or hotel)I’ve stayed in! So incredibly peaceful and relaxing , the kayaking was such a blast even In the cold weather cause it was amazing to warm iight up in the hottub by the fire after!
We had a few friends for a birthday and everyone was in such awe at this place and it’s surroundings! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A CHILL PEACEFUL GETAWAY WITH SOME FAMILY OR FRIENDS!
And the host was super responsive and nice even gave us a little bit of a later checkout to accommodate! Super nice, definitely attentive and responsive to guests!
Thanks for an amazing stay!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Beautiful! We loved staying here. Very clean, comfortable, cozy, and quiet. We visited in March, when it wasn't quite warm enough to swim or use the beach, but I could see it being a really nice place to visit in the summer, too. Everything in the cabin seemed brand new and sturdy, nothing run down or musty in here. Beautiful wood interior with three levels. My 10 year old loved having his own loft with a bunk bed and two bean bag chairs all to himself. I loved being able to get away and not see a single person the entire time I was on the property. We followed the advice found inside of the homemade guidebook on the coffee table and went out for Mexican food at Casa Fiesta, and also had coffee at Sheri's cafe. Both were great! 10/10! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked the cabin for a little getaway with our 3 young children . Although the weather was a bit colder than we had anticipated, we still enjoyed the lake with some light fishing and kayaking around to explore . The beach access is great and this would be even better in summer . We still enjoyed the lake views from the porch and cabin . The cabin overall was very clean and nicely decorated . The only recommendation I can give for cleanliness is the hot tub . We found some debris settled in the bottom upon our first attempt to get in. I also want to mention there are no baby gates on the stairs inside . If you have a crawling baby or young toddler this could be very worrisome . Our kids are 2,4 and 6 and were able to navigate the stairs just fine , but the youngest definitely needed some help at times . The only con is there is only one bathroom on the main level and no lock. The stairs /floors are squeaky and can be heard in other rooms . However, we still loved it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back! Loved the pond and it was so peaceful to view when in the hot tub. Kitchen was spacious and had everything we needed to have a weekend in the cabin with cooking. There was plenty of board games to play and the cabin was very clean! The host was very responsive to any questions we had.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a very new and clean cabin! It was perfect for our group of 8! Loved the basement. Also had extra tables and chairs which was so nice. Larry was very responsive and helpful!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great little spot on an awesome lake with beautiful nature surrounding it. The cabin itself is excellently built, albeit can be cramped for more than 5 people. The single bathroom is really the only downside."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay! Great place to relax and unwind with friends. Beautiful views inside and out! Would love to come back with the family. Will definitely book again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The cabin was perfect for our visit to Norwalk. Would definitely book again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Me and my friends had a blast staying here! We’re all from big cities that don’t have quite the right places to really relax in. This place is the place to go! We definitely will be coming back!

We live a little over an hour away, but we felt like we were in a different state! Perfect getaway for a weekend or longer. Absolutely will come back again this summer, do some fishing and cooking out with our family. None of us wanted to leave! We absolutely LOVED everything about this cabin!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a girls weekend and this place was perfect! We loved the quiet and beautiful location. The atmosphere inside is welcoming and clean! So was the hot tub! The owners responded very quickly and are helpful if there’s any questions. The remote needed batteries and they were down in 10 minutes to replace them. We didn’t even need the TV for our short stay though :) There are local restaurants and salons to enjoy as well! We will be returning!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The log cabin was homey with beautiful views of the lake. Just what we needed during a blizzard with -35 wind chill and -5 degrees. Warm and cozy! Everything was there to cook and serve a meal. Blankets to snuggle in and watch TV. Many board games we played. We will be back in the summer when it is hopefully warmer!!

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a beautiful cabin with lots of land to explore! The cabin says it’s meant for 10 people, I would say 10 people if at least four people are kids. Thankfully there were only 6 of us so there was enough room for two couples and two individuals. With that being said, all 6 of us said we would be back due to how roomy it was for us 6!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Don’t hesitate booking this cabin!

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place with all the amenities you need. We wanted a place where we could have things to do within range of our baby monitor while our baby slept. This place was perfect for that. Got to use the hot tub, fire pit, fish and take turns kayaking. Great stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The view of the lake from the cabin is spectacular. Slept 7 people perfectly comfortably and spacious.

The cabin has everything you need to stay and be comfortable. Would absolutely recommend staying here!! 😊"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great location with a well stocked cabin. Everything we could have wanted while we were there was available. It is really convenient to go to Cedar Point or Sandusky. There is also a ton of things to do while at the cabin. Kids had a blast playing in the water and the sand. We also enjoyed being able to kayak and throw a line in the water. Highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Cabin was amazing. Stunning views, so peaceful, and so much to do. While you felt secluded from the busy world, the short drive into the town of Norwalk was very convenient. We all had a wonderful time!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is perfect for a family getaway. We enjoyed the hot tub, lake and kayaks. The cabin was in perfect order and had everything we needed.
Communication was great from Larry."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Simply awesome!!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay! We had 6 kids with us between the ages of 12 and 16 and there was plenty of room for sleeping but also we weren't tripping over each other all day. It's very peaceful and the views are spectacular. The fishing was awesome both from the shore and off the kayaks. We were in town for a weekend at Cedar Point and it was so nice to come back to a hottub and beautiful porch instead of a stuffy hotel room. Some of the kids would have definitely skipped the park just to hang out at the cabin and fish and swim and sit in the hot tub all day. Definitely check this place out!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful private spot for all ages but still close to anything you need. Teenagers had a blast fishing and kayaking. Super clean and attentive host. It was our first time renting a house and exceeded expectations.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you are headed to Cedar Point with your family this is it. We also went to the island of Put In Bay. Super Convenient for the day trips to Lake Eerie shore. We found the perfect Spot!! This little gem is perfect for large families. Vacation can be tiring and crowded at hotels. This spot allows for your family and kids to be able to experience the outdoors and plenty of play space for down time. There is tons of room. The loft is perfect for kids and the basement perfect for teens all the while the adults have their space on the main floor. The lake is perfect. Perfect little beach area to swim or kayak. Fishing is premiere. No need to be a fisherman, every cast had a bite. Kids love to catch tons of fish. This is the place for that! The water is clear enough to see them catch the bait. Fire pit and the jacuzzi are a huge plus! Kitchen is fully stocked for cost saving for meals and snacks! Don't hesitate to push the button on this one. It will book fast. The family owned business is wonderful to communicate with and will help you with anything you may need."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was exactly as described. The house was clean and we had a comfortable nights sleep. It was easy to hear the noises from the neighbors and the street through the walls. That did not bother us, but could bother others. Our 4 year old declared ""this house is beautiful"". Rainy weather kept us indoors, so we did not get a chance to check out the playground across the street"
2024-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"Nicholas and Kristin were kind enough to accommodate us VERY last minute due to our prior listing falling through because of a cleanliness issue.

The weather wasn’t the best for us but there is a nice fire ring right outside if you get the chance to use it.
Food options within 20-45 minutes away depending on what you want.
This next comment is NOT a negative note but I want to make sure to point it out because I missed it in the (very accurate) photos. There isn’t a kitchen sink or stove. The host does to a fantastic job making it work though, there is a nice refrigerator/microwave/Keurig, well stocked with coffee and cream.

It was quiet and had just the right amount of space for us (two adults and our daughter), a great little kitchenette with coffee, and even cute Christmas decorations!
There was an issue with the heating going out right before we arrived, but Lindsay and her husband were great about communicating with us and provided an alternate heating source for our stay, which worked relatively well considering how cold it was outside. All in all, we enjoyed staying here and look forward to coming back next time we are in the area!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We needed a last minute stay so we wouldn’t have to drive back late from an event. We were delightfully surprised to find Lindsay’s place in rural Ohio near the event.

Sounds of horses, wildlife and quiet make this place so serene and peaceful. This stay was romantic and we even brought a projector for our very own drive in movie! The hardest part about this place was picking a spot to picnic, we would love to stay again and 100% recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The barn itself, the surrounding land, and hosts were all amazing. Easy to find, easy check in. The property/land is extremely well maintained—hosts are putting in a lot of effort in and outside the living space. Fire pit and hammocks are a great perk. It’s a very serene place.
Bathroom, floors, surfaces, etc—spotless. One of the cleaner Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. Powerful AC unit, everything functioned well. Comfy bed, furniture. The space is used efficiently without clutter. Seemingly safe and very quiet area.
Hosts quick to respond—I had messed something up with my booking and they were super helpful and cool about it. Overall a great value."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely serene, spacious property. Lots of private areas—the fire pit/hammocks are great and tucked away for privacy.

It was small but the layout was extremely functional. Everything was so clean, and there was a great amount of seating and places to set things which was great. Would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a nice place to stay, and we’re planning stay here again in the future when we visit our friends."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I would definitely recommend this place. It was perfect all the way around from the inside and out. I loved that we could have s’mores by the very nice fire place out back. Over all it was perfect. 100 out of 10💯

My daughter and I loved that there was water and coffee in the room , it made our busy morning so much easier.

The hosts were extremely friendly and helped with anything we could need. We had a crazy weekend and they were very flexible about check-in. You have a private driveway entrance so it's very easy to come and go as you need without feeling like you're being a bother to the main property.
Beautiful building and property with a view of some horses. Great place to find some quite and relax."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We took a step back in time in this historic, and charming 19th century home. It easily accommodated all 8 members of our party. The spacious kitchen, living room and dining room were such that we spent a lot of our time indoors, cooking, reading and rediscovering the old fashion art of conversation. This was extended to the backyard with the pit fireplace on a chilly night, we enjoyed building the fire and making smores. Walking around the reservoir and downtown were fun and picturesque. We highly recommend Betty's Homestead as we plan to visit again. Thanks to our hosts who were very responsive and helpful.
Jim and Diana"

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Hands down the most well stocked Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Everything that you might need is already there. Need place settings for 20, 37 bath towels, or 12 extra blankets? They're at Betty's. Super clean, beautiful piece of property, and lots of room to spread out. Loved our stay, and we're hoping to come back next summer."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is a great price for the size of the house and the amount of beds.
The house is fully stocked just as if it were your own home.
Very flexible and allowed us to book a night just several hours before arrival. Easy to contact owner through door cam if you’d need to. Very convenient and nice idea!
The bed on the first floor is very comfortable. The mattresses upstairs ( in the double bed room) are very firm. We are not used to super firm mattress but regardless… we preferred this home over a hotel.
We only stayed one night so we didn’t get to fully use the home.
But we would stay again and I definitely give 5 stars."

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The owner was very pleasant to speak with and she was very helpful with all my questions/concerns. She was The best part of my stay.
The place wasn't ready when we arrived. The washer/dryer were filled with someone's personal laundry and some sheets. The dishwasher was on, as well as two TVs. It felt like we had just walked into someone's active home. We communicated this to the owner and she immediately sent a maid to rectify everything. She ended sent me a small partial refund for my inconvenience. I do appreciate that.
The front door is basically unusable. It's SO VERY difficult to open/close/lock that we ended up having use the side door exclusively. If there were a fire, I don't honestly know if we could have opened that door with any level of speed.
Also there was a mouse in the downstairs parlor. I tried to get a photo/video but it was too quick for me. I understand it's an older, vintage location, so such things might me ""normal"". Still. I felt I'd need to mention it in this review.
All in all, the place was nice for it's historical value and it's location to local attractions. Would I stay here again? Likely no"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Betty's home was soo lovely and quiet. The stores are very close by, we bar b que'd and the kids played hide and seek.

Thanks for everything"
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"This is a comfortable, unique home. It is comfortably furnished with some beautiful antiques. The beds were too firm for our liking but otherwise we have no complaints. We met family there to go to Cedar Point together and it was a perfect place to stay. With 2 living room type spaces it gave the teens a place to play games and the adults a place to talk. The host was very responsive to our questions and even gave us a discount because the washer wasn't hooked up and we needed to do some laundry. (The washer is hooked up now and works great!). Would definitely stay here again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Annette is a wonderful host and you could not pick a better place to stay. The house itself is nice and homey in a quiet neighborhood perfect for relaxing. But what stands out the most is Annette's friendliness and care for all under her roof. Her breakfasts were always amazing and able to work with our changing schedule, and having snacks and little supplies like sunscreen available really made it feel like I was staying at home. She was always happy to talk and learn more about her guests, as well as give recommendations around the area. And of course the 2 kitties Luna and Eevee were the sweetest little things that made the place feel even more warm and cozy. This was one of the best AirBnB's I've ever stayed at, and I'd highly recommend that anyone planning to travel in the area stays with Annette and experiences her amazing hosting themselves."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Annette was so far above and beyond helpful and caring during our stay. She helped my son with housing as he began his new job while he was apartment shopping. She provided food and snacks and made him feel like a family member. We can’t appreciate Annette more. The entire stay was amazing. Thank you!! She’s a wonderful host and person.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Annette was the best AirBnB host I've ever had. She is super friendly, bends over backwards to make sure her guests are happy, is a really interesting person to talk to, and just fun to be around. The house is lovely and Annette takes the second B in BnB very serious - she serves home-cooked breakfast with locally sourced ingredients fresh from the farm.
Staying at Annette's felt like staying with a friend and I sure hope to get to stay with her and her adorable cats again some day!"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place to stay when visiting Kalahari or Cedar Point. Only complaint which has been mentioned in other reviews was the overall temperature. Extremely hot upstairs and cold downstairs. No real happy medium. Other than that, everything was great."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean neat and cozy space
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a cute little cabin. We had some trouble with the temperature control of the place, the 1st floor was freezing and 2nd floor unbearably hot. Other than that though it was a good experience!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"John’s home was beautiful. We had everything we needed for a perfect stay. Highly recommend!
Thank you for hosting us!
Joe & crew"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here over night on way through. We spent the evening at Kalahari. The house itself is neat. It is an old log cabin that has been updated. With the old construction, comes quirks like poor lighting, oddly shaped rooms, etc. It was a perfect house for us for such a short stay. The fact that he allows pets is what sold it for me. We travel with our little 4 legged family member so we needed that accommodation. I will stay here again if needed in the future."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Me and family were visiting our family in Ohio and stayed at John’s house and it was very easy to get to and felt like we right at home definitely recommend staying here as John’s
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks again for a great stay!
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,Fun
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"It definitely has potential to be a really nice place. It could use a big deep clean as there was a lot of dust. I’m pretty sure there is something wrong with the hvac system because it would be cold downstairs so we would turn the heat up a little and the upstairs would feel like a sauna. And so we turned the heat down a little bit and it was freezing at night. It was really hard because we were 3 separate softball families and only one male- the bathroom door didn’t have a lock which made some of uncomfortable to shower/use the restroom.
It’s also right next to a trailer park which was kind of sketchy as there was a guy who was walking outside the house and kept waking past and staring at the house. He seemed like he was a little off.
It was cool that pac man was available but to call it a gaming house, that’s a little far fetched- Just one game.
On the way upstairs, there is a light that turns on by sensor, if you’re in the loft, you get woken up by others going to bedroom."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was right in town, but the cabin was cute. There is a train that goes through at night that yoi can hear. It was a great little house."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Traveled with 3 adults, 2 teenagers and 3 dogs. Everyone had space and it was reasonably close to Cedar Point where we spent most of our time. Sidewalks everywhere for dog walking and had we had the time would have loved the the outdoor space."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time here! Very comfortable and had everything we needed
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,John was very quick to respond when I needed to change my date of stay. This place was perfect for our stay after a long day at Cedar Point. There were 7 of us and had plenty of room. It was clean and big free. It was a 35 minute drive from Cedar Point. Super cute place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Host was quick to respond when questions arose. Space was cozy and perfect for our weekend stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,John's BNB was an adorable little cabin with everything we could possibly need! Thank you for being such an awesome host!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2023-08-01,3.0,Group trip,"The shower needs to be fixed, adjusting the temperature was nearly impossible. It was either scalding or ice no matter how small of a movement on the handle. The towels were all damp like they were put up but not completely dry. The upstairs only has one vent for the entire space which didn't allow for the bedroom to cool. But the bed at the top of the stairs in front of the vent was far too cold for a good night rest. The stairs have a motion sensor light so those on the bed at the top of the stairs were awakened several times during the night due to movement would set the light to go off. This also meant those sleeping in the bedroom upstairs can't go to the restroom w/o waking those sleeping in that bed. This is advertised as a 3 bedroom, but it really is a two bedroom w/ a bed at the top of the stairs. It is a cute place and John was friendly and even allowed us a late check out which we didn't end up needing, but it was nice to have the option. I think it should be priced lower."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Adequate for our needs.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"You could smell cig smoke as soon as we walked in. The grill was dirty and not useable. The “well stocked” kitchen had one towel, no cutting board, no oven mitt. The real issue is this is NOT a three bedroom as advertised. The “3rd bedroom” is a loft at the top of the stairs without a door or closet. There’s no room to even change in the so called room. With 4 adults and 5 kids that was a real issue to everyone getting sleep. If we had known that we would have never booked here, it should be listed as a 2 bedroom with a loft sleeping area. The place was pretty dusty and could use some deep cleaning. We weren’t at the house much except to try and sleep."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place. John was very responsive and accommodating. Would stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Overall, we all enjoyed our stay. The neighbors were kind and helped us start a fire and overall, it was a great experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"It was a great place to stay, very peaceful. Neighbors keep to themselves. Lovely area not far from the needs like walmart and gas!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Group trip,John was very responsive and did refund the cleaning fee. However this is not 3 bedrooms- one of the “rooms” is an open space at top of stairs. Place could use a deep clean
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice air conditioning, good comfortable beds, overall great stay"
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Instructions to get into the house were clear. Location of place was a little uncomfortable, there is also a other airbnb property next door that another booker got mixed up with. Place was clear and roomy. Upstairs bedroom doesn’t have a door which isn’t shown in pictures or described. Overall, had a wonderful time and private space!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"John’s log cabin was very clean and exactly like the photos. He was very responsive and friendly. The house was comfortable, and the arcade was used by all the kids! Grocery stores, restaurants, and the freeway are all nearby. Unfortunately, and this is no fault of the owner, the neighbors were very loud and obnoxious, keeping us up much of the night of July 3rd. They were fine the other nights, so hopefully that was a one off event! Overall, we had a great stay and would come back again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved the space, it was minimal but provided everything! It was easy access and make it easier to come and go to Cedar Point too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Me and my family had wonderful time it was so relaxing and peaceful we will definitely be looking into more of johns listings
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"John was very responsive and easy to work with. House is clean and cute but I didn’t care much for the immediate neighborhood. I did go for a walk and felt very safe. There are beautiful homes a couple streets over to take a nice walk and look at.
I would recommend johns place. If you are visiting the area and busy during the day away from the home ... this is a perfect place to rest your head"

2023-04-01,3.0,Group trip,"Overall was a nice stay but I think it could use some more deep cleaning. Under the beds were really dirty and the beds had some hair on them and cobwebs it the ceilings. Overall was a nice stay, the location was perfect for what we needed and the space was nice."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a peaceful and relaxing stay at Johns cabin with another couple. Everything we needed was there and great spaces to leave our pup during the day where he wouldn’t hurt anything. Would stay again.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! The inside is very well done.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Upon arrival it was very beautiful and the curb appeal was clean. The inside was just as beautiful and very clean. We felt right at home and we look forward on coming back and staying again. John was very responsive back. 100% worth every penny we spent to stay. Thanks John for having us a guest.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,John was an absolute pleasure to work with and his cabin was perfect! This is the second time iv ever stayed in a Airbnb and the first time was the worst experience ever and John definitely made me change my mind.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Getting there was easy, John let us know we could check in early if we wanted to which was nice, and getting in was a breeze. The place was very clean and cozy. My only downside of the entire house was the couch was a little small, but that’s such a minor thing so no big deal there"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Not a bad place just needs a few things that would have helped!.
kitchen towels to do the dishes would have been nice, and coffee mugs. we were okay with having wine in a regular glass but much needed on the other items that we could have used..
We will come back because the host John was very easy to talk with!
Thank you for the stay.

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,nice place to stay if you going to cedar point.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Exactly what we needed
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"John’s place is clean and homey for my party of 6. There’s plenty of beds for everyone. It’s better value than having a hotel room. You get the whole house versus just the beds. And have more options to do inside a home than that of a hotel room. But don’t forget to bring your basic essentials ( shampoo, conditioner, body wash or bar soap). Overall, I recommend this place for your next adventure."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,House was a good place to sleep.

The host is super responsive and caring. Heck yeah- 5 stars! Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third time staying at Steve’s and once again we were happy with our stay. Finally got the right weather to try the fire pit in the backyard, which was a nice way to end our trip."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was perfect for a had no choice but to be away for Thanksgiving if we wanted the entire family together! Steve’s home was perfect- since I needed a place that would take dogs—even better! Steve was helpful when I asked for places where I may be able to order a cooked Thanksgiving meal as we were coming from NJ- he also had recommendations for the coffee shop around the corner. It was just what we needed to be together for the holiday! Thank you, Steve!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"It's a cute older place with a great location well decorated and plenty of parking space. We had everything we needed. The only inconvenience was having only one bathroom, but understandable because that’s how older homes used to be. We enjoyed the firepit, Central A/C & heater, and hot water was greatly appreciated. My grandkids loved the video games (a great idea). I recommend it and will come back next year for my grandson's graduation 🎓"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The little town of Norwalk is walking distance and super cute. Most stores were closed by the time we got there, but we found a nice little shaved ice place. There are a lot more stores and restaurants just a couple miles down the road also, so plenty of options.
There was an issue with the AC when we first arrived and Steve was extremely responsive and helpful, calling someone out after hours to get the issue fixed asap. We went for a walk and it was fixed when we got back.
The house was cute, clean, and had plenty of space for our family of 6. The kids loved the arcade games. Backyard was cute and private with a fire pit and cornhole game.
I highly recommend this property!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"Steve is a very responsive host. I had difficulty with the back door lock messaged him and he immediately called me and talked me through locking it up (not easy)
the backyard area is really relaxing and nice...loved it"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice for me and my family we had great time
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a place to stay in Sandusky, this is the place for you. My family and I came to town to celebrate my niece’s birthday at Cedar Point and stayed the night at Steve’s place. My only regret is that we were able to there for only 12 hours!
This is a really cool place. It’s located about 25 minutes from Cedar Point. It’s clean, it’s got a really cool layout including an awesome back yard and it’s got a couple of retro arcade games. The bedrooms are nice and everything is comfortable.
The price per night is phenomenal considering hotel costs in the area. If you need to get groceries or you want to grab a bite to eat, it’s all within a mile or so of the house.
In short- I’m glad we stayed there. This will be the first place I look for whenever my travels take me to the Sandusky area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Most of our time was spend at Race track, it was a great place for all of us to stay in one place and unwind after a long there."

The house was close to everything restaurants, shops, bars, and best of all, close to Kalahari. Host responds very quickly. We all got a good night's rest. Check out is a little early, but overall, I would highly recommend this place. My family and I had the best time at this Airbnb in this cute little town. I will definitely be booking again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy to communicate with. Very Hospitable.
2022-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"All in all, we enjoyed our visit. Steve is very communicative and helpful. Check in was easy and so was check out. We needed to ask for more towels, toilet paper and an extra blanket and he brought some over while we were at Cedar Point. The beds are comfortable. My teens (group of 9) loved the video games and tv. I’m glad there was AC as well. The upstairs gets a bit warm though so bring a fan if you get hot easily. There are nice lamps with plug ins in the bedrooms which was nice. The kitchen has ample plates and cups. There were not enough spoons for our large group, but we didn’t need them so that was good. I wish I had had time to use the oven-it’s gorgeous. I’m honestly not sure what cookware was supplied aside from plates/cups because we didn’t really cook while there. The bathroom didn’t have a plastic shower curtain-just fabric and the shower head sprayed everywhere so the floor got pretty soaked our first day. But, Steve came to the rescue with more towels! The parking lot is big and the neighborhood is quiet. It’s really close to downtown as well. We used the fire pit in the back and Steve had left some firewood out there. There was dish soap and hand soap and air freshener for the bathroom. There isn’t Shampoo/conditioner/body soap though so bring those. There were laundry supplies. The space was on the small side but it did fit everyone in our party. We were given an extra blanket because we needed to use the couch for a female who had come with us and we didn’t think about the fact that she probably wouldn’t want to share a bed with boys. The couch worked though. I would also say that it could use a deep clean although our sheets and towels were clean;) There were crumbs under beds and in the couch but you could then that it had been cleaned, but could probably use deep one. There are stains on the couch and dining benches too but we just used a sheet in the couch. My kids didn’t care much. There aren’t lots of bells and whistles, but it served it’s purpose for our birthday weekend trip to cedar point! The decor is very homey as well. Oh-I don’t know if Steve left it, or a previous guest, but there was some coffee in the cabinet and that was much appreciated. There was Also a 4 cup coffee maker and our family must have coffee in the mornings:)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Steve's house was perfect for our two day Cedar Point trip. It was a little less than a half hour. The house was clean and we had no issues. We would stay again.

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Steve's places were really nice and fairly updated! They were a close enough to Kalahari which is why we stayed there for the weekend! The houses were in pretty good shape but overall I think they could use a deep cleaning not just surface level! But Steve was really great at communicating and we enjoyed our stay!
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Norwalk is a little town close to Cleveland. Steve's house was perfect for what we needed. Remodeled and with some fun added (game machine) We recommend it.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Could not have asked for a better host. Steve was quick to be on contact with me because we needed to make a minor adjustment to our reservation. The presentation was awesome and the ad for the house was exactly what we got. Hope to go back soon!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Steve was a great host
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Worth the money 💰! Great place to Visit and dont let the forecast determine your trip. Go! Its worth it.
2021-08-01,3.0,Group trip,"Steve was a great host by communicating well and provided many of the essential amenities. Both the kitchen and the bathroom were well stocked. The check-in process was very thorough and we were able to get in right away. However, the home could be a bit more clean like the other reviews mentioned. I did message Steve prior to our arrival that I would like the home to be clean before we arrive because I have encountered too many stays lately on Airbnb that were very dirty. I wouldn’t say that Steve have met my expectations, but the home wasn’t as dirty as the ones I have recently experienced. Additionally, the location of the home seems quiet, but because we were not from the area and that the neighborhood looked like it wasn’t maintain, we did feel a little but uncomfortable, but of course, this is just based on preference. Overall, I thought that the value was okay; although, I paid for a cleaning fee, but the home wasn’t very clean."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great. Booking was easy as well as check in. The house was super clean and cute!

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Family of 6 adults, the home was perfect for us! Make sure you enjoy the fire pit and back porch. We played card games and made smores. We went to Norwalk for the night under fire race and then a day at cedar point. It was wonderful to have a peaceful and private house to come back to for the evenings."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Really clean, neighborhood is really friendly, go to the coffee shop near there! Good location :)"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The living and dining area here is comfortable and well maintained. We only used one of the bedrooms upstairs and it was nice and cool. The fenced in backyard was helpful but note…it is not fully fenced. The driveway pulls into the backyard, so the dogs required supervision. As you pull down the street, you may wonder about the condition of the neighborhood. We walked to the coffee shop and local tavern/restaurant and felt completely safe. Great local places. Finally if you are looking forward to hours on the arcade game, note the joystick is worn out. I couldn’t play Burgertime but worked hard at Centipede! The owner was great to work with. Easy drive to Cedar Point."

2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and relatively spacious at a good price point. Steve was quick and easy to communicate with... an easy stop for our cross country drive.
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Steve was so quick to get back to us about a stay just one day away. His house had enough beds for my wife and I and my 7 children. The arcade was plenty of entertainment for all my children taking turns with the hundreds of games available. His hospitality was unparalleled and even accommodated a return to look for a lost binky. Thanks Steve!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Given the pandemic, we were looking for a place somewhere that was driving distance both from where my girlfriend and I live and where my father does, so we could meet for a low-key Thanksgiving instead of traveling home for the normal, big family gathering. Steve's place was just great given what we were looking for. It accommodated us comfortably and we were still able to cook up a pretty decent dinner. Steve was easy to communicate with and everything went smoothly. Would definitely recommend."
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Exactly what we needed

There was cut wood there for a bonfire if you wanted. Everything was great, and it’s also right behind a main street, which has a nice coffee shop."

Steve was very attentive, made sure we had our check-in instructions, and responded to any inquiries immediately, which we appreciated. Location was perfect for our weekend activities and we also enjoyed walking to Sheri's coffee house each morning!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay and enjoyed the kitchen area to gather for meals. Also enjoyed the porch and the grill on the porch! It was the perfect location for us and everyone enjoyed the garden tub! The only minor inconvenience was the plugs in the bathrooms not working and the coffee pot did not work, other than that it was great!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home… the kids loved the arcade games…. Only issues was ants behind sink in big bathroom and hair on sheets but wasn’t big issues and easily fixable. Loved the location.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely will be staying here again for our next vacation!!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place with a lot of room
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay, a little bit of a miscommunication with the door code and getting in but Steve was super responsive and right on top of it. Some of the beds had a few stains on them."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was very nice and comfortable my and my family had a lovely time
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay. My kids and I loved it!
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I enjoyed the house ,the check in was smooth , what I didn’t like was how the refrigerator was dirty , the beds had stains and hair on the sheets , in every room , the back room had some chill to it , when I reached out the host it was a while for a response , eventually the issues did get resolved , so I was thankful and I do understand things happen but the response could have been quicker"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved everything about the house. It was beautiful and clean. My kids loved and wanted to make it our home. The only issue was that the master bathroom tub had hair all over it. I tried to clean it, but I didn't want to clean someone else's hair. So i was not able to enjoy the tub like i wanted to. Besides that everything else was wonderful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place kids liked it and it was a 10min drive to Kalahari
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"An amazing space for spending time, cooking, and eating with the family."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything went super smooth! Steve’s communication was perfect. The house was very spacious and clean 10/10 recommend
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,My family really enjoyed this house. It was beautiful and in a great location.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice clean spacious place. It is in a mobile home park and it is kind of hard to find when it’s dark out but owner gave a pretty clear map that really helped. Amazing amenities and loved the Pac-Man and basketball hoops but be aware the outlets in both bathrooms do not work. Other than that had an amazing stay and would definitely come back!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I absolutely loved staying here and my family especially the children love the fact that there was something for them to do. this place was clean and when you walked in it was like you felt at home. I had a couple times I had to get a hold of the host and got a response back within minutes and that's the first for me so they were very helpful. I would definitely recommend this place and probably stay there again if I'm in the area.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Steve is an amazing host, hope to stay here for future trips!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a convenient half-way stop during a long road trip. Very grateful to have a clean home that was welcoming to dogs. I first tried to find the property with only the address in an electronic map. Since the home is in a trailer park, it would have been nearly impossible to find after dark without the map proactively provided by the host. The location is adjacent to open fields and trees, which was nice, and the neighborhood was very quiet. The home was clean and decorated nicely. Compared to others that we considered, this was priced well and provided the safe place we needed to rest up before continuing our drive."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you SO much for being available to assist my questions very late at night and to accommodate our early check in for a last minute need! We appreciated your flexibility, nice home and kindness at every turn. You were available for all of our questions and the place was very big! Thank you again 🙏"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Place was perfect for 4 adults and two kids. Kids enjoyed the pac-man and basketball. We all had our own rooms and it was nice to gather around tv for a movie. We were glad to have a kitchen to cook a nice breakfast. Two bathrooms for all of us to get ready quickly. Place was nice. Definitely recommend over a hotel.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"the place is definitely worth the Money,could use a little tlc but overall a good place"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"its nice, while the air conditioner seems not good in bedroom, a little bit cold inside."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We used this space for our son's 16th birthday. It fit 9 of us comfortably and provided entertanment for the teens after a long day at Kalahari. Beds are comfy and space was clean.
Kalahari was only 11 minutes away!
Steve was very responsive to any needs! We would definitely stay agan!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice quiet location. Really nice house, it was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. The house is close to Kalahari and great wolf lodge. My family really enjoyed the arcade games. We will be booking again for next spring!!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Cool
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a nice place for me and my children to stay. Definitely was better than a hotel stay. The home was clean and spacious, I only had one issue and Steve was great with communicating and responding to my concern. Enjoyed the grill and porch area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, spacious, easy check out, perfect for our family stay to Cedar Point!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,..
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A spacious place for some family fun after a full day at Cedar Pointe. A great quiet location. Place was clean and comfortable. Large TVs, games to play, big gathering table and plenty of seating. Floor space for an air mattress or 2 if needed. Responsive host. We had a great stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a last minute Airbnb & Steve’s place was perfect! He got us all the information & allowed us to check in within 2 hours of booking.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! Great place to lay our heads after work!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice and spacious for a big family, the house was very clean and had everything we needed. Lots of restaurants and very accessible to get to Cedar Point. Definitely will lookout for this place again when we go back to visit the area!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"The AirBnB was nice for being a double wide mobile home. I had read some reviews about a weird smell so we bought Febreze beforehand. I wouldn’t say it was horrible but when you’re used to your own house and smell, it was different. The only thing I had a problem with was the amount of toilet paper 😂 there was only 2 rolls in the main bathroom which 5 people were supposed to use which wasn’t enough. We ended up taking toilet paper from the private bath from the master bedroom. Other than that, we had no issues."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great home . The games kept the kids occupied our entire stay and we enjoyed cooking on the grill .
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Needed a place to crash for the night. This fit the bill
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely a nice place and just as described just a little confusing to find in the dark.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time at Steve’s place. Kids played basketball and arcade game very clean and very peaceful..

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for a small vacation to Cedar Point!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Steve is very accessible and responsible for all the questions I had about the house. Love the location.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place recommend it
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect spot for our family to rest our heads after a long day at cedar point. About 20 min from the park, lots of bed space, and a full kitchen to cook if needed. We had a great time here with our kids, highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, it helped us accomplish our mission for being in Sandusky. The strong smoke odor was off-putting though. It smelled throughout the mobile home and was in the bedding.
Steve, as host, was responsive and we appreciate that."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"it was enough room for my family of 4, close to everywhere we had to be.. we had a few spiders but that is kinda expected due to the area the place is in. And he would come get the trash everyday so no wildlife would get into it. overall it was a good place for our 9 days"
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"inside was nice..had a funny smell.
neighborhood was in mobile park but fairly quiet. one bathroom sink didn't drain. solid stay for the price"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,congenial and friendly
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great overall stay. The place was very tidy and as described. It's close to cedar point and we would not hesitate to stay again if we went to cedar point again. All the beds we're very comfy and well maintained. The master bath has a nice tub and is connected to the bedroom so you don't need to worry about going back out into the public space after bed. The owner communicated very well. I called with a question and he immediately called and walked me through an easy answer.
A few things to note that may or may not bother you.
- it's basically in a trailor park. Many cats ran off the driveway when we pulled up. The people walking around the neighborhood don't exactly instill the most confidence in leaving your car unlocked, if you get my drift.
- it smells pretty strongly of cat urine around the two doors into the unit.
Overall awesome stay! The sketchy neighborhood and urine smells take one star away for me."
2023-05-01,3.0,Group trip,"The overall place was as described. I would have left a better review if there wasn’t such a strong smell of animal urine (or something else). other than the smell, the property was exactly as we expected it to be."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing! Super friendly would definitely stay again! The host was very helpful, felt right at home."
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Steve was very kind in his communication about our stay. The rental was spacious and accommodating for having a few guests over at a time. We were happy that our toddler could roam without worry of falls or major accidents within the home or due to furniture. We felt disappointed with the cigarette smell that emitted from the living area, the presence of ants on a dirty floor, dishes that were dirty in the cupboards, and no working outlets in either bathroom."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We felt right at home! Everything was pristine and we had a great time. The games made it extra fun and its very close to all the major attractions. Would absolutely recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Comfy
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,exactlywhat we need
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay at!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Steve let us check in early. We stayed at Kalahari one night and Steve’s place the second. The kids loved the game room feature and there’s plenty of beds for the 8 of us! Thanks Steve for hosting us! The price was beyond wonderful.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a good host house was beautiful love the games they had inside of there. Kids had a ball.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Steves place was clean and comfortable! 5/5 I would highly reccomend the stay if your looking in this area! :)

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay my children and I just wanted to get away. This was a perfect place for us and we felt right at home
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, we had a lot of fun! The PacMan game and the basketball hoops were awesome"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We liked that we could take a pet . It was as described and located 10 minutes to Kalahari .
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Steve was very responsive during booking and our entire stay. His place was clean and spacious. The arcade and basketball game was a hit with the kids.
We would have liked to have shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the bathrooms as we didn’t bring it with us thinking it would be provided.
The master bed was unleveled and made a lot of noise which was annoying in the middle of the night.
We also think the price was a bit high for the type of home it is and the actual location of the property, however the distance to Kalahari was perfect for our needs.
We would consider staying again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was amazing! 10 minutes away from Kalahari, 20 min from malls and other stores. The games kept us and the kids occupied!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was exactly what was described, clean, very spacious, gave you a nice home feel and was very nice about letting my team and I check in early before our tournament started."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place the pop-a-shot was a HIT for the kiddos. Great way to spend New Years
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was good!! Thank you
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect stop on our travels. Comfortable beds. The kids loved the games.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place and flexible location.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and loved the peacefulness that Norwalk had to offer! Would totally stay here next time I am in the area!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a decent sized place, the games were a hit with our children."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Beds were comfy & it was spacious.
2022-10-01,4.0,Group trip,"The games were great to keep antsy family busy. Couch and beds were comfortable. Also, very clean and quiet. Thanks, Steve!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely place for the family. My kids were so happy to stay here and play the games. Their is so much space and bedding for everyone. It’s the place for the family when you’re traveling.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Steve’s was great for resting after our long days at Cedar Point. The neighborhood is quiet. We had dogs and there was plenty of space to walk them and everything. There were a lot of outdoor cats around. We put a sheet over the sliding glass door to keep ours from getting excited over the 3 next door. Beds were comfy, found mostly everything we needed in the kitchen. Games were entertaining for the kids and had we been there longer the giant grass field in the back definitely would have been used for playing. Enjoyed our stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay to give the kids some space to play (they both loved the games) and stretch out. Would love to stay for a few days in the summer to go to the park and come back to cook (looks like everything you would need is there, supplies, big fridge, utensils, grill, etc). Rate was higher than others, but it’s prime season for Halloweekends at Cedar Point and we didn’t want to stay in a hotel. There were a lot of cats, but they didn’t bother anyone and seemed sweet. Steve was a great host - even quickly answering a question about the door locks after midnight! We were very appreciative. Cheers!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Check-in for Steve’s place went very smoothly. We were disappointed by the cost of the place for what it was. I think it needs to be advertised that this is a mobile home in a mobile home park. Although the park was super quiet and people were friendly, the entire neighborhood was full of feral cats and smelled like cat urine. Steve’s house was very clean itself, however. I wouldn’t be opposed to staying there again but not for the amount that was charged. The basketball hoop game and the pacman were a great addition and kept two teenage boys entertained on a rainy day. The kitchen was well-equipped."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Steve has a stellar set up in this lovely trailer home (high vaulted ceilings and lots of space and really well furnished). It felt like a beach house with lots fun to be had. We played all of the games. Don’t miss out on the wooden tic TAC toe. We also saw a praying mantis and it was really cool!
It was a good space and Steve was extremely responsive and accommodating, as we arrived quite late. I encourage you to give it a try."
2022-08-01,3.0,Group trip,It’s good house to stay. The Arcade games are additional advantage
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean home and located in a good area. Great for our big group and even those with smaller kids.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, accommodated everyone well. Steve was a great host and communicated days before check in. Thanks again!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Steve was a great host
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved the house it was beautiful.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely comfortable place. We’ll be back. Steve is a great host. Provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Thanks Steve. Also the air is perfect for these steaming days outside. (😉) ✌🏾

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Steve was great with communicating. Place was nice and clean and the different games were a nice touch to keep the kids occupied. There is a huge shared yard in the back that is great as well! Definitely recommend and would stay here again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Stayed for a day with friends. It was comfortable, clean, and fun."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very affordable place for large group
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was in a great location. Very close to Cedar Point, there's a Walmart 5 minutes down the road for groceries and the neighborhood is quiet. We also played frisbee and had a water fight with the kids in the large empty lot behind the house. This place is great for large groups and the games kept the kids and adults entertained!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was perfect for our trip to cedar point. The house was clean and easy to find with the detailed instructions.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We got this home for a great price however be warned it is a trailer in a trailer park. There aren’t any outside pictures for one to know. The AC in the rooms doesn’t keep up as well but other than that for a day or two it is not a bad stay.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for 2 nights over spring break to visit Kalahari. Every description was accurate and instructions were extremely clear. The house itself was beautiful and cozy. We enjoyed having a kitchen to cook meals and save by not getting take-out. The furniture was clean and comfortable as were the bathrooms.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice impromptu stay at this rental. Communication with Patrick was great prior to check-in - he was responsive and friendly. We did not need to communicate with him or the other co-hosts during our stay for anything. The house has lots of fun games, puzzles, furniture and pillows. It is well stocked with kitchen and bathroom items.
A few notes:
*They're not kidding about the upstairs being cold in the winter.
*From the photos, I thought only one of the bedrooms was upstairs but it's actually all of the beds except the master suite.
*It's not really secluded as you're bordered by neighbors on two sides and, though the view of the trees out the living room window is lovely, there is a road just below from which you do hear traffic.
*Lastly, it would be helpful to have a walkway from the driveway to the house. The yard was muddy when we stayed given the weather so the walk to the house was a bit messy.
All said, we would happily recommend and stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was my second time booking this location. It was perfect to host a dinner with a few friends and get away with my husband. Close enough for yummy food delivery and far enough way to feel like an escape.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy, modern place with a lot of character, space and things to do. Well stocked, easy check in and check out.

Additionally, this host went above and beyond for us when inquiring about a crockpot, they went out and purchased this for us. Finally we loved the huge canvas available near the dining area for guests to sign. We enjoyed our stay here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Super cute and great location! We stayed for a trip to Cedar Point, and it was decently close to the park. Very private and a lot of space for everyone.

Plenty of space to relax on the large outdoor deck surrounded by woods on the back side of the house.

Definitely will be coming back in the future!"

It was fully stocked with everything you’d need for your stay and also had a lot of items that are commonly missed during packing when you go on a trip. The house isn’t too big or too small and was the perfect size for us. Plenty of board games and the giant connect 4 was a big hit with the kids. This house has a far away feel but with grocery and food just down the road. Zero complaints what so ever!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not totally sure where to begin when singing this places praises. It was immaculately clean and exactly at depicted in the photos. The owners even decorated it for the holiday which made it feel just that much more special and comfortable.
It's fun and funky and exceptionally designed with just the right amount of original character. It seemed like every time we turned a corner there was something new and interesting to discover.
Self check in was a breeze. Wi-fi was good and strong. Patrick was a lovely host and very responsive to questions.
The wall heaters worked wonderfully to keep the chilly nights warm and comfortable.
The bedding in the master bedroom (downstairs) was so nice I had to ask about where they got it from.
The bidet (Tushy brand) in the master bathroom was also a lovely little bonus.
The only thing I'm sad about was that we only got to stay for two nights in this magical gem.
If you're thinking about booking it, do it. You won't be disappointed!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I reserved this place when it only had one review and I’m glad I did. The home is exactly as stated and is impeccably decorated down to the smallest details. You can tell the hosts thought of all the details and the home was fully stocked with what we needed so we weren’t left wanting for anything. Patrick is a great communicator and we felt like if we needed anything he was only a message away. The place also felt bigger than in the pictures to us and especially when you’re in the upstairs bedrooms. We visited my family who live in the area and would absolutely stay here again next time.
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was such a great house! The space was very unique, welcoming, and clean and the host was very responsive. Plenty of space for a group and we loved all of the games and puzzles as well. It’s also a super-short drive to downtown Milan, which was perfect. All in all, highly recommend!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Cute and cozy little cottage! We stayed for a weekend for a mini Friendsgiving! Beautiful in the Autumn but did get a little cold upstairs.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location, fantastic house, great renter. Overall 10/10 trip."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This cottage was a perfect get-a-way from city life!! We had a great girls weekend!! Patrick supplied so many amenities which added a special touch. We will definitely be back again!!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patrick’s place was great, it was spacious enough for four people to sleep and relax in, had an awesome patio, lots of amenities and was a great location off the highway. Thank you again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was probably the most beautifully designed space I’ve ever stayed in, to start with. I love the historical meets modern theme, from the old fashioned looking fridge, to the retro acoustic gramophone phone speaker, to the modern bidet in the master bath - I’d say, they thought of everything! I like the graffiti guestbook, such a fun idea! The attention to detail here is spectacular. The beds, pillows & bedding were all very comfortable. My kids loved the game selection so much, that they didn’t even want to go to Cedar Point at first! The kitchen was well stocked, coffee, good creamer, even some food and drinks in the fridge and some snacks! The location is great, feels pretty private and secluded yet really close to everything you need, and not far from Cedar Point (25m). We enjoyed the fire pit outside too! Overall, have to say I loved it. I was starting to get cynical about Airbnbs but this is the kind of place that would make me want to come back again and again and restored my faith in Airbnb! Kind of a hidden gem, I hope it doesn’t get so booked that it won’t be available next time I’m in the area!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying in this adorable house! It was conveniently located for a visit to both Cedar Point and Oberlin College. The place was clean, cozy, and comfortable."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancée and I have stayed in a number of AirBnbs all over the country, we can honestly say that this has been our favorite. It is extremely comfortable, with the seclusion of a private getaway and all the comforts of home that one might need. The decorations and amenities are a combination of modern innovation and timeless antique. The waterfall shower head is incredible, the master bedroom couldn’t be more comfortable and the privacy/view from the back deck is picturesque. Although there were only two of us, there is plenty of space for larger groups. Patrick was extremely accommodating and available if we were missing anything, which we were not. Just a short drive away is the historic city of Milan. The city square has a number of shops, as well as food and drink options, and the surrounding neighborhoods provided a scenic and relaxing drive. I can’t say enough about the house or our host. Patrick, our biggest regret is only staying 2 nights. We will definitely book again if given the opportunity."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absloutly loved the place. Check in and check out flexibility made the house a great place to stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was AMAZING. We will definitely be back. The perfect get away for my boyfriend and I. Very peaceful and relaxing.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Larry’s place was very nice and great for relaxing! We enjoyed grilling out and enjoying the beautiful scenery from the porch!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place! Location is beautiful and peaceful. Lots of wildlife around. Amazing porch overlooking serene lake helps to soak up nature. House is just what it says- tiny, but comfy and well appointed. We loved it!
Couple notes: 1) Air conditioner is right up against the lofted bed. Didn’t bother us but just be aware it will be blowing on anyone sleeping up there 2)Just like the description says, hot water tank is small and runs out quickly but we adapted 3)There are a couple other cabins/houses on the property but are distanced far enough to still feel private and secluded (and it was kind of neat seeing the bon fires from the other houses along with ours at night)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a relaxing stay at the tiny house. It was very well appointed. Coffee was available and cold water was waiting in the refrigerator.
Kayaking, fishing (I gave the fish my bait) , walks in the woods, lots of wildlife, wild flowers and places to explore. I built a fire the second night.
What I needed was peace and this placed delivered. Yes, there is a bit of traffic noise but the beauty, comfort and security cancels it out.
I would definitely go back again. I asked if I could live there but Larry said, “Lol…no”. Darn."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful time! The home was well organized, so it never felt too cramped (especially since we could unpack our bags and store them in the available shed). And the front porch and gravel area were great for having extra space to hang out in and read a book or just sit and look out over the lake. The view in the mornings over the water from the bed were *gorgeous*. And there were a lot of places to explore within reasonable driving distance (we drove to and walked around downtown Norwalk, Huron, Vermillion, Sandusky and Lakeside and found cute shops, good food, friendly people and plenty of piers).
All in all, very peaceful location, felt very private, and had plenty of space considering the size of the home. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great weekend at the tiny house. Everything was slightly nicer than I expected it to be from the photos, including the well equipped kitchen, which was important to us.
The view and immediate area are lovely, though nearby traffic sounds and lawn mowing were nearly nonstop. Not a deal breaker, but a minor irritant.
The hot tub was clean and well maintained, as was the entire structure. Flawless check in as well.
Worth a stay for tiny house enthusiasts looking to get away."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most peaceful location I’ve ever vacationed. The house was cute and neat. Great outdoors space with great activities to do like hiking, birding, kayaking, hot tubing and bonfires."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying in this tiny home. 10/10 would recommend
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, check in and communication was great."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Stay made my 24th Birthday Unforgettable the pictures does no justice everything about it was perfect! Highly Recommended i'll definitely be back!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tiny house overlooking a privately-owned lake. Great space! Came here for the eclipse and left feeling impressed. The house itself has everything you need, we made tacos and a salad. The lake was beautiful, there were kayaks available right by the beach. There are various walking paths around the property. Hot tub was great too.
One note: The house is situated on the same land as one or two other properties, within viewing distance. It didn't really impact my stay, but if you're looking for complete privacy, be sure to ask the host if the other spaces are rented out."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Larry’s place was very clean and secluded, I would recommend to any couples or just friends who need a quiet relaxing private getaway for a day or a week"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great!! Looked just like the pictures and is beautiful. Larry gave great instructions to make check in as easy as possible. It is hard to find if you arrive at night but was doable even with pouring rain. Only thing that was not expected was that the tiny house is connected to tanks! So if you take a shower expect to turn the water off every time you can or you’ll end up with an ice cold shower!! Otherwise we had a great time, very peaceful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thought the place was beautiful, beautiful weather, had everything we needed. we were scared to kayak but spent half a day doing it because it was so fun. not too far of a walk to the big lake/river. The water was very very cold though. Overall it was very fun 🥲 lots of ladybugs inside the tiny home, and a few bugs but it was a very nice location."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Could not have been more pleased with our stay. Memories to last a lifetime and an unforgettable experience. Can’t wait to come back again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, organized, and cozy. The views were great and the area was peaceful. A great place to spend quality time with your partner!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for a little getaway. Not too far away, affordable, and such a nice play."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying at the tiny house. It was a little slice of paradise. We didn’t want to leave. We will definitely be back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Looks just like the photos! A nice place to stay with a great view. Larry provided good instructions on a easy check-in. Everything we needed was provided, would come back again"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing and cozy and very clean. Great place to spend some time away. Everything was as expected and user friendly. Would definitely recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had such a fun time here! The hot tub was very clean and so was everything else! Very secluded and private area. Loved the complementary fire wood!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had an amazing time at the tiny home! The place was clean and looked exactly like the pictures, we were far enough from the neighbors that we felt isolated, the hot tub was relaxing and the views were great! Kitchen had everything we needed as well! Larry and Mark went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and we couldn’t be more happy with this place! Will definitely be back soon."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dope . Loved the experience can’t wait to try it out again
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wish we had stayed longer. It was such a beautiful place to disconnect from the world and reconnect w your person. Lovely place to stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry went to a lot of trouble to recommend area places to eat and shop. We didn’t have time to visit any of them because we were busy in Oberlin for Parents Weekend but they were well described. We did drive through Norwalk and it looked charming. The lake is beautiful. We really didn’t experience all the location has to offer because, like I said, we were mostly out. I’m sure there was plenty to do on the property as well as in town. We did get in the hot tub for a few minutes and it was very relaxing."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,awesome experience
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, great communication, we had an amazing time!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is gorgeous. Perfect couples retreat!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway for my husbands 40th birthday! It was great to disconnect from the world and reconnect with each other. The location is private and beautiful. The place was clean and had all the amenities you could need. Larry was helpful and left tips and directions for everything Will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were very appreciative to have such a beautiful place to stay during our visit. We were able to get some much needed R&R and re-connect. The property felt like it was miles away but it was just a short drive to everything! We were able to spend hours on the pond and take some great couples pictures on the land. We will be coming back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful stay! We would absolutely love to go back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Larry was a great host and the place was incredible. Peaceful, beautiful and exactly as advertised. Would recommend to anyone !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The tiny home was perfect for my husband and I. There was plenty to do and great ways to relax. Between the beautiful lake and the wooded area we saw quite a few wildlife creatures :) The driveway was a little bumpy but not concerning enough to not give a 5star review!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had an amazing time together at Larry’s place. My boyfriend enjoyed the kayaking and I enjoyed waking up to the view with my morning coffee. We had fires every night. There is no describing the night skies in this part of Ohio. If you enjoy the stars this is the place to be. We visited Lake Erie and had an amazing time. Larry’s place is truly a hidden gem. The hot tub was so great. We brought a projector and turned the privacy screen into our own outdoor movie theater at night. We were so relaxed at Larry’s. Larry even had an unexpected hiccup the day we were coming and gave us a refund to compensate for the inconvenience and he had it waiting for us when we arrived. We were very impressed.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a amazing stay. It was a beautiful place and we hope to come back some day.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay. Scenery was superb. Tiny house was very clean. On our first night we had a mama deer and her twin babies pay a visit. So serene and peaceful. Great locations in nearby town for all your needs. Easy check in. Hot tub was wonderful! We want to come back and stay again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! It was the perfect getaway
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay this summer on the lake. This is a perfect couples retreat if you like the beautiful outdoors. We enjoyed all the amenities, hot tub, gas grill, fire pit, outdoor seating, the deck with its lighting, and even the kayaks. We were excited to see two families of dear travel through our yard several times, ducks and plenty of fish. The local coffee shop was awesome and downtown area definitely worth a walk. Our hosts were very responsive and accommodating. Thanks so much Larry for the lighter!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing stay with a beautiful view and had a great time kayaking the lake, I will definitely be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Tiny home was great! It was very clean and exactly as described. The surrounding lake and trees were more beautiful than expected. I would’ve not planned anything for my weekend had I realized that we could grill, hot tub, kayak, and swim in the lake all weekend. Would definitely stay again!"
,,,Please clean the kitchen and give me a refund
,,,"This is a nice 90% modern house but it was VERY NASTY. The kitchen draws were nasty, the bedding was stained and dirty, the bathroom toilet and floor were dirty. The COUCH WAS FILTHY!!!!! It has so many stains I never sat on it. The dining room chairs were equally filthy. This house has a Major ANT PROBLEM. They were everywhere even crawling on us. The walls And baseboards were dirty. There was not any tissue, cleaning supplies or even a mop to actually clean . The living room carpet was so filthy you wouldn't want to walk on it with bare feet. The back yard furniture was FILTY! Someone definitely lives here on a regular basis. We cleaned the place up as much as we could to just feel a little comfortable for the duration of our vacation . This was the dirtiest bnb I have ever stayed in. Modern place but never again will I stay here. The hot water was the best part of the stay. I was accommodated for a partial refund."
,,,"Renter beware! We chose to stay here because it was cheaper than getting 2 hotel rooms to accommodate a family of 5 and the pictures and reviews seemed good. I even laughed at some of the ""Karen's"" that said it wasn't clean enough. I thought to myself, my god... what do they expect?!? Well.... let me tell ya, I should have listened to them!
If you live in a clean house, this is NOT the house for you to rent while on vacation. However, if you live in filth, this might be a step up.
However, if you choose to stay here anyway you may want to take notes...
Bring extra bedding as I cannot guarantee the bedding Steve provides is clean. The comforters are black and appeared to have schmutz on all of them. God only knows what it truly was. But if you have any kind of imagination,
you can also assume the same as I did! The sheets did not appear to be freshly laundered despite there being a washer and dryer right in the kitchen. I would put money on that the previous renters also slept in those same sheets. I was absolutely disgusted by it!
The house itself is dirty. I felt gross being barefoot and my feet were actually getting dirty walking IN THE HOUSE, so in order to keep my feet clean, I had to wear socks.
The tub was clearly not cleaned prior to our arrival, little curlies were left behind.
The kitchen had a nasty stained sponge that I'm assuming was for dishes. I played it safe and used a paper towel. And the window sill in the kichen could have at least been wiped down to get the dead bugs off it!
The window in the upstairs bedroom had a portable AC unit with a cobblejob tube out the window, so no shades or curtain to block the sun.
And we woke up to the smell of the neighbors out back smoking weed.
And for the cherry on top of this monstrosity of a sundae... under the 'Essentials' he states there is a hairdryer in the bathroom. Because this was listed, I did not bring mine. I absolutely have to blow dry my hair and straighten it every morning after the shower. There was no blow dryer and Steve did not reply to my message asking about it. (This one wasn't a huge deal and if the house would have been decent, I would've never even mentioned it)
We left the house cleaner than what he did for us, so hopefully the next renter appreciates it."
