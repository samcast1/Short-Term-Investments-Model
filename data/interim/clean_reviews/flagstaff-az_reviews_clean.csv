2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place in the proximity of the Grand Canyon. Very well decorated and have plethora of board games to pick from.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home felt just like my parents home ""right down to the towels"" as my husband noted. 😆 The home inside could have used more lighting as the carpet and decor are dark.

The bed was comfy and the room adequate. 😌 The fridge and microwave in the laundry room were a plus! Thank you for an affordable, comfortable stay."

Would recommend to anyone visiting Flagstaff!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really appreciated the bed and shower after two days of camping. My 15 year old boys liked playing on the Xbox . The family has a nice way of both mixing with guests and leaving them alone :)
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This is a shared space with 3 rooms rented out to other guests. you'll be sharing the bathroom with multiple people. Bathroom is dirty, bathtub was not clean, foot/dirt/marks all over the bathtub. The extra futon was so uncomfortable, you can feel the springs when you lay down. Location is good, easy to find.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachelle place was great as my base during my visit to the Grand Canyon, Sedona, and local Flagstaff nature! Her place had lots of very useful amenities (from laundry to kitchen equipment) that i felt comfortable using. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and peaceful. There is some public transportation available (a somewhat direct bus from downtown to Rachelle, albeit ending with a 5 min uphill walk). Other guests were staying in rooms close to mine, bathroom was next door, and I frequently interacted with members of the family that live at the house. It felt very homey and I was able to ask questions and get help quickly whenever i needed to. Would definitely recommend Rachelle's place to anyone needing a stopover or a base for exploring the surrounding nature :)"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"90 minutes from the Grand Canyon. We had a salad in the evening, used the washing machine and left again early in the morning. Thanks!

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good value for money, the accommodation was very well located and the room was okay for 2 people. We had a good time and met friendly guests.
Rachelle and her parents present in the house were welcoming and friendly, I recommend it!
Small downside: the bathroom that could be cleaner especially when several guests share it
Good to know: when the upstairs bathroom is occupied (which was often the case for us) do not hesitate to use the one on the floor"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The private home is a shared space with space for 3 different sets of guests. It was very clean and well organized. The linen and rom was very clean and the bed was comfortable to sleep on. There is a futon that can be converted into another sleeping area if need be. All bedding was stored in plastic containers and smelled fresh and clean. I would definitely recommend Rachelle and Randy's place for a stay.

the bathroom was clean with lots of towels."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very very well
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I never did meet Rachelle, mainly due to my extremely late check in and early departure the next morning. The bed was very comfortable and the place had somewhat of a mystical feeling to it when pulling up late at night after a big snowfall. I was very appreciative of Rachelle allowing me to arrive as late as I did. I would definitely return here."

We had constantly been moving, and it felt so much like home staying here. It's a great place to stay with the kids. We cooked a whole brunch and enjoyed the meal before heading out. The host is super responsive and willing to answer questions and help with local whereabouts. We felt blessed to stay with such a warm and welcoming family."

Rachelle's instructions were clear and concise. As someone who likes things clean, it was squeaky clean! 😁. There were instructions written out in their home if you got lost finding the fridge or anything you would need. If you're staying in Flagstaff for a few nights, I'd definitely recommend Rachelle's home!! The bed was comfy, and Rachelle and Randy were both responsive and amazing. Thank you for having us!! We felt like home!"

2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Somewhat accurate listing, I’d add in to the description you need your own bedding, little dirty I slept on the bedding with a towel over the pillow since I saw some hair from the previous person or maybe in the combined laundry? Very polite and nice as I entered, just a little awkward, I would’ve liked just following their directions in the description and getting to sleep and getting on my way. I arrived at 10:45pm and left at 5am the next morning, VERY quick stay. Value is there if you’re in and out, I just wasn’t looking to chat or have dialogue with anyone, probably more my own fault. Thank you!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super unique and fun little getaway!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Truly eclectic! Fun space to stay in. My only complaint is that the $180 cleaning fee for one night was excessive for a place that was not as clean or fresh as you would expect.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kids loved the hot tub and painting on the wall. We enjoyed some nearby surroundings and loved coming back to a house. The decor is fun! We didn’t spend a lot of time at the house but there was plenty to do when there.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the house! It was a fun getaway! We even stayed an extra night! The only downside is we couldn’t check in until after 4 and the checkout time is 10:00. The host was nice and let us stay an extra hour and an extra night! We even bought some cool souvenirs
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cool space and great hosts! We sadly didn’t have enough time to enjoy the place that long but did really enjoy the artist aspects of the space and hot tub. Thanks so much!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Hatter House was a unique and fun experience. We had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the fact that there were hiking trails directly across the street!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb is a fun themed getaway! We enjoyed our time in ""wonderland "". We had the extra pleasure of experiencing the unique decor in the snow! There was a delicious assortment of teas and a plethora of teapots to steep our tea. Thank you for the banana nut muffin mix. We encourage you to emphasize your rule of no more than four people on the premises at any time in your online description. There is a suggestion of a tea party for 6 and the table is set for eight with eight chairs and service for eight. There isn't a place to store the china while you eat. It is a very fun and comfortable place to celebrate the nuances of Alice's wonderland. We only wish we could have shared it with two more members of our family."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Hatter House was one of the most unique places we've ever stayed. It is beyond creative and we loved that an older home could be ""re-purposed"" in a fun themed Airbnb. Any item you would need on vacation was available (linens, towels, dishes, appliances) plus great recommendations and shopping nearby. And the very best part was that we could bring our dog and she had a fenced in yard. Thank you Jen - we definitely recommend staying here!"
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: The house was exactly as described, kids enjoyed the hot tub and drawing on the walls, the theme of the house was fun.
Cons: There water seeping through the kitchen floor. We discovered a mouse in the kitchen. Unfortunately, nothing was able to done until the next day. I feel disappointed about the fact that we paid such a high cleaning fee only find these specific issues mentioned before.
Hopefully it will not happen to any other guests ever again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cool place to stay! Enjoyed the theme so much! House was a bit dusty, but it is surrounded with dirt so that is to be expected!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, super unique and very quiet. I will definitely stay here again and the close proximity to town and private hot tub were great!"

Thank you for creating such a fun place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were lucky to find this gem for last minute travel after Christmas. What an incredible surprise - an escape we didn’t even realize we truly needed until entering the enchanting Mad Hatter - Alice in Wonderland home. The description of the place was spot on - it’s not your “typical” accommodation- you’re truly transported into an adventure - so many fun details around every corner… where adults (and kids) embark on a real-life fairytale… leaving the stressors of the day to day behind.
We enjoyed every minute (hot tub, games/swings outside, dress-up hats, record player, hammock, treats, hiking across the street, and creative decorations/messages that made the stay extra special.
Everything you need is at your fingertips - and the communication and attention to detail were incredible.
We highly recommend this magical place … hopefully you find it as amazing as we did. :)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great place our family really enjoyed. Exactly as advertised with a couple extra pleasant surprises (nice tea collection for me and hot chocolate for kids)! Directly across the street from popular hiking trail. Hot tub was nice and kids loved the chair swings in the backyard.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mad Hatter house was a blast! Everything was as described and super fun. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time at Jen’s awesome Mad Hatter house. Such a cool and creative space. I’m grateful artistic / unique places like this exist. I would love to come back. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had so much fun at the Hatter House, we only wish we had more time to stay! It was such a fun theme with so many artsy touches throughout. We loved the privacy and felt safe with our kiddos playing outside. A great surprise was the little lending library (if I knew it was there, I would’ve brought some books!) and the graffiti wall. Lastly, we really enjoyed bringing our canine family member and appreciated all of the touches to include him, from the selection of beds and dishes, to the treat box near the front door. Just a really fun place to stay, highly recommend and would stay again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is so unique and fun! Easy check in with a code, easy checkout - little clean up required when checking out :)
Jen was very responsive if anything’s needed.
House is right off a busy road so It’s a bit noisy from cars at night but not a big deal at all and Jen includes earplugs if needed."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique stay! Very quirky and eclectic. Jen was quick to respond to any questions that we had, even when staying over the Thanksgiving holiday. Can't thank her enough for helping us have a great stay.
Only opportunity for improvements I see are that there's some wear and tear on items/areas that don't match how the place is advertised, but none had a significant negative impact on our stay."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house was such a refreshing getaway from ordinary houses! Loved the giant chess set (even though I lost 😔🤣) The kitchen has everything that you need which is really nice! The decor is unlike anything you’ve ever seen. Such a cool collection!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"To start off this was the most magical and memorable overnight stay I've had at any place. It was romantic and such a delight. The photos simply do not capture the magic of this House nor does it capture the beautiful view of the stars from the backyard. Everything was neat, organized, clean, and had some personal care items as well which was a very nice touch. Jen was always in easy to reach communication and made check in and out instructions very simple and clear. I was so happy that I was able to come across this very special and unique find. If I come back to this area, I will certainly make sure that I book the Hatter house again! Thank you so much Hatter House for all of the wonderful memories ❤️"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the most unique AirBnBs that we’ve ever stayed in. Loved this home so much and wish we could have stayed longer. So many Alice in Wonderland details made this place so special. You can tell there was so much thought and time put into this home. The hot tub was also lovely to relax in after a long day. Has everything you need for the most comfortable stay and the ambiance makes you feel like a kid again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The kids had a blast tying to count all the clocks on the property. Very whimsical and unique. We enjoyed the hot tub and outdoor chess. It was a nice place to be our home away from home.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jen’s place was a cozy and magical one .Everything you need is there .. We really enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland theme .
The backyard was very nice and entertaining . The swings were lots of fun .
Location was perfect close to freeway and Downtown Flagstaff . The Trails across the street were a bonus . Would definitely stay here again ."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fun place for a funky little getaway in Flagstaff.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great time and what a great stay. This rental is exactly what it looks like and Jen did a great job with nailing the description in the listing. It’s obvious that extreme care and thought went into the many fun details about this rental. My daughter absolutely loved the theme of the home. All the little extras were great too. Everything from the cookies and waters, to the teas etc… I almost don’t want to say anymore because I don’t want to give away too much of the discovery of this unique stay. Thanks again Jen for creating such a unique experience. Hatter House for the win!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My Girl Friend, Daughter and our dog just loved this themed house, truly a hatters dream… it fit the perfect need for a heat getaway and was so much fun to dress up and get into the idea of just being well as we are ready for a tea party!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a unique and fun place! Highly recommend for a fun stay in flag!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We'll keep your ""mad hatter"" house in special memory. It's a pity that we only had enough time for the standard north and south trips, you know. We would definitely be able to discover many more interesting places in Flagstaff. It was a wonderful stay with you and we can recommend everything unconditionally."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable and clean. Fun concept. The stairs are steep so could be an issue for children and older adults . The gate is a nice touch but could use some attention to keep it closed. The cement and bottle walls seem dangerous. The yard needs tlc. It is our 2nd time staying and we appreciate being able to bring the dogs. we like the location and look forward to a future visit. it improves each time we come.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is not your ordinary AirBnB. This was a creative and inspiring experience. I loved all the small treasures and attention to detail touches. The location to the trail head was awesome and I enjoyed the upstairs music room a great deal.
The hot tub was relaxing and the backyard space was fun.
The bedding was very comfortable and I appreciated that there were enough towels.
A wondrous and magical place that I highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Magical nostalgic getaway. I love what Jen has done with this home, incorporating her own spin on such a beloved story. Jen and her team was incredibly responsive and professional. I can’t wait to come back and relive this dream in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The turn off into the house is easy to miss.
aside from that, you're greeted instantly by wonderland themes, even before going inside. the house is much more beautiful than the pictures. the theme never stops.
plenty to do as well, chess, and other games. hot tub, etc. the house was clean and as expected. Jen was very sweet and responds almost instantly. absolutely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I honestly debated staying here because she is creeped out by anything Alice in Wonderland. However, I’m glad we decided to stay here!
The host was communicative, friendly and informative. The place was awesome, and the kids had a blast! It’s the perfect launch site for any trips in the area.
Thanks so much Jen, next time we come up to Flag we’ll definitely consider staying at The Hatter House again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was fun! All the necessities were there for our use. Beds were comfy and the space was great. Thankful for the AC window units to get us through some hot summer days. Would definitely recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far the coolest Airbnb I have ever stayed at! The hosts were wonderful, extremely communicative, and had such strong attention to detail with the decor. Our personal favorite was the tea table! The beds were super comfortable, and each room looked so much better in person. Thank you so much for our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Hatter house was the most unique bnb I’ve seen.
My daughter said, “made this Cheshire Cat smile”. And this about sums it up for all four of us. Just such attention to detail and tastefully done!
Thanks for a stay that we all enjoyed! Easy to access, great communication, and beautiful view/access to Mt.Elden trailhead."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our family loves staying at the hatter house! This was our first time bringing our puppy. They added a dog treat box and a sharing library since our last visit. Made for a great option for our family to have a summer get away in cooler weather. Definitely won't disappoint!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,100% will return!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderfully unique time at the Hatter’s House. The living room was comfy. The dining room was lovely to have a tea party in with all the nice teas. The kitchen had everything you would need to cook meals and the pancakes were thoughtful touch left by the host. The bathrooms were well-stocked with toiletries. The washer and dryer worked well and was very handy. Jen even supplies soap powder! Upstairs was quirky and fun. My son loved the hammock. The beds were very comfortable. There were even dog beds and bowls! Such a thoughtful host. I loved spending time looking around. We stayed here to visit the South Rim Grand Canyon and the drive was lovely. Such an unforgettable stay. Thanks, Jen!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travel a lot and this is probably the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. It looks exactly like the photos! This isn’t a corporate-owned place like so many other listings on here — you can tell Jen puts a lot of love into this home…the attention to detail is incredible!
It was the perfect place for a restful couple of nights. Very quiet and peaceful. Couldn’t recommend this place more!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We recently stayed 3 nights here. The house is definitely unique & the inside is as described. The location was great as it was within 10-15 minutes to Downtown Flag, right across the street from hiking & just a few minutes from two dog parks for our pup. It was easy to locate with directions provided & using navigation. The house is on the older side but they have done a great job keeping things fresh & clean. The main issue we had was the yard area. It was very overgrown & neglected with weeds. For instance, the listing points out the firepit, but as it is now it would not be safe to start a fire due to the weeds. There were also gaps in the fence where a smaller dog could get out. We ended up blocking those off with things from the yard. In the current state, we didn't feel comfortable allowing our pup to be outside unattended. The outside area needs immediate attention. We realize Airbnb rankings are strict, but after talking through it we could not give it 5 stars based on this."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in June of 2023. The description of the posting matched what we walked into. Absolutely adorable. Everything was clean and the house was comfortable. The location is great. We walked across the street to hike Mt Elden. The Matador coffee house is a 2 min drive as well. Not too far from Buffalo Park and it was about a 30-40 min drive to the lava cave. After the adventures, coming back to the well taken care of hot tub was great. There was plenty of room for my dog to roam. We'd definitely book this place again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun stay! Jen had just about everything we needed for the weekend. Bring a sleep mask if staying upstairs or you'll be up at sunrise.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This Airbnb was absolutely adorable. The attention to detail was on point. Can’t wait to stay again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to get privacy instead of using a hotel. Everything was clean, the home was so fun and check in was easy as pie. We would definitely stay here again :)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is incredible, and my favorite one I've stayed at by far. The theming is fantastic and every little touch is worth noticing. Every time I looked around I saw something new that I hadn't noticed before. Everything had been very well cleaned before our arrival and the beds and linens were super comfy. Some of my favorite parts (I'll try to limit it to 3) were the teacups hanging on the front porch, the awesome swing by the fire pit, and the cieling lights actually working in the master bedroom. I really hope to be able to visit again!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful! Jen’s place is as described. Big back yard, my dog really enjoyed it! The jacuzzi is a plus after a lot of hiking we were doing.
We had a great communication, she responded quickly ;)
We really enjoyed our stay at Jen’s !
Thank you so much for your hospitality ☺️"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You have to stay here! It’s so awesome. My Wife and girls loved it. It’s right off 89 so the Grand Canyon is nearby. Markets down the street. Quiet.. Jen was awesome! Helped me all the way. We lit the fire pit and roasted s’mores and hotdogs… and the Alice in Wonderland theme is the best! So much detail. This place is great ! Thanks Jen !
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed a short staycation here!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, unique stay at the mad hatter house. Hiking trail right outside the door. Hot tub was awesome!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay at the Hatter House, is our favorite airbnb in Flagstaff. The house is so comfortable & cozy. The kitchen is well equipped, the decor is so fun, & the master bed is super comfortable. We love the hot tub & were glad we got to enjoy it in the snow this time. We love that it is dog friendly & the yard is a great size for your pet. Jen is an awesome host, very friendly & quick to respond. Be back soon, thanks Jen!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was amazing! Such great decorations! Our kids loved it too! Definitely recommend if you our an Alice and Wonderland fan!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,let's you tap into your creative side and relaxing.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! Spacious house with 2 large bathrooms. There was quite a bit of snow on the ground when we arrived, so didn’t get to explore the outside of the home as much as we wanted to, but it is plenty of space and really fun. The hot tub was great! Short drive to Arizona Snowbowl if you like skiing/snowboarding. Would definitely stay here again when in Flagstaff."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jen was great and the house was super cool!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute home, so many details, so unique. Has everything you need with personal touches. Would recommend !"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the theme of the house and what you see in the photos is what you basically get! If you come during the winter I will say be prepared to possibly shovel some snow. Jen was a great host and we enjoyed our stay
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful hosts! Great location for navigating to AZ landmarks! Fun house with lots great touches!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fun & Fantastic place to stay! Hosts are incredibly responsive and very helpful when we were ""trapped"" by a snow and ice storm! The house is so much fun and our 10YO loved it! We were still finding hidden gems up until the last day! Great location for navigating to and from Arizona landmarks and national parks!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we had a great time at the hatter house!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great time. We are big Wonderland fans so it was great seeing all the decor. Now we know how to decorate our back yard. Lol
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really felt like stepping in a fairytale! The pictures don’t do it justice and the host was so accommodating and kind. We had a great time and even followed some of the recommendations!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Funky Awesome Cool Place with tons of delicious Tea’s and a Great Hot Tub 👍🏽👍🏽 I really enjoyed the Swings outside and the relaxing hammock in one of the rooms upstairs but I really liked that we was able to bring our Fur Baby with us. I would highly recommend🤗🤗 this place!!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing response time! Within 20 minuets of reporting an issue it was resolved. These host’s definitely care about their visitors
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,nice place!!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We visited Flagstaff for the snow and randomly decided to look for an Airbnb, Hatter House was one of the only ones available but we were thrilled about it! Our kids loved writing on the wall and playing in the yard and we loved the hot tub as well! Everything was perfect!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jen was happy to give recommendations on parks and great sledding hills. Our kids want to come back soon. We had a blissful weekend. Thank you!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my top airbnb stats of all time, we were blown away by the amazing decorations and included amenities. We had a blast in the hot tub, playing chess, and sitting by the bonfire at night. So much to do on the property and a beautiful park right across the street. Great location, we went skiing at Snowbowl one day and it was about a 30 minute drive.
If you just want a boring Airbnb don’t rent this place, save it for someone who will appreciate it! Our host, Jen was always responsive, super helpful and we are so grateful for all his wonderful experience we will be talking about for a life time. We want to come back soon!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our 3 night stay!The house looked exactly like the photo’s and showed all the unique areas and details of the Hatter House. Which was great but maybe took a little of the magic out of searching the property. I could totally picture a family looking around the house and property for the first 1 hr of check in! The added amenities exceeded my expectations, after two long days of snowboarding coming home to a nice warm house and hot tub was awesome. Master bed was super comfortable and soft. We were craving popcorn one night to watch a movie and there just happen to be a bag provided with all the coffee’s, creamers, tea’s, pancake mix, etc. We didn’t bring any shampoo/conditioner and the house had some good quality shampoo/conditioner. The host was super responsive, she seemed to message back immediately. You can tell a lot of thought went into this property and they really wanted to please their guests. Thank you again and would definitely stay again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place! Had a great time
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an absolute blast on our Mad Hatter Christmas! Our son was so surprised! Everything looked and smelled very clean and was overall whimsical! We especially enjoyed the hot tub after a long day of skiing and again after stargazing from the backyard. And it was a good location for all we wanted to do. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"House was just as listed. Wish we could have taken advantage of all the outdoor activities on property, but its December and cold outside! No fault of the owners, will just have to come back when the weather allows!"
2022-12-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mainly booked this to have a hot tub. 1st night the hot tub ended up irritating our skin (itchy & red bumps) & completely bleaching my bathing suit. When I brought it up to the host, she didn’t show any concern & said someone will clean it the next day. We didn’t hear anything until I messaged again at 5pm the next day about it. Then she sent someone. Turns out the previous guest before us dumped a WHOLE bottle of chlorine into it. He said he’s never seen that much in a hot tub & had to drain it multiple times. Seems irresponsible to leave it up to a guest to put chlorine in the hot tub without checking it for the next guest.
On another note, the house was okay but could use some updating. The showers were old & the floors were really creaky. Also the home is right off a busy street. Some of the windows didn’t have any curtains to make it private at night so it did make us a lil nervous at times when it was dark. I feel like the pictures don’t capture the home well."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really fun and endearing place. Pancakes were good
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a fun get away! Every detail is so thought out and intentional.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is very unique and definitely a fun and creative place to stay. If you’re looking for something different, this is it. My daughter loved all the details. Especially the wall of signatures and the pin 📍 maps showing visitors from all over the world. It has everything you need as far as your typical amenities. Close to shopping and eateries. Walkable trails."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a very unique and fun place to stay. It was also extremely comfortable with great beds and furniture.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Alice theme of this house is so well thought out and fun and whimsical. My 4yo daughter got so excited finding all the clocks, and nooks and yelling “omg mommy I didn’t even notice this!” Trying on the hats was so much fun, and we brought Alice costumes for a photo shoot. We had a blast and def hope to return."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! most unique place i’ve stayed at
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very nice one night stay at this Alice in Wonderland themed Airbnb. The unit is outfitted with everything you could want to be comfortable and a lot of things you didn’t know you might want that added to the fun. We had a great time relaxing in the hot tub, trying to play the piano, and sampling the different tees while wearing Alison in Wonderland hats. The washer and dryer was also very handy since we have been hiking prior to our arrival. I would definitely recommend this whimsical stay if you are in the area!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It certainly is a unique and creative house and yard! Felt the cleaning fee was a bit high, but I suppose the entire place would need to be cleaned after some guests. It was just the two of us and we enjoyed the decorating and theme."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The most charming Air B & B we have ever been to!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our 2nd stay in the last couple months at the Alice & Wonderland House. We had such an amazing stay the first time, we couldn't wait to come back. Jen is an awesome and welcoming host. She has created a great experience with the Wonderland theme, in addition to a comfortable, clean, & well stocked home. We can't wait to book again this winter & enjoy the hot tub again, hopefully with some snow. Thanks Jen for truly creating such a unique, enjoyable experience!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Super fun and unique place
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"5 star review for the overall theme. We loved all the decor and little touches to follow with the Mad Hatter Theme! There was great communication with the host and check in and out was very easy. The location, while on a busy highway was fine for us. There was a lot of ambulance and helicopter sounds at night, I imagine it must be close to a hospital?
We didn't didn't find the dog friendly accommodations until the last night we left as we didn't open and search the closets until we were looking for an extra bath towel. But that's probably our fault for not being nosey LOL. An outside trash receptacle for doggie waste bags would have been convenient too, if there was one we didn't see it.
Again we really loved all the decor and the whole experience. There were some burnt out lightbulbs and the outside tables and hot tub cover were very dusty/dirty. We had to wipe them off to be able to use the outside table. We didn't use the hot tub while there due to the strong chemical smell when we lifted the cover. I know to expect that but it was a lot stronger than i'm normally used to and we opted not to use it. And just little things like burnt out lightbulbs, stickey counters and only 2 tissues in the tissue box. We did look through the kitchen cabinets for additional kleenex but didn't see any. Again nothing huge just small minor things.
We were going to have a ""tea"" party but the only tea flavor that we really liked (Cherry Blossom) only had 2 bags and my mom hogged them for herself. We did really like the brand and flavor though and ordered some off Amazon to enjoy at home! It was also advertised in the listing that cookies were provided for the tea party experience but there were none that we could find. There was an empty bowl on the county when we arrived, which based on other pictures we've seen is where the cookies would have been.
Overall a really nice experience and it was a great place to stop in our travels for a couple days to get some personal work done for my remote job and to get a break from the car.
Thanks for such a unique experience!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was amazing. It was like staying in artm the attention to detail was impressive.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! Great details, all amenities provided, very clean and great communication with Jen! Would recommend for an enchanting escape and will definitely be coming back for another stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical fun place and great experience all around! We enjoyed our visit so much, such fun, creativity, and attention to detail. Instead of a run-of-the-mill place to stay, The Mad Hatter and Alice in Wonderland theme throughout adds a special touch. Jen has thought of everything in putting her place together and is ready to help with information or whatever comes up. We enjoyed it all -- dinner at the elaborate tea party table, a hot soak in the spa, a round of croquet by the ""flower bed"", a swing on the swing, playing the piano, a game of chess using massive chess pieces, even a romp in the master bedroom under the decorated ceiling and ornate mirrors. The location was perfect for our visit to Flagstaff. Looking forward to another stay. Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Adorable! Will definitely look to stay here again when in the area. Great communication and definitely as expected. It pays to be nosey so make sure to look everywhere! I don’t want to ruin all the surprises but it was such a fun space. I felt like I was visiting with a grandma while there it was so homey.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an awesome stay at the Hatter House. The home is cozy, comfortable. clean, & well equipped with everything you need. Jen did a great job creating an awesome experience that you don't usually find in typical air bnbs. From the decor, the landscaping, great hot tub, croquet, and much more. My husband and I enjoyed it all. We even watched Alice & Wonderland on our iPad in the hot tub. since my husband had never seen it. Great 5 STAR property for guests of all ages!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a unique and wonderful place to stay. My wife and I stayed for our anniversary and had a lovely time!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love this home. I booked this room last minute for my sweet daughter's 13th. I wanted her first ""teen"" birthday to be special. She was amazed and loved every single special touch. We enjoyed the jacuzzi with our sparkling soda n/a ""mimosas"". We even had our own Mad Hatter's tea party and played a little Wonderland Croquet!
There were many restaurants and great shopping very close by. I liked it because I didn't have to drive far in the ""Dark Skies"" of Flagstaff to get what we needed. We we very close to Lowell Observatory, which is where we spent my daughter's birthday evening. This home is so well laid out and so adorable. Wonderful. We loved every minute."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Unique stay for the night. Thanks!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cool place!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a strange trip! We came to relax and find ourselves already missing this place. At first we were a little weary of the location being on a highway when we were looking for solitude, but once we entered the house, we felt like we were taken to a totally different place and we were completely unaffected by outside forces. Our dog also loved the yard and the awesome pet beds provided. We will be back and would recommend to anyone🥳"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great weekend in Flagstaff! This house is exactly as pictured and made for an excellent and much needed escape from reality. The swings in the backyard along with the hot tub for two were two of our favorite things to enjoy. There is also a fire pit and croquet. Jen, the host, was easy to communicate with and left cookies and water for us to enjoy during our stay as well as a full selection of teas and coffee. The location is close to pup-friendly breweries and restaurants and Jen has a closet with dog beds and dishes to help your pups feel at home. By far the best AirBnB I have stayed at!! Thanks Jen!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved this spot - beautiful views with some magic on the property.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,nice backyard and decor
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Must see to believe: Impeccably decorated house in a perfect spot located across the street from the trail head for some of Flagstaff’s most scenic hikes. And, a hot tub for resting sore muscles!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we really enjoyed our time at the hatter house. it was clean the hot tub was amazing. close to shopping and restaurants.
we would definitely stay again.
Great host's"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A fun and unique place to stay.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Alice in Wonderland! Created with a lot of love for detail.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a fun house! It was magical and fun. We really enjoyed finding all the little details there. It was clean and truly an enjoyable experience. Great location with shopping and food close by. The hot tub was super fun too! Highly recommended.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great stay with park across the street and lots of Alice-related decorations and Easter-eggs throughout the property. We loved the big chess set in the backyard.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we absolutely loved our stay here! it is so unique and fun! There are so many things to do while staying here. And the hot tub is an added bonus. This has been our favorite place so far!!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Very responsive host!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was even better than expected. Every detail was impeccable and so many surprises!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So glad we stopped here. It was really cool. Clean and private and definitely interesting.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house! Definitely recommend.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Jen's place. The property was very quiet and peaceful. The hot tub was excellent, especially at night with some epic star gazing. My mom and I stayed here, and we loved all the details and accommodations Jen provided. It was a really hot weekend in Flagstaff so we were so grateful for the AC, especially in the attic bedroom. Our stay was very cozy. Thank you Jen, we will be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a fun place to stay. I couldn't hope for a better experience from my first Airbnb experience. The theme is charming. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking. It's also conveniently next to a Safeway and a dollar store for ingredients. The Jacuzzi was relaxing after walking all day. The hosts are very thoughtful. I loved the tea and coffee selection. They responded quickly to any questions which was appreciated. I would definitely consider choosing this place for a future visit to Flagstaff.
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"Aside from the unique decor, this house has nothing else to offer. Our family had an awful time and cut our reservation short and left early, because it was an awful stay.
Backyard is full of weeds. I understand monsoon and rain season in Flagstaff. More of a reason to have landscaping more often to prepare for this. Broken mirrors outside making it dangerous for our dog and children.
The two rooms upstairs are a joke. The room with the hammock is so small that you literally can't even move. The other bedroom just fits a queen size bed.
Lots of loud road noise because the house is literally on the highway. The air conditioners are extremely loud and do not reach the master downstairs.
The couch by the front door was in awful condition full of stains, hair and other nasty particles. The landlord said that she was replacing the couch one hour prior to our arrival, which made it inconvenient for her because we arrived a bit early. It will take much longer than an hour to get the large couch out of the house and the new couch inside for our arrival.
When I reached out to the host to help with our concerns, she was very rude and dismissive. She stated that she can't control my expectations. Our family was just looking for a safe and fun house and this place was definitely not the one."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing stay! The house is clean and extremely well stocked! We were very comfortable and our dogs loved exploring the yard. We wished we had more time to spend there. Thank you for a wonderful stay, Jen!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is as cute as it looks in the photos. It's well stocked with kitchenware, toiletries, even some extras you might not expect. The location is cool, kind of urban rural. You are not likely to encounter neighbors but can walk to Starbucks, or a little further in opposite direction to a much better local coffee roaster called Matador. it's a pretty-ish walk of about a mile each way. But you're better off picking it up in the car and then heading to a hike in Walnut Canyon."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had fun stay at Jens place! We would stay here again!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was beyond perfect and amazing! The location was close to everything you could want to do, and perfectly centered for all the drives to the sites! We taught our daughter how to play chess with the Alice and wonderland chess board! Amenities are perfect and I could not recommend a better place to stay! Great yard, private, close to shopping, and completely relaxing!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect base camp for our Grand Canyon trip. The house was spacious, comfortable, and the Hatter theme was super fun. The location was great; right next to Safeway for essentials, and a short drive to downtown Flagstaff for food and shopping. The trails nearby were closed due to fire restrictions, but we still found plenty to do...including the Flagstaff Mall just down the road. Travelers with dogs will appreciate the fenced yard. The kids say: ""Another great thing are the pianos. They are really fun. I loved having a tea party☕🫖"""
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jen’s place is lovely. It’s a very fun place for kids. It had everything we needed and more.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was BEYOND unique! My 7 year old daughter was in heaven! Jen is a great host and has created he most fun rabbit hole ;) It did get a bit hot in the master bedroom at night but Jen had a fan and opening the windows helped. There were A/C units in most every room so we were all good. The house was also right off the highway so traffic sounds are a thing when outside but didn’t bother us at all. If you are going through Flagstaff and looking for a fun time whether with friends or family this is a one-of-a-kind fun experience and not to be missed!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Fun and funky! Loved it! Try something different you wont regret it.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's all about the decor and hot tub here! The best getaway to truly escape the world. Clean, comfortable, and crazy fun details. My girlfriend and I had our own rooms too. Jen and her boys were very helpful and kind. No need to bring much to your stay. Safeway, CircleK, and much more are nearby. AND you must eat at The Toasted Owl nearby (all owl decor for sale). So fun!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is so cool and unique. All the details and small touches were very much appreciated!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a strikingly mad time staying at the Hatter House! It really was an Alice in Wonderland dream house. Decor was phenomenal! Owners were quick to respond for any questions we had. Also gave us a great recommendation for where the best place to see the Grand Canyon! We will likely be back soon to visit again!! Thank you!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a ton of fun, so unique. We were all blown away and had a great time!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So beautiful and fun! The hot tub was lovely 😍
2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is older and from the price of the stay I thought it would be nicer and cleaner. The living room furniture is stained. Some things on the amenity list were not found in the house. There was a wasp problem in the back yard and a lot of cobwebs/spiderwebs. Im not sure if anyone tends to the back yard except for the jacuzzi. I mentioned everything to the host and she was very nice about it and going to take care of them but my thought is everything should be taken care of before her next guest comes to stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This home was the total experience for an inclusive stay. I stayed for two nights and each night I noticed a new detail I hadn’t seen the day before. It was an amazing stay and the hot tub for two was the perfect touch.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,what a fun place!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great 👍
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Most unique stay I've ever had, comfortable beds nice place FOVE STARS"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was magical! So many thoughtful, quirky touches and would be a dream for children and families."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was great! We loved all the details put into the house. We all dressed up in character and had a tea party. The house is a good size for 4 adults, we had 5 but we made it work. The outside of the house was nice as well, the hot tub and the fire pit were a great touch. Communication was great, check in was easy. We had a great time."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a cool place to spend time and relax
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great change of pace from your basic lodging options. Whimsical, fun, and so many little surprises tucked inside and out."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely worth it if you’re looking for something out of the ordinary!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jen’s place was amazing! My family really enjoyed the decor and the upstairs area was perfect for our 2 kids. The kitchen had everything you could need and the hot tub was a special treat on cold nights. It was also the perfect location too! Highly recommend this place! Hope we can visit again soon!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very creative unique airbnb, our 6yo had a blast."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Holy moly this place exceds expectations! The little surprises to discover were such a treat!! Jen was a wonderful host and we even booked another night because we loved it so much!!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute/fun/spacious property and house! Jen is a great communicator and easy going!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing....stayed twice in one week!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was magical from the start! We spent about 15 minutes exploring the outside of the house before we even entered! Every detail inside and out brought a smile to our faces. My daughter LOVED sleeping in the hammock! Jen was so responsive and clearly cares about her guests. We were visiting Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon area to decompress after a funeral and Jen was so sweet to offer condolences and make sure we enjoyed our stay…the host from Airbnb we stayed at for the funeral didn’t even do that! If you have the chance to visit this crazy, magical, MAD place, you MUST!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The new standard against which all AirBnB's will be judged! This place is overflowing with creative touches and fun amenities: old-timey record player that my husband enjoyed, harpsichord on which my son happily played ""ominous music,"" popcorn, pancake mix, a wall you can write and draw on, a hammock my son loved sleeping in, hot tub, croquet, and so much more to discover. We did not find anything we could possibly have asked Jen for or about, but I'm confident if we needed her, she would've been quick to respond and help out. It's near the Safeway for groceries (my husband walked there) and there's a nice little pueblo ruin (Elden Pueblo) up the street. Follow Jen's directions to find it; Google will steer you wrong. Minor caveats that might apply to specific people: It's right off the highway, so if you are very sensitive to that kind of noise you might be unhappy. There's a lot of china around, so if you have roughhousing kids that could be a challenge. The stairs to the attic bedrooms are weird and steep, so people with limited mobility or clumsy toddlers might struggle--but the master bedroom is downstairs."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We planned a getaway birthday vacation for my wife and she was blown away by the Hatter House! It was very unique and you felt disconnected in a positive way, while being close to any of your needs (gas station, grocery stores, etc.). It was snowing hard while we stayed and the house stayed plenty warm and cozy! The bed at the top of the steps is a game changer (soooo soft, but not too soft), make sure to call dibs first! Thank you to Jen for making check in so easy and for providing a wonderful home to stay in for a getaway weekend. The Hatter/Alice in Wonderland theme was so amazing!"

The house is beautifully styled, cozy, exceptionally clean and organized. I don't know how it could be more accomodating.
Read the well written guide attached in the email before your arrival to avoid embarrassing yourself with questions already answered in the guide. :)
Best stay yet!"

The bed/bath linens were high-end and beds were comfortable. There were high-end, non-toxic amenities throughout (bath/body, kitchen, laundry, etc) provided. There is so much to do and see in the area! There is a highway and busy train tracks that can be seen and heard from the house, although they did not bother us and the host provided sound machines in both of the bedrooms. Even though the house sits on a working ranch property, we felt we had plenty of privacy during our stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Ranch House was wonderful! We spent the evening and next morning in Flagstaff and the location was very convenient while offering peace and privacy. The house itself is modern but comfortable and cozy! We made good use of the in-unit laundry which was so handy. All of the other amenities were stylish, functional, and comfortable! Beds, bathrooms, kitchen, living room, etc. were all perfect! Being an active ranch it was also fun to see the animals in the morning, and in particular meeting one of their very sweet and affectionate cats. If you're looking for a home base for the area, but with more privacy and quite we would definitely recommend staying at the Ranch House!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, close to Flagstaff but far enough for peace and quiet. Perfect spot for our toddler as there were toys to play with and amenities for him. Very responsive host as well. Would love to stay here again!"

The only downside outside of the home is that Uber doesn’t like to go out this way because it’s about 14 miles out of downtown and if they do, they charge a pretty penny."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t know if I could say enough about this property or the host. ￼ the house is so clean it seems new. All very good quality, soaps and toiletries, etc. Absolutely everything you need to cook any meal you would like. The location is amazing. Beautiful views and windows everywhere. It snowed while we were there and they shoveled the sidewalk in the mornings before we got up! Yes, I’m serious! I could not say enough about this stay in this review. I have stayed in many many places while traveling and this is absolutely the best. I would refer anyone to this property. Both king beds in each room, absolutely amazing to sleep on. Nice soaking tub in the master bathroom which was amazing! Everything is squeaky clean. It’s just one of those places you feel at home the moment you walk in. Even if this place is a little farther away from where you would actually like to stay, I would stay here. Five stars! ￼"

We lovveeddd the gas fireplace the kitchen had everything you need ( kitchen utensils wise) to make a nice breakfast before you start the day. We explored flagstaff,
Sedona, the Grand Canyon and walnut canyon which was literally 5 mins from her place. Great restaurants in town. We had a day where we all just stayed in and watch a series on the TV snuggled up on her super comfy couch with the fireplace on. I loved it there so much. We weren’t bothered by it, but it is very close to the highway so you hear the train and cars go by if you’re outside and a little hum of it inside but it’s really not even an issue. Seriously her place is a gem and I would stay here again and again"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is probably one of the best Airbnb’s that I’ve stayed at! It was very clean, organized, and the interior was beautiful. We really appreciated how clean the house was which is important to us since we have a baby and a toddler. Overall, we hope to stay again and enjoyed our experience."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful! All the little touches were so nice and made the home so much more inviting. Jenna was extremely responsive during booking and check-in. And I loved the digital guidebook! It was so helpful. The home had everything you could need, especially if you’re traveling with a little one. The high chair and pack and play were nice to have, but the children friendly dishware, toys and books were the best part! The home was near the highway and railroad tracks but noise was minimal, we barely noticed. Our favorite part was how peaceful it felt since it was away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, but still close if we wanted to get out. Also, being able to see the cows from the kitchen window every day was a delight.
I cannot say enough good things about Jenna and her home. We will definitely be booking again the next time we are visiting Flagstaff. Thank you so much!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place to rest and relax!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time with the family. It was me, my husband and our two young kids. We were close enough to all attractions. It was a very clean, had everything we needed and our stay was perfect and what we were looking for. Definitely recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have to say everything was perfect!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time! Went to Flagstaff for grandson's graduation from NAU. Spent three nights of some of the best sleep in a long time in very comfy beds. The outside is very plain, but once inside, everything is updated and works great. The smart TV with all the Netflix and Amazon Prime videos was enjoyed at night. Jenna had some recommended eateries, so we tried out the eatery at 3 Beaver St and had the best breakfast, then headed across the street to the bagel shop for the next morning's breakfast. Everything is within 15 minutes and easy to get to. We were in Flag about three years ago and discovered a wood carver who makes bears of every size and eagles, etc. He was only 15 minutes away, so we went over and bought another wood-carved bear and an eagle. I love trains! And about a quarter mile away are the train tracks, not so loud as to be bothersome, but a wonderful backdrop. This place is just off the freeway. VERY CLEAN!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jenna is an awesome host. The property is just like pictured. It's beautiful and really clean. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again in a heartbeat.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for my family and I. We loved that it was on a ranch! The area was absolutely beautiful. The view of the mountain with snow on top was so pretty. The house was new renovated, Very clean and Comfortable. It was father then i wanted it to be from snowbowl mountain But it was worth that 40 min drive."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Jenna’s little ranch home. It was just enough for a a small family getaway. My kid loved that he could see the trains pass by from the living room window. The location was very quiet and peaceful, even with the highway and tracks nearby. The space was sooooo clean and cozy. We will absolutely stay again, it was a great find and a great price. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The nicest place we have stayed. Everything is new. There was so much thought put into catering to women and children. Great views from several windows. We pulled in one night to huge deer! Close to highway which made traveling to Horseshoe Bend and Meteor Crater. Highly recommend staying here!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at this house in Flagstaff! We were there for the North Pole Experience with Santa, which was just 10 minutes away. The house was spotless & I think new construction. Modern furniture, kitchen & bathrooms (with a beautiful soaking tub).
The house is on a ranch. We saw some cute cows near a barn. It was a very beautiful setting & allowed my child to run around outside, instead of being cooped up in a hotel. There is a highway at the edge of the ranch. The minimal traffic noise didn’t bother us and we slept well. They had sound machines in the bedrooms for white noise, but we didn’t need them.
It rained in the mornings while we were there, but we happily hung out on the comfy couch, read & played board games. It was a quick drive to Whole Foods, Local Juicery & Pita Jungle (which has yummy gluten-free pitas and pizza). We did a scenic 1 hour drive to Sedona for a daytrip & hike up to Cathedral Rock. We loved our stay at this house!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,When we first arrived at the Airbnb the house looked and smelled clean which was a great sign. It had all the amenities we could ask for! Loved that we had the water purifier for our use. The surrounding areas were not noisy but really peaceful with Mountain View’s around the house. It was a great stay would definitely recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jenna was very responsive. Her place is spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. She provided everything we might need.
Wonderful home. Would definitely return!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful house and very comfortable. All necessities in the kitchen and laundry. We had a very pleasant stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was exceptional! Easy to find, very clean and homey! Only thing that would make better for us would to have a box fan in the rooms. Sound machine was nice but not the same as a fan.
Would definitely go back!!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay while exploring nearby. Jenna’s place was simple, intentional, clean, well-equipped, and comfortable exceeding our expectations. Communication was great and accessibility in town was convenient."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just beautiful.. would have moved in right away! Very clean! Very welcoming! You feel like home! Would have liked to have stayed longer!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have a lot to say about this place and all positive. This is the best place I lived so far. Jenna was very helpful, gave us all kind of informations. About traffic, local stores, restaurants, things to do even about the ranch animals. House was super clean and very specious. I have to mention about the supplies. Bathroom, kitchen, laundry room was full of supplies. There was nothing missing that I can ask for. Neighbors were so friendly. They let us pat their animals and take pictures. Very comfortable 4 nights. Highly recommend this place. If I come this side again, of course I would try to get this place. I thank Jenna a lot for all the help and communication."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful area just right out of town. Home is very welcoming, beautiful, comfortable and clean. Highly recommend. If we were to be in the area again, we would repeat our stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was THE BEST AirBnB we have ever stayed at. The house had any and all amenities anybody could ever want. From the sound machines in the bedroom to the fully stocked kitchen and laundry room, there was nothing we wanted for. The house was spotless, and smelled clean. I even looked for dust and couldn’t find any. The bedroom closets also had everything we needed including different sized hangers and a hamper.
The property itself was something out of a movie. Within 50 steps we were face to face with 80 of the cutest cows we’ve ever seen. The owners were more than helpful guiding us to the Arizona Trail, where we saw the cows grazing and a mountain view. The cats followed us everywhere we went and became a source of love&entertainment.
We can’t say enough about how absolutely incredible this home/property is. We will 100% be back and will recommend this place to everybody we know."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, great host. Thanks for the lovely house... it is worth the visit to the Walnut Canyon.."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great house with lots of privacy. the house was clean and we loved the updates.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband & I were looking for a retreat to rest & relax, away from busy life & the city for our anniversary. Wish we could have stayed 3+ days here. It is the most beautiful, clean, organized, peaceful place to rest & re-charge! We were blown away by the cozy, peaceful environment & the natural soaps, lotions, etc that were provided by the host. Jenna is very communicative & kind. The digital guidebook was 1000 times better than any binder. Check in & check out were a breeze. We honestly wish we could live here full time. It is just so peaceful. We will be back. ❤️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful Ranch House ! Such attention to detail in design and comfort. 10 minutes away from many restaurants and shops.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The amenities were awesome. Everything we needed and more. A few more dinner plates would be good and patio chairs. We loved this place.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jenna’s place was the perfect location, since we were attending a wedding at the Sycamore venue. It was right down the road! The place was super clean & cozy with luxurious bathrooms. Our toddler had so much fun - the ranch provided lots of room to explore, run around, animals to see, etc."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cleanest rental we've ever stayed in. Beautifully redone and exactly as pictured and described. We enjoyed the short drive (10 minutes or less) into Flagstaff and it was a great ""home base"" for our day trips to the Grand Canyon and Sedona. Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host Jenna was amazing. She was super responsive and always provided clear instructions. We loved the house so much! It was quite modern, clean and super comfy.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"definitely one of my favorite bnb stays
and only 10 min from town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Long time no longer had such a beautiful, modern and quiet accommodation. 10 min from Flagstaff and if you want to have your peace in the evening absolutely recommended. Everything was completely new and it was very clean. We as a group would go there again any time. The tips in the guide were also excellent."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an amazing place to stay! Very cute, peaceful interior with nothing missing. Definatly the cleanest airbnb we've been to yet, we had a great time and can't wait for our next stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Only spent one night but they did not want to leave... If we're ever passing thru again, we'll stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I love to travel and feel the local vibe by staying at Airbnb’s. Jenna’s will forever fill me with a special warmth. Truly one of my favorite places yet. The working ranch experience was a memorable experience for my family. The special kid friendly touches for my 21 month old niece were super! She loved interacting with the kittens and the goats on the property, and watching the birds through the large picture windows. Husband loved the fresh roasted coffee!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful Airbnb to stay in Flagstaff. Loved to soaking in the bathtub. We would return in the future.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jenna’s place was so cute! Absolutely loved the bathrooms— especially the master! The stand alone tub and great size shower were luxurious! The kitchen was adorable and plenty of space to hangout and play games! Loved our stay!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can only describe Jenna’s place with one word: “perfection!” From the comfortable, stylish furnishings to the immaculate cleanliness, every square inch of her home was top notch! The bed was so comfortable, I don’t think I’ve ever had such a great night’s sleep on a vacation ever, the bed was so comfortable?! In addition to the comfortable, spacious interior, the ranch property the home sits on is sprawling and offers privacy— and yet is an easy, 15 minute drive to downtown Flagstaff. (Check out Pizzicleta for their delish handmade pizzas!). The sunset views are incredible, and the sweet barn kitten on property was so friendly and sweet! Jenna was so easy to communicate wit! It was the perfect getaway from the Phoenix heat, we would definitely stay there again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We chose Jenna’s place because we wanted to watch the best meteor shower of the year, and we couldn’t be happier with our experience! The house was beautiful, new, so clean, and felt very stylish and luxe.
The property is lovely, and we got to meet all the horses, goats, and barn cats—a highlight.
The peaceful, private, surroundings made for the perfect spot to stargaze.
Thank you so much, we would definitely stay again!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I used Jenna’s adorable house as a home base for an impromptu trip to Flagstaff. It was beautiful, comfortable, and convenient. We were only there for one night, and we all wished we could stay longer- we will definitely be back next time we head north!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wish we could have stayed more than one night after a day in Grand Canyon in this beautiful, quiet home"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely worth the price! The place was perfect for what we were looking for and we loved everything about it not one thing negative to say. If this place was available we would have booked it again for our next stay.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you, Jenna for a perfect stay. Your place is beautiful and comfortable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down one of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed at. Great location away from the city but not too far. Incredibly clean and spacious with wonderful amenities. Love the view of the mountains sitting on the couch!!! This place is a steal, will definitely be back next time I’m in flagstaff."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful and exactly what how described, spotless comfortable and easy to find! Close enough flagstaff, but comfortably outside the hustle and bustle. Host was super friendly, extremely responsive and quick help However possible! 5 stars is not enough to describe perfect this place, would definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are so glad that we found Jenna’s place. It was right next a lot of coffee shops and restaurants and yet once you enter the ranch, you feel like you’re the only one for miles. We were welcomed by a beautiful view of the Milky Way. The house itself was spotless, with compact and beautiful interiors. Jenna was an amazing host and was extremely prompt in response. We are so happy to have stayed at Jenna’s place and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful and peaceful home. Super family friendly, we felt right at home!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"SO. BEAUTIFUL. The house itself is gorgeous. Looks just like the pictures. It’s clean, well decorated, and so so cozy. It’s away from downtown Flagstaff, but easy to get to, so you get some privacy with the ease of getting everywhere. And the views are incredible. Can’t recommend enough!!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What can I say but “wow!” This was one of the best airbnbs I have ever been to! Jenna does an amazing job communicating with her guests and her stay is stunning. It has everything one could need for a travel- truly the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. I would rent again. Lots of amenities. Everything is upgraded. Lots of spiders though. Saw 4 spiders in the house of 2 nights, but nothing I can’t handle and I wouldn’t take a star away for it. It’s close to the freeway and there’s a train that comes by like every 20 minutes but it wasn’t loud enough to keep me up or anything. Highly recommend this place. I wish it was my own home!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved it here! By far the nicest and cleanest place we’ve stayed in. The ranch was beautiful and fun to explore and the views were stunning.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and nice!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a brand new remodel with all modern amenities. It is on a working ranch, so that is pretty fun. There was a round-up while we were there, so we got to visit with the owner's family. They were non-instrusive but welcomed this interaction that occurred at our instigation. I have been an interior designer for over 20 years, and this little home as ALL the designer touches. This was perhaps the cleanest Airbnb I have ever rented with lots of thoughtful perks such as local whole bean coffee with grinder, tea and hot pot for water, and any bathroom supply you might possibly forget to pack. I would definitely choose this location again! The only small negative is that it is located close to the freeway and train tracks. However, once inside the house, there was not any noise problem. Chaparral pines seclude the home and provide great privacy. The host was very responsive when we reached out."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about our stay was fantastic! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to see the Grand canyon. Far above expectations.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and well-organized home in a peaceful area. Jenna was extremely helpful with directions, check in/out instructions, and recommendations. The house was spectacular with a comfy couch, everything you could need in the kitchen to cook your own meals, and super comfy beds. I will absolutely be staying here again soon!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"brand new and super clean! it’s private and quiet but still in a great location for eats, and shopping! we had problems w the AC but they accommodated for us effectively! overall a great place to stay and would stay again :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for your excellent communication, for the opportunity to be the first guest to enjoy your NEW house!! Everything in the house is so beautiful, an excellent help for us was that they have a washing machine and dryer OMG enough space for everything, the cream color of the house gives light and I loved that! Thank you for always being attentive step by step on this journey! Thank you for your good attitude, for being very friendly and this lets us know that you are professionals!! We are so grateful for everything Ivan and Vladimir, thank you very much and God bless you always! See you later and we hope to be at your house very soon!! Thanks guys!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I made a last minute reservation and the hosts accommodated my family and I on short notice. Communication with Ivan was fast and clear. This is a brand new home and everything was exactly as described - clean and well stocked. We’ll stay here again next time we visit Flagstaff.
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing Memorial weekend/birthday at the cabin. It was quiet and cozy and close to the adventures we had planned such as the Grand Canyon, Wupatki ancient ruins, Bearizona, and Sunset Crater national park. The scenery was beautiful. Plenty of towels and kitchenware as well. Visit The Chapel of the Holy Dove a couple miles down the road, it was so quaint. Would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family stayed at the thundercliff lodge for two nights and it was simply a wonderful. The peaceful surrounding with the natural beauty as you stepped outside was just amazing. The lodge is consider to be off- grid but you had everything you need to be very comfortable. And it was an easy drive to Flagstaff or the Grand Canyon National Park. Looking forward to our next visit.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful spot off the beaten track with an amazing view out the front steps! Really enjoyed the fireplace and proximity to Grand Canyon. Thanks again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled within nature's embrace, this sanctuary transcends mere lodging; it embodies a harmonious fusion of elegance and spiritual solace. Every corner whispers stories of serenity, inviting one to unwind in its tranquil embrace. The host's warmth felt like a family member. It resonated beyond mere hospitality.
Each sunrise painted the rooms with a golden hue, awakening a sense of wonder within. As the moon cast its ethereal glow, the night sky became a canvas for dreams. In this ethereal abode, one finds not just a place to rest, but a sacred space to reconnect with the soul's whispers and the universe's gentle embrace"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great beautiful place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I absolutely loved staying here. The property was/is well kept, beautiful inside and out, and Chris was very welcoming when we arrived. We love how authentic this cabin is, and would stay again. The night before check-out, it snowed all throughout the night. We woke up to fresh soft snow all around us. An incredible experience overall. Thank you, Chris, for allowing my family and I to stay in your beautiful cabin."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely wonderful lodge for a peaceful, disconnected stay in the mountains."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful time at the cabin. It was exactly what we were after -- a quiet escape in a snowy cabin. The cabin itself is incredible. Extremely cozy and stocked with everything we needed to stay warm and make home cooked meals. The property itself is gorgeous. We loved hiking around the private road nestled in the mountains. Mornings were chilly, and we were grateful for the toasty wood stove and ample firewood. Thank you Chris!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great cabin in a private location! Easy drive to the Grand Canyon for day hikes. Chris was quickly responsive to any questions. Kitchen was well stocked for our needs. Kids loved playing in the snow and running around the property. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chris's place was beautiful. We arrived a couple days after a major snowstorm, and it was like a picture book outside. Then when we got to the cabin, it was gorgeous. The place felt like home and very comfortable. The amenities were above and beyond inside the cabin that were available. You can't go wrong staying here. We would love to come back again in the near future!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of our favorite places to stay in Flagstaff!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful private place, woke up covered in snow just breathtaking! Only complaint would be it was cold even with wood stove on."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Such an awesome place to stay. Would definitely come back.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice and relaxed time at Chris place. We really enjoyed the chimney and all the complementary coffee. One thing if you are not about super rustic, forest insects and not squeaky clean this is not the place for you. Nice place overall!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great time!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice location
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love Thundercliffe ranch! We get to make lasting memories with our boys while we explore the wilderness and unwind in a peaceful and gorgeous setting.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best host ever i have tried on AirBnB
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such an amazing and beautiful cabin, Chris was spot on when I had questions. The cabin was such a great experience with my family that we will definitely do it again in the future. 10/10 for sure"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would give one hundred stars if I could. I have stayed at several Airbnb’s, this stay was far and away my favorite. The host, Chris, went above and beyond for us. A once in a lifetime experience!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to get away from city life.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nothing wrong to say about this location. Very clean.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We would definitely come back again, the place is beautiful , we had a great time. The cabin is very cozy. Chris was a very good host, 100% recommended!!!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"I will start by saying this place is great and Chris is absolutely amazing. This cabin is beautiful. We enjoyed all the little nick nacks and decorations. The is in a private area and very close to the snowbowl. It's very relaxing and has some pretty neat features. Highly recommend, especially during the busy season.
Cons: The cabin was very dusty and sorry to say, but the floors were dirty too. This place needs a good cleaning. We had a 10 month old with us, and it's important to be clean.
2nd - The power went out 4 times in the middle of the night over a two day stay. Chris helped provide direction on how to start the generate. Overall: 4/5 Stars"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely breathtaking views, peaceful & in beautiful unspoilt surroundings.
Lodge was fabulous & made you feel like you were in another world compared to what we are used to.
Back to nature but with every you need.
Chris the host has nailed this lodge."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Thundercliffe lodge is perfect; nestled at the edge of a meadow and surrounded by national forest, it is the perfect peaceful place to enjoy family time together and appreciate nature. The lodge itself is so thoughtfully decorated and comfortable that you feel like you are staying at a friend's well-appointed home; I especially loved the cozy little reading nooks that were perfect for relaxing with a good book. The kitchen had lots of supplies, and in addition to the well-appointed interior, there are great places to hang out outside on the front patio and an outdoor fire pit. The location is great, too; nice hiking nearby, and less than an hour from the south rim of the Grand Canyon, Wupatki and Sunset Crater N.M.s, and lots of good restaurants in Flagstaff only 15 minutes away. We would love to come back another time soon! :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful time in the cabin with my beautiful wife. look forward to coming out again to the lodge
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was private but not far from town. Surrounded by the beautiful National forest and dark skies! Host was responsive to questions. Ample room for a family and plenty of seating outside to enjoy nature. Thanks Chris!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chris was a fantastic host and the property is exactly what I was looking for. First weekend up in flagstaff and Chris's guidebook was very helpful as well. The property itself is extremely cozy and very clean. Obvious instructions for use of the wood burning stove that made each night dreamy. 10/10 would recommend to anyone else looking for a cabin in the woods up in flagstaff with a great location but still feeling secluded.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location in the nature. From here we visited Grand Canyon (50min.) and Antelope Canyon (150min.). Both more than the must!
Location was nice and quiet. We're a great experience richer."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place in beautiful surroundings. I can definitely recommend the log cabin. It‘s cosy and quiet in the middle of the woods. I wish we could have stayed forever. Well equipped kitchen and very clean cabin.
Thanks for having us, Chris!"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin and location were awesome. The only things that made it a bad experience were that there was no microwave and no wifi, and the dvd player didnt work or wasnt connected to the tv properly. I also would have appreciated if they came out to try and fix the wifi instead of just messaging us to restart it or saying they would call about it the next day. I was there with my family on a working trip and was unable to do any work and I didnt have any cell service either with at&t. We also didnt know until check in that we had to remove all the bedding and towels and put them in the laundry or do the dishes etc. Just please be more transparent and honest and have a little more quick customer service going forward. I will however not be staying there again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful place I had to come back for a second stay . Great location for those wanting to visit the Grand Canyon and spend their nights enjoying Flagstaff . Host is very responsive and attentive to your needs . I highly recommend this place to others who want a little rest and relaxation.

Incredible views, very thoughtful and accommodating host, beautiful and well built home with a sweet history and memorable decor. Also great for a family reunion with unique and fun accommodations to share vacation together.

Definitely will be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location & very nice cabin. They plowed the road so we could make it in. I would go back again.

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin looks exactly as pictured. It is clean and free of clutter. Chris is a responsive and professional host and lives in a cabin next door. He keeps the road clear when snowing. One downside is that our internet connection and therefore TV was poor though out most of our stay (too slow to stream anything on TV or any other device). We made Chris aware that this was advertised as an amenity, and he said that the dish was covered in snow and apologized.
Would recommend the place for families with kids as well as adults only groups. We had so much fun!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Once again amazing stay in a beautiful authentic log cabin. Chris is a wonderful super host. Fire was lit and cabin warm when we came in the snow. This is our second stay here

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"1000x prettier than I expected. The photos don’t do it justice. I will be coming back. Plenty of wood for the fireplace. Kitchen is well stocked, the outdoor barbecue was really nice to have as well."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chris's lodge was absolutely perfect. It was as described and more. I look forward to visiting again soon and highly recommend!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We will 100% be back! This cabin was so beautiful with brilliant decor. There were so many surprises when walking through the pictures don’t do it justice. We went with 2 kids under two and definitely a lot of work but kept them outside as much as we could .
Chris’s communication was great and we were very impressed with everything."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Thundercliffe ranch, enjoying the quiet environment and beautiful nature surrounding it. It’s a good location to visit Grand Canyon but also Sedona and other close attractions (lava river cave, red mountain trail, Bearizona …). Our family of 5 appreciated the evenings around the fire stove and peaceful nights at the lodge. We also had a sunny lunch on the terrace ! We highly recommend this place for the nature lovers."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything you can hope for to get away somewhere quiet. Clean, comfortable, friendly, peaceful."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a stunning property! So close to the amenities, yet far enough away to feel the beauty and seclusion of the forest. The house was perfect, clean, and super comfortable. We can’t wait to come back again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little cabin in a pretty spot. I loved all the little personal touches and custom furniture. Beds were comfy, would definitely stay again!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chris has invested his heart and soul and it shows and is shared. You will be more then pleased with this beautiful retreat.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chris's cabin is wonderful - we really can't recommend it enough. It's even more charming than the photos suggest, and our family declared it one of the best places we've stayed!
After a couple of nights in hotels on our trip around National Parks, this cabin felt like an oasis - and with a huge washer and dryer and plenty of hot water (despite being an off grid cabin), it really allowed us the chance to clean up and recharge. Even though it's a 2 bedroom there was plenty of room to spread out. And although we were there during snow so didn't get a chance to use the outside spaces - I can only imagine how nice it would be to sit on the covered front porch in slightly warmer weather and take in the amazing view.
Chris was so welcoming and helpful and genuinely a super host.
(One thing to mention - the upstairs 2nd bedroom is accessed by a spiral staircase which is totally stable and secure, but just something to be aware of if your group has really little ones or anyone who is a little unsteady on their feet.)
This really is a perfect cabin - highly, highly recommend!!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Warm welcome from the host in person, very cozy place and fantastic location for a getaway. Definitely recommend!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend this place! The cabin was everything we were looking for: very charming and cozy and secluded enough that we had the feeling of disconnecting from the rest of the world but ideally situated from Snowbowl, Sedona, Grand Canyon… Chris checked on us a few times to make sure we were having a great time. We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cabin was as described. Chris was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. My family and I had a great stay. Would highly recommend. Perfect off grid get away.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chris gave us a warm welcoming and a tour around the house. Showed us how to use the fire place and also provided lots of kitchen supplies. We had such a great first time experience. Everything was wonderful.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stunning home on a gorgeous & very private piece of land. It was an absolute gift to be able to spend some time here. Chris was wonderful, our stay was just perfect."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect out of town reset from the hustle and bustle! We loved the quiet location and beautiful surroundings. Chris’s thoughtfulness is obvious from the fire when we arrived to the extremely well appointed kitchen. Every detail of the log structure was fascinating and there is no shortage of artifacts and history to admire. Location is ideal for enjoying both the forest, Canyon, and town."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing!!! You will love everything about it. Chris is great and super helpful. The views are breathtaking.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chris’ cabin was just what the doctor ordered! A quiet secluded stay with the comforts of home with a rustic touch. Perfect place for young families looking to get away. Will definitely be back!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin and surrounding area are incredibly beautiful. One of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed. We stayed for 3 nights and would have stayed longer if we could. Chris was a great host! Looking forward to returning.

2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Go here. Do this. Now. We are a family of 5, and slept very comfortably in the Lodge. The lodge was amazing, every corner had a unique piece of furniture or decor to look at, and the kitchen had all the essentials for cooking (utensils, pots, dishes, spices), so we just had to buy food and drinks. Chris and his son were very accommodating and even gave recommendations of where to go sledding and where to eat. It was snowing when we went so the kids had plenty of space on the property to play in the snow, it was awesome!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location, if your looking to get away from the city and be in the woods.. this is your place. Beautiful cabin and very spacious"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great place near the Grand Canyon and Flagstaff. Property looks exactly like the photos. Fully stocked kitchen we used repeatedly, wood burning stove kept us warm, and the beds were really comfortable. The perfect place for a small family to stay when visiting the Canyon."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this cabin! Quiet, very clean, cozy, and fantastic views. Highly recommended!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great stay for anyone looking to be out in the woods for a few days. The cabin itself has all the amenities one might need. The photos are spot on and do a much better job than me of describing the cabin. It is close to Grand Canyon, numerous trails and places to explore in the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, and it is a short trip back to Flagstaff for supplies or just to visit Flag.
While there is wi-fi, it is way off the grid so don't come expecting highspeed broadband. Email and web surfing is fine. Streaming is spotty. But you didn't come out here to stay inside and watch Netflix did you?"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is incredible. Cozy spot not far from Grand Canyon, Sedona and downtown flagstaff. Highly recommend."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"There are some places no matter how they’re photographed the true majesty cannot be captured, this property is no exception. Wonderful host, one of a kind property. Cannot wait to go back!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible place to get away to enjoy a little solitude and peace. This place was very well stocked for an Airbnb. We cooked several meals and never had an issue finding what we needed. Chris was a great host and made himself available for any questions or concerns . Awesome place and will definitely be back .
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful place to get off the grid and to get away from the hustle and bustle of the world. Serene views of nature, trees mountains and wildlife. Rustic and homely decor and atmosphere. A great place for a family or friends. Chris and Joel were quick and prompt to respond. Had no issues with anything. We will want to return."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place with lots of solitude and peace. This place was very well stocked for an Airbnb. I made several large meals there and always found the utensil/tool that I needed (peeler, cork screw, cutting board, cookie sheet, etc.). The only thing I found missing was dishwasher pellets, but I brought some along from previous experience."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thundercliffe Cabin was absolutely perfect. Everything the other reviews say about scenery, comfort, and other accommodations is right on. One thing I didn't see a lot of reviews mention are the beds, and I always wonder about beds before I book. These were wonderful. My wife and I slept on the downstairs king and it was one of the most comfortable we've ever slept on. Our other guests said the upstairs bed was just as good."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Picturesque cabin in the woods. Exactly what you’d hope it to be and more. Chris is a great host who meets you on location and is very welcoming. Just book the property! You won’t be disappointed. The views of the mountains, breeze through the trees, and wood burning fireplace are just a few things we love about it. Comfy beds! Also kitchen is well stocked with everything you’ll need to cook. Seasoned wood to burn as well."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four had a wonderful time in the lodge. Everything was as pictured, and the beauty and peace of this mountain retreat in the pines were invaluable."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great experience. The location, communication and cabin were all 5 star. Had such a great time with family. Will be back!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place. Tranquil with beautiful views of the peaks, surrounded by forest. The lodge is full of character and craft. Chris is kind and welcoming. A true retreat."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the lodge. It had everything we could have needed. I was concerned about having no ac, but Joel assured me we wouldn’t need it and he was right! The porch was our favorite spot where we could hear the wind and watch the birds. We were only 15 minutes from Flagstaff which has everything we needed. I highly recommend the lodge for anyone who wants to be away from the city and enjoy the beauty of nature!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We can’t wait to stay here again some day! Remote, refreshing, beautiful. Comfort and amenities while surrounded by peace and wilderness. Thank you, Chris, for the hospitality and recommendations. :)"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin with amazing views! Chris’ cabins are 25 mins outside of town which gives you the perfect place to get away and relax. Minimal internet and cell services so you can disconnect but enough to get you by. The bed was super comfortable and warm and the fire kept the cabin nice and cozy! We actually eloped on the property and Chris was very helpful and understanding of what we were looking for. Everything turned out great and we would enjoy staying there again!
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This is an incredible and perfect location for a quiet and beautiful weekend away.

Chris and his family have phenomenal hospitality and have mead this place feel so warm and welcoming
2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Chris’ cabin was a wonderful getaway and had beautiful views. Our family loved Thundercliffe Ranch and did not want to leave.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing! Beautiful cabin in a beautiful location and a great host. We were beside ourselves when we walked in the cabin. You her the real feel you’re in a hand built cabin and built well. The former at night and in the morning was so great! And you have to try the rock bed shower. This place was so great we are already planning another trip there for the summer. Thanks Chris!

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay at Chris’s place. The cabin and the overall property were beautiful. The property borders the national forest so you are surrounded by ponderosa pine and aspens. It is a perfect place to get away from city life and be immersed in nature. We can’t wait to go back!
2020-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely loved it here. Do not pass this experience up. So afforadable and so far the most charming and best vacation my family has had. The view alone is worth the price and stay, but then you have this amazing cabin to curl up in and relax with your family or even just yourself. Everything about this stay is extremely friendly and professional. All the way down to the bedding, which we are absolutely in love with. Host was extremely nice and accommodating and gives you a brief history of the place which just makes you fall even more in love. We will definitely be coming back."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chris’ cabin was so charming and exactly what we needed for a weekend away from the city.

Amazing location and great hosts!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Neat place
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This was one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. Chris was an amazing host and more than willing to help make our stay great. We rented both the lodge and the yurt. Both of them were so fitting for our Grand Canyon trip. There was plenty of room for our party of 7. Everything from the beds to the location were wonderful. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing place. I did not want to leave. The cabin is homely and the land around it is refreashing. It is a short drive to flagstaff, next to pleanty of hiking, and only an hour drive to the grand canyon. Chris was a splendid host and was thoughtful enought to show us a comet that we had not known was in the night sky among all of the stars you can see. I will definitely be going back again."

2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Exactly what we needed! Perfect weekend in the woods. Cabin was fantastic! The “log cabin” look but every modern convenience, including one of the best stocked kitchen we’ve seen yet, made everyone happy. Hosts were very friendly and responsive. It was so nice we decided not to head into town the whole weekend and just enjoyed the perfect weather on the patio."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Chris’s place was perfect for our family of parents, grandparents and 2 small children. Plenty of space to roam and play among the pines. Large covered porch was the best feature for us. We spent hours there cooking & eating, watching birds at the small pond, and enjoying the view of the mountains. Nearby easy hikes were a plus."

2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Thundercliffe Ranch is a great getaway. The main cabin is absolutely an out of this world authentic log cabin! Sleeps many and very comfortable. It is about 20 minutes from flagstaff so be ready for the drive however the land is cool enough not to need to go anywhere! Chris is a great host and was very accommodating. Highly recommended
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,.

2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Chris was great and easy to work with. His cabin has everything you need and is in a great location!
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and chilly weather for bonfires and games galore! Yurt and bunkhouse set up made everyone feel like they were in their own getaway and amenities were amazing.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great except there was a problem w bunk house and we couldn’t use it. We made it work and it was only for two nights. We had a great time spending time with family and getting away from the grind. The place was great and seemed to have w writing we needed.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend the ranch for an unforgettable experience in all aspects. Our holiday family gathering of 8 was beyond any of our expectations...superb!
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful Place
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a relaxing mountain retreat!
Fully equipped kitchen!
PLENTY of sleeping options.
We built a fire in the fire pit the first night and sang songs.
Wonderful huge front porch for outdoor dining....including gas BBQ!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place for our family Thanksgiving, hiking in the Grand Canyon & shopping in Sedona.
Loved all of it!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful isolated wooden log with a splendid view on the mountains. We felt like being very far from civilization...but only 1h from the Grand Canyon!
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,had a great stay
2017-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place for the vacation stay
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We (5 adults) had the best weekend vacation at Chris's cabin! It was beautifully decorated, cozy, and comfortable - the perfect escape from the city. My favorite part of our visit was sitting out front each morning drinking coffee and listening to the quiet. 10/10 would stay again!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a great experience! Totally worth it. So close to nature
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place! This property is very cool. The main house has plenty of room for several guests. The downstairs bed is very large and comfortable. The bathroom has double sinks and a really neat stone shower/bath. Super comfy bedding and towels. The kitchen had everything we needed and the grill was great. We loved the extra large table outside for dining al fresco. The couches in the living room were nice. The décor is amazing. A couple of our kids used the pull out couch to sleep on. The upstairs bed is good size and the bathroom is pretty nice with a standup shower.
We didn’t need to use the 2nd cabin but it had enough room for another couple. The yurt also looked like a fun place to stay. The property is well maintained and has a koi fish pond. There was a thunderstorm and we saw a huge double rainbow afterward. We had planned to make a fire outside but didn’t have time with all the fun stuff to do in the area. We ate at a few restaurants downtown and all were wonderful. We visited Bearizona which was less than an hour away and a really neat lava park not too far away – Sunset Crater Volcano. We definitely recommend this place. Chris was very nice!"
2017-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"First, the scenery at this place is amazing. My Wife and 3.5-year-old Son shared this place with two other couples. One couple had a 1.5-year-old, and the other couple had an eight and nine-year-old plus an infant. My Wife and I got there early and were met by the owner's Wife. She was super nice, and gave a good run-down on the place. We were initially a little surprised when she told us her Son and Fiancé were staying in the cabin directly next to the main cabin and another family was staying in the Yurt. Not a huge deal, but it might be a deal breaker for other renters to know that the owner's Son is literally staying in a cabin about 25 feet away. I would inquire about this if you are interested in this rental property. In terms of the sleeping situation. The main cabin has a king bed in the master bedroom with a full-bath. The living room has a pull-out sofa about the size of a twin bed. Upstairs has a queen bed, and a pull-out sofa which is also about the the size of a twin bed. Upstairs has a full bathroom. The main cabin is nice. The kitchen had everything we needed. Moths/insects/flies were a bit of an issue, but the place is completely off the grid so it did not bother anyone. Downstairs in the main cabin it was easy to regulate temperature with the windows/verbal instructions the owner provided. However, upstairs was significantly warmer than downstairs, and it was borderline uncomfortable to take a nap upstairs and fall asleep at night. A fan upstairs is highly recommended. We stayed from 31 June - 4 July. The Wi-Fi worked great, but we never tested out the television. However, the main cabin did have some sort of satellite service. I would also inquire about the washer and dryer. The owner did not mention it, but the 9-year-old seemed to find his way past the locked door in the master bedroom where he discovered a utility room of sort with a washer and dryer. The outdoor patio was one of our favorite parts about the main cabin. During the day, and in the evening, it was great. There is a nice Weber grill and furniture to sit about 8 people. The other cabin was also neat, but is just a place to sleep. If I remember here is a queen or full bed plus a another twin size bed. There is no bathroom or shower in this cabin. Again the other cabin was occupied by the Owner's Son, and the Yurt was occupied by another family. The Owner's do not allow pets, however the other two couples we shared the place with brought their dogs. I told the owner this shortly after we arrived as soon as I found out the animals were coming. Understandably I could tell she was not pleased, but she was very understanding and allowed the two dogs to stay..."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thundercliffe Lodge is an authentic rustic yet immensely comfortable cabin nestled into the forest surrounding the highest mountain peaks of Arizona. Even in June snowy patches could be seen on Mt Humphrey. The location is superb for day trips to the Grand Canyon, Williams' Train Depot, Mystic Sedona, Native American ruins, and forest hikes galore. Only 20 minutes to downtown Flagstaff is a historic district of quaint shops with everything from handcrafts to luxury artworks. Our first night we had fish & chips at Collin’s Irish Pub, another night fine dining on linen tablecloths at Josephine’s Bistro. There are several microbreweries all within a walking distance, so pack comfortable shoes. However, you may never want to leave the lodge as it has everything to enjoy a respite in nature, the smell of pines, wildflowers and pond all attract deer, rabbits, birds (from hummingbirds to raptures) no binocular required; they are that close. Chris was an amazing host, friendly, accommodating and informative. He had recommendations to hikes off the beaten path with tips only locals know. An exciting plus for me was actually finding all 13 spices/ingredients right in the cabinet to make traditional Chai tea on the stove! Nothing beats sipping a warm drink from a pottery mug watching sunrise and set sitting on bent willow furniture in the middle of Thundercliffe’s ten acres. We loved it and hope to visit again."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cabin. Amazing views. It was very nice getting out of the valley heat. Our party was not the easiest to deal with but Chris was very patient and provided top level service. I hope you'll have my family back.
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Chris is a great host and warm-hearted to his guest. This cabin is a great place for a group of people who are going to visit grand canyon. Highly recommended!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super great stay, and location! My stay was only (1) night, but Rich was very communicative and helpful with checkin/checkout instructions. I brought my Goldendoodle and she loved trotting through the quiet backyard- and we took advantage of the fire pit. I came to Flag for a concert, only 20 mins from Pepsi Amphitheater and minutes from downtown."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place to stay for a weekend getaway

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very small ! Been to other properties of his that were nicer & bigger yard

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute place and spacious for it being a “smaller” place. It’s two bed and bath with the cutest kitchen. It was just me, my husband, and dog and felt like we have plenty of space. The backyard area was nice to have especially with it being fenced if we could just let our dog right out! Close to downtown and in a safe neighborhood."

It worked well with my 3 dogs. The yard is fenced, including the front door.

will stay again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rich's place was super clean and very well appointed. It would have been helpful if there were more instructions in the house i.e. the dishwasher was tricky to start. Rich was very quick to communicate when we had trouble with the internet, but it turned out that the network instructions sent by message were incorrect, which one of us finally figured out. I would also like to add that something really should have been done about the very thick and big ice patch outside the door so no one slips (they had just had a big snowstorm so I'm sure not a problem usually).
I have given it very high ratings because it is really nice, quiet, and has a great little yard. The above comments are meant as suggestions. The beds were big and comfy - a huge plus for us!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rich is the best airbnb host I have ever encountered. Amazing service, friendly, caring, and his places are extremely clean and neat. For the price he charges any of Rich’s properties would be an amazing deal!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at the Chalet!

Impressed by his service, I've already booked his property for my upcoming trip. Grateful for such a positive experience and looking forward to staying there every year during my skiing trips!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very warm place to stay in, 2B2B makes it very flexible.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rich's place is the best!
It is extremely dog friendly. The small fenced in yard is amazing for dogs and offers peace of mind to let them roam around. Rich made a convenient blanket for the couch as well to protect the furniture.
Location is convenient! Super close to downtown. 15 min walk to all bars and restaurants or a $5 uber ride if you aren't up for walking.
Kitchen is great! Water temp and pressure in shower is great! WiFi is quick! Heating works amazing to keep you warm on cold nights!
Rich answers super quick if you have any questions.
The mattresses are very firm so if you can't sleep without a pillowy soft mattress, keep that in mind.
Amazing stay! This will be our place when we come back to Flagstaff!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Rich’s place was just perfect. The decor is fresh and fun and super clean. It was in a great location, easy to get to the local trails and downtown for meals. I chose Rich’s place mainly because I was bringing my son’s dog for a visit while he is studying at NAU, needless to say my son missed his buddy so much he stayed with him instead, but Rich’s place is very dog accommodating and I would choose it again for that! Loved our time in Flag and would happily stay at Rich’s place again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent a lovely fall weekend at the Beaver Street Chalet enjoying hiking trails, the farmers' market and historic downtown Flagstaff, all of which could be reached by walking up to a mile. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. Rich's house was spotless and uncluttered. The fully fenced backyard was equipped with a barbecue grill, lawn chairs and a picnic table. Rich responded promptly to any questions. We highly recommend the Beaver Street Chalet."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for my daughter and I to get away for the week. Nice backyard for our little dachshund. Half a mile walk to coffee, breakfast and to pick up some pizza to go. The vintage/retro decor was amazing, very clean and well-maintained . The beds were comfortable, and we each had our own bathroom. I would recommend this place to anyone."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved the location and the opportunity to bring the dogs! This was a great stay and will happily return. Place was very clean and has great vibes.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay & we really appreciated being dog friendly! It was very clean with some great extras. Bed was comfortable & loved the backyard. We would definitely stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and quiet, exactly as it looks in the pictures, and a very straightforward check out process. The shared driveway had a clear line in the middle of the gravel, which I appreciated. Location was great for what we wanted to get done in the area!
The WiFi was slightly spotty, but it may have just been having a bad run of it while I was there—it came back pretty fast during any work calls I had to join, so I stayed off camera and it wasn’t a real hindrance."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place, perfect for 2 people or small family. Highly recommended, great host!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was beyond great especially for the price. So close to downtown with restaurants only a 4 min drive away. For some reason I thought this was a one bedroom apartment but ended up being a 2 bedroom 2 bath so that was a nice surprise lol. Probably just a lack of reading on my end. The fenced in back yard was great for having my pup. I wish we could have made use of the nice back yard they have here. There was a fire pit, grill and chairs to hang out back there but it rained a lot while we were there so, next time! Highly recommend this home for anyone staying in flagstaff. Thank you, Rich!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - the home was spotless and the furniture including both beds was very comfortable. We also loved the backyard. The neighborhood was very quiet and there was a grocery store that was close enough to walk to.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was very well laid out and decorated. It is a bit smaller than it appears on the airbnb listing. The yard space was clean and good enough for our two dogs for a few days. The beds were very nicely sized and comfortable, as were the large showers. Rich thought of everything from extra doggy bags to clean up after our pups to sandwich baggies and spices in the kitchen. Hours after checking out my son realized he left his beloved stuffed animal up there and Rich found it and mailed it back to us right away. We'll definitely be back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Awesome place for our get away from the heat. This place was newly remodeled and is very comfortable and cozy.
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot close to town! Big pluses are the separate bathrooms, well equipped kitchen, clean space. Fenced in yard was great for dogs - it’s small but there’s a little seating area and charcoal bbq. Beds were not the most comfy but the price here is right."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great home, very clean and cozy. Love how close it was to downtown Flagstaff. Rich was a lovely host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Chalet. Our pups enjoyed the back yard and exploring the neighborhood. There is a nice park close by with trails for walking. Convenient to downtown Flagstaff and NAU.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying at the Chalet! It was so cozy and comfortable that we felt like we were at home. It was such a great find! Walkable distance to quite a few places which was great. The place itself was very clean. Rich was very responsive and helpful when needed! Will definitely look at staying here again!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our road trip overnight pitstop here! The place is so cute and colorful and we felt very welcomed! Was especially helpful to have a fully fenced area where our pup could stretch his legs after a long day in the car. The rooms are on the small side but worked perfectly for our needs. We also enjoyed the record player with some classic/standard selection, very fun amenity!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute accommodations! Great location. Beds were super comfy!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a great retro vibe, and very pet friendly. Fairly new property on Airbnb, so a few kinks to work out, but we really enjoyed our stay ( our daughter didn’t want to leave, and I don’t think the 4 dogs we had with us wanted to go either) and we would be happy to come back or recommend it to our friends. Even better, what you see is what you get. No exaggerations, just a comfy spot to enjoy. Thank you, Rich"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay at Rich's Chalet. Everything was as expected in the listing. The accommodations were inviting and very clean. The instructions were clear and our communication with Rich was good. We would enjoy staying here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Rich is a truly great host! We’ve stayed with him before and we’ll continue to do so every chance we get. Rich is accommodating and responsive. His homes are clean, well laid out and the decorations make for a cozy stay(enjoy one of the books while you’re there). Add to all that that his places are dog friendly and you’ve got the recipe for a GREAT stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really loved this home! The decor was so cute! It felt cozy and bright. The kitchen had everything you needed if you wanted to cook. The fire pit and the grill was available in the back. We would love to come back to this house if we go to flagstaff again. There are great restaurants and coffeehouses close by.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Right by the city center, very peaceful, and easy to find"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a nice and quite spot. Everything was clean and the beds were so big and comfy! Rich responded so fast to all my questions and was very helpful. I’m sure I’ll be coming back to this place or his other place called the cottage in the winter time!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was very nice. Super quiet at night. It’s very tiny but has two bedrooms each with its own Bath. Living room furniture is trendy but uncomfortable for watching tv. Good little rock yard to let our dog go out on. The only reason it didn’t get five stars is I waited 45 minutes to get in due to a glitch getting door code. I tried all ways I could to get in touch with Rich. Almost canceled to go get a hotel when we finally figured out how by doing a deep dive to get the code.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute place in an accessible area. Was fine for one night and
For our animals. Although quite small, it had everything you need and was well thought out."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a lovely stay at the Chalet. It is so well-organized and comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay in Flagstaff for our son's graduation. The location and neighborhood are also great. Plus we and our dog enjoyed the lovely outdoor area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, downtown is walkable. It’s a small home, king beds take up the whole room so there’s not much space for your items. But place is furnished super cute plus a record player and other nice touches. No issues with check in. Nice yard and happy that they allow dogs."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Nice and quiet
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best Airbnbs we've stayed in! Felt right at home and enjoyed our time in this space.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at Rich's place. It was super clean and comfortable. It was nice having some great records to listen too while we relaxed. We really appreciate him letting us have our dogs there. We will definitely be back!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rich’s Chalet recently completed construction and shares the lot with another of Rich’s lodgings, the Cottage.
Rich is very dedicated to making a stay at The Chalet the very best experience he can offer to guests. He seeks feedback on ideas that would improve a guest’s experience and is appreciative of suggestions.
That said, The Chalet is already a thoroughly comfortable, well appointed, and extremely charming lodging. It is spacious, clean, and features interesting objects for you to consider i.e. a turntable and vinyl records, and more. If Sheri and I could have had a copy version of The Chalet waiting for us at every stop on our road trip we would have been delighted.
We can’t say enough good things about our experience with Rich and The Chalet."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Chalet. Rich has it decorated so uniquely and it had every amenity. It’s very clean and located close to downtown Flagstaff yet in a quiet neighborhood. His communication was quick and friendly.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this Airbnb space. It was pristinely clean and located conveniently to walk to all the downtown Flagstaff attractions, or branch out to drive to the hiking trails and National Parks. It had a nice fenced space to let the dog out, with a fire ring to enjoy the crisp evenings by. The compact kitchen was well appointed with cooking supplies and even had spices & storage containers - a bonus for us, as we love to cook family-style meals together on vacation. The cozy bedrooms had super-comfy, firm beds. We appreciated the efficient use of space, including the full laundry facilities.

Additionally, any questions we had for the owner were answered within the hour. We would definitely come back to this Airbnb."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Trevor’s. The property was very clean and a lot of thought out went into accommodations. We appreciated that!
The beds are our favorite. The shower not so much. It’s pretty tiny, understandably so. It’s an older build.
The kitchen is very open and we liked that. It’s a smaller home and put together very well.
Thank you Trevor! Our stay was great, we would definitely stay again."

EVERYTHING necessary was supplied, even coffee, creamers, sugar, Coffeemate, 2 coffeemakers, toaster, microwave, full fridge, stove… The kitchen is big enough and well-supplied enough to cook a full meal. The bed we slept in was very comfortable. The bathroom is small, but serviceable, with good hot water. Trevor was immediately responsive to our requests and questions and had compiled a book of house rules, places to eat, and things to do. Great place to stay. Will be back next time we’re in town!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay and hang out for a group or family of 2 to 4. The kids especially enjoyed the coziness of the place.
Street parking is free. Luckily, the parking space described in Trevor's instructions was available throughout our stay, as I had been told that there are no designated parking areas for each home.
Amenities and essential materials such as dishes, cutlery, bath soap, shampoo, tissue, paper towels, laundry soap, and dishwashing liquid were available to use. The beds were very comfortable, and the sheets were really clean. Having gameboards available was a plus for family game night. There is no air conditioning, but the electric fans were sufficient, given the relatively cooler temperatures at Flagstaff even during summer.
Overall, it's a great place to stay and return to in Flagstaff."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Trevor was a great host. The home was well stocked with everything but your own toothbrush.

Trevor's place was super convenient and peaceful for me and my family. He has a lot of board games and activities(darts, fire stick etc..) to do if staying in and a convenient parking spot.

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Should explain that there was a lot of remodeling going on around the area and that ally was really muddy
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place Trevor is a great host very helpful
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Large Airbnb for the price.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great find in a quiet neighborhood. The space was very well kept and had plenty of supplies for just about any cooking needs. The furnace warmed up the house very quickly and kept the room temperature comfortable. This would make for a good one night stay like I did with my family while passing through or doing a longer term stay with family.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trevor’s place was a wonderful and comfortable stay, especially last min booking. Thank you Trevor! Will definitely book again when I visit."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is a great value for the buck. The house was clean and beds comfy. The space fits 5 perfectly. The outdoor space is cozy. The heater works excellent. The shower is small but has nice pressure and heat. There is no longer a graveled area to park. Bring golashes for rainy weather and snowboots during snow. Trevor might update the photos to show an updated exterior. The front door faces an unpaved alleyway and the red dirt is no one's friend. Trevor provides nice mats to act as a mudroom, a snow shovel and broom to keep things tidy. A grocery store is less then a mile, as is La Fonda, best Mexican eats in town. I truly enjoyed my week stay at Trevor's place. As i have family in the area, I will rent again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall great place. Parking was tricky with the snow but Trevor was quick to respond when we needed it. Well stocked tools in the kitchen and a cozy place to stay for the weekend.

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,House was cozy and had everything we needed for the evening. Check in instructions were clear. Close to restaurants downtown. Only real compliant is that parking situation was horrible. Had to unload in muddy back alley and eventually parked across the street. Great no frills location for couple or group of adults. Not that convenient for family with small child/ren with lots of bags/ little people to load and unload.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I really liked was clean and I enjoy it
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a nice place to stay very cozy spacious and convenient. The TV apps included was very thoughtful. Thank you for the stay.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cozy place for a weekend ski trip. Older place but very well maintained - heat was good, shower was hot, beds were super comfortable and plenty of hangout space. Would definitely stay there again. We got there a bit earlier, and Trevor was very accommodating on letting us check in early so we can drop off all of our gear. Would for sure recommend and stay there again."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Accurate posting
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was really awesome, all needed things inside the house was provided for the stay. Really recommend anyone to stay here for their trip to Flagstaff. But one thing to improve is the parking space for the house could've been near the house or in-sight because of snow problems. Rest all the place is 💯"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean. wonderful place for stay in flagstaff.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Good -
1) The place has all the amenities and the host placed lot of attention to smaller details.
2)Bathroom was clean and well equipped; shampoo/shower gel weren't cheap ones.
3) Bed/Mattress/comforters/pillow was very comfortable (again not the cheap spring mattresses).
4) Kitchen was very clean with plenty of dishware/pots/pans etc.
5) Kids enjoyed board games, darts and cornhole. TVs has popular streaming services (youtube, netflix, prime) which was quite handy.
Not so good - Using the alley for getting in/out was horrible. As the snow melted, the alley became quite slippery (it may be due to construction next door) and we almost fell. Parking the car across the street didn't feel safe (especially since Sunnyside is not in the best part of the town). The house is small for a family of four (especially the shower)."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trevor's place is comfortable and well equipped, with lots of thoughtful stuff included--Q-tips, hair elastics, coffee filters, and a generous supply of little coffee creamers, among other things. The kitchen area is huge. Trevor is a very responsive host. The location is convenient--access to the Arizona Trail is right across the street, Safeway is only a few minutes away, and downtown is about a 10-minute drive. The neighborhood is quiet. A few things to keep in mind: the shower is very small, parking is on the street (although there is plenty of space to park), and the driveway/alleyway that leads to the door can be icy and/or muddy. I've stayed here twice now, in summer and winter, and would definitely stay again. It's often the best Airbnb deal in town, from what I've seen."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Trevor was an excellent host and the place was cozy and comfortable. Just spent the night for a snowboarding trip and it was an amazing experience all around.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Trevor was awesome and his place was just as listed. It was nice and warm, close to town, and comfy sheets! I appreciate the little touches in the bathroom such as ear plugs, extra feminine products, cleanings wipes, etc!"

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to hang out and head to Grand Canyon. Trevor is very communicative and fixed our internet issue straight away. Well stocked kitchen was great to see. Don't be put off by the outside lane, inside the apartment is old bithas everything you need for a couple of nights. Thanks Trevor!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Works well for us. The property is comfortable. I would check with Trevor about parking.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The only real downside to this comfy rental is figuring out the parking, but it was otherwise very nice."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Trevor’s place has everything you might need and much more. He has collected some great advice/recommendations around there area. The place is clean and offers everything you might need during a visit. Trevor even provided logins to a lot of video streaming providers so you can sit back and relax while watching a movie after a day of hiking.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice clean place
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great base for Flagstaff area adventures. Roomy and loved the extras (darts, cornhole)."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for your help. In rethinking I should have asked you save it so we could return next day to pick up. About $100 food😩
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A cute little place that was perfectly situated for the Coconino high school volleyball tournament and other celebrations. Didn’t spend too much time here but appreciated it!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This Airbnb was very nice and cozy. My sister and I especially loved the comfy mattresses and the creativity put into the space. The host was great at communication which is always appreciated.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"accurate description, great space and great location. 👍"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in the heart of Flagstaff. Made for a nice place to get some good rest in between hikes and different attractions. Neighborhood was quiet. Description and pictures matched well. There is some new construction to the side of the unit (2nd Ave), but if you park like the last picture in the listing across the street, we didn’t have any issues. Would stay again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I appreciate that the house was clean without having to use scented air fresheners and such , as I am sensitive to that."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Trevor’s place was in a great location close to Walmart and restaurants. The apartment is big, beds were comfortable, all amenities were provided especially if you wanted to fix a meal. There were board games provided and a nice patio too. Only thing would be the place is not as easy to find and parking is not directly in front of the unit, and needed some figuring out. But other than that place is nice !"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great and the host was helpful when I needed help. Nice pad will be back
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised for the most part, didn’t find the parking spot so we parked by the black building. Rugs were kind of dirty as well as the bathroom but for the most part it was a good place to stay for 2 nights!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun place! We always enjoy the patio and the dartboard.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This was a great spot to stay. It was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. Easy check in and out. Nice breakfast spot within walking distance.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Trevor’s casita was so cute and homey. The beds were extremely comfortable. Loved all the board games, added for a fun evening."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was really cute. Worked perfectly for our one night stay.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little home in central Flagstaff! Trevor was very communicative and the place was perfect for a story stay as we visited the Grand Canyon area! The pics on the listing are bit outdated regarding the area around the unit (there’s some new construction now partially obstructing the unit which made it a bit hard to find — especially at night), but not a big issue at all. Overall would recommend if you’re looking for a good deal and a simple place to stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable living so very close to really great trails! Resturants withing close driving distance. Back porch was lovely for relaxing and breathing in some fresh Flagstaff air!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place within a quick drive to downtown and many other places flagstaff has to offer. Place has everything one could need. Bring some eye masks bedroom gets bright with no blackout curtains. Great place overall!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place in a neat neighborhood not far from downtown. Hiked the trails and enjoyed breakfast around the corner.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Trevor's apartment is great. Good equipped and neat. We loved our stay!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is great and just as described. Trevor was helpful and sent us all the necessary information.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place. definitely worth every penny
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great value and amenities. Trevor gives great check in tips. Furnishings and fixtures are older, but the listing is very accurate. Patio is a perfect spot to chill at night. Thanks, Trevor, for a wonderful stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good place to stay if you are looking to be outside of the hustle and bustle of Flagstaff. Quick drive to downtown but far enough to not be quite as busy. This space had everything we needed and was cosy but comfortable for a group of four friends who are quite close (shared bedroom made for a closer than typical sleepover style arrangement). There were some incredibly noisy neighbors up until 3am, but that was beyond the Host's control. The fans provided in the bedroom and living room did eventually provide enough white noise; wish we'd thought of that sooner. Otherwise, a very nice and simple place to stay! Parking on the street was not crowded at all"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at this Airbnb. It has everything you need plus being very clean. I would repeat my stay here.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This place is cute and comfortable. It has everything you need for a quick stay or a short few days. Parking is a little tricky other then that everything was super easy.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is Small but does a lot with the space provided. The kitchen was amazing and the beds were soft comfy and clean. The back patio is a little small but shaded and just enough space to play some games if you are bored. My only knock on this place is the construction that occurred during our stay on the next door house. The parking isn't great. especially if you're not from there. The listing states there are pictures to help but there are none. other than that, it was a nice small place to rest your head while you explore flagstaff."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quaint, well stocked, cozy. Trevor thought of everything. The TV was logged out of one of the streaming options and I went onto AirBnb's message system to get ahold of Trevor. He responded very quickly and gave us the info to log in. We had a comfortable and relaxing stay. We will look this place up the next time we are in Flagstaff! Thank you!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Trevor’s place is great value for the price! We had more space than we expected - and it was clean. Would stay again
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice stay. Cozy and clean. Trevor was very communicative as well.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, super close to downtown Flagstaff. Great Host."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot near downtown Flagstaff to come back to after a visit to the Grand Canyon!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect—clean, quiet place with all we needed…really nice to have the kitchen available…Trevor was a very helpful host—he helped us out of a jam by accommodating a last minute change to our plans."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place as described. Met our needs for our time in Flag. Close to most everything.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location in Flag, not to close to downtown where you’ll be in traffic a lot, but close enough to everything where you don’t have to drive into town."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was perfect for a one night stop! The beds were SUPER comfy, the tvs worked great and the hosts were kind enough to purchase Netflix etc so we didn’t have to worry about using ours. Kitchen had everything we needed, darts was a good touch! Just note parking is on the street, and it’s an old home which means the bathroom is teeny tiny. There is also no AC. Would recommend, especially if you don’t have small children!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. Perfect for what we needed. Had a little problem with finding the place but once we did there were zero issues
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great space with comfy, inviting vibes! The parking situation is really the only downside. The attention to details and cleanliness was spot on. The outdoor space and availability of games was awesome :)"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place was basically as pictured. Had everything we needed and nice little extra touches. We appreciated how all the toiletries were provided and there were extras of everything. There was a great TV in the bedroom and it was a very spacious place. We loved how comfy the beds were! The hot water in the bathroom sink didn’t turn on, it wasn’t a big deal but would have been nice to have advertised. The floors could have used a good mopping, we noticed it wasn’t the cleanest on the ground while walking around. It could have been because of the construction, but I couldn’t find the parking area that was advertised for us to park in. I parked just around the corner and that seemed to be fine. Overall it was a good stay and we enjoyed our time in Flagstaff! Lots of great hikes!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Pleasant house to stay in close to the city center of Flagstaff.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as listed. Great communication. Great location and peaceful. Comfortable beds.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was great and as expected. As my first Airbnb experience, I couldn't ask for a better one. Bed was comfortable, we were supplied with all cooking utensils, toiletries, etc. We felt very comfortable and at home."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great value and quick to allow our booking. Shower is a bit small but works, only thing that was a bit of a pain was light shining in bedroom in the early morning, maybe some better blinds. Other then that it was great!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Solid accommodations. Was as advertised.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly how it looks in photos, with plenty of extra towels, toiletries, kitchen supplies, and games to make for a comfortable stay."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great space!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cozy, great location, and all the comforts of home you could ask for! This place was a perfect landing spot for me on the road. I'd definitely come back again! One small thing: There's a bit of construction going on next door that started around 7am the Monday I was there, and this will of course be temporary (and this is no complaint to Trevor and this Airbnb of course, who were perfect by all accounts -- and they even thoughtfully left ear plugs for guests, should you need them). I only mention it for travelers who are especially noise sensitive -- or who, like me, sometimes get a little startled by new voices/sounds when traveling solo. All in all, I had a really great stay, and would recommend this spot to anyone!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Interior of the house was exactly as pictured. Clean, good location, plenty of games, enjoyed the darts. Beds were comfortable, kitchen well stocked. Shower was small, but manageable. Was a bit thrown off upon arriving because there is a port a potty literally inches from the house."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Thank you
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay. Parking was a little confusing (on the street in front of a construction site).

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is very quaint other than the parking due to construction I am thinking not sure if that will get better. The shower is a little small if there’s a large person or a tall person it may be difficult for them to take a shower. Better curtains in the bedroom.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is spotless. However, a little bit expensive. The host was exellent and very hellful. Enjoyed the stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space, plenty of room and everything you could need! Perfect backyard, and just an overall amazing experience!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was exactly as described. We had our three kids with us for spring break and Miguel’s place was centrally located for a lot of different hikes and locations including Sedona and The Grand Canyon. Great pace to stay.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miguel was very responsive and his home is spotless, it looks brand new. The 75 inch TV in Living room was great and TV's in all 3 bedrooms as well. Beds were very comfortable memory foam. Property is very well maintained. I would Highly recommend staying at Miguel's place it is centrally located in Flagstaff just out of town, 30 minutes from Sedona and about 1 1/2 hour drive to Grand Canyon south rim. You will not be disapointed."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. I definitely recommend.

Very convenient location with plenty to do nearby.
Perfect getaway for a ski trip on your weekend away from home!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at this house!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This host is responsive and that already had me sold. They provided me with a list of nearby activities and restaurants when I notified them I arrived early. The house was peaceful and very clean I recommend this place 100% and if I come back I’ll definitely choose this property
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable beds. We even came home and bought one which they were able to link us to. I liked the ambiance and atmosphere of the home. All the doors locked securely and we felt safe as well as our belongings. Overall I would recommend this place for anyone that wants to visit Arizona. 30 minutes from skiing. 1 hr from Grand Canyon and about 4 hours to phoenix if I remember correctly. There is also a lot of great things to see out east in the Navajo nation that we didn’t have time for.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home. They did an amazing job with the remodel and had all the amenities you could need.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Property was nice and clean. Location was not ideal. Communication was great but had to wait in order to check in because cleaners were still working.
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Miguel‘s place was exactly what he had posted. We enjoyed our stay there. House was super clean and updated. he was always very responsive to all my questions and very helpful.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best airbnb very comfortable and host is great thanks !
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,His place was perfect. Very nice inside and great backyard for sitting around and hanging out. Will definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great stay at Miguel’s flagstaff home. It was very clean and had all the basic kitchen necessities. Very modern but not baby friendly at all which is fine but something to keep in mind if you are planning on staying here with kids.
Another thing was the heater would shut off every night in the middle of the night. It would get very cold and my baby would wake up in the middle of the night crying. The temperature would drop 10-15 degrees colder than the temperature we had set it to before bed. We would have to get up and reset the thermostat so the heater would kick on. Other than that it was a great clean home and was close to a lot of great restaurants and grocery stores."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice modern home in a peaceful neighborhood. Great private backyard with fireplace. Great host, definitely recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miguel’s place was tastefully redone and very clean. That’s why we chose to stay there. The location was a minute or so from the hustle and bustle of Flagstaff life. We enjoyed sleeping in, eating out, hiking Walnut Canyon National Monument, and exploring Snowbowl and riding the gondola."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such an awesome place to stay .. can’t wait to stay again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was perfect for us and our 1 year old. The location great and close to everything. We felt right at home and our little one had a really good time. It was quiet and just what we needed for a 3 night stay. We would definitely stay at Miguel’s place again. The home is just like the pictures showed and the backyard was nice to hang out or have a little one that wants to explore the outdoors.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed Miguel's rental. It is beautiful, comfortable, and very clean. It is just as lovely as the pictures. It was nice to lock our bikes in the backyard, which was very secure. Miguel checked in with us to make sure everything was okay. We would love to stay here again and would definitely recommend it."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Miguel was very responsive and I was so glad he let us book last minute. We were traveling to Palm Spring and decided to stop half way in flagstaff and I’m so glad we did. The house is SO CLEAN. It has everything you need.
The back yard is wonderful. We grilled out and turned on the fire pit and enjoyed the night. Very close to everything about 7-9 minutes! (Shopping, grocery stores etc)
Definitely will stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Miguel's place was incredibly clean! You can tell the space is newly renovated, with the new smells and squeaky clean spaces. It was all so very relaxing and enjoyable being in such an organized and well thought out home. Everything from the appliances, silverware, and big screen TV with fast internet was great!"

2022-09-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately I can't leave the 5 star review that I think this spot likely typically deserves.
We were initially very impressed and pleased with the space as it is cute, private, and just has that quality feel you'd expect with a nicer hotel room. However, later in our stay it became unequivocally obvious that the bed linens were not changed or washed prior to our arrival. The sheets presented as generally clean, however, after closer inspection it was obvious that there were loose body hairs and other debris on the surface of the fabric. We thought perhaps the hairs and debris we embedded from the wash machine but that was clearly not the case. The host apologized and helped resolve the issue, but unfortunately the issue is too egregious to leave a positive review. Obviously we don't know if this issue was simply a gross oversight of the cleaner or a result of intentional negligence, but nonetheless dirty linens is not acceptable at any establishment and greatly diminished the enjoyment of our evening.
Providing the host takes corrective steps to ensure this particular oversight does not happen again it would certainly be a great addition to anyone's itinerary."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay and would always come back! Nice area, big & clean apartment - thanks!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Accurate, simple, affordable. Would stay here again, no doubt!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Well, I loved it so much, that I booked it on my return trip. When getting a private room, you kind of never know exactly what you are going to get. In this case, this is like getting an upscale hotel room, which happens to be housed in a private residence! But with the separate entrance and the way the space is set up, it is quite private! I appreciated the fridge/microwave/coffee setup and especially the bottled water!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and in a great location. We will definitely stay here again.

Peaceful location and fantastic view from bedrooms.
Thank you for providing everything we need during our stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Vista A-frame was beautifully designed and so cozy. It was perfect for our family weekend getaway.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a fantastic home with such an incredible host. This A-frame cabin in the woods just south of Flag is everything that is promised and so much more. The views, the coziness, the feeling of remoteness with accessibility, the accommodations, the consideration, the price, the cleanness - all FIVE STARS!! Andrew's awesome about responding to questions within an hour, and he's thought of everything for the house. All supplies were well-stocked, and my husband and I wanted for nothing. Just when we thought we had Andrew stumped, we found the coffee grinder after accidentally buying beans instead of ground coffee. (And that's only if you want your own - there are two coffee makers with more than enough coffee for both.) The house is SO clean with a ton of furnishings, blankets and pillows. Streaming TVs available and easy to use. You can trust that everything in the description and photos is true - in fact, it's a little understated. This cabin experience was nothing short of magical."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved it! The kitchen is a dream with staples like oil, honey, hot chocolate (a must-have!), half and half, sugar, and two types of coffee machines. Every appliance you could need for breakfast or dinner is here, plus the cutest retro Galanz fridge and microwave, and top-of-the-line appliances. The decor is cozy yet modern industrial, featuring an old-time typewriter and metal shelving packed with games. Clever little blocks display WiFi codes and curated Spotify playlists for the Marshall Bluetooth speaker. Privacy is well thought out with an upstairs curtain and a downstairs accordion door. The bathroom had plenty of hot water, fluffy towels, and nice soap dispensers. Little tree faces and mushroom path lights add a whimsical touch to the clean and well-maintained home. Perfectly situated close to town for convenience, yet far enough for peace and privacy. Can't wait to stay here again!
Communication with the host was fantastic. They were responsive and exceptional!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect for my husband and I
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a real gem! Beautiful, thoughtful and exquisitely decorated!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I have been traveling across the country from VA for almost a week and this cabin was a perfect break from the hotels.
The structure was beautiful and had everything we needed to feel right at home. Andrew was very helpful and responsive; the website he has includes a lot of recommendations & also clear instructions for the house.
We were at a perfect location to visit Bearizona & the Southern Rim of the Grand Canyon. Flagstaff was also very close.
Anyone who is thinking about booking, do it! You’ll fall in love!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can’t ask for a better stay! Very cozy and nicely decorated. Highly recommended (plus Andrew is awesome).
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew’s cabin is gorgeous - every detail of decor is well-thought-out, and includes delightful touches in every corner. This place is beyond curated - from the color of the exterior, to the throw blankets on the couches, to the soap dispensers in the kitchen and bathroom. We LOVED the Vista A-frame. It was a perfect home base for our Northern Arizona adventures."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very nice place to stay.
Very secret and nicely decorated.
We felt very comfortable.
Many utensils are at your disposal in the accommodation, which are not self-evident."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A magical stay at this gorgeous, thoughtfully-designed cabin! The host thought of so many amazing touches like sensor activated lights, free toiletries if you forgot yours, fun pantry items like popcorn, etc. By far best Airbnb I’ve stayed in! Comfy beds, spotless and modern bathroom with great water pressure, quiet location and amazing ambiance. We can’t wait to come back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely incredible stay! We feel very fortunate to have experienced such a wonderful stay with every aspect thought out. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Vista A Frame exceeded our expectations! Seriously - the vibes were immaculate. Andrew thought of quite literally anything you would need during your stay - even a Pur water filter to fill up our water bottles every day! Getting there and checking in was a breeze thanks to the extremely clear instructions provided by Andrew - who is amazingly friendly and pleasant by the way! Loved how close we were to downtown Flagstaff as well as a short scenic ride to Sedona. The only complaint we had is that we wished we booked a longer stay! Cannot wait to return to this cozy cabin in the pines.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The best AirBnB we have stayed in!! Immaculate. Cozy. Well appointed and designed. So many little touches like extra toiletries, a Spotify playlist, and top of the line coffee machine! I wish we could have stayed longer."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was absolutely wonderful. There were lots of nice touches and perks throughout the home. Ease of access was a breeze and communication was quick and informative. The helpful online home guide offered assistance and recommendations above and beyond what is expected at most Airbnb’s.
The beds are very comfortable and every detail in the decor made for a comfortable and inviting stay.
I highly recommend these amazing accommodations for your next getaway!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing time staying here. The cabin was just as described and was fully stocked with all necessities.
The neighborhood was peaceful and the house was squeaky clean."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We've stayed at many AirBnB's, but this one was done exceptionally well. The details and amenities were awesome. It left us really impressed. We would highly recommend a stay here!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for an unforgettable mountain town stay, my family and I highly recommend this cabin. So close to downtown Flagstaff with still feeling remote, cozy, and private. Bonus for being so close to Sedona, too! The home was better than anticipated. Everything is carefully curated, it’s beautifully updated and outfitted with bespoke accents. We had such a lovely time and this home made our long weekend in AZ complete."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a stunning property, the photos don’t do it justice, this is the most perfect A frame paradise! So tastefully designed with so many special touches, we loved the playlist, the views, the aesthetic overall ! Our 10 year old enjoyed the complementary face mask! Very generous host with coffee teas lovely linens, lots of cosy blankets everywhere, wonderful game cupboard, One of the best properties we have ever stayed in- wished we could have stayed longer! Absolute 5 star property, highly highly recommended,"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the VistA is all she is cracked up to be... even better than the pictures! 🙌 easy access off the highway yet you're tucked into the towering pines, close to charming flagstaff and spectacular sedona. the space is perfectly appointed with everything you can think of, and the cabin vibe is on point!! we were there during a spring snowstorm and it was just magical! andrew has created an extraordinary getaway that offers incredible amenities and comfort. his responsiveness and detailed house manual eliminate any questions or stress. book with complete confidence!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was really nice. Everything from the set up, the fine attention to detail, location and Andrew was a great host. I will definitely be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and clean cabin! Every last detail was considered in making you feel home away from home!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"To say we enjoyed ourselves would be an understatement. One of the nicest, comfortable stays. Waking up to the view is priceless. The weather was a beautiful mixture of it all. From the mid 60’s one day to a bit of snow another day. Took one of our days to just stay in the house and enjoy the fireplace. Had a fun game night and ordered in some Chinese. Andrew has thought about everything with this place. Hardest part of the trip was taking the key chain off and returning it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are so thankful that we found this gorgeous home, and our only regret is that we didn’t stay longer. The home presented even better than the photos. There was an immediate sense of calm and peacefulness upon entry. The A-Frame window provided us with an ever changing piece of art that hooked us in at many moments throughout the day. It’s evident that the hosts are well traveled, as they have equipped the home with countless thoughtful gestures and amenities that we didn’t even know we needed or wanted. Simple things (but appreciated!) like coffee and shower products. Creative ideas such as sensored lighting on the stairs and bathroom, a custom play list, and a scannable shopping list for all of the furnishings we will (have already) be ordering in an effort to replicate the tasteful style. We are committed to an annual trip A(if you’ll have us!), and in 10 years, will likely think of this as “our place” too. Congrats to you, Andrew on creating an amazing space to share."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking at this listing, book now! I’ve stayed at more AirBnBs than I can count and this is at the top of my favorites list. It’s better than the photos, you literally have everything you need stocked for you, and Andrew was so easy to communicate with. Read the guest book when you arrive and don’t miss ANY sunrises!!! You’re welcome :)"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is so cute ! It was everything we needed and more to feel comfortable and secluded. The online website with all the information was such a helpful reference. We had a wonderful relaxing adult only vacation. Thank you Andrew for your hospitality !
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the most beautiful place!! We felt right at home! It is obvious they worked hard to make sure it had everything you could possibly need. If you’re staying in the area you should definitely stay here!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous cabin! Very tastefully decorated and comfortable. So much attention to detail. We felt right at home and would absolutely stay here again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay here. The home is so cozy and beautifully furnished. Everything was extremely clean and comfortable. I can't believe no one has mentioned the Spotify playlist the host created for visitors. Such a cool touch.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive and helpful. The place was super nice and clean. Good amenities as well. Will definitely check them out again once I plan the next skii trip!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb experience of our dreams. Vista A Frame has impeccable design, unexpected amenities, and luxe style. It feels more like a resort villa than a vacation rental. You can tell a lot of thought and intention went into making every aspect of the guest experience memorable. It was so cozy and picturesque that we never wanted to leave. Andrew was a fantastic host and made our stay unforgettable. We can’t wait to come back soon."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! From the moment we walked in we felt at home. So much love and thought was put into every single detail/item in the home and it shows! I’ve seen and stayed at many airbnbs due to my profession and this one really checks all the boxes!!! The home was stocked with everything we needed to enjoy our weekend getaway including extra tooth brushes, toothpaste, cooking oils, nespresso pods, teabags, and so much more. We were blown away by the thought and care put in by these amazing hosts. Andrew was so friendly and quick to respond before, during, and after the stay. The balcony views are so beautiful and peaceful and the amenities were top notch! If you’re looking to get away and relax in Flagstaff, this is the home for you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The best Airbnb my partner and I have ever stayed at. So incredibly clean, cozy, and peaceful.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This A frame cabin was absolutely perfect! The interior looked exactly like the pictures. It was cozy and had everything we needed. The cabin was exactly as described and felt magical. We stayed here for 2 nights so that we could see the Grand Canyon one day and Sedona the next. It was the perfect location to do it all. This cabin is a perfect couples retreat and so picturesque. It snowed during our stay so the views out the floor to ceiling windows were gorgeous. The cabin was easy to get to and the instructions for check-in and checkout were clear and easy. Andrew is an extremely communicative and proactive host, ensuring that his guests have everything they need. He answered all my questions within minutes and sent timely reminders about check-in and checkout. This Airbnb is at the top of my list for Flagstaff and will definitely book it for future trips up this way. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in seeing Flagstaff, Sedona or the Grand Canyon. It’s well worth it!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When I say that this cabin was ABOVE and BEYOND our expectations, I’m not exaggerating. Not only is the Vista A Frame GORGEOUS inside and out, it had everything you could possibly need! The detailed thoughtfulness of Andrew as a host was impeccable, he truly anticipated our every need, and the cabin was stocked with everything and more. It’s a stunning cabin, beautiful decorated and created a homey and relaxing atmosphere to relax in! We were in love with this place, in awe of its aesthetic, architecture, cleanliness and overall vibe, we never wanted to leave. Definitely recommend anyone to stay and enjoy this lovely cabin, down to the cozy beds, natural light, AMAZING shower head, and every little detail that made this the perfect birthday weekend getaway!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is so beautiful! It’s exactly how we imagined it would be-perfect location, the windows get such beautiful light from the sun rising and setting, and it’s just so cozy. We ordered pizza, turned on the fire, and played board games all night. Definitely recommend for a group wanting to spend some time in flagstaff!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. Super excited to stay at this cozy A frame while it snowed. We were under-equipped for the icy hill up to the Airbnb, but with time and persistency, our front wheel drive made it. We were told by the owner before hand and even street signs that 4WD/AWD and chains are recommended, but we unfortunately did not have a vehicle with 4WD/AWD or could accommodate chains. The view from the hill was amazing and worth every penny! There is a wonderful Spotify playlist available to guests to listen to via QR code blocks and it fits perfectly with the vibe of the place. The owner did a phenomenal job accommodating guests that encourage a nice and relaxing stay. If you want a place with a view and makes you feel right at home, look no further."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew was a wonderful pro-active host who ensured that we had all the information prior to our trip. He even checked in on us when it was snowing to make sure we had everything we need and additional information as needed.
The house was extremely clean, user friendly, and had a modern touch with the appliances. You can tell a lot of thought and care was put into the home to make the guests feel comfortable and cozy.
My family and I really enjoyed our stayed and were able to witness snowfall through the A frame windows, which was truly magical!
I highly recommend this air bnb and will be looking to book it again in the future!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent New years in this beautiful cabin and had such a nice time it is about 10 min from town. this cabin was magical! the sun rises were gorgeous best cabin we've stayed at! the host was super responsive, and the entry was super easy. The house had so many little details and anemitys. they have games which we used. We cooked and stayed there all weekend and didn't go out much. we wanted a relaxing weekend, and the house has everything available to cook with, including a grill! The second floor was amazing. There was a chair there, which I used so much. I enjoyed my morning coffee and read! we loved our stay and will definitely be back!!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazing stay at the Vista A Frame! The host curated such a clean, well put together, and overall beautiful space. You can really tell a lot of thought went in to making sure guests have a nice and relaxing stay. The digital manual and instructions were really helpful and easy to follow.
It is located in a quiet area but still central to other tourist spots such as Downtown Flagstaff, Sedona, and the Grand Canyon. We also had nearby access to a small grocery store and gas station three minutes away! The interior of the cabin had multiple conversation spaces and nooks for some quiet time that would be perfect for a couple or family get away. There were so many personal details the host added that really elevated the whole experience of our stay! Whenever we had any questions the host was quick to respond and super friendly, we fell in love and will definitely be coming back for another stay! 10/10 highly recommended :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodation was so nice.

Even more, the price was cheaper, so it was better."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Trevor was excellent!! Always responded in a timely manner! Home was beautiful inside, very cozy beds and plenty of pillows!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"During our recent stay at Trevor's place, we were thoroughly impressed. We were a group of three, and our primary objective was to work remotely while enjoying a comfortable and tranquil environment during a tour of NAU.
Trevor's property exceeded our expectations in a few ways. First is, its location. Nestled against a quarry, the property had no rear neighbors, ensuring complete privacy and a peaceful atmosphere. The neighboring properties on either side were quiet, contributing to a sense of serenity.
What set this place apart was its location in a safe neighborhood, free from any disruptive car or train noises. This allowed us to focus on our work during the day and enjoy restful nights. The inclusion of a mudroom and a decent backyard were practical and appreciated additions, offering convenience and outdoor relaxation.
The beds were comfortable, and the property was equipped with nearly everything we needed for our stay. Thanks, Trevor!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a work trip for my employees and I. We had everything we needed and more. The house was comfortable to come back to after long days of work!

Trevor was a great host and provided clear instructions for check-in, and check-out, and was very responsive. The place was clean and provided all the small hospitality items located throughout the house.
The home was stocked with kitchen items for those who are interested in preparing meals, a wonderful backyard area suitable for a family, and plenty of board games. I love the attention to detail to make you feel at home.
I would definitely rent again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trevor’s place was exceptional. Clean, modern, had all the amenities we could ask for. Very well stocked and so thoughtful in putting in “girl items” loved that! I had a problem with cellular service in the area as I was approaching the city and when I finally got service Trevor was super helpful in allowing us to book earlier than what was listed. Thank you for that -saved our night! Great place to stay highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Siri got a little confused on the location due to it being a one way street but we quickly figured it out! Trevor was always quick to respond. Everything was as described and we enjoyed this being our base camp for all of our Arizona adventures! As a fellow superhost I was very impressed that every bedroom had a large television! I left a couple of books for future travelers.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is definitely a luxury style living! Me and my children loved it. It was well worth the price. It seems I thought of everything you might forget and had it available! We thought we would wanna be out on the town, but the place was so nice that we enjoyed our short little stay there"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Trevor’s place was great! We had a group of 8 people and it fit us all so comfortable! I 100% recommend this place!

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Myself and my family stayed in Trevors home while visiting the Grand Canyon from Ireland and we couldn't have felt more at home. The house was spotless, in a beautiful location and had everything you would need for a multiple day stay.
Would definitely stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our spring break camping plans fell through due to the floods so we booked this place last minute to play in the snow. Everything was great! There was a little quarry/hill behind the house that the kids liked to climb. It was tucked away in a quiet neighborhood but only a short drive (or walk) to a shopping center with grocery store. It was nice to have a garage to keep the car in so I didn't have to dig it out of snow. We definitely saved this place for our next trek up north from Phoenix. The host was very responsive and helpful but only needed to reach out a couple of times since everything was set up and laid out very nicely.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a perfect stay! We enjoyed it and it was more than big enough for us 5 :)
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place with many great accommodations. Great place for kids to stay too. Walkable distance from a very nice park. Far enough away from Flagstaff down town to keep it quiet, but close enough to quickly drive to the city center."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in Flagstaff was relaxing and comfortable. Trevor’s place had everything we needed and more. Clean and cozy. Thank you for the pile of snow in the backyard and the beautiful Mountain View.
We even visited the neighborhood playground. The only drawback was that the internet was not fast enough for my husband to work from the house."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Trevor's home was absolutely adorable. Very clean, cozy, TVs in all the rooms, huge dining area, cozy couch and beds, immaculate bathrooms, and lacked for nothing! We just had to go pick up a few items for snacks/meals, but he has everything else there for you (sugar, coffee, FILTERS (thank you!), little creamers, oil and spices...just perfect. We only used 2 of the 4 bedrooms, but all rooms were clean and have a TV in them. Absolutely loved this place. Oh, and Trevor was always communicative and timely. Highly recommend! Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and location was perfect. Close to downtown Flagstaff and had everything we needed for a great stay. Highly recommend!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There’s a right way and a wrong way to host an AIRBNB! This home is the epitome of the right way. Trevor took all manner of travelers into consideration when he decided to host his home. From The amenities to the decor, this is truly a perfect mountain getaway for anyone looking to escape their day to day. It accommodated our 5 children, comfortably while providing a gorgeous scenic mountain view in the front and back yards. I can’t say enough positive about the host and home. We will be returning for sure!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,the area was beautiful a mountain behind us the snow was beautiful

2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very beautiful home!! Very home like ♥️ we loved it !
,,,"It’s very charming and whimsical, however it’s definitely not worth the price.
If you think a box of pancakes with a bottle of syrup( no butter ) that you have to make is “breakfast provided” then you will be pleased. If you don’t mind cold air blowing on your head all night from a gap( or something) in the window then you’ll be pleased. We were not pleased."
