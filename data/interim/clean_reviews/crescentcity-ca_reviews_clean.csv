2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect for our vacation. The beach was walkable and soo pretty. The house was spacious so we could all spread out.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views and beach is a very short walk away! Home was very clean and spacious!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Coastal Cove house was just great. It was exactly as pictured, and was a clean, relaxing and welcoming space. The view of the ocean from the sunroom was amazing. The house was perfectly situated for our travel itinerary -- close to both the coast and the redwoods. Zoe was very responsive to questions, and provided lots of information about the area. Check in and check out were both very simple. We were delighted with this place and would definitely stay here again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house with an amazing view I loved it
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and comfortable, situated in a great location, but the view was priceless. We would love to come back."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location, conveniently located to grocery and the Redwoods. Would definitely stay there again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful space with a spectacular view!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty decent stay but the stellar view is currently partially obstructed by a large pile of dirt which was disappointing.
Other than that everything is as listed and it’s an easy walk to the beach."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"PROS: Plenty of towels and washcloths for 6 people. Towels & sheets were soft & beds were comfortable. The bathroom & floors were very clean. Plenty of room for 6. Crockpot in kitchen was nice to start meals before long days in Redwoods. Enough dishes for 6. Good view and easy beach access. Beach was great for agate hunting. Had Disney & other tv options.
CONS: There were a few crumbs on the counters & tables and in cabinets. Overall, the house felt very clean besides this. The tools/pans in the kitchen could use upgrades. The knives were dull. The view wasn't quite as expected because there was a large, 5' high and 15' wide, pile of mulch about 10' in front of the house. Was still a nice view but couldn't get a photo without the mulch. The de-humidifier had to run all night or there was excess moisture & pooling on the windows. Trundle is in front room with dehumidifier. Telescope doesn't work.
Despite these minor items we loved the stay & would love to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this as a last minute stop on our west coast road trip and we are so glad that we did. The place was perfect, so spacious and so welcoming. If you get the chance you must make a booking 😀"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall stay is awesome.!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great view and great rock hunting Beach. Beds are comfortable, and property manager got us some wine glasses when we discovered there were none."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful stay. We couldn't have asked for a better veiw, and it was close to everything you could need. The street is a little tricky to find, but once you know what you're looking for it was fine!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with beautiful views! Easy walk across the street where we collected sea glass while walking along the beach. So many things to do from the Redwoods to the beach. Perfect place! Zoe was very helpful and fast to respond to any questions we had.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view of the beach every day, sleeping in the sun room with the moon and stars. Steps to the beach and very spacious inside. Very nice spot and love to go back. Make sure to bring some cooking items if you plan to cook, no basics such as oil or pepper, but plenty of cookware and dishes/utensils."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Zoe was a very helpful and friendly host and the place was perfect for our stay as we drove from there to hikes in the Redwoods, walked to play on the beach, and ate at the local brewery. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend this place for anyone coming to this area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice weekend at the beach and hiking in the Redwoods. We loved the view and there were plenty of warm towels for our party of 6. Zoe had great recommendations of places to eat. We enjoyed the food from SeaQuake Brewing.
We had to bring the trundle mattress into the living room for our 9 and 6 yr olds as we arrived in the middle of the night and it was too cold even with the space heater for them to sleep in the front room. They loved playing Jenga on the coffee table.
The master bedroom bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time. The house is beautiful and roomy. Lots of light
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time I’ve stayed here and it’s a perfect fit. Thanks so much.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying here, and we love it. Great view through the windows and the place is clean, modern, and comfortable."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and amazing views!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view from windows! Clean place. Lots of room to move . Gorgeous kitchen.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Prefect location for a beautiful view. No issues whatsoever. I would definitely book again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Coastal cove was a great home base for our Redwoods exploration. Gorgeous views of the ocean, plenty of room to spread out, relax after a busy day and plan our next days adventures. Small details were all there like board games for the kids and syrup in the pantry. Crescent City was a great city to stay in, and Zoe left great recommendations for food, activities, and trails. Wonderful all around."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Coastal Cove was exactly what we wanted! A clean, spacious, and close to beach rental.
The kitchen is awesome and shower hot with great water pressure.
Just an amazing experience from start to finish."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly as described. We stayed for a week and took time to explore the nearby state and national parks and the coast. The sunroom was the best spot in the house. The views were gorgeous and a perfect spot to watch the sunset. A space heater was provided for chilly October mornings/evenings and a spacious daybed to enjoy the view.
The house was stocked with much more than a typical airbnb- coffee and filters were provided, more than enough towels, a closet with extra blankets, a basket of snacks, laundry detergent, dryer sheets, shampoo, and conditioner. We ended up not needing to purchase nearly as much as we normally would.
The neighborhood is super quiet and it’s only steps to the beach where you can explore the tide pools at low tide, watch the surfers, collect rocks, etc.
The house was very clean, well stocked, and really spacious. If you are looking for a home base to do some hiking and exploring along the coast, this is a beautiful and relaxing spot!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Zoe's place was great. Amazing views of the ocean and beach just as advertised. The house was very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved this place! Beautiful view and we loved the close beach access. The town was just a couple of minutes away. We were happy to find that we were 7 minutes away from Safeway and Walmart. Lots of random helpful things in the house like extension cords and HDMI cords. The washer and dryer were great as well.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was exactly what we were looking for. Great distance from the Redwoods and the Beach was an added bonus. Zoe provided great recommendations for hiking and food and was quick to respond. Thanks Zoe! We hope to be back soon.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views and great host!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great home with spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean and close to all the attractions that draw you to the area. Quiet and clean with very easy checkin instructions.
Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home and wonderful location! Had everything we needed and was exactly as described.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful views of sunrise and sunset! You can watch it from the sunroom or primary bedroom as well. Great central location for going to Harris Beach, Samuel H. Boardman & Redwoods!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The view was breathtaking.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"fantastic views, easy walk to beach with two kids, comfortable and functional space. will definitely book again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a nice and peaceful stay. We loved having a clear and perfect view of the sunset from the sunroom every afternoon. If you’re looking for a place close to the beach, this is the perfect spot."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent location. Beautiful view. Great home beach walk and sunsets.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"1. Clean place with a great view and the beach is right across the street (convenient for rockhounding);
2. Good location - close to Smith River kayaking + N. Redwood Forest Parks; and
3. Slim pickings for eating out, but Kin Khao Thai Eatery was one of the exceptions."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy access to the beach and great view of the ocean from the house!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a fun beachy themed rental. everything is as listed. We had a great time being just a short walk from the beach. There is a wire fence that is quite tall that crosses the front yard so people don't cut through the neighbors yard. I hope this is new and can be replaced with something like a white Pickett fence so that it doesn't cross through your line of vision of the beach from the front sunroom area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great view! stocked kitchen. Large common spaces. Had trouble finding it, but otherwise everything we needed. Thanks for the binder with info!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious home, perfect for families. Fantastic view from the house. Very peaceful. Zoe was a great host, very responsive and informative. We loved this stop in our road trip."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was beautiful. Nice view from the seating area. The unit was well stocked and overall comfortable. It was very warm our first night and we could have used some fans because a lot of the windows don’t open. Overall would recommend when you are in the area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic views perfect location. The best
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family had an amazing stay! Walking on the beach in the morning when the tide was low was a favorite for everyone as there were many places to explore for critters. Watching the sunset from the beach was amazing as well!
We were all very comfortable and slept well especially after heading to the redwoods which was only a 10-15 minute drive. There were many great trails and a river to play in. Would definitely recommend this location if you’re looking for a view and a decent price."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate, spectacular, hidden gem are all words I'd use to describe this slice of heaven. Beautifully situated near so many attractions. We enjoyed both the beach, and the redwoods during our stay. 10/10"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we had a great stay. The beach is wonderful and it made a great base for visiting both the beach and the redwoods. The view from the front windows is beautiful.
Getting to the house was a little confusing. The driveway that is closest to the house is for the adjacent property, so you have to drive down to the next street and approach the house from the back/alley side. Also, there’s a wire fence in front of the property that is not in the photos. The area directly in front of the house and to the side of the house are not part of the property, so in order to access the beach, you have to walk back to the road you came in on and then across the street to the beach. There’s a map inside the house, and it’s only about a 5 minute walk, but it would have been nice to have that info available before check in."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. The view was gorgeous and it was exactly as described. We would stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this is not the first time I've stayed at Zoe's Beach home and I am hoping it is not the last. gorgeous views. tons of space and it just makes you feel like you're at home.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect spot for our visit to Crescent City. The house was comfortable and the kitchen was stocked. The view out the windows was amazing!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was so comfortable and so clean. The view was spectacular and we loved watching the sunsets! There were great suggestions for eating out…… we especially enjoyed the brewery. It was just perfect for our getaway to the Redwoods!!

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Quiet neighborhood and impressive views. Having kids, I appreciated the beach toys in the garage and the board games in the living quarters."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Beautiful view from the sunroom and a quiet neighborhood, will be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,What a great property! The ocean is *right there* and Zoe is so easy to work with. She is responsive and kind. We’re very glad we stayed at Coastal Cove!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place. Very clean. The view is unmatchable, especially with a subset. Short walk over to the beach. The front room was a great place to wind down after exploring the Redwoods."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved every moment of it!! Beautiful!! the welcome binder was so detailed and appreciated.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space for a weekend getaway.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this cozy bungalow for a 3 night stay with our family of 5 in Crescent City. The clean and comfortable rooms and amenities such as the two smart TVs and kitchen appliances made up for the age of the home being a bit older.
We loved the sunroom! Upon waking in we were blown away by the amazing view and proximity to the beach. Such a great location close to everything but still feels private enough to feel “at home.”
LOVED the spacious laundry room, clean washer and dryer and provided laundry detergent/dryer sheets for our use.
Checkout was a breeze. Took out all the garbage and left a load of dishes and a load of towels running. Locked the door and we were on our way!
This place is perfect for families (I even noticed the pop up crib in the primary bedroom.) Nice touches without being over the top!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Zoe was great! Prompt responses and clear communications! House was really nice in a beautiful location with easy access to the Pacific Ocean across the street. Tide pools at low tide were great to check out! Very nice kitchen, comfortable beds and furniture, easy parking on site, and a beautiful ocean view from a great enclosed porch!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"There isn’t beach access from the front yard like in the photos. There is a gate up so you have to walk over to the street. It isn’t a huge deal, but it was longer than expected. There aren’t a lot of food options in the area. This isn’t a great city to stay in unless you want to feed yourself."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to relax in between days of hiking. Amazing view, walk to the beach, short drive to stores/restaurants. Great home for a couple, or small family. The sun room was our favorite spot. Definitely saving this place for future adventures."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was great at Zoe's place. The view was wonderful! When the sun hits the sunroom, the room warms up nicely. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking.
We experienced almost every season, from cold wind, rain, and hail to warm sunny skies. There was also an entire city power outage, which without heat the house got cold quick. We used that as an excuse to go hiking. The welcome binder had great suggestions for both in and out of town.
The house definitely has its quirks, like light switches to rooms being located outside the room or wall heaters without numeric thermostats. We also couldn't locate a tub stopper for our daughter to take a bath. No issues though that we couldn't figure out."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love the view and easy access to Pebble Beach
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing view. Zoe very quick to respond. Fun house, great kitchen!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed a long weekend here. The house was very clean and comfortable. The view cannot be beat.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice house, very clean…. Very homey with a beautiful view. Great neighborhood- quiet and peaceful! Great host! Felt right at home."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A friend of mine and I reserved Zoe's house so we could attend my daughters baby shower. When we arrived in Crescent City it happened to be a beautiful sunny day. no wind, no clouds. When we walked in the house and saw the views of the ocean, our jaws dropped! the pictures on Airbnb are good but they did not do this view that we were witnessing justice!!! They were spectacular!!! The house was very clean and spacious and open to the kitchen. We had everything we needed for our weekend stay. Zoe was great to work with and very responsive. I can't wait to bring my husband here in the summer!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful views and great location! Spacious and comfortable place. We enjoyed our stay!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very disappointed the fireplace did not work. Could not share photos over Smart TV cause it was in bedroom, the TV in living room just has Netflix. Also telescope decorative only! Does not work, someone has messed around with it & lens cracked & view upside down. Carpet in living room dirty but did not smell. Throw pillows were stained but again, not smelly. Some of the outside windows had not been washed in a while so the dirt obstructed the view, but not the main front windows. I would have chosen a different place had I known the fireplace was non-functional. Zoe did give me a rebate but only $115. On the positive side, house is large, open & comfy with great kitchen & lots of towels, linens etc. Lots of family games was also very nice. Wifi worked well. Zoe was kind to permit an early check-in & was always positive, quick & kind in her responses. I would stay again at the same price but only if fireplace worked."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, and hope to come back to this place again !"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very well-equipped home with a beautiful view. It was great to be just a block away from Pebble Beach.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at this property! The view and location are perfect! The home was very clean and everything we could ask for! Definitely recommend!
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,beautiful place
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean with everything you need. Crescent City is a ton of fun. The beach across the street is accessible and beautiful.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is great!!! The view and access to the beach are perfect. We will definitely book this one again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious house, only a few mins from downtown Crescent City. Right on the beach with a great view of the water. Great kitchen and comfortable living room."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Zoe‘s place. It’s very spacious and my favorite place was in the front room on the coziest day bed! The view and sounds of crashing waves can’t be beat. Kitchen was incredibly well stocked with any cooking item or small appliance you might need. The furniture could use some updating and rugs would make the place a little more cozy, but that’s probably just my personal preference. I had some questions about the heater and Zoe returned my messages immediately and communication was clear and helpful. I would highly recommend staying in this wonderful home!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was remodeled and very clean. The only issue was the construction equipment parked in front of house by the road. But it really didn’t obstruct the view much because the house sits up on a hill. Deer came right up to the sun porch windows right before dusk as we were watching the sun set!
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding view and location. Zoe was very responsive and check in was seamless. It was an added bonus having access to laundry facilities. We found the amenities to be sparse for the rate we were paying.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Zoe’s place was perfect! So close to the redwoods, the beach, and close to a Walmart for everything you need!
Zoe was responsive and helpful! I would stay here again!"
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay could have been much better. The house needed a thorough cleaning including the floors. Equipment parked in front of windows obstructing the view of the beach and ocean.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Views views views!!!!! Amazing house, large and pristine. How everything you needed . Would stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great communication and the house was exactly as advertised. Great view of the ocean and a quick walk to a wonderful beach. House was clean and had plenty of entertainment for our family. Will be coming back in the future for sure!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Pebble Beach is a wonderful area to stay when visiting Crescent City. Zoe's home is comfortable and has easy access to the beach and other areas around town. It was a great get away from the heat and smoke of the valley this summer.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Comfortable and clean. Great location with just a short walk to the beach. Bathroom needs a little updating but everything else was excellent.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We found the location of this place to be the best anyone could want. Views and the beach across the street were almost perfect. The coastal cove bungalow was clean and well supplied. We appreciated the garage and driveway for parking in the back of the house.
We were disappointed when we arrived...parked in front of this beautiful view was a crane and cement mixer. The photo did not show these. Apparently they belonged to another person that owned the land in front of the cottage."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stunning ocean view & quick walk to beach
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view and location. Our kids loved walking the beach first thing in the morning. Found starfish in the tide pools and tons of crabs! The house had everything our family of 6 needed! Would definitely recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful stay here! Access to the ocean was so easy, and the views were stunning. Rooms were all very clean, and was so helpful to have both an outside hose to wash off sandy feet and a washing machine/dryer!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great house. Wish we had more than a day there. Very spacious and comfortable.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a nice place, so much room. The sunroom was a great place to hang out to watch the sunset and surfers. So close to the Redwood State and National Parks."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place right across from the beach. House was well-equipped and very clean. Thank you!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommended
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stunning view! And...that's coming from someone who lives on Bainbridge Island right on Puget Sound with views of downtown Seattle and Mt. Ranier. Well-appointed, comfortable, and quiet. Just what we needed on our last night before heading home. Highly recommended."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice view of ocean from closed in back porch. Easy walk to beach. Easy check in and check out.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was just perfect for our Redwood road trip. It was on the beach so the kids were able to play and the sunsets were amazing. Lots of room and quiet neighborhood. Thanks Zoe! we will certainly be back.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is the perfect place for beach lovers of any age. View from the sunroom is amazing in any weather. Just a short walk down the hill & across the street and your feet can be in the sand! Comfortable for the family to be together, but with room to spread out also. I almost don't want to share this beach treasure because I hope to return myself again soon & would be heartbroken if it' unavailable."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying in the house. The view was amazing. We also loved being able to walk across the street to the beach. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place for our large family to stay as we visited the Redwoods and the beach. The home is as spacious as the pictures look and very well equipped. Everything we needed was there, including a can opener, laundry basket, and sand toys which we put to good use. Our girls enjoyed sleeping in the sun room on the trundle beds. The beach is very windy and cool, so plan and dress accordingly. Thank you for a great stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful! 5 Star!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Like I said earlier. Two bedrooms: King size bed in one room, a double bed and single bed in the other room. When you enter the house, you are hit with an outstanding view of the ocean. This room has a day bed with a trundle. One bathroom. Briquet(sp?) barbeque. Really a clean and nice place to stay. We loved it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing view. Great place, very clean."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views of Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge and the ever-changing weather of Northern CA in this comfortable, clean and well-equipped home. Walk across the street to stroll along Pebble Beach or take a short drive to gaze up at the beautiful Redwood forest. Very responsive host and very relaxing environment in Crescent City."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely worth it
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely amazing house, the view of the ocean is great. You just cross the street and you are on a beach. The house has open floor plan and is comfortable"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and convenient to all the Redwood Coast has to offer.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location right across the street from an awesome beach! Loved the back patio that was converted into a common room! Even with it windy and cold one of the days you could still sit there and watch the waves.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for a small family or couple not needing more than one bathroom. Beach access and views from the home are outstanding. Very secure and quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed the use of the garage especially during rainy weather. Well stocked kitchen, excellent Internet, nice laundry facilities and super clean home. Will definitely stay here again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to unwind after a few days of road-tripping! The closed-in deck was perfect for sunset drinks and hearing the waves.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an excellent stay at this location! The view was amazing, it was clean, comfortable and a perfect spot to relax! The beach across the way was great for agate hunting and had a beautiful view of the sun set. I absolutely recommended this spot for a stay in Crescent City!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You don’t want to miss this one! Clean and beautiful. The views are amazing.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,wonderful place to stay
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The whole process of Checking in and Checking out was straight forward and easy to accomplish. The house was clean and inviting and the view was amazing! It is a small walk to the beach to be prepared to walk downhill and over rocks but so worth it to have such a large area to explore when the tides are low and you pretty much have the beach to yourself.
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Pros: beautiful location, easy check-in, house was clean and as described, we enjoyed our time seeing the redwoods!
Cons: communication with host and emergency preparedness. The power went out in the town while we were there. We had two small children with us and were unsure how long power would remain out. The house had one flashlight available and the batteries were dead. After the host said they would update us on when to expect power on, they stopped responding. We eventually were able to get ahold of them by calling air bnb. They consented to us manually opening the garage door to try to go out ourselves to buy another flashlight or lantern, etc. Hours later, after we purchased our own working flashlight, they called and offered to bring replacement batteries. It was very stressful to try to prepare for a night without heat or power in a town we aren’t familiar with, and having more basic emergency supplies and more communication from our host would have helped improve our overall experience immensely."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We absolutely loved the location and the view! We loved the open concept of the space where we could all cook and be together as a family.
It slept 7 of us with ease, but do be aware there is only one bathroom. The laundry facilities worked great and we were grateful they were there.
The kitchen had all the necessary items to cook meals in. We didn't cook a ton but enough to know the kitchen had everything we needed. There aren't any spices other than salt and pepper so you may need to plan ahead for meals.
The internet was super fast and reliable. Something my family was thankful for in their spare time.
I would highly recommend staying here. You won't be disappointed!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Check in was very simple. The home is very clean, comfortable and accommodating. It’s a great house with privacy and perfect Pebble Beach sunsets."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host amazing communication, beautiful house!! Thank you for everything!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this place. The location to the beach was great and we loved that there was hardly anyone at that particular beach…maybe it was just the time of year. But our daughter (2 1/2) loved the house. The only thing we didn’t love was the super strong scent of laundry detergent. At least we knew the bedding was clean! But luckily we brought some of our own blankets and pillows and opted to mainly use those. Just a heads up for anyone who may be a little sensitive to that.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked this house on a whim to escape to the beach. This house did not disappoint and was easy to book with literally 2 hours notice!
It Has a fully stocked kitchen, lots of bath towels, a game and book closet, perfect setup for a family. You could bring camp chairs to sit in front of the house or watch the picture perfect sunsets from the beautiful sun room. Will be back soon!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wow! What an amazing space, view, and host. It's hard to beat waking up to the ocean in your front window. Zoe was so helpful and accommodating.

There is a beach right across the road perfect for morning walks. The location is very convenient for dining and grocery shopping. We even walked the 2 miles to the local brewpub for happy hour one afternoon. We would gladly return!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would recommend Zoe's Place to anyone who is considering a vacation in Crescent City/Del Norte County.

6 of us spent Thanksgiving here as a meeting space from several parts of the country. The house had all we needed for a full turkey dinner preparation (had to buy a disposable aluminum pan but that’s it).
Our 4 cars fit easily in plentiful parking (we didn’t park in garage due to short depth).
Recommendations:
-Bring binoculars to see the many sea lions surfing and harbor seals resting on Castle Rock island right out of your window
-Spend lots of time at Jed Smith
-Take the Redwood Rides kayak trip. We did the half day to Stout Grove on November 25 at 43 degrees. They included all the gear to keep us warm enough and the Class 1 rapids on that particular trip were exciting enough for us “small quiet lake” kayakers. Lots of wildlife"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Unbelievable views and not too bad of a drive to the parks. Crescent City as a destination isn’t ideal but again, proximity to the parks and view made it worth it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Oh my goodness!! Words cannot describe how perfect the location is this Airbnb is. We were all completely smitten the moment we arrived. It’s beautiful! So close to the beach!! The kids would have lived at the beach the entire time if we didn’t have other plans.
The home was perfect. Comfortable, spacious, CLEAN!! The bedrooms were a great size, and the kitchen and living area were both quite large. Our whole family of 11 fit at the table without any problem. The pictures truly don’t do justice. It’s perfection all around.
We would stay here again in a heartbeat if we find ourselves in the area for another vacation in the future. Crescent City is now one of my most favorite places in the world."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are wanting a seaside haven just to relax in, it is highly recommend. To stay at Zoe’s.
We used this home as a springboard for tons of adventures (redwoods, hiking, exploring the coast). My favorite thing was exploring the coast in the morning while drinking my coffee. It soothed the soul.
Zoe is kind, quickly responds, and helps with any concerns or questions."

This place is a great home base for Redwood National Park adventures plus all the fun things to do around Crescent City! Loved coming here with my family! It was such a special place to be together."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing location, steps from water. Thoughtful amenities. Everything you can need. Convenient parking, hosts were available for any questions. Would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cannot say enough!! Great location and views. Fantastic stay!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location makes this home hard to beat. Everything is provided, including comfortable furniture, great appliances, three bedrooms, three full bathrooms, a telescope to look out at objects on the horizon and in the night sky, and plenty of storage space. Parking is a bit tight, and the thought of using the garage disappeared due to the lack of a remote control, and the length of the garage is rather short (a Ford Edge was too long) due to the laundry appliances installed there. But small inconveniences that are dwarfed by the view. The home is very quiet, even though it is located on the beach road. We never heard a sound from outside with the windows closed. Very, very comfortable home, and very beautiful inside. Recommend printing the check-in instructions before arrival - we found we had no cell service outside the home, so we couldn't bring up the app to look at the instructions. Cell service is available just up the road, making it possible to look up the code. Whew!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough about our experience in Zoe’s home, she made it home for us, too!
All of our needs were met in every way, my sons and I had one of our best trips to date.
We went on two great hikes in the redwoods, enjoyed an INCREDIBLE meal at Schmidt’s House of Jambalaya, visited Endert’s Beach, and drove to both Pebble and Glass Beaches.
The wonderful showers felt so great after an adventure, too.
My fav detail: The sunrises and sunsets in this pretty home provide the most beautiful light. A very good energy.☀️
We will be back again and again.
Thank you! 🙏"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely fantastic place to stay with a family of adults. Amazing views. The beach directly across the street is so cool. Going down the rocks to the beach was a bit tricky for us older ones but the last day I found that if I walked just a bit further north just past the speed limit signs that there was a much easier sandy path down to the beach. I was very grateful that I brought slippers, as shoes are not to be worn in the house to protect the beautiful hardwood floors. The shower in the master bedroom is nice and big with two shower heads. The living area was so cozy with plenty of couch space and the dining room table is much bigger than the photos. Great for game playing with the group. The house was very clean and not cluttered with stuff. I could go on and on but just book it, you won’t regret it!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time. It was beautiful and had everything we needed to have a great stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our team travels often to Crescent City on business and have stayed in many homes, and can certainly say that this lovely house is absolutely gorgeous. Clearly, there is special attention given to cleanliness, as the house absolutely sparkles. The pictures do not do the home justice, and we were very pleasantly surprised. All of the beds are super comfortable and there are plenty of supplies available. Shampoo and conditioner and body wash were in all of the bathrooms. We definitely appreciated the attention to details, as well as the booklet that offered suggestions for local sightings and trips. We currently have three additional trips scheduled for this house, and are very pleased with our decision. Can’t recommend it enough. Definitely five stars plus."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved everything about this beach home. A million dollar view foe sure! It was so comfortable and had everything we needed. We only wished we could have stayed longer.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place! Ocean views are the real deal. Sunsets were picture perfect. Had an issue w/ the front door lock that Zoe fixed within 2 hours (from my call to technician resolving the issue on site!). That’s an Airbnb first for me. House is spacious, clean with a great location. Crescent City is quaint with good restaurants - recommend Chart House at the harbor. Proximity to redwood forests is great. Within 15 minutes.
Only thing tricky w/ this house is the parking. I rented a large SUV due to traveling with 6 people. I made it fit, but it was tight. Photos on the website of the parking would be helpful to people renting large vehicles.
For anyone flying in / out of Medford, the drive on 199 is very picturesque. Lots to see and plenty of hiking if you want to take your time. Enjoy!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing. Stayed here for a 3rd time and plan on coming back again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house and location! The house was beautiful, clean and so close to the beach with a great view. So close to the Redwoods, which we loved. We would all recommend the house for sure. Zoe was very responsive and quick when I had questions."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was amazing! across the street from tide pools with even better ones a mile away. be sure to go to crescent beach for sand dollars! (maybe 10 or 15 mnts to the south)
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a lovely house facing the Pacific, with rugged rocks along the gorgeous coastline. There was a large, comfortable sectional sofa facing the ocean-view windows, making a perfect setting for happy hours. There was a nice telescope facing the sea — fun to spot fishing boats at night!
The kitchen was well-appointed, with dishes, glasses and mugs to handle a family. It was nice to find a large tin of decent coffee, too. The fridge was spotless, the ice-maker worked. Everything looked new and clean.
All the amenities to make it comfortable were there, including dishwasher soap, laundry detergent, and everything you’d need in the bathrooms.
We liked the clean wood plank flooring, with mats beside beds.
The water heater was on-demand — so no issues with hot water, etc.
The redwoods are only a 15-minute drive away — Jedediah Smith Redwoods Park. Sea to trees almost instantly.
The host took a lot of effort to make this place comfortable and inviting!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place : better than the pictures. The pictures don’t do justice to the incredible views of the ocean from the house which is just a few hundred feet from the ocean. Very comfortable and clean place.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would def recommend to anyone traveling to Cresecent City. The ocean was so close the waves breaking could be heard in every room. The view alone was 10/10. Loved this place!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular views, convenient location and cozy. Truly amazing! Only con, poor phone/ internet connection."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best vacation stay in ages! One minor challenge was arriving at location in the dusk and there was no clear street number. Everything was perfect otherwise!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cost was outstanding! We loved the home and location! Would recommend this home away from home, felt like we was at home. Thank you!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great place for a weekend getaway. Enjoyed it, thank you Zoe"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing views, beautiful home, peaceful. Exactly what we needed for this vacation."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thank you, Zoe for lending us your beautiful place. It truly rejuvenated us."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time. The location was absolutely incredible. The view from the living room alone was worth it. Everything was clean and clear. Our only minor complaint, when we arrived the heat wasn't on. It was 50 inside. We're had little kiddos so we just had them sleep in some layers and the house was nice and toasty by early morning."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space and view were absolutely amazing (especially at sunset).
PRO:
- amazing view (large windows, perfect sunset view)
- close to the beach
- updated appliances
- nice outdoor setup (chairs, lounge chairs)
CON:
- overall, if the listing was updated with most of the items below - I’d appreciate knowing before booking
- TV/internet was incredibly slow (had to buffer a lot or sometimes wouldn’t connect)
- garage would not accommodate our SUV (should be noted)
- numerous signs about parking fees and neighbors taking pictures as proof (felt creepy)
- many rules resulting in $500 fees (should be listed in description before booking)
- many check out rules that should be included in listing (before you book): garbage, dishes, laundry started
- laundry is noted in welcome materials that you have to get started, but during check out says it’s optional"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Location, location, location! You cannot beat the view out of the amazing picture windows! The living room, dining room, and kitchen had gorgeous, stunning, perfect beach views. I was worried about having a road between us and the beach, but you are high enough above the road the view is not obstructed at all.
With the binoculars and telescope supplied you could view the nearby island nature preserve. We had so much fun watching the birds and sea lions on the island while sipping coffee in the morning.
Easy access to a walkable beach.
The house itself was perfect also - comfortable beds, soft bedding, large couch to sprawl out on, well stocked kitchen, large dining space. The whole house was very clean and well represented by the pictures.
Zoe was awesome and let us know everything we needed to know well in advance. The one time we did have a question she responded very quickly.
Our party of 7 had the best coast trip ever at this rental. We will definitely book this place again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place: AMAZING views (and the sounds of the waves and sea lions on Castle Rock), very nicely furnished and excellent place to stay! We will definitely be back! Zoe was a great communicator, and everything was easy peasy."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The views from this Airbnb are outstanding. Love that it is at the end of a row of houses. All the rooms are large and the closets. The back bedroom has a Murphy bed so the area is big & it has a desk. The furniture is comfortable as are the beds. The kitchen has plenty of space and everything is very neat & there are places to put your food. The refrigerator is very large. Everything is spotless. No clutter, lots of areas to put your things. Very open floor plan all on the same level. We loved this place and didn’t want to leave. We stay at lots of Airbnb’s and this was one of our favorites. The WiFi is very fast."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and view of the beach across the street. Close to a number of vacation attractions. Very comfortable beds. Highly recommended!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location, breathtaking view, comfy beds, clean and cozy! Loved our stay! Absolutely recommend Ocean Song!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay at Ocean Song, Zoe was very responsive host! Super clean place that was well stocked with just about anything you would need. There were only two of us staying so the house was more space than we needed, but you could not beat the ocean view! It was also nice I didn't have to share a bathroom with my fiance, because there were 3 full baths! This place has Pebble Beach road in front of it with some light traffic, but the way the house is propped up on a hill with large hedges in front of it, you have a lot more privavcy than other rental houses we looked at on this same road, which were more at ground level. We had a minor snafu with the oven, and Zoe quickly responded with an offer to send someone by to help, very kind! Great base camp location for the Redwoods National & State Parks! There's a Safeway grocery store right in town and we liked the Brewery and Italian place in town. A wonderful stay indeed, we will definitely return, thank you Zoe! :-)"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home is our favorite in crescent city. The view is spectacular. The home is perfect for a family and very comfortable. The beach across the street is family friendly and a great place to walk or do a camp fire.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a comfortable and scenic place to stay, very near the Redwood Parks and right near the beach. We had a wonderful stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely home with the beach across the street. Beach vacation doesn’t get much better.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing view of the Pacific. My only regret was not bringing a wet suit!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. Will definitely be back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay. It was foggy the whole time so wasn’t able to view the sunset but the walk on the beach was very serene. Due to low tide, we were able to see star fishes and other creatures. It was pretty cool. House was clean and had all amenities. Will be returning here. Thank you."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Better than advertised. The home was pristine. We wanted for nothing. Location was perfect and spent just as many days hiking in the Redwoods as we did playing in the ocean. We will stay again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a fantastic stay! What a place! A View! We spend majority of a time outside just enjoying the space, sun sets and proximity of an ocean. Wonderful stay, highly recommend to everyone!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful location and views! The home worked great for our family. Only cons are that the garage only fits really small cars. One of the cars we brought was Subaru Outback and it could not fit in the garage, even at an angle but they do have parking behind the house that works. As some other reviews mentioned, there is a smart TV but it is very slow and they could use some real cookie sheets instead of disposable ones. You should also note that the third bathroom only has a tub and not a shower.
The house was clean. We had everything we needed with some to spare in the kitchen. Plenty of towels and nice bedding. Loved all of the seating in the family room. The chairs on the front porch are a nice touch. The décor was just right to make you feel at home. The family room has some really nice art pieces of the area. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We were looking for a place close to Oregon where we could visit the Redwoods. Zoe’s place was perfect- with the bonus of being on the coast with amazing views of the ocean. Clean and comfortable with plenty of room. Exactly what we were looking for.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"You won't be disappointed in this beautiful house with the breathtaking views and the wonderful hostess. We had a memorable stay and my family was absolutely surprised and delighted at the beautiful location. Even if we did nothing but sit on the porch and enjoy the view of the ocean, we would have been completely happy. Many thanks to our wonderful hostess for an enchanting stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place is so beautiful. Fair warning though, one of the neighbors watches you through the front window. So make sure you’re following all the rules 😂"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice house
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just spent the last week at Ocean Song , we had a family reunion with our kids and our 2 teenage granddaughters ( total of 8 ) and this home was perfect !! We all had our own bedrooms in this spacious home . The home has a modern decor , furniture very nice and comfortable , kitchen wonderful to cook in with all the utensils one would need , 3 bathrooms .washer and dryer.
The views of the ocean are stunning any time of day. Walk across the road - find the path you want to take to the beach - a stone walk down - or the sand path just a little was down from the house - further down there is a handicap ramp to the beach - everyone can make to the beach. This is one of the best walking beach I have walked on ( I’m use to the Florida beaches ) - great for looking for rocks, agates, ocean glass , surfing . Low tide walks are the best - the tide pools are great - starfish, crabs, ocean snails , we even saw 2 seals playing on the beach .
Zoe and Natahna - managers are very responsive to your questions or concerns .
Again this was a wonderful stay and we will return when in the area again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The views were incredible! The kind you only dream about having. We would definitely stay there again. Fantastic location! Any essential you could need, coffee, creamer, etc.. Lots of towels and wash clothes. Very nice to have washer and dryer! Sunset views!!! Zoe was amazing! She was So nice, friendly and helpful! We even saw a seal in the surf and watched surfers. Pebble Beach is the best! Come stay at Ocean Song."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a FANTASTIC place to get away and relax as a family! The house has everything you need—all you have to do is go to the local grocery store (6 min drive) and you’re set! We loved the tide pools (star fish galore) and looking for cool driftwood and rocks! We will definitely book Ocean Song again—thank you for a great stay, Zoe!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home. Great location that offers a wonderful view of castle rock and amazing sunsets! Typically sleeping in a different bed from my own is difficult but the King bed was SO comfy. Lots of towels, beach toys, and everything you could need in the kitchen. Plenty of beds and sitting space. We will definitely come back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Was a nice home beautiful view
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This home is fabulous. Great location coming down the coast of Oregon to see the redwoods national forest. Incredible views enjoyed inside and out! Our family would definitely come here again.
2022-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"What a wonderful house to stay and very clean. The view was spectacular!
Heads up bring slippers or something to wear inside no shoes inside the house!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very peaceful spot on the water. ⛱️
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an amazing beachfront house with a stunning view of the ocean. Unique coast line with rocks to watch the waves crash against and the kids had so much fun playing on the beach. Also, was the prefect spot to stay to go explore the giant redwoods. Wish we could’ve stayed longer."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very very nice property and great value.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A worry-free stay where you can spend quality time with your family. You should know that parking rules and non-smoking rules carry a $500 fine if you don’t follow them which seemed a little aggressive and even though we don’t smoke and followed parking rules it made us a little fearful of messing up somehow and getting some hefty fine. I don’t think before checking in you are told that no shoes in the house rule but please be aware of that when you go inside. The floors are beautiful and in order to best protect them, remember to take off your shoes."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,:)
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"WOW!!! That is what everyone would say when they walked into the living and took in the magnificent view of the ocean. Our expectations were met in all aspects; location, fully equipped kitchen, house layout which was very clean and had plenty of room for 6 adults.
I can honestly say it was my best Airbnb spot to date. A perfect example of what an Airbnb should be."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Houses like this is the whole reason we love airBnB... perfect in every way.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved staying here. Can’t wait to come back again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was incredible! The view was stunning and the house was clean and beautifully decorated. Beds and furniture were comfortable. The location was great for exploring the coast and visiting state parks/attractions. We would definitely stay again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and location.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Definitely a house I would love to stay in again. The view is spectacular, easy access to the beach, and the owners have really gone above and beyond to ensure that the home has all the creature comforts one could hope for. We had a herd of kiddos with us and they all had a wonderful time. Zoe was a wonderful hostess, very flexible and accommodating and easy to communicate with. The house was easy to keep clean and their house rules were very reasonable. Highly recommend this little Oceanside paradise!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable home. Excellent views and beach access. The whole family enjoyed our time here and are already working on a plan to return!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful setting and wonderful home, very much enjoyed our stay there."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view from this house is unbeatable! You can sit in the living room and watch seals, birds, a few surfers, beach combers - it was just amazing. You can walk down to the beach in a couple of minutes and nearly everything is just a short (minutes) drive away. We visited Pier B, Whaler Island (geocached and saw so many sea lions), Battery Point Lighthouse, which are all so close to the property. We had lunch at SeaQuake Brewing and the food was really good and the waitress was funny! We also did some longer day trips to Brookings, OR, The Avenue of Giants and Jedidiah Smith Redwoods, so the house was a great starting point if you are visiting north and south of Crescent City. We had a small issue with the thermostat going offline on the first night, but Zoe responded right away when we called the next morning and it was fixed less than an hour after our call! That's great service! The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals (except a baking sheet for biscuits but we improvised with the provided tinfoil!), and even includes a charcoal bbq outside, the furniture in the living room was comfortable, beds were good, showers had plenty of HOT water. The phone service isn't really strong, but it does work. TV and Internet worked. Honestly, the only issue we really had was parking. The house is located on a narrow driveway and shares the driveway with another residence above it. We were driving a 16"" Ford F150 short bed crew cab and we barely (had to do multi-point turns with several people watching) could fit in the parking space. The garage is available, but no larger size vehicles will fit in it (probably could only fit 'compact' cars in garage). We had a great time at the house and we would recommend it!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cozy home and awesome location. we really enjoyed our stay and the view is heaven! kitchen had all the utensils, pots and pans for cooking. all I had to do was a Walmart pick up and we were set for 4 days. Zoe is super nice and answered all our questions"
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,The view is spectacular. All the rooms are very spacious. We wish that the other room with a full bathroom has a shower like the master bedroom.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing spot for relaxation & great views in a friendly town!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great place to relax with family. The house has everything you could need for a week of family time. I definitely recommend, and look forward to going back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,The view is simply amazing! There were 7 of us and we were very comfortable! The televisions could use an update. Nice short walk to the sandy beach. Beds were comfortable. Quick to respond to communication. Looking forward to a future visit. Parking was a little hard for a bigger pickup truck.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, beach just right across the street. Beautiful view from the living room! Will book again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,the pictures just don't do it justice...breath taking experience every minute was amazing
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice house great location and that view is awesome.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great views, incredible location to be able to just walk right across the street to an amazing quiet beach!
Thanks for sharing your property with us!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place to stay. The ocean is just a walk out the front door. Beautiful house very roomy. Can't wait to come back again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place, AMAZING view! Clean, comfortable, even let us check in a little early. Parking is tight, but doable. Would go back 100%!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A must do. It was our favorite stay so far.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a wonderful place. Super clean and location couldn't have been better. Would definitely stay again if in the area.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the most amazing house I have stayed at it was so dreamy. I will definitely be going back.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location. Would definitely stay again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful view and great location
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house with all amenities and great location. Highly recommend.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing location in crescent city beautiful view from the house, remodeled home feels like new
And very affordable for a 4 bedrooms/3baths house."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful house with stunning views. Everything was setup nicely and the place was sparkling clean. Communication with the host was easy and she responded quickly. We had a great time here
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place has the most relaxing views. Fully equipped kitchen. Beach toys for the kids. Games, puzzles. I did struggle a little with the electric stove, probably because I'm used to gas."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Right by the ocean! View was amazing! Clean and spacious! Great communication! Great host!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home accommodated 8 of us comfortably. The view was breathtaking! I can’t say enough about the location. We loved running down to the beach anytime throughout the day! The beach was nice and not crowded. The property manager was so helpful in preparing g us for the trip and got right back to me with questions. We loved the keyless entry too. It was a perfect place to stay to visit the Redwoods.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great locations!!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We visited as a family of parents + two teens, grandparents, and a great aunt. We all enjoyed our time.
The house is a perfect location for the beach and Redwoods. The beach right across the road was perfect for walking on and kids playing. Easy walk to tidepools and close to coastal hikes. We spent our Redwoods time in Jedediah Smith State Park due to construction on 101 and there are lots of beautiful hikes in there!
The kitchen has basic cookware, so if you are looking for specific cooking pans and pots, bring your own. We are a cooking group and made it work.
The space was good for several adult groups. The third bathroom (the murphy bedroom’s bath) is only a soaking tub (no baths/showers) so keep that in mind if you have a group that is really particular about bathroom sharing.
I would definitely recommend staying here. Beautiful location at a great price!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The views are fantastic. Location is superb. Close to town and on the beach. Very easy to access. Spotlessly clean. We highly recommend this location. The owner/manager is very easy to contact and accessible.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Spacious bedrooms and a view that can’t be beat! This place was absolutely amazing! We found treasures on the beach and even saw several whales nearby! Don’t let this home get away! Next time we will stay more than a couple of days 🙂
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great views. Great house. Great for multiple couples staying. Nicely renovated. Would recommend.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The view is amazing the home is beautiful. The family and I had a blast! Thank you!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing home on a quiet beach. Clean, beautifully decorated/renovated and thoughtfully appointed. Great place to relax and or launch your outdoor adventures from."
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was really nice and very clean, also the view on the front porch is amazing!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,It was absolutely amazing. The first day we were able to watch whales from the window. Bring binoculars! And enjoy the view. Watch seals birds waves and whales. Very clean and comfortable
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful view, clean and great location."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is every bit as beautiful as it looks in the photos and the view is gorgeous! It was a perfect stop on our family road trip.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Outstanding location, with wonderful views of the ocean! Close to great hikes and day trips. Garage was too short for both our cars...(Avalon, Pilot) and if they did fit there wasn't a remote control for it, but there is plenty of outdoor parking.

When you look out the living room window you can see the light house. This place is close to many other beaches and the redwood forest so your able to expirence multiple things.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My dad and I had a wonderful stay. We did have a snafu with the thermostat at the beginning, but the host responded quickly and did their best to check in on us even though our first night was cold. (I had a problem getting the space heater to work at the beginning. Just bad luck. Could have happened to anyone, and I definitely didn't expect the host to respond at 4:30 in the morning when I realized it was a problem. lol.) Everything was spotless, and very well presented. The beds were a little on the firmer side, just fyi. Very quiet neighborhood other than the sound the lighthouse puts out at night, but it would only be a problem if you were a very light sleeper as the house has good insulation. View of the lighthouse from the livingroom couch was pretty. The host had some great recommendations for things to do and places to eat! The best restaurant was a five minute walk away, and brews their own beer and even kombucha! Definitely recommend this place. :)"

The location was absolutely gorgeous, view of the ocean and lighthouse from the living room and beach access just across the house. The redwood state park is also about 20-30 minutes away. The place looks exactly like the photos and had all the amenities listed. Herman and Wendy were quick to respond to any questions we had. It's a short drive (~1 mile, you could definitely walk too) to the downtown area which had lots of restaurants and grocery stores. One thing to keep in mind, there was a younger man wondering around with a backpack near the beach access. He was looking inside our bags we left on the bench while watching the sunset and we caught him in the act. I would make sure to keep your items close to you and car doors locked.

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The space was adorable, clean, and close to the lighthouse. The hosts were kind and helpful. The JURNY app was not user friendly with my iPhone and we did have an issue with the heat not turning on. I tried to resolve it through the help line but was unsuccessful so I called the host directly with the numbers provided. He was very prompt and responded immediately with a quick fix. No problems after that. The bed and pillows were on the firm side. A nice stay for the night."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stunning view Very clean. Very thoughtful on little things that you may need. On demand water heater We will be back!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"peaceful area. Nice home, clean, comfortable."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location close to everything. Part of a cute quadplex looks like. Nice quiet neighborhood. Owners communicated well over email. No issues. The heater makes some odd noises at night but you get used to it.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location and charming place to stay! I felt very comfortable and safe as a single woman traveler.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Booked this unit last minute for a quick spontaneous trip to the redwoods and I’m so happy we did. We only stayed for one night as we were just stopping along the way from Vancouver to Eureka, Ca. It rained the whole time but we still had a wonderful time! We could walk to the beach from the unit, look for tide pool’s during low tide, and even close enough to walk to restaurants (even though we drove because it was raining and I’m pregnant.) The view of the water and the lighthouse from the unit are also so perfect! Even with the rain and fog! Can’t imagine what it looks like on a clear day! It was extremely peaceful and relaxing to just sit and watch the waves crashing from the unit. Only thing to possibly improve would be the comfort of the pull out couch and the noise from old heater. Besides that everything was wonderful!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great location close to the beach
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time and loved the restaurant recommendations. The host was very responsive over a check in hiccup we had. Must stay if you’re in the area!

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was nice with a great view,
just way to many messages sent back to back. I dont need daily reminders."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Herman and Wendy do a great job communicating and checking in to make sure you have everything you need. The location is perfect and the pictures don’t do it justice as you can literally see the ocean from the family room and bedroom. They have all the amenities available and even provided us with an electric heater since the main heater was too noisy at night. There were very thoughtful touches like chocolate on the pillows and sunscreen with beach towels.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful! The views are magnificent and the space was very peaceful and homey! Would definitely recommend and would love to stay again in the future.. 10/10!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Home away from home
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was exactly as expected. Easy access to walk the beach; fresh, comfortable bedding and extra blankets, separate heater in the bathroom was nice, and the kitchen supplies didn't require us to buy the basics.
Super easy and comfortable stay."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. We could see the light house from the window and the water crashing on the waves. Bed slept great!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great except that the heater is very very noisy. I’m a heavy sleeper and I kept waking up to the noise of the heater!

Will have to check out area more when have more time in future."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Understanding hosts. Very responsive.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spacious spot close to the beach! The kitchen was well stocked and the beds comfortable (including the fold out couch). We asked for and got an hour extension on heck out which was really appreciated! Also, we walked to the brewery for dinner which was a huge bonus after a long day of driving. Good beer and service! While we (2) were able to sit right away at the bar, there’s usually a long wait for tables so get there early!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot! Clean and easily accessible apartment! Right across the street from the beach with amazing views. I would stay here again!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Definitely recommend staying with Herman and Wendy! There was great communication with the owners, they provided a comfortable stay at the location. The kitchen was well stocked and made cooking easy.
The home is in a beautiful location near the coast and we felt extremely safe staying there. Not to mention, the place was very clean!"

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean and cozy. The host communication and the guidebook is spot on with local recommendations on dining and hiking. The location is perfect for waking on the beach or a quick stop at the lighthouse - be sure to check the tides :).
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a cute and co.fortable place to stay. The host provides great communication and area recommendations.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at Lighthouse Shores. The location was great!! We enjoyed our time in Jedidiah State Park and walking on the beach which was only 1 block away.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this little place! Less than a block to the coolest pebble beach. Very well equipped. All kinds of little details that were awesome! Highly recommended.
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place located near ocean. Crescent city is a very cute town.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The space was very clean and super close to the beach. The description states that you can hear noise from the other units and that is very true. If it would bother you to feel like you’re sharing space with people, I’d look elsewhere."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great rental. You can't beat the location. Very comfortable and well stocked. Herman is very helpful and responds promptly. We liked the place so well we took an extra day on our way home and stayed here again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, well stocked, beautifully but unpretentiously decorated, perfectly located home. This place was ideal for our stay in Crescent City. The house had everything we needed and was roomy and comfortable. We took a great evening walk to the beach and through the neighborhood; the tide was too high to get to the lighthouse so we have to come back and do that. You can hear some sounds through the walls from other units, so if you need absolute quiet or the freedom to make a lot of noise, another place might be a better choice for you."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and thoughtful space with very helpful hosts. Great proximity to the redwoods and the beach. We enjoyed our weekend!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! You can see the lighthouse from the window! Nice and clean space!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much for a wonderful stay in your home. We truly enjoyed ourselves. Everything you need is available in this Airbnb. Great host and hostess. Easy access to beach and lighthouse, but you can only visit the lighthouse during low tide. Awesome 😎"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"the apartment was perfect for us, beautifully decorated, accommodated our needs, & so close to a beautiful beach. we would definitely stay again. we had the best time!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The stay at Herman & Wendy’s was perfect! Very clean, cozy and a great location right next to the beach! We would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area :)"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stayed here for one night with 3 kids 7-11 on a road trip from Seattle to LA. The location was terrific, easy walk to a beatiful quiet beach with incredible sunset views and easy walk to a great restaurant. We were also just a few minute drive from Ocean World, (which was a surprise hit!) and South Beach where we watched surfers and searched for sand dollars.
The unit was very clean and while we didnt use the kitchen for more than a single cup of coffee, I did notice that it was well stocked with a lot of common condiments and I loved that it had a Keurig for me and some dairy and non dairy creamer options stocked!
I did make the mistake of giving two kids the bedroom and sharing the sofa bed in the living room which was plenty large enough, but it was really noisy so I didnt sleep great. However, I would totally stay here again and just make the kids take the sofabed next time, because everything else was great and we all wished we could have stayed longer. In fact Id love to just come back with the hubby next time and leave the kids with the grandparents because the beaches really are romantic here."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was perfect!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, well-appointed, terrific location."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lighthouse shores home is clean and comfortable.
We stayed only one night and had a great one.
Herman N Wendy were responsive.
The view of the lighthouse is a bonus!
Thank you for having us in your home!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was really cozy, cute and clean. A great stay for our family. Really close to the beach. Nice gas range, but we accidentally set off the fire alarms when we cooked eggs in the morning, so I would recommend opening the window before using the stove (the range fan doesn't actually lead anywhere). The pull-out bed in the living room was large and comfortable for the kids."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a fantastic location and the accommodations are comfortable too. I stayed with my family of 5 and my husband and I were able to put the kids to bed and then sit and play a game of cards in the kitchen dining area without disturbing our kids. The view of the lighthouse right through the living and bedroom windows is also just spectacular. Close access beach access 1 block away!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Location was great and well appointed and very clean place. Great communication and awesome hosts.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very easy instructions for check-in, clean and cozy place to stay! Loved the Airbnb and Crescent City."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was very nice, clean, relaxing and very quiet. Great location for evening walks on the beach. We loved the lighthouse! The redwoods were just a short trip. Our daughter enjoyed herself very much. Good places to eat as well. We would recommend the SeaQuake Brewery (great beer) and the Chart House (great fish and chips). Both very family friendly. We also like the Norris Family Kitchen for burgers and fries. I highly recommend staying with Herman N Wendy."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wendy was easy to communicate with, and the check-in process was super simple. We loved how close the place was to the beach for a lovely sunset and beach walk. We also enjoyed stretching our legs on a pleasant stroll to SeaQuake, the local brewery, for dinner. I would stay here again the next time I am in Crescent City."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was right on the coast with an awesome view of the lighthouse. Had an opportunity to speak with Herman for a while, cool guy. Would recommend.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Herman and Wendy’s place is a dream! It is clean, comfortable, and the location is amazing. Right on the beach with fantastic views of the Pacific Northwest landscape and ocean! Another wonderful perk is being so close to The Trees of Mystery canopy tour less than 10 miles one way, and the Jedidiah Smith State park less than 10 miles the other direction. I had the time of my life. You must see the Grove of Titans in the park as well, awesome trail. You will not regret staying at this wonderful place, even just for a day!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location to town. Took some nice walks right out our door. Bonus view of the lighthouse. Handy to have a kitchen and enjoyed the morning coffee supplies.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place and great location for a couple looking to get away for a few days. Close to Redwood Forest and coastal area.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a location! Great bright and clean place. Surprised by the toys our 3 year old had to discover in the unit and the cute little rocking chair. Very Cody and calming. So hard to leave!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just 2 of us stayed 4 nights and it was great. Close to the redwood forest. Right by the beach. A short drive to Brookings. The host left a list of places to visit and that was very helpful.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed one-night and this was a super clean and comfortable place for our family. parking in front of the condo was no problem and view of the lighthouse was so pretty. Check out the tide pools on the way to the lighthouse, our boys had a blast catching crabs and seeing starfish."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a great place! We’d definitely stay again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, Location, Location is said to be the secret of success. Well this place has the best location imaginable with views of the lighthouse and surf-crashing-against-rocks from both the living room and bedroom. The short walk to the beach access at Third Street made morning and afternoon strolls super easy. Being 20 minutes from the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park (part of the Redwoods National Park) and it's magnificent drives and hiking trails through the most amazing rain forest full of majestic redwoods adds to the pleasure of staying there.
The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed, and local restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies were close by. The hosts were terrific at communicating before, during and at the end of our stay. Check-in and access were very convenient and easy. We highly recommend this as the place to be in Crescent City"

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place in a great location. Not a good idea if you have kids or are there with friends who like to stay up late. They’re very strict about noise, otherwise if you’re just there to relax it’s a great location and a nice place."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful little place and very welcoming, even for little ones! Thank you!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Wendy and Herman provided details and things to do around Crescent City and what to do around town. We were able to enjoy hiking on many different trails and explore. It was a beautiful place to stay.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great space right by the ocean! Falling asleep to the sound of the waves and waking up to gorgeous sunrises makes it well worth it. The condo was spotlessly clean as well, and well stocked. Overall a beautiful space to spend a vacation."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is such a cute stay and has everything you need for a great trip . It was clean and comfortable. The lighthouse and beach are just out the door. You are close to the Redwoods and the Oregon coast .

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, this place is great! We walked everywhere from here and the redwoods were an easy drive away. Gorgeous spot and the hosts give great recommendations of what to see and where to eat! Being able to see the lighthouse was so sweet too!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy Access, clear concise communication, and fully equiped Partment, made for a relaxing beach side trip. We loved the quick walk to the beach."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot speak highly enough about Herman and Wendy. I’m moving across country and when I arrived there was a major spill in my car. They were incredibly kind in helping me with the situation and made me feel right at home. The home was beautiful, gorgeous views of the lighthouse and coast. I had a wonderful stay and will definitely stay again when I’m in the area."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely place with amazing views! Just a walk down to the beach. Good restaurants and breweries within the area as well.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super quick response time for booking last minute. The stay was as promised. Cute, cozy, close access to the beach, and clean. Would recommend!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay clean and peaceful
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Herman N Wendy’s lovely beach unit is just what you’ll need to wind down after a long drive. Be sure to get up early enough to walk right down to the beach and see the fog around the ocean rocks and catch a glimpse at the lighthouse in the morning sun. Such a beautiful sight. I had an amazing sleep in the comfortable bed and was delighted to see they have a Guest section in the Netflix provided on either of the TVs provided. The keurig and coffee pod selections were a nice touch as well. I highly recommend this unit for a wonderful beach side experience!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place! Cozy, convenient to the beach, easy communication.. 5 star!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and clean, a lovely place. A block away from the beach!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter was beyond delighted with being so close to a gorgeous beach! The place was clean and cute and cozy, had everything we needed. We will return!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and location. Steps from the beach
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful view of the lighthouse, right from the living room!! Cute cozy space and neighborhood."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Very clean place.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely messages. Clean place. Glad to have shampoo / conditioner / soap. And towels. And coffee. Thank you. Loud heater w clicks so couldn’t keep it on at night.
Somewhat of an ocean view through the side living room window. Super close though to the water without being on the water. Stayed in the south bottom unit.
Didn’t read check out messages until after I left but it mentioned a need to clean somewhat - if I’m charged 65 dollars for cleaning I don’t understand asking guests to clean - seems odd. Thought the total price of around 420 for 2 nights not worth it overall.
The folks who own the property seem incredibly lovely."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Great location for our North Coast, Redwoods, and surrounding beaches vacation. Super clean, well equipped, and very comfortable. The view of the lighthouse out the windows was awesome and the very short walk to the beach perfect. Great recommendations from the hosts---especially when we shared what types of adventures we enjoy at home as well as when we travel. If you're visiting when the lighthouse is offering tours, do visit. We hiked 5-6 miles a day at numerous locations throughout the parks and rarely saw anyone (September visit and hitting the trailheads by 8:15). Talk with those Visitor Center Information Officers or Rangers! They're extremely helpful (and we'd already done TONS of research)!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little vacation rental, just steps from the beach. We stayed in the south unit which has a lovely view of Battery Lighthouse and the waves crashing on the beach. As others had mentioned, you can hear renters next door and the owners upstairs, but it isn't a deal breaker. The location, cleanliness and overall charm of the unit make up for that, in our opinion."
2021-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great, and the residence is clean and updated. However, host does not disclose that you will hear every step and voice from upstairs at every turn. You will also hear the dog as it moves about the upstairs level. Not great to be woken up each day at 0700 by movement and voices. The internet was further highly sporadic, kicking you off constantly."
2021-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"There’s a saying in French, ‘love is like those second rate Paris hotels where all the luxury is in the lobby’. I don’t like to pan Airbnb places and truly this place wasn’t all bad. But the environment was as cheaply done as possible, no joy or care put into it. The photos are much nicer than the place itself. There is no view, (except for houses next to and across the street), you have to walk a block or so to see the ocean or lighthouse. You can hear Every sound in the four unit building, parking is on the sidewalk, the front of the house has zero landscaping just a sad looking dead lawn. It did have a comfortable bed, there was good water pressure. The host refused to text me the code until just before my arrival - other hosts send that kind of info as soon as they confirm reservation/payment. Overall I was disappointed and would not stay there again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very near the beach, comfortable and welcoming."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The unit was one of the nicest I’ve ever stayed in on Airbnb. 5/5!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic location! Really beautiful views and nice spots within walking distance.
One thing to note is that the walls are VERY thin. We could hear conversations upstairs which would suggest it’s the same for those upstairs… so just be mindful of that!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place...near beach and Redwoods!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place! The host was very helpful and friendly!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with lovely views of the lighthouse and walking distance to beach access. Place was very clean and comfortable.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location. Beautiful view. Beach access across the street. Super clean and cozy.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicely decorated . Very convenient location. Wonderful view of the lighthouse . Very clean. The walls are a little thin , but - the people above us were very quiet, and it did not impact us in any way."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Right next to the beach. Very clean and stylish home. Would definitely recommend staying here if in crescent city!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A friend and I we’re on a road trip from Seattle to San Francisco, and stopped in a Crescent City. Herman and Wendy’s place was perfect for our stop. We caught sunset by the water and slept well in a comfortable bed after a long drive!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful beach across the street and lighthouse view was amazing!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Callie's place is farmhouse adorable! It was a comfortable and clean place for our family of four to relax after hiking in the redwoods. If Callie offers a tour of the egg farm, be sure to take her up on it! Farm fresh eggs and milk waiting in the fridge were the crowning touch."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful farm house, baby birds and cows as neighbors were fun to watch, and it was peaceful and incredibly comfy and clean!!! So very grateful for the opportunity to stay, will be back again soon!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't have enough characters in this description box to fully express how wonderful our stay was. The home itself was amazing and absolutely spotless. The kitchen was stocked with every cooking utensil I could possibly need, and even had unexpected items like ziplock bags, skewers, and cupcake liners. I loved that there were basic ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, milk, etc. Every bedroom had a TV, and there were so many amenities to enjoy. We particularly appreciated the cozy living room (fully stocked with board games) and the outdoor hot tub. I wished we'd booked a longer stay! My husband and I can't wait to return."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here. Fantastic location for redwood hikes!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the BEST place for a west coast trip! Great driving distance to several Redwoods parks/trails and Oregon coast views/activities, as well as a comfortable, spacious, and private place to return to after sight seeing. Amazing master suite, beautiful decor, and has everything you need for cooking in, playing games, and resting up before your next excursion! We loved the hot tub and patio, and the basketball hoop was a pleasant surprise that we used a lot! As some reviews mentioned, this home is not necessarily your “middle of nowhere” spot, but it is the perfect combo of spacious and private (and quiet enough) while being very accessible to main roads to get to your activities! Truly no complaints. We had an amazing stay. Places close by we recommend: Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, Jerry’s jet boat rides, Kellogg Rd beach, SeaQuake Brewing, Perlita’s Mexican Restaurant, and C C Diner for ice cream."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to unwind. Just as pictured. Callie was very helpful and had great suggestions for food.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So many beautiful touches - best part is the diary farm is one of my favorite brands I buy specialty in Los Angeles! I couldn’t believe it. We filled a cooler for the ride back.
Space is so warm, inviting, many thoughtful touches and so close to all the spots we wanted to be in the redwoods.
We loved it. Will be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Callie’s place is absolutely gorgeous! Every detail of the house is amazing. I love that they stock the fridge with their products from Alexandre Family Farm which is only 5 minutes up the road if you have time and want to take a tour! Would move into the house if I could I loved it that much! Very cozy and makes you feet at home. Comfortable furniture and beautiful kitchen and bathrooms! Can’t say enough good things!! This is a must stay!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a great place! Looks exactly like the photos! Great communication with host Callie! We did a tour of their chicken farm and made me fall in love with chickens!! Also got to go to the dairy farm and saw calves births! Was close to all the activities we planned but still very private!! We had a girls weekend and everyone had a great time!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,I very much enjoyed my time. the next day I had to get ready to leave and was super sad about it. I had a hard time leaving. I cannot wait to you book with my family next time. I love how much time and effort she put in her home. The only problem I had was the curtains because they are white and a little see-through. Other than that I very much recommend their establishment.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and charming place with exceptional hosts! Super convenient for Redwoods adventures and the dairy farm tour Callie provided was a highlight of our trip. Every detail was tended to and hosts responded quickly to every question! Would highly recommend.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED this BnB and will be staying again for sure. The house was warm and comfortable and super cute! I especially loved the master bedroom. Super spacious with a walk in shower, oversized jacuzzi tub and the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in.
Downstairs is so cute with a pedestal tub, comfy living room with a fireplace, adorable dining room, 2 bedrooms and washer and dryer. We also enjoyed some of the amazing g A2 milks in the fridge. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ihave stayed at many airbnbs and this was my favorite, it was super cozy and very comfortable and extremely clean. The host was very friendly and very responsive and super nice . I highly recommend this cozy house to all my friends and family ..."

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this place! We were road tripping, so we only stayed here one night, but it was such a cute home and the decor was lovely."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"My group of five (5) had a wonderful two night stay at Callie’s log cabin/home - the 3 bedrooms/4 beds were super comfy and linens fresh and clean! Kitchen well appointed with everything we needed for cooking in and sharing meals in the beautiful dining room. Great living room for game night too!
Ideal location for our planned activities in the area, hiking in Jedediah Smith Redwood State Park and kayaking on the Smith River!
The complimentary eggs, yogurt and creamer from Callie’s family farm were awesome!
Highly recommend!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Callie’s place was a wonderful surprise - a great place to unwind after a long day of traveling. We’re planning on returning to stay for a weeks as it is the perfect base from which to explore the area! Great decor, thoughtful hosts, awesome amenities!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the best Airbnb I have stayed with a good place, everything is perfect"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Callie was a great host and we really appreciated the stay. Felt like home. Callie was so nice that she also guided us through their family farm and that was exceptional experience for us. I will definitely recommend Callie’s place to anyone need a place to rest before visiting Redwood National and State Park, and you will enjoy exactly the same great night that we had here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cosy atmosphere. Very nice interior and it was very spacious inside. Very clean and well equipped (especially the kitchen).
Plenty towels and the bathroom had plenty toiletries. As we stayed only 1 night, we could not use all the features; but the fireplace was great. The master bedroom was very nice.
Finally, we really appreciated the milk, chocolate milk, eggs etc from their own farm.
We would definitely revisit!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host left fresh milk, eggs and yogurt from the family farm! It was such a homey beautiful little spot."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Callie’s place is spectacular, we arrived to fresh flowers. Everywhere you looked, there was a feeling of calm, cozy, warm, welcoming. The pictures online are pretty, but the house in person is even prettier. Cottage charm all thru the home. Callie invited us to go tour her dairy farm, so we took my son, his wife, and 12 month old daughter to see the cows, such a treat! Callie was super responsive from the get go, and it was a pleasure communicating with her. If you love country, farmhouse, cottage style this is for you. I can’t say enough how much we enjoyed our stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"100% the best airbnb we have ever stayed at. From the moment we arrived we noticed the amount of work & love that has been put into the space. Every detail not only showed thoughtfulness, but also quality. The fresh dairy & eggs were so welcoming and all the cow photos made my heart happy. I really wanted a lovely place to get ready on the day of our elopement/wedding ceremony & this cabin was beyond my wildest dreams. All of our guests were blown away at the level of comfort in every corner. We were impressed that there was not only a jacuzzi tub in the most spacious master bedroom I’ve ever seen, but also an amazing hot tub right off the patio that we made sure to utilize. The couches in the living area were so comfy & made it easy to enjoy playing the games that our host thought to include. And the master bed… made us never want to leave. We felt so at home it not only made us wish we could stay for longer, but also made our special day perfect! Truly felt 5 Star!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything about our stay !! So cute and comfortable..
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very thoughtful home. I would stay here again and again if I could. Be sure to tour the farm and try their dairy products. My friends and I reallllllly enjoyed our time at Callie’s home.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend getaway! Lots to do (nature wise). Highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Obsessed. One of the best Airbnbs we’ve stayed at with our young family. Such cute decor, and so many thoughtful touches from the kids’ toys to the well-stocked blankets/towels to the farm-fresh pantry supplies. And an amazing location! We loved it and can’t wait to come back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Callie, staying at your rustic 1800s farmhouse has been a highlight during our vacation. The shabby chic decor was pristine and accommodated our every need. We were able to tour your nearby organic dairy farm and sample the goodies left in the refrigerator for us. I would highly recommend your Airbnb and seeing your dairy farm. Your Airbnb is a 5+ stay. -- Bill"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautifully decorated and comfortable home. Callie was a super friendly host, and we really appreciated the farm fresh eggs and dairy products that her and her husband provided. Would definitely book this home again in the future!! Thanks Callie and Christian"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Although our family only stayed for one night, everything was perfect. From the second we walked through the doors we felt right at home. It’s a rustic, farm cabin, with plenty of room for the kids to run and enjoy a summer evening. The extra little touches were so thoughtful. We absolutely enjoyed the fresh eggs, which made a perfect breakfast to start our day. Wish we could of stayed longer, and we may just have to find an excuse to visit the area again. Definitely worth the stop and an amazing stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Callie has created a space where it not only feels like home, but you also get to experience what home is like for her and her farm family. She shares milk from their cows and eggs from their chickens - the chocolate milk is divine! My husband and I stayed in a few awesome Airbnbs while vacationing, but I truly wished we could have stayed at this location longer. Callie’s Airbnb is not just a great place to hang out with the family and sleep; it’s an entire experience in itself. It’s beautiful, comfortable, and provides a joyful glimpse into farming life. Be sure to plan some time to check our their family farm during your stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 stayed here while we explored the Redwoods and Crescent City. The home was beautiful and the gift of fresh eggs and dairy products from their family farm in the refrigerator was a huge hit! Our kids enjoyed the basketball hoop and hot tub in the evenings after hiking, biking, and kayaking in the redwoods. We would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to those looking for a peaceful, clean home to rent for vacation."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We only stayed for a few nights, but it was a very lovely place. We appreciated the added touches of puzzles and games to play along with the cute kid's tent set up in one of the guest rooms. The house was very clean and well organized with lots of spaces to hang out in. I highly recommend this to others staying in that area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Lovely house with terrific location for the redwoods and smith river. Callie was fantastic!! Milk and eggs were the best added touch! We will be back!!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We all had a fabulous time, great home has everything, our grandson enjoyed the try cycle. Home was very comfortable had all the amenities."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was such a lovely retreat for our family. I only wish we had 3 more nights! Would love to return and highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Callie was a wonder full host, responsive and friendly throughout our stay. And the farmhouse was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. My daughters and I have a very relaxing time making meals in the kitchen, lounging inside, and stepping outside to enjoy the large yard. I'd definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a quiet space and slower pace, close to the redwoods and coast."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Callie’s place was absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. The sunset views are amazing! Cute country home and the town is adorable. The hot tub was fabulous as well as the chocolate milk from the family farm! We highly recommend the farm tours as well and we got to see a calf being born! Overall just more than what we expected.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a house in this area just go ahead and book this place! My family and I fell in love with this house! It’s beautifully decorated and makes you feel completely comfortable as soon as you walk in. The house was super clean and had everything you could want during your stay. The house is off of a somewhat main road but there was no noise from it and still felt very private. Location is perfect for exploring locally and getting right back on the road. Everything was comfortable and beautifully done. The house is filled with nice touches from the host! The sweetest extra is the assortment of fresh milk, yogurt and eggs provided to you from the host from their family farm (which you can also find in stores! So cool!) I loved everything about this house and location and wish I could have spent more time here! Thanks to Callie and her family!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Callie's place was absolutely stunning. The log cabin/farm style decor was perfect. The house was settled on nice private pastures with the soft moo of cows in the background. The place is conveniently located near the best entrances to the Red Woods and just a few miles from Crescent City, CA and Brookings, OR. Callie was a tremendous host, providing milk, cream, yogurt, and eggs fresh from their farm. My fiancé (now wife!) and I wanted to have a picnic in the Woods and Callie went out of her way to go shopping for us before our arrival. She has a beautiful family, their love for the area and others clearly shows in their hospitality and generosity. I couldn't recommend this place enough!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Callie, her husband and their home was the perfect spot for us while we were in Crescent City. I highly recommend staying here and if we ever visit again, we will do the same!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was exactly like we pictured and more! Cozy, comfortable, spacious! Definitely recommend!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay here. The place was clean and it was easy to find. We really enjoyed the place and thought it was a great place and it was beautiful inside.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay out of the main city. Host was very friendly and easy to work with.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family greatly enjoyed our stay! The host was very responsive and even provided a pack and play for our baby. We enjoyed beautiful sunsets and we’re surrounded by charming farms. Callie kindly invited us to her family farm where our 2 year old daughter was in awe to meet the chickens and chicks. It is centrally located to anyone looking to explore the redwoods. We would highly recommend this home and would stay here again if we return to the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything about this experience was wonderful! Callie and her family are just delightful and when we had an issue with the thermostat and no heat, they responded immediately! The home was beautifully done; clean, decorated so cute, everything provided that we needed and then some!! We arrived to find some of the family farm milk. yogurt and eggs in the refrigerator. That milk is some of the best we've ever had and we will be finding is at home!!
There is so much to see and do nearby from hiking, beachcombing, shopping, and great restaurants.
I can't speak highly enough about Callie and her home. Will definitely rent again if we are ever in this area!"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"The milk and eggs they left from their farm were a nice touch, However, two of the key reasons we choose this AirBnB were the farm setting (which we imaged to be peaceful) and the hot tub.
The house is located on a busy road - speed limit 45 mph - and very close to Highway 101 so there is a lot of traffic to and fro, at all times of day/night. The hot tub is equidistant between the AirBnB and the neighbor, and the neighbor has a clear view from their window ~ 15 feet away.
Because of these plus many smaller things, we left after 3 nights, rather than stay for the 7 nights we'd booked. Callie was respectful of our decision, and very understanding."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such a cute place!! So comfortable & everything you needed, all the comforts in a country, farmhouse setting, wished we were staying more than one night!! The Eggs & dairy products were a nice touch 😁 Will definitely check if available when we’re in the area!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at this gorgeous farm stay. The amenities were top notch and there was everything we needed to make home cooked meals every day. The surroundings were serene and the hot tub at night under the stars was perfect. The place is thoughtfully decorated, charming and peaceful. We wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stay here, you'll be better off for spending time at this beautiful, cozy, happy home. We had the most beautiful time here."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay at Callie's place! Her home was tidy and homey and all of the furniture was comfortable. The beds were comfortable and all 6 of us slept well. The hot tub was big hit too! We were greeted with fresh dairy products in the refrigerator. Callie was quick to respond to our needs - one of us has celiac disease and we requested an extra pot. The pots Callie ordered hadn't arrived yet but she quickly brought us one from her kitchen to use. We were really looking forward to the farm tour, but between the weather and our own schedule, it didn't work out for us. We had a wonderful time at Callie's place and will definitely stay there again if we are in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So so lovely, beds all very comfortable.
Easy to get into, hot tub was great, beautiful sunsets off the porch.
Also the milk and eggs were such a kind bonus, egg burritos every morning!
Highly recommend!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed at Callie’s place for two nights. Callie is a super responsive host. The property is so lovely. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely beautiful home. Lots of natural light, and the white paint makes you feel the modern farmhouse aesthetic. The organic milk and eggnog the farm produces was our absolute favorite. The hot tub outside was lovely after a long day of travel. Check in and check out was easy. The bed was very comfortable and quality. Probably the most comfortable Airbnb bed we have ever had. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with our family. Our daughter will remember it forever."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying in such a cozy home. Everything in it was thought out to the smallest detail. The owners of the house are the owners of the farm, we were offered a tour of it. Our city children especially liked this tour, they had the opportunity to see how the ecological farm works and touch the calves. The hosts are very kind and generous people. We were provided with 5 types of milk that is produced on the farm and eggs for free. We were simply fascinated by our stay in this house."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay!! It was super comfortable, fantastic location close to Jedidiah smith state park and also restaurants + stores etc, place was super clean, actually was bigger than I expected too! It was well stocked and the hosts were really helpful bringing us extra firewood + candles (and cookies!). We arrived in a storm with no power but they were really helpful making sure we had what we needed to be comfortable. I loved that they had milk from their farm stocked in the fridge for us. Also this is just a personal thing but we usually don’t enjoy the coffee provided at any airbnbs but it was sooo good to wake up to a GOOD cup of coffee! This trip was just my husband and I but I would definitely come back with my kiddos and stay at Callie’s place again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Airbnb in one of the most beautiful parts of the California coast. Tastefully decorated, great WiFi, cozy and comfortable bed, adorable goats in a back shed, communicative hosts. Truly a gem. I will definitely rebook in future visits to Crescent city"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Callie's place is a wonderful spot if you want to get away from it all and enjoy the redwoods, ocean and beautiful farmland. Behind the home is the Smith River and Jedediah Smith State Park and in front is farmland out to the beautiful beach/ocean. The house itself is lovely and was very clean. We did the dairy farm tour and our young son had a blast - it was definitely a highlight. Callie and her family are incredibly sweet and responsive. A few issues came up during our stay, and we were impressed by how quickly they responded and fixed the problem. We wished we could have stayed a few days longer!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and cozy place. Beautiful decore details all around. I will definitely stay again and will highly recommend to my friends! Thank you!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Callie's cottage is a dream! So beautifully appointed, the epitome of cozy and so relaxing. We loved being near and around the local farms, being so close to the beach (which you can drive on with your car!), and having so much to do at the house. They have so many games, puzzles, toys for kids outside, propane firepit, outdoor games, hot tub - it was the PERFECT get-away for my little family. Can't wait to return!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Callie’s place was absolute perfection! It was decorated beautifully and very clean! Such a personal touch in every detail. We loved the fresh milk and cream from her farm that was there for us in the fridge. The home was close to everything we wanted to visit. My only wish was that we had more time to stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this home so so comfortable. Great master bedroom upstairs best bed ever. Kitchen was great everything we needed to cook. It was just like being a home. Callie is a great host. We will be back.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,OMG!! I just finished my first day of work and I'm looking forward to continuing here but I have to say after listening to some pretty sad stories in the courtroom this afternoon I am so awestruck with how bright and beautiful and clean! This is exactly what I envisioned and more the upstairs bedroom I don't think I would ever leave!! I am so excited and want to sit in every chair and smell every candle that you've lit around here. The kitchen is amazing and I'm already eyeing the wine glasses as my bottle chills in the freezer. I've only been here 15 minutes and I'm just amazed! Way to go will recommend you guys to only people that I really like cuz I want to keep you a secret:-) have a great night I know I will
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Oh my goodness, this house was a dream. Did a girls trip. Master suite was so big and lovely, and all other rooms were clean, beautiful and comfortable. Lots of cooking and baking supplies, games, special touches- fridge was stoked with several different dairy product and eggs from their farm. We did the farm tour and highly recommend. Callie walked us through with her two sweet kids, and it was cool to learn about how intentional they are with it.
Our favorite Airbnb stay so far."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing time staying at Callies house. From booking spontaneously to getting fresh eggs and milk in the morning everything went easily. Communication was also perfect, fast and easy. The house itself is just awesome and very lovely, has all you need and is well equipped. I definitely recommend staying at this airbnb. Thanks again and see you next time :)"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful three bedroom, two full bath house in a very convenient location! We loved the hot tub, comfortable bed, and all the fun games and puzzles provided. The tour with Callie at the chicken farm was also a highlight! We would absolutely love to stay here again and highly recommend this place to anyone traveling in the area!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place transports you to rustic comfort. Enjoy beauty in decor that creates peace and joy. And we made a delightful day trip to Stout Grove hike on the Smith River followed by a drive to Zolas for dinner in Brookings. It was a truly relaxing and rejuvenating 2 days.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ahhhhhhhh😌Wonderful!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"On arrival, a candle was burning and there was fresh eggs, milk and cookies in the kitchen! This house was perfect for the four of us. There are two full bathrooms, and the accommodations were fantastic with comfortable bedding and a well stocked kitchen for cooking. We ordered Thai take out and enjoyed the back porch and the perfect weather. We recommended this home to others and would love to make a return visit."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely house, thoughtfully renovated and very comfortable."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the most beautiful and most comfortable Airbnb I have ever stayed in. My family was so comfortable, Christian and Callie were both communicative and helpful. We will definitely be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, everything extremely clean and with very good taste, the milk they give you is delicious and the experience of being in the middle of ranch fields with nothing around was very good, the only thing I regret is that we were passing through and could not stay more days.
We were fortune to meet Callie and her husband and they are excellent and fine people."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, the moment we stepped in we were speechless! We were greeted by a lit candle at sunset. The house gave very cozy farmhouse vibes. It was clean, and everything was in the details. We were also stoked to find out they are the farmers/owners of our favorite branded milk+eggs!! Thank you so much for the private tour! Can't recommend enough."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the BEST AirBnb experiences we've ever had! Beautiful home in a spectacular location. The sunsets out the master suite windows were nothing short of breathtaking. So much space in the house and outside! Convenient to the Redwoods and town yet felt very private and remote!
Callie also offered to give us a tour of the organic chicken farm they run about a mile down the road. I think it may have been my daughters favorite part of the trip! Callie and Christian are the kind of hosts that you actually want to meet when you check-in! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sweet, comfortable, warm and inviting"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful relaxing stay at Callie’s home. She was a generous, responsive, and helpful host. She took us on a tour of her chicken farm. What a special experience for our family! We also loved the milk & eggs she provided from their farms.
The home is very lovely and comfortable. Downstairs are 2 bedrooms (2 twins & 1 queen). Upstairs is a large master suite (no door separating from stairs) with a king bed, a sitting area, a bathroom with shower, and a large jacuzzi tub.
The home is located off highway 101, so there is some street noise but it’s very tolerable. Out the windows you can see cows in fields. The sunset is gorgeous from the backyard. It’s about 15 minutes from the center of Crescent City so it really feels tucked away. Such a pretty location!
We were sad to leave today & hope to come stay again. I highly recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"AMAZING! This house was one of my dream houses. I loved everything of this house. It is so beautiful, spacious and well-equipped. I loved the big master bedroom upstairs. It has a jacuzzi hot tub. There was also an outside hot tub, which was very cool for my kids. As described, there were farm eggs and milk in the fridge. They were so good that we bought them more and more. Alexandre farm's milk and eggs are a must-try! Callie was super friendly and communicated with me very quickly. My kids really loved this place and they wanted to stay much longer. So did I. Would stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,My family and I had a great time! Cabin is very cute and clean. Callie is great at communicating back with me for any questions. Will definitely return :)
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Callie’s house is amazing - we’ve stayed in many airbnbs and this is top notch quality and comfort! Every little detail was taken care of from lovely soaps and shampoos, beautiful high quality candles, a stocked pantry with so many goodies to bake with, beautiful linens, super comfy beds, and of course the fresh milk and eggs! No detail was overlooked with this Airbnb. Only downside is that there is a surprising amount of road noise for a quiet farm house. However the location is excellent and the noise is a minor inconvenience for the comforts, location, views, and spaciousness that this stay provides. A great bonus was Callie taking us on a farm tour too! One of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve ever had."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed Callie’s place. It is stocked with everything you need. The location was perfect for us as it was close to the redwoods, smith river, and brookings. We loved the hot tub, and the surprise master suite. Would definitely stay again. The milk and eggs stocked in the fridge was a bonus too."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We so much loved our weekend away at Callie's cabin. Really appreciated how many family friendly activities were made available --- from lawn games to rainbow sprinkles. Everything was clean and comfortable. Communication was immediate and check-in was a breeze!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin in the Redwoods. Great location for any hikers or sightseers. Great hot tub along the beautiful and very clear Smith River. We were able to hike 53 miles in 4 days. Let me not forget how great and comfortable the bed was up in the loft. All in all if we did this again we would definitely go back to this house and location. Thank you very much Shane and Laurie.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The minute we drove down the driveway, we knew it was the right place. A picture can be worth a thousand words, but this property surpasses the expectations.
Let’s start with the outdoors, nestled surrounded with trees next to the Smith River, where the hot tub is and a picnic table. Steps away the main entrance.
Once you open the front door, another surprise, a beautiful Industrial combination architecture with lots of details. High ceiling celebrates the whole cabin inside with a loft and a real staircase accommodating a queen size bed and another small bed. Downstairs, a complete kitchen with a bar counter to have a cup of coffee and a table for 4 people. Full bathroom and only one next to another bedroom.
My wife and I were so confortable that we are planning to come back for a longer stay. Thank you Shane and Laurie for making us feel at home.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it here! Will be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location to explore the Redwoods. There are great trails nearby. The hot tub on the river was the perfect way to end each evening. The house was spotless and cozy.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, comfortable and secluded with gorgeous view of river and the hot tub was wonderful!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thanks for sharing your beautiful piece of heaven with Us we had a great time and wish we could stay longer
Previous reviews are accurate the cabin is really cute,cozy had everything we needed and more!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Impressive! First word that came to mind when arriving at this cabin! The rustic and secluded feel, was helped by the vintage vibe and immaculately kept place! Free of any trace of bugs or pests in a secluded cabin is worth noting, as it added more peace around bedtimes. The views were refreshing and hot tub was exactly how described. We will planning a return, thank you for the stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the cabin! It is even better than it looks on the Airbnb listing. Close to trails, comfortable, gorgeous view of the river from the hot tub, and very private. We already want to come back in the future! Thanks Shane and Laurie!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If only we had more days to stay we definitely would’ve extended! We didn’t get to the cabin until late but it wasn’t difficult to locate. The cabin was immaculate and essential items were provided. Our girls loved the outdoor surroundings and the hot tub with its beautiful views was truly amazing! We will definitely keep this one in our must-stay places and hopefully we’ll get to come here again in the future!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The redwood cabin was an amazing experience on the river. The pictures do not do the cabin justice. Extremely beautiful, quaint and quiet. Will stay here again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,so clean and cozy. the tub was wonderful. we enjoyed our evening hot tub with the stunning sunset and the sound of the river. it was truely a great time :)
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredibile space. Lovely hosts. Easy checkout instructions and just an all around phenomenal time.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for rainforest exploring! The cabin was warm & comfortable and the bedding was cozy, soft and comfy. The hot tub was clean and worked well, and much appreciated after a day of tromping in the woods. The river was raging, very cool to listen to on the back porch. The kitchen had everything we needed for hot breakfasts, plenty of gourmet coffee & tea. Great stay in an amazingly beautiful spot. Thanks !!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Recommended: Bring slippers to get from cabin to hot tub, also for interior as most of the floor is cement with a few rugs. Bring ice as there is no ice maker nor ice trays to make ice while there. Bring cooking oil if applicable, as someone else previously mentioned.
This place was better than I hoped it would be. It was clean and smelled new. The cedar wood smelled wonderful inside the cabin. The hot tub is not on the porch as you would imagine it would be based on the pics. It is actually a short walk to get from the porch to the cliff on the river's edge. Fairly private other than some homes on the other side of the river that are hidden in the woods. You can see a little bit of the cabin next door from the porch, but very private beyond that. No window coverings so be aware for those that have difficulty sleeping in light. None of these are complaints for us, just some information for future guests. We loved the place and greatly look forward to visiting again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay and the property being on the river and the hot tub. Used the grill and kitchen and had no issues
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to relax and enjoy the quiet of the woods and water! The place was clean, comfortable, and has everything you’d want and need for an extended getaway. You can’t beat the location to some phenomenal hikes."
2023-12-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was in a beautiful location and I loved the view of the river from the hot tub. The inside of the house was pretty nice too. I was really disappointed with the hosts communication. There were multiple alarms in the house chirping our entire stay and it took the host two days to respond to us about the issue. When we arrived, the house was cold and it also took about 18 hours before the heating unit made the unit warm enough to not need layers. Kitchen doesn’t have cooking oil."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our favorite of all the places we stayed! Magic.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far my most favorite AirBnB. As others have noted, the pictures don’t do it justice. If you are looking for a private, peaceful place to relax in an accessible location— this is your place! It was close to must-see stops, and it was perfect."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, cute, and perfect location! The perfect tranquil getaway for our family."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were recommended this place by previous renters and their recommendation did not disappoint. We spent some time hiking the numerous trails but mostly just enjoyed the cozy space, cuddling up by the fire and sitting on the front porch sipping cocoa and coffee. Beautiful space and a much needed reset"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and great view of river.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect cabin in the woods for hiking the redwoods!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and my new husband spent our Honeymoon here.
The cabin and property were breathtaking and felt very secluded. Everything was clean, organized, and fully stocked with everything you need. If you plan to stay for more than a few days, keep in mind there are no on site dumpsters. We did a lot of cooking during our stay and were told that trash pick up would be arranged if needed so the lack of a dumpster really isn’t an issue. Our hosts were responsive and very nice.
The views of the river and the surrounding area is indescribable and photos do not do it justice and the jacuzzi was AMAZING. We will remember and cherish this trip for the rest of our lives. Thank you so much Shane and Laurie for letting us use your beautiful home.
Can’t wait to come back for our 5 year anniversary!
-The Watts"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved the stay here ! Host is friendly and helpful. Joy is awesome too and we loved the home ! It’s so beautiful and the photos don’t do it justice!! Definitely think about renting this place out. You won’t regret it !!!!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the cabin and would recommend this Air bnb to everyone! We have already told friends and family about this gem! Don’t hesitate to book! Tons of hiking nearby too!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures seriously don’t do it justice, very nice stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved this place the cabin is perfectly secluded
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful cabin in the forest next to the river. Bigger than expected which was wonderful
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is possibly one of our most favorite airbnbs we have ever stayed in! The pictures don’t do it justice. The home is beautiful & the hot tub by the river is perfect. A very relaxing home to come to after hiking all day. We loved getting breakfast at Hiouchi Cafe down the road. The home has so much lighting. Comfy couch & bed. Coffee beans & grinder made for delicious coffee on the porch every morning. Would love to stay here again sometime!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our first time using Airbnb. I cannot lie, I was anxious about it. Walking in the cabin, my anxiety left. Their place was clean and inviting. It was a great place to come back to after a day of exploring. Definitely will recommend to others."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is lovely. The problem was the hot tub, and the lack of communication from the owners. As soon as we arrived we checked the hot tub which was left with the cover off and at 96°. Their instructions said to never let it get below 98. We set the temp to 102 and went out for a few hours. When we went in the hot tub it hadn’t heated. We tolerated it at low temps for a while. That evening I messaged them and asked if there was anything we could do to try to get it to warm up. They simply asked, “what is the setting at?” This was not helpful. They asked me to let them know if it warmed up after it dropped to 88. I told them it only got up to 96 after being set to heat all day. They read my message and never responded! A simple “I’m sorry” would have made a difference. I did my own research and put hot some hot water from the sink in the tub. That evening it got up to 99, and the next morning was up to 104. Hope this helps someone else since they won’t bother responding."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cabin! We loved our stay and look forward to returning.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy cottage is absolutely perfect. Proximity to Jed Smith State Park gets you to the day use area in minutes, and it’s easy to get to other close trail heads, town and beaches.
Start your day with everything you need to make a fantastic cup of French press coffee, sit on the peaceful private porch and look out at endless trees and the beautiful Smith river. Explore nature during the day, and finish with a soak in the hot tub. We didn’t use the wood stove during this summer stay, but I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here any time of the year because it would be so comfortable. Everything you need to cook is provided, so one could hunker down and just read, write, relax.
As other visitors mentioned, the neighbor dogs wandered through a couple of times, but are super cute and just wanted to say ‘hi’ then continued on their way. Definitely not a problem. The hosts are welcoming and very responsive for any questions. The best trip I’ve had in years. Could not ask for more."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin, great location, would stay again if in the area! The hot tub is a huge plus down by the river!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful cabin! We loved it. So clean, well stocked, great location, and clear instructions. Plenty of room for the 4 of us. I loved having fresh ground coffee made in a French press every morning and enjoying the hot tub in the evenings. Beds were super comfortable. Cabin was a short drive to lots of trails for hiking. We cooked all our meals at the cabin and ate dinners at the picnic table overlooking the River. You could hear people at the next cabin, but could not see the cabin. Very private. We never actually talked to the owners, but everything was all ready for our arrival and instructions were clear. So no need! Would highly recommend this cabin."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin exceeded our expectations. Sometimes rustic cabins can be be a bit dark and dreary, but Shane and Laurie have thought of everything - including thoughtful lighting throughout the cabin, a new and beautifully tiled bath/shower, cozy throw blankets, etc. The cabin is very close (5-10 min drive) to a number of great hikes among the redwoods."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a dreamy little cabin. Beautiful surroundings right by the Redwoods. We loved our stay, wish we could have stayed longer. The hot tub overlooking the river was a hit! Cabin was better in person than the photos."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time to Northern California, and I was very excited about seeing the redwoods. Shane and Laurie’s cabin was private, cozy, and scenic. My friend and I loved reading on the porch and relaxing in the hot tub. The cabin is 20 min from Crescent City, but it never felt like a long drive. There is beautiful scenery on the way, and a delicious cafe down the road. I would love to stay here again in the future"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was awesome and the setting was beautiful.
Would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures def didn’t do the home justice! What a beautiful cabin!! Was very private and so beautiful! Loved the concrete flooring and the vintage appliances. I can’t wait to book again! Thank you for sharing the space. It was the highlight of our trip! Such a cool spot!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in Shane and Laurie's cabin! We appreciated that it was really well marked with good signage. The area is very quiet and private. We loved the picnic table and hot tub overlooking the river!! That was fantastic! The location is extremely convenient to the Jedediah Smith Redwood Park where we took some beautiful hikes. The cabin is so wonderfully designed and handcrafted. I really admire whoever built it. The views looking out the windows were amazing. The cabin had everything we needed. I feel they thought of everything. It is very nicely decorated too. I highly recommend this cabin!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this cabin and the location could not be better.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed in over 150 Airbnb's over the past handful of years. And I used to write reviews pretty much for every place we went. Now, I only write reviews for places that I would actually recommend to friends or family.
This place was great. It's a beautiful and very private location. The sound of the river is always in the background.
There is no direct access to the river from the house. But it's a short drive either direction on the main road to get places where you can get into the water.
It's a great location for a romantic get-a-way.
I would definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic visit to the Redwoods. The location was amazing - just a short drive to get to hiking, the river & a great little cafe. The cabin was cozy and the hot tub was a great bonus after a long day of hiking. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A secluded location with a great view of the river.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and well appointed. Cant beat the view and there is a redwood right out the front door.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing and private. Easy access to the redwoods. Great stay overall
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. I almost don’t wanna leave a good review so I can get in easier next time!! It was more than a pleasant surprise. On the river cliff, hot tub overlooks the Smith. The place was super clean and stocked with essentials. Lots of room for a small cabin. Newly refurbished/built I would guess. It’s such a perfect spot, close to trails and river access. Short drive to the best trails in Jed smith. The host was super great and let me know in advance that the hot tub was needing repair and if it wasn’t done they would discount.. but it WAS repaired and we were so happy to spend every evening in it and soak away the day in peaceful solitude. ❤️🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We celebrated my 74th birthday at Shane and Laurie's cabin. It was the perfect spot for us! Clean, roomy, and quiet right next to the creek and with seating out front and in back. Very private and just a really good feeling to the cabin. A big plus for us was the proximity to The Redwood parks, which are glorious. We had a few questions, and Shane was very responsive to our phone calls."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a rare diamond. If you have the opportunity… go!!! It is a nature-lovers paradise with the most incredible views. The ultimate morning coffee front porch. Redwood trails minutes away. Simply stunning. 5-stars and then some. So thankful for the opportunity to enjoy such a beautiful cabin.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the cabin in the woods on the beautiful river! So much so, we preferred to make dinner as opposed to going to Cresent City (we don’t cook on vacation). The proximity to Redwood hiking can’t be beat."
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we checked in, the kitchen sink had some left over grime in it, but was easy to wash away. The hot tub was not working. But they were nice enough to let us use the next next door the following day. However, it would have been nice to use our own , as that’s the main reason we booked the cabin, so it was somewhat disappointing that there was not a better effort to get ours fixed; and there was not a lot of communication once we checked in on the issue. The view from the other hot tub was not in the same ballpark as the one we booked. We understand things don’t work from time to time, but we were taken aback with the seeming lack of effort to get it fixed.
We did have to go to Crescent City and get some spices, olive oil, and other kitchen staples to able to cook dinner. All of the soaps, body wash, and shampoo were all diluted with water. Overall, we would come back to the area, and spend a significant amount of time here. The cabin was almost exactly what we were looking for."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely place to stay during our visit to the Redwood parks. We’d love to return. Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cozy wood cabin in the woods. It was the perfect location for exploring the Redwoods Parks. After hours of hiking trails we’d return for a welcome hot tub soak overlooking the beautiful Smith River. The inside of the cabin was comfortable, and very quiet."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay, would reserve again. Visiting the nearby grove of titans was a once in a lifetime experience. A must visit area. Thank you for hosting us!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was nothing short of magical. We didn’t realize just how inside the forest we’d be staying here, and the location was perfect for us. It was private, the hot tub had an amazing view of the river, and we felt right at home staying here."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shane and Laurie’s place was right next the Redwood National Park, and 30 mins to the Oregon border so it was perfect for us to hike and explore the outdoors. The beds are probably one of the most comfortable beds we’ve ever slept, seriously slept like a baby. My only complaint is communicating with them was an issue. I called twice left several messages both on the air bnb app and their listed number and nothing until I messaged again and they finally responded."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could, I would give this place 10 stars. Beautiful, quiet, peaceful and breathtaking views. The cabin is stunning inside and out!
Sitting in the hot tub listening to the river is about as peaceful as you could ask for. I've stayed in lots of places and this was the first place I was sad to leave!
This would be a dream property to own, thank you to Shane and Laurie for sharing your beautiful retreat with us. We will be back very soon!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location in a stunning setting
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so beautiful, the pictures really do not do it justice!!! the hot tub overlooking the river was an incredible place to end the day after hiking in the redwoods. The cabin is cozy, very well done, and secluded! The only thing that happened was our internet went down for almost 2 days and we didn't hear back from the hosts until after we left. We understand outages happen but there is no service at the cabin which made the internet outage inconvenient for us to be able to reach people we needed to. not the end of the world and totally will come back next time we're up in RWNP, highly recommend!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Comfortable, clean, peaceful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! What a beautiful location! Was perfect for our weekend getaway to Redwoods. Would stay here again for sure if we get back to this area!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and just a wonderful cabin.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best place to stay! Definitely worth the price, highly recommend anyone to stay here if you are planning a trip to Redwood National Park!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here a few nights at the beginning of our honeymoon — so gorgeous and private. Awesome breakfast 5 minutes away, but it was far enough from crescent city that we felt more connected to the surrounding area. It was a romantic getaway perfect for couples!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful. Will be returning many many times in the future. We enjoyed this place so much, felt just like home!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Shane and Laurie's beautiful cabin to spend my husband's birthday weekend in, we've been wanting to explore the Redwoods for awhile and this was the perfect getaway! Especially after long days of hiking for miles, coming back to the cozy cabin and the hot tub with that beautiful view was perfection. We described this airbnb as one of our ""Top 5 Favorite Airbnbs"" we've ever stayed at - so there's that! Thank you so much for having us, we hope to come back again with friends!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful and peaceful stay. The hot tub is an extra treat to enjoy on the river and underneath the stars. We look forward to coming again.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An incredible stay - beautiful surroundings and a cozy, spotless home filled with character."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at the cabin. It was the perfect place to get away from it all, while still having access to modern comforts. We were nestled in the peaceful forest and could look out at the nearby river from the window, porch, and hot tub. Listening to rain fall at night was particularly delightful.
Shane and Laurie stocked the place with everything we could have needed, including quality coffee! The upstairs bed was so comfortable, I slept just as well I do in my own home. We made use of the full kitchen and the included cookware without issue.
We had such a great time here. It's now our go-to place for a weekend escape. I can't wait to visit again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very close to the redwoods. Beautiful surroundings. Very cozy cabin.
One thing I really appreciated was that it didn't have air fresheners everywhere, and it still smelled nice. Was genuinely clean, no trying to cover things up. Also really appreciated the tea set.
Well stocked kitchen, but be sure to bring food since the nearest store isn't very close.
Only downside was that the hot tub is more like a luke warm tub. It wasn't very cold (50s) or windy while we were there, but the hot tub lost heat fast. Even with the lid half on it was only 97 degrees, and this was after turning it up to 104 half an hour before getting in. It couldn't heat. If you do plan to use it, turn it all the way up at least 6 hours ahead of time."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here so much! The place was clean and cozy, and so private and quiet! We only heard neighbors when we were outside. We did a couple trails, since we were so close to everything! Definitely check out the Myrtle Creek trail if you are a planty sort of person. We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful setting and great cabin and surrounding grounds. We really enjoyed looking at the river and mountain from the property.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We really loved the nice cabin. It was brand new and well furnished. We found everything we needed and were very comfortable all around. The hot tub was great too. We did very nice hikes in the area and enjoyed our time there very much.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was absolutely perfect! We wanted to stay there forever! It’s impeccably clean, coffee and other essentials provided, and the views are unbelievable. The most peaceful and beautiful stay. Close to the best redwood hikes in Jedediah Smith State Park. 5 stars!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this cabin! Gorgeously built and surrounded by beauty. It was perfect for our stay and the hot tub was a great bonus with the chilly weather!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING!! It was well worth what we paid and even better than the photos. And for those wondering, they have a great kitchen!! If I could give more stars, I would. It’s right next to the redwoods state part. Amazing."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolute gem of a getaway spot. Quiet, with a great view, and not too far from hikes in the Redwoods or Crescent City beaches. Every detail was so thoughtful, and the location could not possibly be beat. I just hope I get the chance to come back some day!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect!!! The amenities, the setting, the ease….. 5 stars!!
I would recommend this to anyone exploring the Redwoods.
The location was incredible. The cabin was charming. Thanks for sharing a piece of heaven with us."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was for my husbands 60th birthday. The cabin was perfect for what we wanted. Super close to the Jeddiah Smith Park and right on the Smith River. The spa was clean and hot. We were very happy with our stay and look forward to coming back.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was such a cozy spot to stay and I would return in a heartbeat!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the wood smell as soon as you walk in. We were looking for a secluded cabin with a hot tub and we got a bonus of the river! Everything was cleaned, lots of towels, blankets, extras in the panty, cast iron skillets, and the fire place. Truly quiet and away."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful cabin, right on the Smith River. The hot tub was great, the cabin was cozy, and it perfectly secluded but not too far from hikes and a market. Beautiful scenery everywhere you go.
Was hoping to grill steaks for dinner, but there was no propane in either of the tanks.
Overall, if you’re looking for a clean cabin in the woods, I’d definitely recommend this spot."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,super scenic. perfect cabin stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was incredibly beautiful in a nice, secluded location. It was very clean, well stocked with the basics and a lot of thought and effort went into everything. The spa was amazing after a long day of hiking in the trees. Thank you so much!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is beautiful, tidy, welcoming, well kitted out and comfortable. The location is relaxing with a stunning view of the river and we enjoyed our visit thoroughly!
Thanks Shane and Laurie. We hope to be back again some day!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Shane and Laurie’s. It is in the perfect location and makes for a spectacular getaway in the Redwoods right off the river. The beds were very comfortable, it is a quiet area, with ample privacy. The description is very accurate and I would recommend this stay to everyone. Just a note, the upstairs loft doesn’t have window covers so the morning sunlight is very bright if you are planning on sleeping in after a long day of hiking and drinking but gorgeous nonetheless."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing pictures don't do this cabin justice. Everything about our stay was perfect. We woke up each morning to the birds singing and drank our coffee overlooking the river. We opened the windows every night and enjoyed the cross breeze and lovely quiet. We slept like babies and then drove 5! minutes and we were back hiking in the Redwoods. Every item in the cabin was of good taste, good quality, comfortable, and well thought out. And very clean. The appliances and plumbing worked perfectly. We even cooked our meals there so we could spend more time enjoying the cabin. Even the bed and bedding were of fantastic quality. There were plenty of towels, dish towels, and washcloths. We stay in a lot of cabins and it really doesn't get any better than this. Thank you, Shane and Laurie!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had the best stay and far exceeded my expectations. Everything was perfect and provided a convenient home base for exploring the redwoods and surfing in Crescent City.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place and I’ll endorse the other reviews. Lovely location right on the Smith River and right next to Jedediah Smith State Park. It’s in a small community of homes but we rarely heard much neighbors’ sounds. Great cabin, well appointed and supplied, and responsive hosts. We hope to stay again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful in all ways! Comfy, clean, stylish, well stocked, and with a location that cannot be beat: on the Smith River and minutes to the best hikes in the Redwoods!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hot tub overlooking the river was a dream. The cabin had everything we needed to enjoy the weekend. The beds and bedding were comfortable and cozy. Everything was well labeled and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals in the cabin. We had a lovely time and we would love to come back another time soon!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Shane and Laurie's home is perfect for exploring the Redwoods of Northern California. The home is comfy with all you need to prepare home meals and enjoy coffee overlooking the river!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best stay ever- if I could give 10 stars I would! The cabin is beautiful, cozy, and well-appointed. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely amazing time staying at the Redwood Cabin. Beautiful space with adorable mid-century touches. The proximity to Jebediah state park was incredible it took us 20 min to be on the trails. The river front table and hit tube made for magical evenings. The place is fully stocked with delicious coffee and French press, cute mid-century glassware, towels, and blankets. Cannot recommend enough - we will for sure be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I stayed here for four nights while we eloped on the Oregon coast. The location was absolutely gorgeous and exactly what I imagined from the pictures! The listing makes it seem like the place is fully stocked and man is it! Lots of towels, pots and pans, kitchen appliances, cooking basics (oil, salt and pepper, some spices, etc…). The place was just like home, and not lacking anything. The only thing we needed to bring was actual food. The sheets are so soft, good mattresses and pillows. Hot tub views were stunning and we used it every day we were there. Having the washing machine and dryer (both basically brand new) was such a perk mid 3 week long road trip for us and came with basically everything a laundry room at your house would have.
Some notes: driveway is narrow and a touch over grown (we brought out full sized pick up and it was a bit of a squeeze). The other cabin is a bit close, so you can hear the neighbors if you’re both outside. The residential neighbors at 260 I believe have a larger dog that came into the yard space and rolled around for thirty minutes just moments before our photographer was supposed to meet us. My fiancé went outside and sternly told the dog off/fake barked at the dog and he eventually wandered back home, but definitely something to consider if anyone in your party is scared of large dogs (the dog did bark at my fiancé, but seemed aware that it wasn’t at its own house so wasn’t aggressive). It’s in the woods and by a river so it’s gonna be buggy so bring stuff to combat that."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect getaway! Absolute serenity, inside and out. The photos don't fully showcase the beauty."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful cabin which made our trip completely epic!! The smell of cedar throughout is transcending. Fantastic finishing touches, it was warm and welcoming. The bed in the upstairs loft gave me the best sleep I've had in years! Fantastically stocked kitchen. That view from the hot tub in enchanting!!
I hope to come back someday soon."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful cabin with great amenities and a perfect location! Very clean, had exactly what we needed."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you need a place to take a break from the crazy life you live or just a place to escape, this is it!! Beautiful location! Quick 15 min drive to Crescent City, minutes away from Jedediah State Park. The cabin is nice and open. Small wood stove for heating. A little of everything to make your stay comfortable. The hot tub is right next to the river. We really had a relaxing weekend! Highly recommend early morning coffee sitting in the hot tub listening to the birds and river flowing. You won’t regret this stay!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place. Gorgeous setting. Very clean and peaceful. Will definitely stay again when able. Thank you!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully furnished and well appointed home. Everything you need for a great vacation near the redwoods.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and absolutely beautiful! The view was wonderful! We loved sitting on the deck in the morning and evening. The yard was so beautiful as well. Beds were very comfortable. So nice to be able to do our laundry here as we moved down the coast. We did not want to leave!! I cannot say enough good things about this rental. Thank you so much for sharing your home we will never forget our stay at the Ugly Marlin.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the views- absolutely stunning! The entire house had everything we needed and was clean, comfy and cozy. Just like home. Kitchen space was perfect!
Arriving at the back, note there are three “Private Property” signs on the fence, but this is the place.
Janice was fast to communicate and accommodated us with short notice. We look forward to coming back again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter, grandkids and I had a wonderful experience in Crescent City enjoying all of the local attractions but the very best part of all was spending quality time together in such a welcoming, comfy and cozy cottage. As soon as we walked in it felt like a giant hug. The kitchen is like my dream kitchen with plenty of room and everything you could possibly need for cooking not to mention the spectacular ocean view. The beds were very comfortable and the house was very well stocked with all of the amenities of home. Thank you Janice for making us feel right at home. Oh and I just love the name, the Ugly Marlin also proudly hanging above the bar. I just wanted to know the story behind it! We are looking forward to another stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an unbelievable stay! Janice's home is even more lovely than the pictures. She is a terrific host.
The home is gorgeous, spotless, and very cozy. All the furniture and beds were very comfortable. The kitchen is amazing. The view was spectacular!!
Janice also provided excellent recommendations for things to do in the area and great places to eat. We enjoyed many on the list.
We had such a wonderful stay for our family of three. We were actually sad to leave, and we can't wait for our next opportunity to visit Crescent City and hopefully stay here again. Highly recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,All good- exactly as described. Nice house to spend some time in.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Janice was a great friendly, accommodating, and very responsive with any questions we had host. She calls her place the ugly Marlin, but honestly, it should be called the Beautiful Marlin. I would recommend and definitely stay at the beautiful Marlin again.
Thank you, Janice, for letting us stay at your beautiful house
April and Family"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful cottage in a spectacular location. Very well appointed. I enjoyed my stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. It was great to be right on the ocean. The home was very relaxing and stocked with cooking utensils. Highly recommended and will return!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this little house. Spectacular view! Very comfortable and convenient home layout. Every little detail had been taken care of. It was an easy stay, we just wish we had booked the house for a longer stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful & spotless! New appliances worked great. Beautiful beach across the street. We watched sunsets every night. Great location for Redwoods hiking & we also enjoyed local restaurants, lighthouse & the cheese factory."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was beautiful and homey. Everything left in the kitchen we needed to cook meals and extras. Snacks and little lemonades upon arrival. Gorgeous place.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Ugly Marlin cottage was absolutely perfect for our visit. The house was immaculate, with all the appliances and fixtures nearly new. The kitchen is well stocked, and Janice had coffee and staples to get us started. Two days (and many miles) later, and I am still thinking of that view - 180 degrees of ocean! I would hang out in the kitchen just to watch the changing sky and water.
Janice's description mentions all this, but just to confirm: The house had easy access to the beach, and the roads nearby are also walkable. We took several trips into the redwood parks. We found a few lively restaurants in town (Nooner cafe, and Sea Quake brewery). There was a farmers market on Thursday (I think). Otherwise, it is a very quiet town, which was just what we wanted."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable cottage in a great location, everything as described. Kitchen fully stocked and beds very comfortably, we really enjoyed our stay and the views out the front were gorgeous, would definitely stay here again if in the area again. Close to a lot of great hikes in the majestic Redwoods!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay for pleasure or business. Our Family had a great time and enjoyed sitting out front and watching the ocean. Definitely will be back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Both the evenings and mornings were particularly peaceful and picturesque with the ocean views. Also, we enjoyed using the grill on the front patio for a relaxed dinner at the Ugly Marlin."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home. I will recommend and most likely be back
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Janice's place is as described, the location is a great to explore the Redwood forests. There are beautiful views of the ocean from the house. My family and I had a great experience and would highly recommend staying here."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice getaway from the big city. Beautiful home with amazing views, plenty of space. I felt right at home the moment I opened the door. Would definitely come back to this perfect treasure.."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay! The location was amazing. Loved bein to sit on the front porch and enjoy the ocean. Janice was very helpful, when i couldn't figure out the heating system she called and walked me through how to operate it. The snacks she left for us were a great treat and the home was beautiful inside and out"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was beautiful. We loved all the touches. Everyone we met was so friendly. I would definitely recommend and would love to stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we arrived, we stepped into the front kitchen area and all of us gasped,,so beautiful and overwhelming! the ocean is a 360 panarama from the front deck area! The best beach ever is 1 block walk down the paved road, it has a permanent stairway down to the sand. We walked there every morning for at least an hour, at low tide there are starfish, crabs, agates, birds of all types. The sound of the waves is so soothing. Janice's place has everything you could need for a very comfortable stay. After adventurous days experiencing the redwoods, Smith River kayaking, whale watching, sky trail, beach combing The Ugly Marlin was a relaxing place to rejuvenate. Highly Recommend! 5+"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Janice’s beach house was the highlight of our trip to Crescent City. Right by the beach with a gorgeous view. The house was immaculately decorated with thoughtful touches. We wish we had stayed longer!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely clean and well provisioned home that is in a beautiful area with a five star view . I'd recommend any time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay. Everything very comfortable. Great view of the off shore stacks. There is a road that runs in front of the house & people like to walk the road. But still enjoyed sitting out in morning or evening taking in the view. Great location for Redwood Parks
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views, great kitchen, will stocked, clean. Janice was a great communicator, responsive."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful views and a wonderful chefs kitchen. A family of 4 adults enjoyed the ocean walks, comfortable beds and spotless spaces. We will be back soon!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Snug cabin in the woods. Slightly surprised that it was so close to a busy road, but that didn’t detract from the stay, and made it easy to access. Did feel very private. Need car to get to local attractions, hiking trails etc but all pretty close. Walk out around neighborhood and meet some of the friendly locals. They all have great stories!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin we leased was beautiful--right in the heart of the redwoods. I only wish we had been able to stay more than one night as the weather was more rainy than sunny this time of year, but our plans didn't allow for it as we had other places to visit. However, it was a lovely cabin and very relaxing. It has everything you need and lots of personal touches (even creamer for our tea and coffee), which was greatly appreciated. It was just a short car ride to Crescent City for restaurant visits and truly a beautiful place to stay. Perhaps next time we visit the Redwoods--we'll have more time to stay longer and this place will definitely be our first choice."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 stay. Was exactly as described. Secluded enough to allow maximum relaxation, but also close enough to Crescent City for all your other needs. Would stay here again in a heartbeat! James was incredibly easy to get a hold of and was proactive when it came to any issues we may have had during our stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute cabin. Comfortable bed. Lovely environment.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was beautiful!! Easy location to everything. Cute and clean!! Will definitely book it again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little cabin was everything we needed and wanted! Cozy, clean, a redwood right out the front door. The light was even left on for us and our late arrival. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin on our visit to the Redwoods! Loved listening to the birds ! Great spot to relax and unwind.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Its exactly what you are hoping it will be! Beautiful, peaceful place in the woods. The cabins are far enough from each other that we didn't feel the need to close any of the blinds. Awesome!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"James was super friendly and described the check-in/out process clearly. There were clean bath towels, cooking utensils, cookware, plates, etc. The pictures also matched what the cabin actually looks like in person. A few things to expect for first timers to the area. The roads getting to the cabin are NOT for the faint at heart and can be intimidating, just take your time and PAY ATTENTION TO THE ROAD SIGNS. Once at the cabin the mini split unit will heat and cool the cabin efficiently just give it some time it's not like your central AC home unit but it works very well. At night we placed a shirt over the front door glass to prevent anyone from seeing directly into the bathroom while the door is open due to line of site. Overall, the cabin was wonderful. No complaints on our end and I'm sure you will enjoy being nestled in the woods as well. ENJOY!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful weekend in a lovely cabin
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is so quaint and beautiful! We enjoyed our stay here, it was very peaceful and instructions were simple and clear. Definitely recommend!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great experience
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was great! The surrounding redwood trees made us feel right in the redwoods forest! Able to enjoy family time while listening to rain fall from the trees and play card games! Easy check in and easy to find and the cabin looked just like the pictures. Great choice! We enjoyed our stay!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was a cute, if small place. Had what we needed but would have felt tight for a longer stay. Maybe a tad overpriced. The place smelled a little musty but otherwise was super clean."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean; bed was comfortable, quiet area except for us hearing the cars in the road; we had thought it was more secluded; these are all on a loop but not far from road. We would stay again, had no issues!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cabin just minutes away from the Hiouchi Visitor Center!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location in the redwoods. Easy check in, clean place."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Remote cabin in the woods. Very clean. Beautiful surroundings. The cabin gives you the feel that you are a part of the redwoods.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place. Loved being surrounded by trees. Only “negative” I have is about the smell of weed when entering the cabin. I understand it is legal and I’m not trying to be picky but with two very little kids I was a little taken back. Everything else was great!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean cabin, stocked with all of the things we needed. Driving distance to great park trails."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The views were spectacular. it was easy to find. it was very clean.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful!! This cabin was a perfect base camp for our getaway to explore the Redwoods National and State Parks. It was quiet and secluded, surrounded by towering Redwoods and lush fern. The bed was very comfortable and it had a nice little kitchenette available. Exactly what we needed. We enjoyed every moment."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute cottage in beautiful surroundings. I was pleasantly surprised at how far apart each cottage was, we definitely had lots of privacy. The cottage was clean and warm, the shower was good and the bed was VERY comfortable. Wish we had had more time to spend there!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Fern Hook cabin was just what we were looking for. Easy access to Redwood trails. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. We had one question when we arrived and James was quick to answer. We highly recommend and would visit again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful and peaceful place to stay. I’ll definitely be back.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cabin was absolutely perfect for our family of four! After a long day hiking the Redwoods the cabin had everything we needed for a fun and relaxing night to rest. We enjoyed how easily accessible the cabin was but how private it still felt. Waking up to the beautiful view was amazing. James was also very helpful in providing an extra bed and very comfy linens and bedding for our kiddos (family of 4.) We stayed on a chillier night and the cabin didn’t have any issues warming up or staying warm throughout the night. 100% would recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An absolutely beautiful cottage exactly like the photos! Cosy, super comfortable bed with beautiful linen. And the surrounding Redwood forest is truly magnificent."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay on our way through the Redwoods. The cabin was quaint but comfortable. Great views!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This lovely Cabin is tucked in a redwood grove and feels magical. It is so close to the Smith River and the redwoods, you can see it all with very little driving. The bed was ultra comfortable, and the extra mattress in the living room was, too. And, clean, clean, clean! I wanted to sit on the sweet porch among the trees and read all day! What a special place."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent, would highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"During my stay I lost my 18 month old pup out in the woods and the host, James, went seriously out of his way to do so much in helping me try to locate him and accommodate a second night for me! Great place, great host … doesn’t get better than this!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to explore the redwoods. Easy to check in and with the minimum appliances to enjoy your stay. Would recommend.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful secluded cabin just a few minutes drive from some amazing redwood hikes in the state park
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is tucked away in the woods and felt very private even though you could hear the occasional car go by and see the other cabins through the tree. The place was spacious and very comfortable, especially the bed. The surroundings were beautiful! Didn’t mind not having any wifi because we wanted to be disconnected. I didn’t have signal for my phone (T-Mobile) the first night but somehow had signal the second night. So I recommend you download offline maps and any other information you might need before getting there."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin we stayed in was extremely clean and well set up. The setting was both beautiful and serene- we really enjoyed being able to sit out on the porch and admire the greenery. Very convenient location for hiking in the redwoods- would definitely stay here again!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This small cute cabin in the redwood grove is close to the Jedediah Smith SP. The cabin has all the necessary amenities. It's not very fancy, but it's totally functional. The noise from the nearby road is audible, though..."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, tranquil log cabin in the woods. Comfortable accommodations.
James was a great host and provided clear instruction on how to get there (it was a little off the beaten path). Gorgeous surroundings! Only wish we could’ve stayed an extra night or two!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This location is perfect if you’re looking for a small getaway driving distance into the forest or even driving into Oregon. I recommend this place especially if you have dogs since there’s enough private space for them to walk around in. I do recommend bringing your own flashlights since it gets really dark at night.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If others are staying in the cabins nearby, might be a little too close for comfort. But if you happen to be the only people there it’s an very private area. Cozy place! Very close to redwood access which was very convenient."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fern Hook Cabin 900 was one of our favorite AirBnB stays to date. The cabin itself is clean, quiet, cozy, and has all of the essentials. The surrounding environment did not disappoint, sitting beautifully within the Redwoods. We held our private elopement ceremony behind the cabin among the magical trees and ferns and it was an absolute dream! Next time we find ourselves in the PNW (hopefully soon!), we will definitely stay here again. Thank you James!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this little cabin in the woods! Very quiet, peaceful, and private surrounded by massive trees and forest vegetation that make you feel completely absorbed in the beautiful surrounding of the redwoods. The cabin itself was cozy, comfortable, and clean, with the soft bed being a major highlight. We absolutely will stay here again!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable tiny house in a peaceful setting with basic amenities provided. Home was very clean, but did have a musty/mildewy smell for being a new build. We would definitely stay in another cabin here onsite in the future."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"‘Neath redwoods' embrace, Fern Hook Cabin's delight,
Clean, quaint charm, each moment takes flight.
Nature's lullaby, a comforting croon,
In Fern Hook's haven, beneath the moon.
Stars twinkle brightly, but none shine so bright,
As the five-star allure, every detail just right.
Cozy and cute, like a fern-kissed dream,
In Fern Hook's cabin, where memories gleam."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You won’t regret picking this beautiful cabin for your visit to the redwoods!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was so peaceful and had everything I needed to make it comfortable. The place was very clean and well cared for by the owners. I really appreciated that it worked well for my dogs. The only bit of advice I would give to prospective residents, make sure you come prepared with food. There is only one restaurant within the area and it closes early during the week. Otherwise it is a great way to unplug and be surrounded by the stunning scenery."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very cozy and private retreat from the busy world. Bonus: it was very close to the state park!
It didn't bother us at all but there's not a t.v./wifi so be prepared for quiet time and bring some games/books instead."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location out in the Redwoods. Very peaceful and comfortable.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and secluded right in the redwoods! Perfect
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a late day exploring the Redwoods and opted to stay in the area. We booked online a short time before check in and James was extremely accommodating. Each cabin is set back from the others, making it your own oasis. Be sure to make time to enjoy a quiet moment on the deck. It was a truly magical property."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect spot to relax after spending the day along the Avenue of Giants. As described and shown in the photos. Host communicated well. Private. Comfortable. Would recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"James's cabin was as advertised if not better. It's location to the Jedediah Smith Redwoods is ideal, and the trees surrounding the cabin give you the experience of lodging in the Redwoods itself. He also allowed for us to have a late checkout which was very much appreciated. I would recommend the cabin 10/10 times, you won't regret it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very enjoyable visit. We loved the privacy and cozy cabin. Had everything we needed. Hope we can visit again someday!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I really enjoyed my stay at this cabin. A lot of care and attention to detail were put into to the design of it. I would definitely stay here if I’m in the area!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay and feel connected to nature ! Beautiful property and everything you need,
super comfortable and clean !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,we were looking for an adventure and this cool place was the cherry on top!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,House was as described. The location is gorgeous and quiet. It was a great place to begin a trip to see the redwoods.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So good, had to get it twice"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James was a great host. Cabin is incredible. Gorgeous views of the redwoods. Our cabin was near the highway - so you did hear some echo - but it was quiet and peaceful. You really cannot beat the ambiance and serenity. Not hard to find, but you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere. Easy access and check-in. The house rules require cleaning and putting dishes away. Although we complied, I did see where this could raise potential sanitation questions (to be fair, the dishes were clean and looked brand new - but ""clean"" can mean different things to different people). Perhaps a policy of cleaning and rinsing dishes, but leaving them in the sink, might strike the appropriate balance. Regardless, we would definitely stay again and really enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful area, cute cabin, quite and comfortable. Right next to the start of the Redwood NP. Worth another visit!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location. Felt very private. Nearby hiking and sightseeing.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James has a great place, nestled amongst the redwoods and the ferns. Very peaceful. Great place to get a good nights rest. James was very communicative regarding nearby fires and making sure we’d be safe. That’s a great host!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,James was an amazing host and I wish I had some more time to stay there. We will definitely be returning. The only suggestion I would make is put another AC in the bedroom. Other then the place is perfect.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay at Cabin 900! Sitting on the front porch with my wine after arriving and my tea in the morning before we depart is always a highlight. The trees are so beautiful and peaceful. The bed is super comfortable and my teenage son loved the long, comfy couch. The kitchen is very well equipped."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James was very informative and accommodating for the circumstances. Unfortunately, due to wildfires and power outages we were unable to check in to this cabin. Owner communicated and gave us a refund in a timely manner even though he was being evacuated himself."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous cabin amongst towering redwoods and beautiful ferns. A peaceful comfy spot.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James's place met all of our expectations. Nice and clean, great surroundings. We would stay there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for a wonderful travel oasis.
The cabin was very charming
The location among the redwoods was awesome.
Wished our travel plans had allowed us to stay longer"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The pictures did not do this location justice. It's surrounded by trees and growth. It's very clean and is a great little getaway. We will definitely come back here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy cabin Nestled in the trees! Beautiful surroundings, and clean. We enjoyed our stay.
No tv or Wi-Fi, which was wonderful to disconnect. I would suggest bringing some games or good book if you’ll be there for longer than overnight."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the cabin was perfect, the pictures certainly do not do this place justice! Highly recommend staying here (and be sure to get breakfast at the nearby Hiouchi Cafe)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing location! Even though it was off of a main road, it was very quiet and private. Simple, yet had everything we needed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful stay at James' cabin. Couldn't have asked for a better location. We'll be back for sure!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay while visiting the nearby national parks! The redwoods right outside the door made it epic! The cabin was comfortable and clean!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful cabin in a peaceful little area, very secluded and private, the check in process was flexible and seamless with James'easy instructions, the description on the site matched the cabin, except for ""sleeps 4"" meant someone had to sleep on the couch, but it wasn't bad, the couch was comfortable, the bed was comfortable, and everything was very clean. It was a pleasant stay, we would recommend this beautiful place."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed staying here, the views were spectacular. The place was cozy and just what we needed. Easy to find and check in. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great two night stay! Super close to the Redwoods and Crescent City. Would definitely come back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect getaway in the redwoods! The tiny home was better than the photos. I would highly recommend booking this for your getaway. Bed was amazing and James had everything you need for your stay! Would absolutely book again!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful solitude in the middle of a fern oasis! We loved our little cabin. The beds were comfy and the cabin was just the right size for the two of us. James was proactive with directions to help us locate the cabin as the road is newer. Great location!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, in the woods but right by the big road. Very clean."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James’s place was perfect for our stay near the Jedediah redwoods. Absolutely beautiful surroundings, very cozy and quiet cabin, and easy access to nearby trails. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an adorable cabin nestled in a beautiful setting. It was impeccably clean, quiet, and close to Redwood National and State Parks points of interests."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Fern Hook Cabins area was absolutely beautiful. You really feel like you’re in a totally secluded area deep in the Redwoods, while still being conveniently located. Didn’t have to drive very far to find a great hike. There are of course other cabins nearby but they are spaced out enough to enjoy your privacy. The cabin was exactly as described. Plenty of extra towels, blankets, and essentials. Everything was very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and we got a great night of sleep. Drinking a hot cup of coffee on the front porch and taking in the scenery was the perfect way to start the day. My only complaint is that due to our travel plans we didn’t have time to stay more than one night! We will definitely be back to Fern Hook Cabins and would recommend it to anyone visiting the Redwoods! Thank you for a fantastic stay!!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such an amazing stay!!! Having our own little cabin in the woods was incredible. It was beautiful and peaceful, and the cabin itself was very clean and nice. Clear and easy check in. It’s a short 10 minute drive to Jedediah Smith State Park to see the Redwoods. All good things to say!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little cabin was clean, organized, and peaceful. We enjoyed our stay very much."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very private, clean and cozy place. We loved these tiny house with all the lovely details.
It was a great stay. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,James’s place was INCREDIBLE!!! Truly a magical location with a clean home and great views. We fell in love with it as soon as we reached it!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quaint little cabin for a getaway! Far enough out of town to enjoy the peacefulness of the redwoods while also close enough to grab a bite to eat at a local restaurant or go on a hike nearby!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was perfect for us and very peaceful. So glad we stayed here for my 40th birthday! Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is phenomenal!! We will definitely be coming back here! So tranquil and it felt like home!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our stay. The cottages are breathtaking and in a serene forest. The place was clean and had good amenities. Great location for the redwoods.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"How cool to be able to stay in such a private place in the middle of the forest! James provided clear instructions, and the place was clean and comfortable. Not too far of a drive to cities/restaurants."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very impressive cottages! James is very talented and has created a haven in the redwoods. Very well appointed and clean.
So much to explore nearby! We enjoyed our stay and hope to return."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was absolutely beautiful- cute and neatly nestled in the trees, big windows. It was a perfect fit for 2 people, and exactly what we wanted it to be. If you're looking to extend a hiking trip in Jedediah Smith State Park by staying close by and feeling like you're still in the woods, this is the dream. We'll definitely be coming back"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin in the woods. Newly built. Spotless. Not even a spider web on the outside of it. No buggage to be found on the inside.
We really liked staying here. Some may think not having wifi would be an issue but I had 2 bars of AT&T and I was able to do what I needed to do. The diner in town knows James and said they were really nice people. Love the small town family feel. Everyone was cool and gave good advice for dope hiking.
Wish the bed was bigger, but not a deal breaker. We’ll most certainly be booking this spot again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A stop on our way down the coast and it was perfect!! Loved it!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean, fantastic communication!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place. Great host. If you are going to stay more than two days, keep in mind that they don’t have Wi-Fi and the area is out of network for phones."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! Would stay again!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This would have been a five star review if there was internet service. Loved the location, beautiful surroundings. Very clean and comfortable. I would add a couple of wine glasses to the pantry. Excellent stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little cabin and great host. Finding and communicating with host was easy. Highly recommend !
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely will stay here again! Amazing beautiful surroundings! yes there are neighbors but you still feel alone. Favorite place ever stayed.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a wonderful getaway in a beautiful setting. We loved being so close to Redwoods NP and being able to explore. The place was clean and had everything we needed.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place to stay in you wanna spend some time in the Redwoods!!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The place is beautiful, thru the windows you can see redwood trees - and they are amazing. The house is next to the street, but we did not hear a lot of cars. The house is totally enough for 2 people, but not for 4 adults - 2 of us were sleeping on a mattress (but is was super small), there is a coach as well, but super small and not comfortable for sleeping. Overall, I would suggest this place, becauce of the peaceful surrounding and redwoods."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay. Couldn’t ask for a better location.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Even better in person! Only positive surprises!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an incredible weekend here. Everything was clean and as expected, and the amenities had everything needed and a step beyond. Would definitely recommend staying here."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was absolutely wonderful! It was located in such a beautiful area, such amazing views. The place was very clean and I enjoyed the stay! Pictures don’t do this place justice and I will definitely come back. I’ve also recommended this to friends/family who will take a trip to the coast! James was super friendly and responded quickly. Couldn’t be happier with the stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnbs and this place was hands down the cleanest place I’ve ever stayed, 10/10 clean and neat."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean and private, quick drive into the Redwoods and Crescent City. Very peaceful cabin nestled in the trees."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"New little cabin. Decent cooking provisions. I checked in after a hike, in the dark, and had a hard time finding it - I had to re-read James’ given directions, he had said it was not clear on GPS. No wifi, but I had cell signal with ATT. It was peaceful and clean. Wish I had more time to have spent there on this trip."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was a very serene and beautiful location
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved our stay even though it was short! Will be booking again in the future!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely LOVED our stay at James place! It was very secluded and made us feel like we were deep in the Redwoods! The cottage was quant and adorable! Inside was very clean and all amenities nice. Would definitely stay here again if we come back to the redwoods!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want an experience around redwoods, this is definitely your place. It’s gorgeous"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute cabin in the redwoods! Perfect launch location to explore the forests with worlds tallest trees. We loved being surrounded by the trees and ferns. Everything was as described, be sure to bring your own salt, pepper, cooking oil and such if you want to cook meals. Shower was great. Overall a lovely spot!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot to stay! Going to the Redwoods every year is becoming a new family tradition for us, so we will most definitely be staying here again! The location is so close to Jedediah Smith SP, and not far from Crescent City so you get the best of both worlds!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean cabin about 20-25’ outside Crescent City. Not the most aesthetically pleasing (e.g. there’s a twin mattress just sitting on the floor), but it gets the job done as a place to sleep during a long drive. Area is very remote, but cabin isn’t particularly secluded because there are 8 others on the property within a few hundred yards."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this place. It was pretty quiet and felt like we were in a different place. Having some redwoods right outside our door was beautiful.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fantastic! Great location, super comfortable and easy check in made for an awesome trip."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location and privacy
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a magical little stay at this perfect little cabin! I loved the location and how secluded it felt! I was half expecting to wake up to a Sasquatch in the window! Such a beautiful stay and the fact that your so close to so many cool trails! James is a stellar host, I look forward to booking again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy stay. Close to the parks and crescent city. Would stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, perfect for 2 adults and 2 golden’s . The property was beautiful and very well kept. Perfect stay and will definitely book again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"James place was Amazing in so many ways. The location was wonderful, the place was so clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The Bed was VERY comfortable and we slept great. Loved the fact there was a split unit for Hear/AC came in handy. We really loved that it was close to town to grab a bite to eat and then head back. We are definitely coming back here in the near future. This is the place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cabin right in the redwoods. Very much in the woods but not far off the highway. Cabin looks brand new. Great stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You will not be disappointed staying here! This place was cleaner than any other Airbnb or hotel I’ve ever stayed in, and absolutely beautiful. Incredible value, lots to do nearby and the host responded very quickly with any questions I had. Already want to stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was accurately descriped by the listing. The bed was very comfortable. The cabin felt new which was nice.
It did feel a bit bare bones. The bedroom is too small to store your luggage so we had to have everything in the living room which made it feel a bit cramped.
Overall a positive stay."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Almost everything I might write is covered in previous reviews so nothing terribly original here. Fern hook cabins are essentially tiny homes in a second growth redwood forest. Tree huggers will be saddened by original growth stumps peppered throughout the woods. There are no basics like salt and pepper, a deck of cards, a fire pit or a television. There is not much to do in the adjacent communities after dark.
However the view is amazing and while you’re near a road and can hear the cars it feels very private. Pitch black at night, wonderful for rest. Mini split in unit allows you to fine tune the temps and the cabin was SPOTLESS and new. Great location for redwood hikes."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great stay at James's place. The location is super convenient to visit the Redwoods (specifically, the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park). The cabins are brand new and very peaceful. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed for a cozy night in the redwoods. Waking up to the glow in the forest through all of the windows is a memory I'll never forget. Kudos to James for this charming use of beautiful land."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this cabin! We were stopping through Crescent City on the way home from Oregon and wanted to stay near the redwoods. Location is absolutely perfect, with amazing hikes just a 5-10 minute drive down the road. Cabin was newly constructed, very clean and had all the basic amenities. We wish we had stayed more the one night and would be back given the opportunity."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our little cabin in the trees! Perfect location for our adventures to see the redwoods!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Not sure how long these little cabins have been around but everything feels new and nice. Worked well and provided a very cool experience. Would absolutely recommend. Thanks!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and relaxed
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful, cute, quaint house where you are surrounded by redwood trees and ferns everywhere! My new husband and I chose this Airbnb as the place to get ready for our elopement day, and we couldn’t have picked a better place! It was clean and had all the amenities we needed. Great stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful little cabin nestled amongst the redwoods. This property has everything you need for a lovely relaxing stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful cabin in a beautiful location. Everything was clean & easy to find. It will be about an hour from fern canyon & that & the drive to it is all a must see. From the cabin it will be a bit of a hike to other parts of Redwoods. It’s right by Jedediah smith state park which is small, but still beautiful."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just as pictured and the perfect distance into the redwoods to provide privacy while being just a short drive from town. Absolutely incredible!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love this cabin. I stayed here with my mother last December for my birthday and fell in love. I booked another trip that same month for September. It was a perfect getaway from the smoky skies where I live. Such a refuge. It's very clean, peaceful and serene. Close proximity to many outdoor adventures. Thank you for providing this comfortable and beautiful space. I can't wait to come back!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a truly beautiful setting, although there will be some road noise from the nearby highway. The cabin itself is extremely clean and neatly set up. The shower was excellent. There is no wifi, but we had good cell phone data connections. My only issue is that I am relatively short (5'2"") and had a challenge using the microwave and without a tall husband would not have been able to access some of the kitchen items."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a sweet place! Lovely secluded tiny cabins nestled perfectly in the woods. You can just tell they have spent some time and money to get this little community going. Beautiful loop road with what I think will ultimately have 9 cabins on it. They are spaced out enough where you get great privacy. Inside you will find everything you need, however it could use a ladies touch when it comes to decoration ;) Will definitely be back if we are in the area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for a cozy stay amongst the great outdoors. My husband and I had a great time.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved this little cabin so much. It was beautiful! Thank you!

Conveniently located near the Stout Grove trail which was also amazing."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little cabin is amazing. So comfy and cute. It has everything you need. Everything also seems brand new which was nice. This little cabin is in a perfect location. We drove from San Francisco and the location of the cabin allowed us to make many stops in the red woods and along the coast. If we ever come back, we’re definitely staying here again.
Thanks again for a great start to our honeymoon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at James’s cabin! It was cozy, clean and in a great location close to the Redwoods. Would absolutely recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful cabin in a beautiful setting! It looked so little from the outside, but the inside has so much space! Nicely decorated inside and so new and clean! Loved the redwoods around the property, and how pretty the view was sitting on the porch. We had everything we needed and James always answered any messsges promptly. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Very clean and private. Excellent value for the price. Highly recommended.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best experiences I have ever had with short term rentals. Perfectly built cabin in a serene setting.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Man, this place is cool. The cabin had everything we needed and it was awesome being in the redwood forest. The cabin was very private, but was also a great location for visiting the park. We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely worth it! Cabin was beautiful and it was as just like it was described. Loved it!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super cute and comfy! Just as nice as all of the pictures and really well insulated (cool when we wanted it & warm when you need it). Great base to explore the woods and a perfect stop for us on a trip down the coast.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Would give this location 10 stars if I could. Most serene setting you can imagine. Cabin is as clean as you could hope for and a beautiful hike is just 15-20 minutes away. Highly, highly recommended!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome little cabin right in the redwoods.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Fern Hook Cabin was a great place for us to spend the night after exploring Jedediah Smith State Park. The cabin was incredibly clean and the surroundings were very peaceful. Crescent City is a short drive away where we enjoyed dinner at the SeaQuake Brewery. James is a great host who made everything very easy for us!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was perfect. Secluded but close to town. Would recommend to anyone.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The location was amazing and it was the perfect amount of space.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Quaint place. Easy stay. Clean. Perfect for our road trip stay with easy access to the Redwood forests nearby.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is brand new and has a beautiful setting. The downside is the road noise. It’s quite loud when trying to enjoy coffee and the birds waking up while sitting on the front porch. It did not bother us once inside with windows closed. Maybe another cabin on the property would have less road noise.
To the positive! Redwood trees are super close by off Hwy 199. Great river access close by as well. The bed was super comfortable and the cabin is very clean."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Fern Hooks Cabins are in a great location, as they're very close to both Crescent City and Jedediah Smith State Park. The cabins are perfectly spaced, so it truly feels like you're the only cabin amongst the dense forest. The finishings are quality and they've done a really beautiful job with both the construction and the exterior landscaping. It was perfect for me and my two pups. I highly recommend these adorable little cabins for your Crescent City/Redwood adventure."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a convenient location! We were hiking in the park, which was literally 5 minutes down the road, if that. Super clean, and easy to check in and out.
There is some noise from the road, which is close to the property- though muted with the windows all closed."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a really great stay! I will say the kitchen is pretty bare, so bring salt and pepper, and anything else that could be considered extra. It was really peaceful and felt secluded. Near the hwy but you really can’t hear it!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish we had booked this place for more nights, it was perfect! The view of the trees all around was absolutely stunning."

,,,"We paid over $200 for the night, lost electricity, heat, hot water. Basic services but were not assisted or offered a refund. Stuff happens with the weather, but there should be some plan to help your guests if you are leasing your place. Especially at that price!"
,,,"We checked in and discovered a terrible deal-breaking issue for our stay (cockroaches and spiders, which the host admitted the previous guest had also complained about). The host came downstairs immediately, was apologetic and offered a 100% refund. We left. At this point I was understanding-he can’t control a bug BUT he can control how he treats his guests.
Afterwards, he became very insistent via messaging that I cancel the listing (which would penalize my account) instead of him taking the “ding from Airbnb”. He then told me he has “had many guests do this”. Here’s the thing—if I had cancelled, I wouldn’t be able to leave this poor review. By him making any guest that has a bad experience cancel on their own, it prevents all of us with bad experiences from being able to share and keeps his review score perfect. Buyer beware!!! I had to involve Airbnb to get a refund since he wouldn’t process it on his own for us as he had promised in-person."
