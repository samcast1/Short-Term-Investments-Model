2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find in the heart of Fells point. Was perfect little place for a family get together for my daughters graduation. We were able to spread out, hang out with a couple of friends for a little graduation gathering. It was perfect. We had everything we needed in the kitchen. The rooftop was an awesome place to sit and just chat, it is at the very end of the busy streets for Fells point so the upper bedroom you could hear the noise and the band playing so if you’re a light sleeper sleep in the basement bedroom. but will absolutely stay there again. Great morning walks around the harbor."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and very big place - 3 levels - great rooftop deck and awesome location in heart of Fell's Point. Clean and quiet and spacious, easy and free parking on the street. We were in and out a few times and found parking right in front.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this fully loaded Airbnb in Baltimore's Fells Point, and it exceeded all expectations! The location couldn't be more perfect – right in the heart of everything, yet still tucked away for a peaceful retreat. The attention to detail in the amenities made our stay incredibly comfortable, and the space was thoughtfully designed to comfortably accommodate four guests. From the cozy furnishings to the well-equipped kitchen, every aspect of our stay was thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a fantastic stay in Baltimore!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Two of us had a lovely week's stay at Martin's house in Fell's Point. His home is very comfortable and clean with all amenities. The rooftop deck was an extra treat. Martin was prompt, friendly, and helpful in all communications. The location was prime Fell's Point, just a half block from piers and water views, with restaurants, shops, Broadway market, all around. A fabulous bakery Sacre Sucre just a few doors down, and another, Pitango, right across the street. Martin's place has become our new favorite spot to stay while visiting Baltimore, and we look forward to being there again."

Martin's a great host. Provides timely responses and easy to understand instructions. He's kind and expresses gratitude. I would definitely book his place again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sisters & I were looking for a place to stay in Baltimore for a girl's get together. Martin's place was perfect!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Martin’s place! The place was beautiful, from the exposed brick walls to the roof top patio with string lighting, it was exactly what we were hoping for in Baltimore. Check in was a breeze. We arrived a little late and were super hungry, and there were little bars and restaurants all around the immediate walking area, which was perfectly convenient. We ate breakfast each morning at the bakery/cafe directly across the street with a water view and it was perfect in every way. We spent our days there sightseeing, visiting the aquarium, and enjoying the multitude of delicious restaurants nearby. We ended our days relaxing in the jacuzzi bathtub and sipping wine on the rooftop to the beautiful city view. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and plan to revisit the area — and now we know exactly where we’ll stay.
Thank you Martin for the hospitality and the wonderful Airbnb!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed in ALOT of places in the greater Baltimore area. And this place is probably “thee” best locations I’ve ever stayed. It’s in the heart of fells point, quiet neighborhood , decent parking, close enough to be in the mix of things, but far enough to rest without the noise of the bar crowds. The beds are comfy, the place was clean,, I highly recommend!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall we had a great long weekend at Martin’s place to celebrate our anniversary. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again. The location would be hard to beat. Some noise from local nightlife, but it didn’t bother us. The place was perfect for our needs."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Martin’s place looked just like the pictures. It was very nice! There was plenty food options and other places near by in walking distance. We enjoyed our stay. My only complaints would be that there was a few strands of hair on one of the towels that were hanging for us to use and when we turned the jets on in the jacuzzi there was a side that dirt came out of so there were some dirt bubbles and dirt on one side of the jacuzzi so we decided not to use it unfortunately. The shower was great though! Other than that no complaints, everything else was clean!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place and host
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd stay at Martin’s place. Great location in the heart of Fells Point. But in a nice quiet side street. Couldn’t be any closer to restaurants and nightlife. Would love to return with warmer weather to really enjoy the rooftop deck and beautiful views! House had everything you could need and very clean!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay. The house is beautiful, the location is excellent, Martin did a really good job."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location , welcoming house, ideal to stay in Baltimore."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Martin's place was great! My parents and I were in town for a quick overnight before an important doctor's appointment the next morning at Johns Hopkins. The location was so fantastic, and we lucked out and got a parking spot right out front, and Martin provided a parking permit which was very helpful. The home is lovely, clean, and comfortable. The upstairs shower was awesome. The place was as described and exactly what we needed for the quick trip. The neighborhood is pretty incredible - we couldn't believe how many amazing restaurants were super close, within half a block of the house. We had dinner at Penny Black which we absolutely loved. Despite it being a rainy during our stay, I loved walking around the neighborhood and grabbing tea and a cookie at the bakery across the street. I could hear loud music thumping late into the night from somewhere nearby, but I expected that given the vibrant location. I would definitely return to this spot on a future trip to Baltimore."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Easy rental. Would definitely stay there again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location in Fell’s Point, very walkable, close to great restaurants, nightlife, and bars.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place right by the water and within easy walking distance to all the great restaurants and attractions. Martin is super nice, respectful, and helpful. I will definitely stay here again. Five stars!!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Martin’s home offered everything our family needed. Our kids had the basement bedroom and bath, we used the upper level bed and bath. We were even able to use the rooftop, which we didn’t expect in December. It was fantastic!!! Martin’s home is clean and well appointed.
To help other travelers, I will mention that the street was loud. This is not at all Martin’s fault or anything he can control but I wish I could have known. The area is home to multiple bars and clubs. While we couldn’t hear the establishments, from 11p-3a every night the street noise of cars, folks talking, music from cars, was a disturbance. For folks visiting for the purpose of nightlife or who are accustomed to city vibes this may not matter. As an aside, the basement bedroom was quiet. We only heard the revelers up in the upstairs bedroom. So a couple traveling alone could just sleep in the basement, which is what we plan to do if/when we venture back sans kids. We still had a great visit!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Martin's place. We loved the space and all three floors, plus the awesome roof deck. The big tub was our favorite part! The location was prime; amazing bakery, nice shops, and a really terrific farmer's market. Thanks so much!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had the best week here lovely I highly recommend the only problem is you won’t want to leave it’s just that great
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin is a stellar host! We were in town for my son's graduation at MSU! It felt like he was just as excited as we were! We have found our forever home away from home. though my son has graduated, we are trying to find new reasons to visit Baltimore just to stay in his place! Thanks for being great Martin!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks Martin for the great stay in Baltimore! Perfect location, clean and cozy!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Martin was a very responsive host! We loved every minute of the stay. The neighborhood is so beautiful with the water right in walking distance. Easy access to everything around but tucked away in a peaceful location! Definitely recommend 10/10.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Martins place was perfect! Great bakery across the street and lots to do and see in Fells Point and the surrounding area!! The house was clean and super homey! I will stay again for sure!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Made our first trip to Baltimore a great one!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Martin’s place checks all of the boxes. I’ve been to many bnb’s between Fells Point and Canton, and this is by far the best. There’s a reason it’s 4.99 stars as of the time of this listing.
Location is perfect. Walking distance to great restaurants, cool bars, the Harbor, and even a killer cafe/bakery on the corner.
House itself is clean and tidy. Beds are very comfy. Internet TV is an incredible plus. Throw blankets to use. Go up to the rooftop for an absolute treat of an experience with a great view of the Harbor.
Martin is a great host and a real gentleman. He was a great communicator and very kind. Got to meet him in person for a couple minutes, and just the epitome of accommodating.
I will always try to stay here in the future when I come to town."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful home in a wonderful location! It was our wedding night and the entire visit was lovely. Thanks Martin!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place in a great location! There is a lot of foot traffic so you hear random conversations while sitting in the living room, but it wasn't intrusive. The area is so conveniently placed right on the waterfront in a great neighborhood. We were able to walk and enjoy a variety of places with delicious food. We especially enjoyed sitting in the sun on the rooftop patio with breakfast and coffee.
Martin was very responsive and kind in his communications. We arrived very late on our first night and the instructions that had been provided made getting in and navigating the house super easy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Martin’s townhome. It is a fabulous location and walkable to all restaurants and shops in Fells point. Parking was easy which is great because that can be a hassle in this neighborhood . The house was very clean and had just about everything you need for your stay. There is bakery and wine bar directly across the street so from your morning coffee to your evening glass of wine - this home has it all! Would definitely return!!
Special note: it is in the heart of a bustling neighborhood , so outside noise can be a factor, but for us, we just loved being in the heart of such a beautiful and charming area. Martins place is a real gem!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was in the heart of fells point. The unit was just as described and fit our needs perfectly. Martin was a great host. The rooftop deck was great, and the place was clean and new. I would strongly recommend looking into this unit if you stay in the Fells point area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful location and very clean home. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and great host!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Martin, thank you for sharing your home with us! We had a wonderful time in Fells Point. The location was perfect! Lots to do! We will miss our morning walk enjoying the city life and smelling the freshly baked bread along Aliceanna Street. Whole Foods was within walking distance. Parking was challenging along our street but if you circle the block a few times you can usually get a spot close by. The beds were a little firm for us but having the additional quilts really helped with additional ‘padding’. Loved being able to watch movies without using our login credentials. The kettle was perfect for hot tea and my hubby loved your coffee maker! The deck is fabulous and the view incredible. The master bathroom is great especially the jacuzzi and the massager head in the shower. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was excellent! Martin was very accommodating with check-in/check-out due to airline changes! Martin’s place is a real gem! We look forward to staying here again when we return!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best location! Martin was a wonderful host. The home was perfect. Very clean and well maintained. We will be back for sure.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy to find, excellent location, very clean, comfortable, well stocked home. The coffee shop across the street has great coffee and amazing baked goods. Some really cool places to grab a drink or have a great meal. Easy to walk and 2 blocks from the water taxi. It’s a popular area and Parking is a little tough sometimes but we found a spot pretty quick just circle the block a couple times. Highly recommend this house to anyone visiting the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spectacular place in every sense of the term. Comfortable condo, spacious, light, and airy. Everything is so well-kept. The rain showers were squeaky clean and super relaxing, and the split floor plan was perfect for our group of 4. The rooftop was a beautiful touch, and the location could not have been better. 10/10 would recommend. Hope to return again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This townhouse was amazing. Beautiful and perfect for two couples to share. I was here in business and the cost saved us hundreds. The location is perfect to all restaurants and bars on Thames st. Martin was responsive and great.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely location and accommodating host! Would absolutely stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can not say enough about this amazing property! Martin’s home is a must-stay if you are coming to Baltimore!
Location is unmatched - right in the action in Fells Point so you’ll have plenty to do/see while you are here. Coffee, restaurants, bars and shops are within 500 feet of the location. We parked our car the day we arrived and it sat until we left.
Property is clean, decor is well thought of and stylish. There was nothing we needed or would have wanted to have as an amenity. We were visiting for a girls trip so we really appreciated the large stand alone walk-in closet on the second floor and giant bathroom to get ready in! The best part however was the amazing rooftop with unmatched views! We spent hours there enjoying conversations and watching the sun set/rise. If this property is available the next trip to Baltimore we will be booking it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin's place was just as expected - squeaky clean in a great section of town with everything in walking distance. We even walked to the Inner Harbor! But then got the water taxi back to within a block of the house. The rooftop patio was a neat space with warm lights and a table and chairs. Not an amazing view, but not a terrible one, either. We could see water from up there. Martin's communications were prompt and instructions were very clear."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was better than the photos! Beds were comfortable, well stocked kitchen, and the shower was awesome! We were right in the middle of all that Fells Point offers, but quiet at night. We will definitely stay here next time we visit Baltimore. Love the rooftop! Thanks, Martin, for sharing your home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My dad and I stayed at Martin's townhome in Fells Point for a couple of weekday Orioles games. Martin was an excellent host throughout. He accommodated our early flight and allowed us to check-in early despite having guests from the previous evening. The townhome is centrally located with many bars and restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood has a really cool vibe and always felt safe. No problems getting Ubers or taking the water taxi which is located nearby. The townhome is newly renovated and all of the amenities are as described. If I'm ever back in Baltimore, I would certainly stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Martin’s place and our time spent there. The location in Fell’s Point is perfect - easy walks to great restaurants and things to see and do. The parking pass was a wonderful help, we never had difficulty finding a spot on the street. The house is spotless, comfortable, and very nicely updated. The upstairs bed was comfortable, and the upstairs bathroom is gigantic and very well appointed. The upstairs was a little warm thanks to Mother Nature, but it was never a problem. As others have noted, this place is right in the middle of the Fell’s Point nightlife, so you will hear some people in various states of revelry. If you need complete peace and quiet, it may not be ideal for you. If you like people watching/listening and don’t mind a little commotion, this place is ideal. We would definitely stay at Martin’s place again."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Martin and his Fells Point home are wonderful! It was a five star experience all around with two exceptions. The top floor was a bit hot (Martin offered to come and show how to fix the AC radiator when I mentioned it to him) and the street can be loud at night (we had to call the cops because a group outside was super loud. Both of these things - Baltimore summer heat and party summer nights - are out of Martin’s control.
Would highly recommend to anyone !"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was exactly as described. Great for two couples. Will definitely try to return again. Couldn’t ask for a better location. Parking pass included has a fantastic plus!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in the heart of Fells Point. Martin's place was clean and as shown in the photos. 5 stars -- would be happy to stay again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin's charming house in the heart of Fell's Point was a perfect retreat for my wife and me. We enjoyed two delightful nights exploring the vibrant neighborhood and witnessing an exciting Yankees vs. Orioles game at Camden Yards. The immaculate house provided all the essential amenities, and Martin's thoughtful provision of a parking pass secured us a spot right in front for the entire weekend.
The rooftop was a highlight, offering a lovely view as we savored our morning coffee from Daily Grind. Our Inner Harbor excursion on game day was effortless, thanks to the nearby Baltimore Water Taxi.
We truly enjoyed Fell's Point with its enchanting shops, lively bars, and delectable restaurants. As a lesbian couple, we always research our travel destinations and were thrilled to find Fell's Point to be a diverse and welcoming community, allowing us to stroll around and feel safe.
Thank you again, Martin. If we return to Baltimore, we will undoubtedly choose your inviting home once more."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our overnight stay at Martin's home was wonderful! The home was exactly as pictured and had everything we needed. The whole place was very clean, the beds were comfortable, the water pressure was perfect, and the living room was a cozy place to hang out. The neighborhood is walkable and the house was close to many restaurants, bars, and small shops. We only wished we had stayed more than one night! We had the opportunity to meet Martin at the end of our stay and he was very friendly and accommodating. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Fells Point we highly recommend staying at Martin's home, and we look forward to future stays!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin’s home is a great oasis in the Fells Point area. As someone who spends a lot of time in hotels and air bnb’s, I am very particular and it was great to see Martin is as well. His home is located in the perfect place on the street, plenty of parking available in front of the home and he provides the necessary parking pass. The area is quiet but there is plenty of activity so you do not feel isolated if traveling alone. Martin gave excellent information about accessing the home, very detailed information to make you feel at home and is not overbearing. The home set up is perfect if traveling with a family or friends/colleagues. Great water pressure, cold A/C, and iron and ironing board (necessary for me). He provides ample towels and bed linens, laundry detergent, wipes, paper towels, etc to last your entire stay. High end appliances and stoneware in the kitchen and an overall great environment. I will definitely stay here again. A+Thanks again Martin."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Liked the variety of restaurants and coffee shop nearby. Very lively neighborhood on Friday and Saturday nights.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a lovely stay at Martins place! There had been some power issues in the area and Martin was extremely proactive in making sure I was informed of the power status and worked with me every step of the way to ensure it was a smooth check in and a comfortable stay! The place was exactly like the pictures, everything was clean and had great furnishings! The area was very nice with cafes and restaurants within walking distance on beautiful cobble stone streets. I would highly recommend anyone visiting the area to stay here and would gladly come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Martin is a FANTASTIC host with a great place in Baltimore.
My teens loved staying there and the layout gave them just the right amount of space to relax after a day of sightseeing.
The home looked just like the photos. The entire space was very, very clean. The kitchen was stocked with all the utensils and dishes one might need.
Plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance, too!
Best of all, Martin was quick to respond with helpful answers when needed."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I LOVE Martin’s place and highly RECOMMEND his place. The terrasse view is amazing! And the Jacuzzi! The neighborhood is one of the best in Baltimore City. I got the chance to see Martin as I was leaving and he was super friendly!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Fells Point. The home was lovely and the rooftop was nice! Martin communicated effectively on what to expect.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin's home was AMAZING! Sparkling clean, well furnished and decorated, and in a wonderful location. Would absolutely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous place to stay and so clean and easy to communicate with Martin. He was so responsive when my friend and I needed more hangars and he brought them over so fast. The rooftop patio area was unique and it was very nice to just plug in the soft glow patio lights in the evening and enjoy the view. The WiFi for the TVs throughout the home provided very good speed for streaming Netflix, YouTube etc. Pictures accurately show the home. The main level has living room, kitchen and a half bath and downstairs is a bedroom and full bath and upstairs a MBR and bath with separate shower and jacuzzi. The location is very convenient to the thriving Fells Point area and we enjoyed the water taxis access, restaurants and theater there. A bakery and cafe right across the street had great breakfast foods too. All in all, we appreciated Martin’s professionalism. The waters in the fridge so much appreciated too. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was kept in great order and host was responsive.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great Location and nice place. Would definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin’s place was immaculate. Beautifully decorated w/ top of the line finishes. The rooftop overlooking the harbor was a plus. The location is central to Fells Point and very walkable. Be aware that the neighborhood can get very noisy late at night — so if you’re a light sleeper, choose the bedroom in the basement. And consider bringing your own pillow(s) if you want to avoid a stiff neck when you wake up. The pillows in the unit are rather bulky and have very little give. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Martin's place exceeded expectations!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spotless well appointed property. Great location and a very responsive host! Can’t wait to come back and stay here again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had such a great time visiting Baltimore Harbor!! Martin’s place is right in the heart of Fell Point with several choices of restaurants/bars! The place was clean and comfortable! Would highly recommend this place to anyone!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Martin was very responsive. Excellent location and updated interior. Minutes away from the water, attractions, and restaurants."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place right in Fells Point. It was spotless, and Martin was a great host. I loved the fact that one bedroom was in the basement, so it was quiet for sleeping, despite being right in the thick of things. Definitely would stay there again!!
Also, loved sitting on the rooftop deck in the morning!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Martin was an excellent host. He was very responsive when we had some trouble, and he always reminded me that he's always there to help.
The location is excellent, right close to the water, and in front of a cafe. The bath and rooftop are extremely nice addition to make the stay special. It was for my parents visiting, but Martin's house made them want to live here."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin was a wonderful host! The house is beautifully maintained and in a great location walkable to lots of bars, restaurants and shops. Martin was very responsive. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, excellent host! Fells Point is a fantastic location with walkable coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and shops by the waterfront, and Martin's place right in the heart of it. The house was very well stocked except for facial tissues - orherwise had everything. Martin was helpful, proactive, and responsive. Light sleepers should be prepared to sleep in the basement bedroom because the upstairs master gets a lot of noise from the surrounding nightlife, but it's worth it to be in the heart of all the action. we loved relaxing on the rooftop deck morning and night."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Airbnb in a great location. Martin was extremely responsive aswell.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin's place is a wonderful spot to stay in for touring all that Baltimore has to offer. We were able to park our car and walk to all the major attractions. The roof top deck was a beautiful spot to see the harbor.
Martin was very quick to respond to any of our concerns.
Fells point can be a noisy area at night. Bring earplugs."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely and cozy stay. Location is perfect. Had some clubbers disrupt us during the night but other than that WE LOVED IT!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing time loved the location and hospitality
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin's place was fantastic. Close enough to the inner harbor to be convenient, but just far enough away to not be noisy all night long. The house was very clean with nice modern furniture. Lots of amenities were available, and best of all the space was not cramped like some locations can be when a host tries to have to much furniture in the house. Martin was very responsive and helpful anytime I had questions. I definitely recommend staying at his place."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were traveling with our teenage son and Martin's place was the perfect spot for us since we were in Baltimore for 5 days. The layout, beds, bedding, 2.5 baths, location, parking pass, kitchen, washer/dryer, cleanliness, and over all quality of everything in the home made it so comfortable and relaxing to live in. The location felt safe, lively, and desirable due to the easy access to everything you would ever want to walk to while visiting Baltimore. Martin is a a conscientious and great host. We had an excellent stay!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin was very responsive. Answered every question we had. The townhouse was spotless from the basement all the way to the roof deck. Two person soaking tub was great for me and my wife. Parking was a bit of a challenge, but we got lucky each time. Would definitely go back there if in Baltimore area again. ! Best Air BnB experience I’ve had."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin’s home was great! Awesome location, close to everything in Fell’s Point! Very clean and well thought out! Everything you’d need was taken care of! Martin was a great host! Hoping to be a return guest!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Martin is the Ultimate Host! His home is absolutely beautiful and in the best location. He did more than most hosts ever do with perks in the bathrooms down to water in the fridge. If I could rate him more stars I would because everything from checking in to leaving was perfect. We loved the place so much we stayed an extra day and Martin was just so accommodating about the whole situation.
Martin, thank you for making our weekend in Baltimore absolutely special. You really have a Gem. We can not wait to return!
Best regards,
Shalyssa"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could rate this place 6 out of 5 I would! It’s perfect! I’m in Baltimore frequently for work and this was definitely the best place I stayed in! Martin is a great person- went above and beyond- very responsive host. I would have extended but a lucky person got to me before I could! Close to everything, sidewalks clean and safe, parking was so easy and pass is provided. Very comfortable place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kenneth was a fantastic host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place looked exactly how the host described it. My parents and i loved the neighborhood because it was easy to walk to most restaurants we were going to. Not finding a parking next to the house was the only ick but did not bother us so much because it allowed us to explore more the surroundings. Overall we had a great experience and we'd highly recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our host was super responsive and check in was super easy. Parking is free in the neighborhood which was great. The place had everything we needed and was super walkable.
The beds were very comfortable! The rooftop deck is awesome!!!
People in the neighborhood were very friendly. We felt very safe walking around."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our visit was delightful and I and only wish that we had more time available to us for a longer stay in this idyllic place. The interior space space was appointed in a contemporary, stylish and welcoming way. The exterior terrace/roof afforded a lovely view of the harbor beyond a magnificent tree. The terrace also was beautifully arranged for day or evening occupancy. Overall the visit was a memorable one for us and we look forward to returning again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Felt right at home at Kenneth’s place, super clean and was easily accessible"

2024-03-01,4,Group trip,"Kenneth was very responsive. The home was okay, clean for the most part and there was a small convenience store a few blocks away. The biggest issue I had was parking was very difficult to find, I drove around a few times to find a parking spot. And the listing says 6 can sleep in the home but it really should say 5, including a twin size air mattress."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kenneth was a good host and the home was a unique find. It had everything we needed and perfecf location. I would definitely book this place again in the future.

2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We had a nice stay at Kenneth’s place. The house is in a great location and we didn’t have much trouble with street parking. There were a few things that were inconvenient- no dish soap, no hand towels (just very small wash cloths or large bath towels), and the dining table had noticeable debris on it, meaning it had not been cleaned - but overall, the space functioned well for our needs."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Kenneth’s place! It looks just like the pictures. Kenneth was very responsive and helpful! Would definetly stay again.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in town a couple of days to visit a friend in ICU at John Hopkins. Kenneth's home was a nice, quiet, relaxing place to unwind in the evening. The place is immaculate, has everything you need and tastefully decorated. The neighborhood is near everything, very safe and really cute. Unfortunately, it rained the entire time so we didn't get to enjoy the rooftop, maybe next time!
Thanks Kenneth"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kenneth was an extremely thoughtful host. He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and we are very appreciative of it.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Place was amazing. Host was very helpful. Place looks even better than the pictures. Only issue is you can park for free on the street, but you have to walk about 5 or more blocks due to there not really being parking available on the same street/in front of the home. Overall excellent experience."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time in Baltimore. We chose a terrific AirBnb. The rooftop patio was cool! The place was spotless clean,Relaxing and welcoming. Kenneth’s place was close enough for us to walk to Fells Point and enjoy some amazing restaurants and and cool spots
Parking was tough at times.
We did use Lyft a couple of times. We used Lyft at night so we would not lose our parking space.
Kenneth was responsive and let us check a little early.
We left a couple of things and Kenneth reached out and sent them UPS to us!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall we had a great experience. Clean, cozy, comfortable. One negative was that the weather was too cold to enjoy the welcoming rooftop deck......Location was a primary factor for us as we have family less than 1/2 mile away and found the neighborhood very walkable and safe. Look forward to coming back again in 2024!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent location
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice 👍

If you enjoy delicious Thai food you’ll be happy to know that there’s a restaurant directly across the street. Kenneth’s communication was a 10/10!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Kenneth. The space was beautiful and easy to access.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming and Convenient: A Baltimore Delight
Our stay at Kenneth’s place in Baltimore was exceptional. Nestled in a fantastic neighborhood, it’s centrally located yet remarkably peaceful, offering the best of both worlds. We were just steps away from great dining, the scenic harbor, and lovely parks.
The house itself impressed us with its thoughtful design and comfort. It’s equipped with everything we needed - from entertainment options with great TVs to practical needs like a well-functioning laundry room, efficient heating, and pristine bathrooms. The beds were a dream to sleep in.
A special mention must go to the rooftop deck - a serene spot to enjoy some quiet moments. Kenneth’s attention to detail and guest comfort really shone through, making our stay both memorable and comfortable. We’re already looking forward to coming back. This place is a true Baltimore gem!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kenneth was a great host, he responded quickly to questions I had and gave great recommendations for restaurants that fit the needs of my family, especially my parents who are in their 80's. The place was beautiful and in a nice neighborhood. There are several restaurants with different cuisines that one can walk to. We took a walk around the area, people were out walking their dogs and everyone was very friendly. The roof top patio that is part of Kenneth's place is a wonderful area to hang out and have a cocktail or two. In fact, if you run out of your favorite adult beverage, a wine, beer and spirit shop is a short walk away. If we end up in Baltimore again, we will certainly try to book with Kenneth again! He's a super host for sure."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great deal price wise. Everything was exactly as advertised by the owner and he was completely professional to communicate with.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great host! What a cool place! It was phenomenal. I came into town on business with another filmmaker and immediately when we arrived at midnight we wanted to watch a movie. The host was up late enough to help us locate the TV remote so that we could change the settings because we are so picky. The tea and the bedrooms, the rooftop and the lighting, every aspect was ideal. I wish I owned a place like that! I would happily return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was so nicely decorated and very clean! We felt right at home and it was perfect for our needs. Would highly recommend!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at Kenneths place. It looks exactly like the pictures and is such a great location. We were walking distance from a ton of great food and found parking easily around the property. The beds were very comfortable, and we especially enjoyed the roof deck. We would definitely stay here again!!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and clean spot! Exceeded our expectations :) Love the decor and all the amenities from lint rollers to a few snacks and teas!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the space! Very clean. Loaded with amenities. Stay here.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kenneth was a great host! The house was very comfortable, tastefully decorated, and well appointed. This is a good location within walking distance to many places to eat (B'More Licks!) as well as Patterson Park. Street parking wasn't an issue and we would definitely stay there again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this place booked last minute at 1am the day before and he responded right away! The house was just like the pictures and I got in town so late because the weather he offered me a later check out time for free. It was nice and like home I will definitely stay again. My only complaint was parking but it is better during the day than night next time I will park and Uber around or ride a scooter. The last people that rented probably forgot to cover the chairs back up outside so unfortunately they were wet but the scenery was still nice10/10
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,great space.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place.
Very friendly host."

location is centralized to restaurants. The property was maintained and was very clean.
This host responded right away to my questions."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great weekend stay here. The place looked just like the pictures and description. We had everything we needed. Everything was clean and tidy. The location was great as we could walk to restaurants, the local ice cream shop, and the local park. Parking was not an issue and that was a big draw for us. When we wanted to go to the Inner Harbor, we just called a lyft and saved the hassle of parking there. The host was very responsive anytime we had a question and even reached out with helpful information proactively. The rooftop deck was very peaceful. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Kenneth for the great stay. This was our first visit to Baltimore and we absolutely loved it!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was amazing - even better than the pictures. The roof top deck was so relaxing after a long day driving to Baltimore. Beds and furniture were inviting and comfortable. Loved all the “smart home “ features as well as all the little touches that made our stay so easy. Coffee/ tea bar, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in each bathroom . Our host Kenneth was very responsive and so easy to work with . We will definitely be returning !!"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall our stay was very good. It was my son, my husband, my mom, step-dad and me. It was very clean and met our needs. It was nice that the home came with a variety of extras like laundry soap. The place is smaller than we thought. My sister lives in the area and we assumed it was about the same. It is noticeable narrower. Made it difficult with 5 people.
There were a few safety things to keep in mind with young kids. Base of the stairs has open staples and there is only a hand rail on one side. It is completely open on the other side.
Would we stay here again? Yes. It met our needs with being close to the park. If there weren't the safety issue it would have been a 5 star stay for us!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This sweet little townhome was absolutely perfect! It’s gorgeous (smells AMAZING) and everything was so comfortable. I felt right at home and the location was great. I can’t say enough good things about this place!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had an amazing stay, the photos actually match the interior of the home.
I loved that for me!

Prime location central to everything!! It was only a 5 min ride to get around. The pictures do no justice, it looks and smells amazing.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for 4 nights, and for a family of 3, it could not have been more convenient! The living and sleeping areas are well done, the kitchen is well stocked with utensils and cutlery, the bathrooms are not tiny. We were a bit nervous about finding street parking, but managed to find something within a block of the house every time. Kenneth is incredibly responsive and very kindly accommodated an earlier check-in time. We'd definitely stay here again."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Kenneth was very communicative and helpful! Great experience!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, this place was such a great fit for us! We were passing through and needed a place with room to spread out, fast WiFi, and somewhere to stretch our legs after a long drive. Not only did Kenneth’s place meet our needs, but it was also clean and comfortable and well-designed for a stay of any length.
Would’ve worked well if we needed to pick up groceries and cook, but we just grabbed some great Thai food from across the street! Whether you have a few hours or a few days, be sure to walk to Patterson Park and relax as you watch the ducks. There are also rental scooters all over the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were super impressed with this Airbnb! It was clean, homey, and stylish! Once we got there we were bummed we were only staying one night since it was so nice. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in Baltimore!"

The property is beautifully decorated and you can tell that whoever decorated paid very close attention to detail. And there were so many nice touches that really made you feel at home. I was a big fan of all the available cleaning products, even though the property was already very clean and smelled so nice!
The master bedroom and bathroom give you the, ""I'm on a vacation in a bungalow on an island vibe."" And the rooftop is wonderful! I can imagine staying up there all night on a perfect summer night.
I highly recommend this place for a stay and also if you're looking for a beautiful space to create content!! The aesthics are great for photo shoots and video content creation!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this beautifully decorated row house with a fabulous rooftop deck! Everything looks newly purchased and newly renovated - we were excited to find such a great place! The furnishings are so pretty, it made us feel like we were staying in a very nice, comfortable home rather than a rental. The kitchen was surprisingly large with beautiful countertops and top quality appliances. Both of the bedrooms and bathrooms are upstairs and the stairs are a bit narrow, which was not a problem for us at all but could be if you have mobility restrictions. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms very nice. It was definitely one of the nicer Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in, especially for such a great price!
Kenneth was a wonderful host, and we highly recommend this place. We’ll definitely book it again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The townhouse was beautiful just as described It will be my go to spot when I stay in the city. The host communication was on point and will definitely recommend.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"5***** all of the way. This location is as described: clean, spacious, private, and trendy. It is emmaculately kept and in a wonderful location (close to eateries and the park). Ken made sure that the entire process was smooth by ensuring that I had the code to check in and access to wifi. Fantastic communication. I did have to park a few blocks away from the townhouse, but it was worth it and I felt very safe in this area. I am visiting Baltimore for the 1st time and I was able to get to all of my planned locations within 10 minutes . A++"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place, very high quality, would definitely recommend & come back. 10/10"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing experience, beautiful sunset and drinks on rooftop."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The houseboat is very nicely appointed and is well-situated in Baltimore Harbor with views in every direction. Brian was very proactive with communication to ensure that we had a good experience. If staying in a houseboat is a bucket list item as it was for us, this is a great find and a unique experience."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A real unique experience that was great for quick trip to Baltimore. We enjoyed the views, proximity to restaurants and activities. The hosts anticipated our needs and had everything available and ready to go. Highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We are entrepreneurs who booked last minute to get some much needed work done away from home. Let’s just say we are now spoiled, as this experience set the bar HIGH! We were absolutely floored at how amazing our stay was. The boathouse was everything advertised and more, not to mention the 360 view was beautiful🤩
5 stars across the board😊 We will definitely book again. THANKS BRIAN!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique experience! The houseboat is one of a kind. Very clean, modern, and convenient location. Brian is a proactive and reliable host who provided helpful guidance throughout our stay."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The whole experience was impressive and more than lived up to our expectations. The features of the place were well appointed, the views, as well as the little details such as the rooftop heater and blankets made our stay a memorable one. Brian was responsive when we reached out and staff at the marina were accommodating and helpful. I would highly recommend Flohom."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing experience!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely be back! My wife and I loved our entire stay! Brian was wonderful to work with.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was simply beautiful! It was exactly as pictured, completely spotlessly clean, and even smelled amazing. The instructions for check in and out were very thorough, which was much appreciated, and it was all just so comfortable and perfect. My husband and I had a wonderful stay, and we would absolutely consider returning."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a gorgeous houseboat. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and very well appointed. Thoughtful touches throughout make the stay special--e.g., stainless steel chopsticks, battery-operated candles, wine fridge, and cozy wool blankets on the top deck. We cooked in (why eat out when the twinkling lights of the Inner Harbor are all around you), and the kitchen was well stocked with high quality pots, pans, appliances and dinnerware. The interior design is spectacular. We especially loved the shower!! Privacy shades throughout the boat make it easy to close off the view from outside to inside. We stayed overnight on a Saturday and the waterfront was very lively and fun to watch. Surprisingly, everything quieted down by about 10:00 p.m. (perhaps there is a noise ordinance on the harbor?) and it was very quiet to sleep overnight. Most of the boats in the marina were empty, but several friendly dock dogs passed by with their owners on Sunday morning. We loved Flohom 01!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brian was the perfect super host. Self-checkin and parking is super easy provided you read all the instructions. Communication with Brian was easy throughout our stay and he was extremely accommodating, which helped to make our stay enjoyable. The FLOHOM is an excellent lodging option when visiting Baltimore while on vacation or on a staycation . This luxury houseboat has all the amenities you could possibly need during your stay with the best panoramic views of the city’s Inner Harbor. The rooftop deck offers the best front row seat to the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets. There are a lot of special touches added to help make your stay memorable, to include an amazing FLOHOM playlist that you can easily stream from your smartphone to add to the ambiance of the FLOHOM experience. Highly recommend choosing Brian to be your host during your next trip to Baltimore."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Let me start off by saying, this home is immaculate! My biggest regret was; I only booked for one night. Moving forward, I will have to book two-four nights. The listing was just as pictured and the scenery is beautiful. This space provided my wife and with a just enough space for us to unwind and enjoy the views of the harbor. This place is five stars and will definitely book again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,I had a wonderful stay! The attention to detail is impeccable. You have EVERYTHING you need in Flohom! The place is so clean and looks just as pictured.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,W O W! Truly incredible. Comfort and luxury right on the water. This is the best waterfront stay in the city. Best sleep ever. Every detail has been considered. Amazing amenities. Roof deck is amazing. Even better than pictured. Such a unique way to experience Baltimore. Loved the 360 view from the middle of the harbor. Worth every penny.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing place. I will definitely be back. Completely worth the price. Just go for it. You'll love every second. Even down to the neighbors. Thanks so much Brian.!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the beautiful houseboat in Annapolis was an absolute delight from start to finish. This charming space, nestled on the tranquil waters, provided a serene escape from the bustling city life. We couldn't have asked for a more picturesque setting to unwind and recharge.
Brian, our gracious host, went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exceptional. From the moment we arrived, he warmly welcomed us, sharing his wealth of knowledge about the area and offering valuable insider tips on local attractions and hidden gems. His genuine hospitality truly made us feel like treasured guests.
We cannot recommend this Airbnb listing enough. If you're seeking a place of tranquility, with a host who embodies genuine warmth and hospitality, look no further than this beautiful boathouse in Annapolis. Our stay exceeded our expectations, and we left with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you, Brian, for sharing this slice of serenity with us. We hope to return someday soon."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything we hoped it would be. Such a lovely home
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Terrific location and excellent place to stay. Gerald was a great host. Everything was as advertised or better. Will definitely be looking to stay again. Thanks Gerald
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Gerald’s place with a colleague. We were in town for a conference and his location is fantastic. If you prefer an AirBnB versus a hotel, this place is minutes from the convention center and very walkable to other fun amenities like the aquarium, baseball, football stadiums, and food scene. Federal Hill was my favorite area to eat and it was a 10-15 minute walk south. Gerald was very responsive and proactively communicated with us before we arrived and before we departed to make sure everything was okay. The place feels bigger in person and was very clean. I was very comfortable hanging out in my room and working in the common area. One bedroom has a bathroom and the other has a bathroom in the hallway. All this to say that me and my colleague felt like we had our own spaces, which was great. I would stay here again the next time I visit Baltimore. Thanks Gerald!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place, probably one of the best all around options for a trip to Baltimore. Safe, quiet area near the Convention Center and baseball stadium, and across the street from Inner Harbor.
Two large bedrooms with comfortable foam mattresses and lots of extra pillows. Beautiful full kitchen with large stove/fridge, utensils/spices available, huge dining table. Several couches and TVs if needed for guests. Entire apartment and bathrooms were totally spotless, couldn't see even one speck of dust, seemed like a brand new place.
Host very polite and responsive as well. If I am in Baltimore again this is a go-to spot."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gerald's place truly exceeded our expectations. From the moment we stepped in, the warmth of the apartment made us feel right at home. The attention to detail was impeccable, and the kitchen was stocked with every imaginable item, making meal preparation a breeze. Without a doubt, I wholeheartedly recommend this unit to anyone seeking a wonderful getaway."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was a gem! Very meticulously kept and clearly well cared for by the owner. Well stocked kitchen, including a wine preserver 😉, nice linens and comfortable mattress. Very responsive and friendly host. Highly recommended from someone who rarely gives 5 stars!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this home for your stay in Baltimore. It’s an excellent, comfortable, safe and has easy access to all the sites nearby.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay a lot. Great and safe place for families and also businesses people. Unlimited supplies.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"What a find! This condo is a second home complete with all the extras, linens, cookwear, a great Sonos sound system, comfortable furniture, bidets, and more. The rooms do not have black out curtains but the harbor front wall is less than 2 blocks away. The parking pass allows you to park directly under the bedroom windows. The condo is walking distance to the convention center and baseball stadium and downtown, the area further south gets more residential and posh. this is Baltimore, there is construction and the homeless population has continued to grow. My coworker and I shared the place while were in town at the Orpheum and it really made every single day better for us. We appreciated all the comfy beds, great showers, great living space, and ease of getting in and out."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great place! The unit was perfect for four adults- 2 beds and 2 baths. Stocked kitchen and lots of extras. The dedicated parking spot and the two street passes were awesome. It was so nice knowing we always had a place to park at the end of the day- a luxury in Baltimore!!
Walkable to Oriels and Ravens as well as Inner Harbor and Federal Hill.
My daughter is going to Hopkins and this will be our go- to unit in the next few years."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were from Lubbock TX and heard a lot of not being safety city at Boltimore so safety was my top priority. I actually cancelled one of booking I made because location was changed after I booked and paid but this place was exactly same location as photo you see and even inside was exactly same as phot you see. Talking about 100% transparency!! We felt in love this place specially they have best bed. They are so comfortable and you can tell difference as soon as you laid down after long walking. I stayed couple of air&b place before but this place have bed bed mattress!!! Location was very good too. They are very close working to inner harbor area. We went for my God daughter’s graduation so we didn’t get to visit baseball field but it was very close to baseball field as well. Host was amazing. He was able to work with us check in and check out and gave us very clear direction so I have zero difficulties during my stay at this place and will go back for sure!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderfully comfortable, well-curated, and extremely well-located condo near the Inner Harbor of Baltimore. We slept well, had all we needed in the condo, and benefitted from excellent communication from our host, Gerry. We were in Baltimore with our two children, and the space suited us well, particularly having two bathrooms, a well-equipped kitchen, and ample seating for meals and relaxing. My kids have already asked us to consider renovating our bathroom to be more like the one in the condo: think great water pressure and a nicely set up master-shower.
We appreciated the on-site parking, keyless entry, smart home set-up, laundry, and sense of privacy. Though we were in a block of condos, we didn't hear any neighbors for the duration of our stay.
This is a second floor walk-up, which worked fine for us, but would be a consideration for anyone else. It is within walking distance to the Inner Harbor, Camden Yards, and Federal Hill (where we enjoyed a number of great meals).
On the whole, we couldn't recommend this place more highly. It was one of the nicest AirBnB we've stayed in."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a great appartment for a visit to Baltimore. We came to visit Comic Con and it is within walking distance of the Convention Center. it is also very near to the Football and Baseball stadiums.
In a 5 minute walk of the Inner Harbour, where you can see old ships, the aquarium and more.
it was great to have a private parking space so we didn't have a problem with the car.
the appartment was everything you see on the pictures. In a nice part of the town.
Very clean, all that you needed was there and more.
We loved the adjustable bed!
Also great was having the 2 bathrooms.
So if you want to visit Baltimore this is a great place to come!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Truly the Harbor Gem! Honestly, being able to reach Gerald so easily, the hospitability of his calls/texts, and the perfect home away from home, I couldn't ask for anything better. This was my first bnb experience and I just don't see how it could be any better - just perfect! Walking distance to all points of interest at the Harbor, Fells Point, Federal Hill, the Convention Center, etc... Just a perfect spot! Felt safe, neighbors were friendly, and parking was so easy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place stay. The location was perfect Inner Harbor and the surrounding communities and parking in lot was plentiful. It was clean and stylish and the mattresses were very comfortable. We hope to stay again on our next visit!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're two new empty nesters who came to Baltimore to visit our kids who live locally. Our experience in Gerald & Lana's lovely home exceeded expectations. Not only is their home beautifully decorated but it's functional and comfortable as well. Kitchen is well equipped, beds are super comfortable, and open living room area with large screen tv was perfect for hanging out with family. Location was very close to waterfront area and an easy drive to many great restaurants. A bonus was the gated parking area adjacent to the building (one car) and street parking passes (two cars). Baltimore city parking is headache without the passes. Gerald was an attentive host and responded immediately to any questions. We're looking forward to future visits to this home!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our accommodations were perfect for us. Great place and location, friendly people and access to so many options for dining and outdoor activities we needed during our business/conference stay. Relaxing to unwind in the lovely living spaces. Comfy bed; slept well. Everything we needed was thoughtfully provided. Entry access to the front door would be difficult unless stairs aren't an issue."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,lovely condo- nice area-beautiful amenities-- a fully enjoyable experience. we want to return for sure
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the condo for my son’s wedding. This was one of the best Airbnbs we have stayed at. The condo is exactly has pictured. The showers were wonderful, immediate hot water and fantastic water pressure. The bedrooms were lovely with enough storage space and tons of hangers. The kitchen has everything you would need for the stay. The AC worked great. The free parking was the icing on the cake. The location cannot be beat. Gerald was a wonderful host and easy to get in touch with. We would happily stay at the condo in the future."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We travel quite a bit, and often to Baltimore, and this is the best Airbnb we've stayed in. The home itself is incredible - beautiful, a great layout, and phenomenal amenities. The location is great - perfect for any activities in the harbor and perfectly located to get to either stadium. The proximity and ease of getting to Fed Hill is great too for going out before or after football games. Of particular note, the parking is very easy and spacious, which is great in and of itself. The bathrooms are beautiful and the showers incredible (exceptional water pressure), and both beds are very comfortable. Every element of the trip was great - from social activities to working from home."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just great
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This condo is 5 stars all around. Gerald communicated with me throughout my stay. The condo is very clean, super close to the inner harbor, and very affordable."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location and host is wonderful! Gerald is the perfect host and the apartment is everything we hoped it would be! Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gerald's Harbor Gem was a beautiful unit, very upscale and included great amenities. Gerald was an amazing host, very communicative, responsive, provided great recommendations, as well as very detailed check in instructions. The unit was in the perfect location and included parking which was very important. If I return to Baltimore, I would definitely return to this unit. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,The condo was very nice and close to Baltimore’s many attractions. Gerald was quick to respond to any questions we had and checked in during our stay to ensure the condo met our expectations. We’d definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Definitely lives up to its expectations! Great location only steps from the harbor. Easy parking options for the city. All the creature comforts of home! Responsive owners. We loved our stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was lovely and had everything we needed. The location was within walking distance of fantastic restaurants, sights and nightlife. The host, Gerald, gave great detailed instructions on everything we needed to know. Would stay again and highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a pretty great find and the host was a pleasure to deal with. I’d be happy to stay here again
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura's lovely home is tucked into the perfect corner of Little Italy within walking distance of anything and everything you could want. It also had everything listed and the some - a true ""what else could I need?"" spot."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Laura's place was exactly as described. Easy street parking. Clean and tidy. Very comfy bed. We enjoyed being able to leave our car and walk around town. Would definitely recommend, especially of you're attending a show at the Pier 6 Pavilion which is just 5 minutes walking distance."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place in an awesome location. Laura was great with responding and very accommodating with everything!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home, clean, and exactly as pictured. A lot to do in walking distance. Outdoor area was really nice, quiet area. Bed mattress is extra plush."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Laura’s place is charming out the kazoo. I felt like I was in a Parisian-designed home. The whole layout has great feng shui, and makes the space feel larger than it is. Parking was easy and the neighborhood felt safe. The location was walking distance to pretty much anything needed, including some nice late-night restaurants. Check-in and check-out was seamless, and Laura was kind, down-to-earth, and so responsive. I loved the 2pm checkout option, which was incredibly generous and a standout feature, since so many places push you out early, and this home is precisely the kind of place you want to spend as much time in as possible."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With its proximity to great restaurants, the Inner Harbor, and Fells Point, there is plenty to explore just steps away. The apartment is well-equipped for a short stay, and the attentive host ensures a comfortable experience from start to finish. If you're looking for a peaceful and convenient base in Baltimore, this is a good place to be."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Laura’s and it was a nice Air BNB! I personally like to have more details about where we’re going to be staying so some details for reference:
It is a smaller space, the couch is made of an interesting but itchy material, if you have sensitive skin be careful!
The kitchenette area is beautiful!! You may want to bring your own brita or buy water as Baltimore Water is not the best.
Water pressure everywhere was amazing, the shower gets very hot and it is so nice!!
The bed is cozy, it has a foam topper on top with a mattress protector. There is also luggage stands which is AWESOMS. There are also fans and a tv in the bedroom. It is wonderful.
The back patio was nice, it is shared just at an FYI.
Baltimore itself was Baltimore. The stairs to the door were dirty and had litter around it. The location was okay but there was the smell of weed from nearby homes and businesses.
The place was very nice overall, just wanted to add important details!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was one of our favorite AirBnB stays to-date. Beyond curating a beautiful-yet-inviting space, Laura was communicative both ahead and during our stay. The place was clean and—as Floridians who get cold if it dips below 80—we appreciated the additional blankets and towels. Laura is also proactive about soliciting feedback to improve future guests’ stays, which made us feel right at home. Last but not least: it’s a great location walkable to plenty of shops, restaurants, and attractions (including plenty of vegan options!)."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good location and very pleasant interior design. Would stay again
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. Walkable to Inner Harbor destinations and many great restaurants. The apartment is well-appointed and comfortable with economy of space. Host is responsive and easy to communicate with. Parking can be on-street, off street, or in public lot across the street (cheap on weekends)."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laura is a great host. Very responsive. Apartment was clean and comfortable. Neighborhood is perfect. Would definitely book again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the central location and quietness of the area. Little gem!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second time staying with Laura. The last time was about 6 months previous and we were relieved when we were planning to go back to Baltimore for work and we found her place was available again. The apartment is cozy and extremely well supplied. It's stylish and modern and very comfortable. The neighborhood is great too. Tons of great restaurants and bars and coffee shops. Whole Foods is nearby too. I highly recommend this for your stay.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura’s place was excellent. Great for a personal planning retreat, with tons of restaurants around, and only a 10 minute walk or less from many activities, including the National Aquarium!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, safe area, easy to get anywhere you need!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura’s apartment is so perfect. She has prime TV in both the bedroom and living room which is great. The kitchen has everything you could need including a small burner if you want to cook. There is even a wine cooler! It has super available street parking too and a free parking permit she gives you. I enjoyed my stay. Laura was also very responsive and generous to me. Great place, great host!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at 🥰
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable. Great bathroom. Well located. Easy access to everything walking. Easy parking in the street. Whole Foods 5 minutes away. Did not use Patio but would have in summer.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Had a great stay at Laura’s apartment during a recent work trip! The apartment is cozy and matches the description in the listing.

Very walkable area, close to lots of great restaurants! Would definitely stay again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great area to stay - able to walk to so many places! Great restaurants right around the corner, small neighborhood feel - can't go wrong. It was a great stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Cozy and quaint in the heart of Little Italy. It was the perfect retreat to head back to after long days being out and active!
Laura was an amazing host. Attentive, transparent, and accommodating. I arrived into the city much earlier than anticipated and long before the check-in time. Laura had informed me that the unit wasn’t ready yet for our stay, but was so accommodating to let me check-in early and drop bags off so I wasn’t traveling with them around the city until it was ready. Laura was prompt to respond to questions and made the stay here all the more enjoyable. I will be saving this one for when I travel to Baltimore in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for walking and exploring Baltimore! Laura was super responsive and helpful with check-in and parking. Space is cute and clean.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Laura's place is excellent. It is newly renovated and clearly has an interior designer's or artist's touch. It's a garden-level apartment, but it doesn't feel like one at all. Their is plenty of natural light and the apartment itself has lots of light tones that brighten the place up. They really make the most out of the available space with tons of creative storage especially in the kitchen and bathroom. My wife and I are thinking of finishing our basement at home and we literally took video of Laura's place to derive inspiration from. It's cozy, modern and comfortable. And the location is amazing. Parking was a breeze because Laura provided a parking pass for the street. At all times I was able to park right in front of the front door. And the house is in an incredibly walkable neighborhood close to restaurants, bars, coffer shops, grocery stores, you name it. Great, great value and I hope we can stay here again in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Location Location Location!!! Great place!!! Highly recommended. Walkable to all the sights and sounds.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little apartment in Little Italy in easy walking distance to Fells Point as well as to the Inner Harbor. Parking was exceptionally easy.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laura’s place was nice and efficient. She was professional and responsive. She lives upstairs but you would never know. The space is functional and you have everything you could think of. Now the only thing I’m not a fan of is the air conditioning is all in one.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location can't be beat! Super walkable and felt safe at all hours. The food choices are overwhelming; so many delicious options! We had a great stay at Laura's place, would stay again for sure!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for just the two of us. It’s small and super cute, exactly what we needed just for a couple of nights. It was very clean and newly renovated. Also super convenient staying here you can walk everywhere and there’s great food places all over! We really enjoyed our stay! And Laura was very friendly and flexible."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I love the apartment and the location. Check-in and Check-out ran smoothly.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming place, beautifully designed and in a great location."

- restaurants/grocery stores/coffe shops/bakeries/harbor within walkable distance"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! The location is wonderful. Easy and safe walk to Rams Head if you are in town for a show, lots of restaurants nearby, easy on street parking, and the bedroom is extremely quiet. Will definitely stay again if we are in town."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I, and our little dog had a very nice stay at Laura’s place. Cozy and comfortable is a good description. Attractively furnished and decorated, clean and very good floor plan that maximizes space. Modest kitchenette, but very functional. We made breakfast and lunch there every day during our visit. Very nice modern bathroom with a huge shower, and very comfortable bed. Location was terrific, just one block from the main restaurant row in Little Italy. Also easy walking distance to the Inner Harbor and Fells Point. We were in Baltimore for medical appointments at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and it was an easy drive of less than 10 minutes. Parking was never a problem, we always found a spot on the street within a few steps .
Laura was a terrific host, proactive and responsive. Highly recommend and would definitely stay again for future trips."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! HIGHLY recommend! The place is beautiful and you can walk to so many restaurants.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at Laura's was great! The place is super cute and homey, perfect for a couple (and our little pup).

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying here. Laura had everything you would need. Lots of little details made the space cozy and fun!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Laura's home is welcoming with inspired design choices and great lighting. We immediately felt at home.
The kitchenette had everything we needed, even though we mostly ate out at the fabulous restaurants all within walking distance. Ovenbird Bakery is a MUST in the morning.
We felt safe walking from her home to Fells Point and the surrounding area.
Street parking was so easy that we didn't have to use the dedicated parking spot she offered. We never worried about driving somewhere outside of walking distance because neighborhood parking was always a breeze.
Sifting through reviews and neighborhoods to find an AirBNB in Baltimore took a lot of time. Save yourself search time and book Laura's home!
We'll likely do another weekend getaway in Baltimore and when we do, we will be booking with Laura."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great place right in the heart of Little Italy and within walking distance to the Inner Harbor and Fells Point. Parking was very easy. The apartment is beautifully renovated and decorated. Our stay was very comfortable … the living room was comfy to lounge in, the kitchenette was well stocked so we could make our own breakfast, there are TVs in both the living room and bedroom, and I can’t really think of anything else that we could want! We were also able to bring our small elderly dog who seemed to feel right at home. This is really great bc it’s getting harder to leave him. We took him in his doggie stroller to Fells Point. It was so fun!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Conveniently located AirBnb. We especially enjoyed the nearby bakery!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and nice to stay in and had great location to local restaurants and to Inner Harbor. The only downfall was that it was a bit chilly inside the apartment, other than that, we had no issues what so ever!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! Very close to everything.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laura’s place is exactly how it was described. It has everything you need and is the perfect location to get to fells point or canton. I want to come back! Laura was also a great host and was responsive.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The best things come in small packages - at least they do at Laura’s cozy apartment. The place has it all: well stocked kitchen, compact oven, coffee maker, dishwasher, amazing modern shower, washer & dryer, small office area, tv’s in both the living room & bedroom, super comfortable mattress (best sleep I’ve had in a while!), and a beautiful courtyard for morning pastries from the nearby must-try Ovenbird bakery.
Parking was a breeze even on Friday evening, and the nearby restaurant scene is incredible (check out The Elk Room for live jazz in a speakeasy environment). The location is perfect, nestled in a quiet neighborhood, yet within walking distance of a more lively scene if desired. We loved it so much, we extended our stay a few more nights! Laura was extremely responsive and flexible with our requests."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Laura's place was clean, and well decorated! We loved all of the restaurants right near that we could walk to - especially Ovenbird and Tagliata. Laura was very responsive and helpful throughout the time we stayed. The space felt larger than it looked in the photos and had everything we needed during our stay. We would 100% recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Fells Point!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura's place was lovely! Everything was clean and as described, check in was simple enough - Laura sent all the info ahead of time and we had no problem with the lockbox. She also gave us a few restaurant recommendations that were really great for us.
The neighborhood gets pretty quiet and most places are closed after 9 or 10, but Fell's Point is a ten minute walk so there's still plenty of late-night stuff within walking distance if that's your scene.
All-in-all it's a great space, we're already talking about booking here again the next time we're in Baltimore."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect spot in Little Italy! Very nicely renovated and furnished. Highly recommend this spot, Laura was a great host. Super helpful that parking was included. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect airbnb for a stay in Baltimore. Clean, brand new everything, nice high ceilings for a basement, quiet and convenient area. Bed is new and on the firmer side. My new go-to for quick stops in Baltimore!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay. We were there for one night, and needed something simple, clean, and a comfortable bed. Yang’s place delivered. Also the ceilings are super high and there’s a nice big window facing west, so there was great natural light which I always look for (and also large, thick curtains, so the light is easy to shut out if that’s preferred).
Yang was very communicative & check in was easy, exactly as described. I’d stay here again!"

Not a deterrent but rugs would def help!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot and great host, would stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Yang is fantastic. The accommodation is clean and pleasant, with stable Wi-Fi. The house is quiet, making it conducive for work. There are numerous restaurants and cafes in the vicinity. It's absolutely perfect for a visit to Johns Hopkins University, just a 10-15 minute walk away. I genuinely cannot find any drawbacks and highly recommend it."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Yang was great!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Yang’s place was perfect, it’s located in a beautiful neighborhood, it was spotless and I will definitely be booking again in the very near future."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful studio in a great neighborhood. High ceilings make it feel airy. Very convenient. If you are not a deep sleeper, it’s relatively loud inside the house, if someone walks in their apartment upstairs and/or cars on the street until 1am. Otherwise beautiful"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Yang's space was great for my stay in Baltimore. The place was clean and neat
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,It is an excellent place. It was clean and comfortable. It is a walking distance to JHU. Yung sent me clear instructions for parking and entering the building.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay. Surprisingly little traffic noise even though on a busy street. Comfortable furnishings. Yang was responsive and helpful.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, quiet, easy to walk to multiple stores and restaurants, on the bus line, but also free parking if you have a car."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Small but perfect for what we needed. A lot quieter of an area than I was expecting which was nice. Yang was great and easy to communicate with.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect place at perfect location! I helped my daughter moved in into her dorm at JHU and this place was just 3 min away.
Thank you so much!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love staying at Yang’s Airbnbs. Yang is always friendly, responsive, and great communication. Yang’s places are always just as described. This room has been perfect for us. Great location, close to everything we needed, and great local eateries. We will continue to book with Yang first, if available!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is a great place to spend a few nights in what are the best neighborhoods in Baltimore (Hampden, Remington, and Charles Village). And the bed is very comfortable! Yang is very helpful and responsive."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A good place to stay if you plan to visit JHU homewood campus. Nice host and great place. A cozy place to rest after long flight.

2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,The sound of the air conditioning is too loud
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Lovely location, very close to both Hopkins and downtown.
The room had beautiful light and its temperature was perfect; it was a hot day and evening, and the AC felt great but not too cold.
Yang was incredibly communicative and clear."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic option for anyone looking for a place to stay in Charles Village or near JHU! The space was clean and well designed with beautiful hardwood floors, a lovely bricked-up fire place, and gorgeous west-facing windows overlooking historic St. Paul St. Yang was very clear in his instructions, and we were able to access the building and the unit with ease. Parking was simple, free, and unlimited on Saturdays & Sundays. The unit had everything we needed - a comfy bed, a solid couch, a modern and clean bathroom, Keurig, mini-fridge, and microwave.
The location is really spectacular. You are spitting distance from the Waverly Farmers Market, the BMA, Normal's Bookstore, and Motzi Bread. Just a bit further (but still about a 15 min walk), you can go to Clavel, R-House, Paper Moon Diner, and Charmington's. If this is available, book it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for a short stay, and Yang was a responsive host. I needed to be close to Johns Hopkins University's Homewood campus, and this apartment, a unit in a townhouse, was probably a 5 minute walk from the campus. It is also just a block away from a bunch of restaurants, coffee shops, convenience stores, and a small grocery store. The bed was super comfortable. I loved the cute coffee nook. The place has big windows for a view of the street below, but thick curtains for privacy. Traveling alone for this overnight trip, I also felt safe in the neighborhood and in the building."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, highly walkable location. Bright, light-filled studio. Communicative super host who provided clear instructions. Everything you might need for a work or pleasure visit to JHU! I’ll definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, well lit studio in a good location. It might be a challenge for a long stay given the sparseness of the space and limited kitchen, but for a short stay, it suited me well. I appreciated Yang's clear, thorough instructions. A fun neighborhood, local highlights."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a single person or couple
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice experience

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for my partner and I to call home for a few nights.
The bed was insanely comfortable, and the location is ideal for those who enjoy walking to and fro.
The best experience we could have asked for. It is extremely well kept, and I plan on booking again.
Thank you for your thoughtfulness and consideration with your recommendations, and for laying out more than enough linens and coffee for us as well.
We couldn't be happier with our stay. The easiest 5 stars I could ever give!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Excelent
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Decent home for short and inexpensive stay with excellent proximity to Johns Hopkins.

Floors are very creaky and you can easily hear neighbors walking and opening/closing doors."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location - very close to JHU and the neighborhood is very walkable/easy access to public transportation. The space is great for 1-2 people and was very clean!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! The apartment is clean, bright, spacious.

Yang was very responsive and friendly to any questions we had. Would book again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Worth the paid. Great location, walking distance to JHU and restaurant. Comfortable space for two guests with cozy sofa and chair."
2023-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and very responsive host. Fast internet and SUPER EASY check in, extremely efficient and reliable. Rather unclean and left some things to be desired (trash can is so small, no dish soap or sponge despite providing dishes, water only from bathroom which wasn’t clean). Otherwise was fine, bare essentials"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice stay in terrific location - close to restaurants, stores, etc."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this place. Great location, easy check in and out, and really comfy and beautiful inside. Will definitely be looking to stay here again during my next visit to Bmore."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is aesthetically pleasing and well set up. My only challenge was the bed was quite soft (had foam topper) and the fan for heating a bit noisy (cannot be turned off). Other than that it’s well situated near JHU and the hosts are responsive.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,always a pleasure staying at this hosts’ listings!!!! highly recommend it <3
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and a great place for students or a short trip! Had everything we needed!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay thanks
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what you would expect from a superhost, Other guests mentioned the squeaky floor, that is what you should expect from a 100 year-old house. Neighborhood, being very close to Johns Hopkins, is very safe."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The room was very spacious and really felt like home. Good bagels, coffee and restaurants up the street a couple of blocks. A free “Purple” bus that goes down to Penn Station and back up again one block away. Other buses very conveniently close. Walking distance to JHU the Art Museum. Great bed and down pillows. Thank you, Yang!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice unit that is spacious for a studio.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Yang’s apartment. I was visiting the area as a student for the first time and the location felt exceptionally safe and convenient. The apartment was comfortable, clean, and quiet. Great for studying and resting during my stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay at Yang’s place! The room was large and light-filled. The location was great — convenient to all the things I wanted to do. The building and street were a bit noisy, but nothing my portable noise machine couldn’t fix. The bed was comfy and the kitchen area had everything I needed."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great for a one/couple nights stay. Comfortable temp for a walk-up in an older building. VERY easy keypad-lock system. Great natural light. Clean bathroom. Comfortable bed. My partner and I are not light sleepers so the floors creaking did not bother us, but if you are a light sleeper maybe bring some ear plugs or something. Also the kitchenette area is best suited for people who will be eating out! You cannot prepare anything more than maybe tea and some coffee here. Not a complaint for me personally- but just a warning for those interested in an extended stay. Overall, lovely place in a quiet neighborhood."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a lovely and private room very close to Johns Hopkins and the heart of the student area. Clean and well appointed!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Yang’s place is located in a great area. We found that finding parking was possible at any time, even though you might have to drive a bit. The room is spacious with lots of light. You can hear the tenants in other rooms, outdoors, and the floors are a bit creaky. My husband was ok, but I am a sensitive sleeper.
There is a very steep long flight of stairs leading to the room, so if you are loaded or have physical issues, it might be a problem. The area is very safe and pleasant to walk.
The place is clean, there is small fridge and glasses/bowls.
Would come stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to rest and chill at. Would visit again.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place, lots of space and right by Hopkins campus"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spacious and clean, felt very safe. This was perfect for going to a wedding nearby at the Baltimore Museum of Art. The floors are very creaky so it felt like we were making a lot of noise and we could hear the person upstairs very clearly."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I didn’t get a chance to stay here because I accidentally booked for the wrong day, but Yang was very responsive and communicative which I appreciated."
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"From the description we did not expect a mini hotel with every room being rented--we thought it was a home with a guest suite.
It was noisy -- was kept awake by people walking in hallways and upstairs (and having fun late at night) and the noise of the very loud air conditioning fan and the shower noise from other rooms.
In the morning we felt that every step we took creaked so loudly that we were probably disturbing others.
It was too warm at night and we had no control of air in our room. (we tried lowering the temp on the 3rd floor but someone else then raised it).
The mattress seemed overly well used with an indentation--sleeping right in the center was ok, but....
I'd recommend carpeting the floors and figuring out some other noise muting tactics."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice to meet you!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Yang is an excellent host and has a great apartment which is ideally located if you need access to the JHU campus.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location! Very clean, easy apartment to access."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Yangs row home for 6 nights. The room was a good size, comfortable, in a good location and clean.

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great space
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location near the BMA and lots of convenient parking. Room is spacious and has everything you need for a short stay. Good communication and easy check-in with door codes.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Good price nice location host responds quick. Good for a short stay
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I loved both the room and the neighborhood. Yang is an excellent host, always replying to non-urgent messages within a few hours and the one urgent one I sent almost immediately (I got locked out of my room, and he fixed it right away.) The light during daytime hours is beautiful. There's a very comfortable sofa in front of tall bay windows, and I think that's where I spent most of my time. There is no reading lamp, so if you're a reader bring a tablet for after dark. There are two small groceries a block away, as well as many reasonably priced casual restaurants. The art museum is 1/4 mile walk. The bus stop is just over a block away, Purple busses are free, and Penn station (with two options for trains to DC) is only one bus away. The neighborhood is mostly airbnb and other rentals, but it's very quiet and people here are extremely friendly."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an excellent stay at Yang's bnb. The unit was very clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. It's fun to stay in one of Baltimore's classic rowhomes. Yang was very professional, responsive, and accommodating in our communications. Yang made checking in & out very easy. I would definitely recommend this space, especially if you're going to be busy exploring the city - it's in a great location (Charles Village neighborhood), and close to food, cafes, bars, just a few blocks away from the Baltimore Museum of Art, a short trip to the cute Hampden neighborhood, and walking distance to public transit stops. Thanks again for having me!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,everything was as described. the place is spacious and comfortable. had an event early the next morning so the location was convenient. Parking on the street. One set of steep stairs to get to 2nd floor.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"This space is a large attractive quiet light-filled room conveniently located near Charles Village shopping and food. The check-in and check-out is smooth and easy. All the basics are there, with plenty of room to spread out for packing and unpacking and settling down to work. The wi-fi is good. The bathroom is very nice and the shower is good. The decor is simple and clean and the bed is comfortable. Overall simple nice space."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot, lovely bay windows and a good night's sleep--everything we hoped to have for our brief overnight. I'd definitely stay there again. Yang was a perfect host w/communication and kindness."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Accurate to the description. Perfect place to set up base to explore the city without shelling out an arm and a leg for a place in the inner harbor. Place is clean, however the floors are very creaky. Overall would recommend for a few night of active adventuring in Balty."

I loved reading on the couch in front of the large window.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place in a great area.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice and comfortable room. It is near the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus, so quite convenient to parents or friends visiting. The room is quite spacious, and very clean. Private bathroom is quite spacious and bright. This is an old row house so has some character and squeaky wood floors, but the neighborhood has plenty of charm. It is street parking, but we didn't have a huge problem finding parking within a couple blocks. Yang was very responsive. Would definitely consider staying here again in the future."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Parking can be a challenge at times.

2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient to JHU and easy to check in and out. Comfortable bed and furnishings, and fairly represented. Not sure if there are bedrooms on the first floor, but the second and third floor bedrooms would be very challenging to reach for anyone with mobility issues. Reasonably priced; We would consider staying again."

With several tasty and interesting restaurants and unrestricted parking just a block and a half away, it was perfectly situated for a car-free visit to the Baltimore Museum of Art a few days of quiet work time. Internet was fast and stable and I really enjoyed the light and view from the big curved bay window."

No kitchen but the microwave, coffeemaker and refrigerator were all in good working order. Street parking can be at a premium but we had no difficulty with a parking space.

It was perfect for our one-night stay in Baltimore."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed in this unit multiple times. The location is great. Quiet and peaceful residential neighborhood. Close to transportation the the highway. Walkable to The Avenue. It's wonderful!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Súper nice and Cousy place! Very nice area too, near restaurants & bars and still quiet."
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The entire space is private but everything happening upstairs could be heard by the guests, and likely vice versa. The hosts have a dog and child which can be heard very easily from the AirBnB in the basement. Also, we had issues with the lock on multiple occasions, including during check-in with the host. Also, the HVAC for the AirBnB cannot be controlled by the guest, so it gets pretty cold in the winter. They provide space heaters, though.
Hampden is amazing but it's not a particularly central Baltimore location. This AirBnB should be priced at a lower rate given the lack of privacy, space, and ability to control the HVAC."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,cozy
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rachel and Sean were very helpful and supportive when I thought I lost my purse. I have stayed at their place 3 times and hope to stay again!

A great place, and I hope to stay again when in town."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We moved from Baltimore to DC last year and came back for a long weekend to see some friends and decided to stay at Rachel’s because it had everything - private space; parking spot; easy access to I-83; walking distance to coffee, beer, books, and records; etc. We appreciated the coffeemaker and Brita!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This location is AMAZING! So close to many restaurants, shopping, groceries, not to mention a big park. Hampden is a picturesque neighborhood and lovely to walk around.
It's also AMAZING to have a parking space at this location!
I so appreciated the small touches in this apartment — reusable shopping bags, adult coloring books, toiletries, a throw blanket, many types of tea, and games.
Rachel was a great communicator. She reached out to let us know about traffic issues during a neighborhood parade. She also left out a recycling bin for us to use before we left.
My only warning: this is a basement apartment, and it's cold in the winter! Space heaters and the throw blanket help, but be prepared for cooler temps if you're staying in the winter.
I 100% recommend staying in this apartment!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place is a perfect little spot for a stay in Hampden. The whole basement unit is very private and cozy, with a super comfortable bed, well-furnished little living area, and very clean bathroom. Keypad access makes entry and exit easy and it’s within a few blocks of the main avenue in Hampden with tons of restaurants, bars, and cute boutique shops.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was exactly as listed. It was a very quiet neighborhood and cozy space. The worst part about it was the parking but it wasn't even bad. It's just a tight turn especially if you have a larger car. Rachel responded to me quickly and gave me everything I needed. Would stay here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this place! We have stayed multiple times. It is so convenient to The Avenue and the highway. The off street parking is a huge plus!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This listing exceeded expectations! I walked in after a long, exhausting drive, and was greeted with an extremely clean and cozy space. It had everything I needed! Rachel’s small notes throughout the space were helpful, and I felt safe and secure in such a beautiful space. It was a perfect fit for one to two people and truly felt like a fancy hotel stay! The hosts thought of everything to provide their guests. A huge bonus was the use of the parking space, and the surrounding neighborhood has everything you could imagine! The hosts offer themselves up for suggestions (if the traveler is interested) and even provided the guest with lots of menus to check out some of the food options ahead of exploring! I would HIGHLY recommend this listing to anyone!!!! Thank you!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location. Less than 5 minute walk to the Avenue. Having use of the parking pad is a HUGE bonus, as parking in Hampden can be a challenege!
Had the pleasure of meeting both hosts and their adorable pup! It was comforting to know they were there if we needed anything, and they fully respected our privacy. Great communication, responsive, provided recommendations of places to check out.
Apartment was perfect for the two of us. Double bed is super comfortable. Kuerig (and K-cups) and Brita dispenser there for your use. Really nice shower - shampoo, conditioner and soap provided, along with a few other toiletries, in case you forget!
We will absolutely stay here again in the future. Highly recommend."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a high-value stay with a really good location in the Hampden neighborhood of Baltimore. The basement apartment is immaculate, with plenty of space for my mom, who was visiting us for the week.
Rachel and her husband were excellent communicators and made sure to reach out to us at various points of the stay. There was one point where the WiFi went out for a few hours, but we were kept in the loop throughout and the situation was resolved quickly.
The parking is a little tricky to get in and out of, but by Baltimore standards it’s not that bad. In fact, it’s a godsend to have your own space 24/7, especially in such a dense row house neighborhood.
We enjoyed our stay and hope we can stay again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location, price, and accommodations."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal location and a comfy bed! You couldn’t ask for a better place to stay in Hampden near great food, drinks, and Druid Hill Park.
Because this is a basement apartment and we visited in summer, we weren’t totally surprised to see a few large cockroaches in the living room and bathroom on both nights of our stay. Bugs aside, this place is very clean and tidy. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend."

Would recommend and stay again!"

2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Rachel was very responsive and pleasant. The space was clean and as advertised, though it turned out to be somewhat small for our family of two adults and two children (ages 9 and 5). The walls are somewhat thin, so we did hear people walking around upstairs quite a bit. This didn't bother us, but we are city dwellers and used to hearing neighbors.
The neighborhood (Hampden) was fun to explore -- there are cool restaurants and shops within a short walk. We explored multiple local coffee shops and generally had a nice stay."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Highly recommend this little apartment! I stayed here for a month. Everything was clean and tidy and just as described in the posting. Super comfy bed! And the parking space is extremely convenient. Easy walking distance to The Avenue in Hampden for plenty of cafes, restaurants and shopping. 🙌🏼"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Rachel was a top-tier host. She was quick to communicate, flexible, and extremely accommodating. The space is nicer than we expected, with all necessary amenities for a short or for a long stay (in our case, 2+ weeks). The location in Hampden is great, with access to Druid Hill park, as well as three different clusters of food/drink venues (Falls Road, Woodberry/Mills, and The Avenue, among others). Overall, an excellent experience in a great space with a wonderful host."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect. clean simple and safe.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little basement apartment! Perfect for my solo, quick trip to Baltimore! The parking spot in the driveway was very handy as street parking can fill up.

The place was perfect for a couple. The parking pad in the back is really convenient. They really have thought of everything! They provided coffee, tea, paper plates, shampoo, etc. It is well decorated and cozy! My husband and I enjoyed playing the board games. I only feedback we would give is that the computer monitor/speaker as a TV is complicated and a little small. We couldn't get it to work, but we also didn't take the time to ask for further instruction. A small smart TV would be more convenient. It would also be really nice to let the guests control the temperature with a window a/c unit. We were a little hot at night even with the fast fan! Please note: we stayed in the heat of July, so this is to be expected! There are two space heaters in the place for the winter months! These things did not ruin our stay at all, we just wanted to share our thoughts! Big thanks to the great hosts!"

My only note is that there’s no real TV, it’s a monitor with a chromecast (just something to be aware as of it took me a moment to realize). Having never used one, I was too tired that evening upon realizing to figure it out. I’m sure if I had noticed sooner in the day, or was staying longer it wouldn’t have been an issue, or I could have asked for assistance - hosts were amazingly responsive to all of my questions and I highly highly recommend!"

There were so many bars and restaurants close by that we wanted to try, but ran out of time! We also loved meeting their dog, Charlie! She is so sweet!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect - thanks!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott’s Airbnb was clean, accessible, and as described. Was a great space for an overnight trip near Fells. We had a chance to meet both of them and their dog Charlie briefly and all were friendly! Would not hesitate to stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for an artsy spot in an upscale row home with magical, private indoor/outdoor spaces in the heart of Fells Point, look no further!
This home has every comfort & convenience, and a LOT of HEART.
We appreciated having loads of privacy, as well as easy access from the street to our room (without feeling we were disturbing the hosts).
There are many restaurants, entertainment options, & the Inner Harbor within walking distance or a quick Uber ride from the property.
We recommend: The Blue Moon Cafe for b'fast/brunch & The Port for local comedy.
We had the privilege of meeting Scott and his darling canine companion, which turned out to be a bonus to a wonderful trip!
Thanks for hosting us, Scott and Jennifer!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing treatment
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott were super friendly and went out of their way to let me in and tell me where to find cheap parking (the garage just around the corner is only $5 over the weekend). You cannot beat the location and the space was very artfully decorated and well thought out- and probably the cleanest AirBnB I've ever stayed in.
This area of town was a little bit loud at night, but as a light sleeper, I slept pretty soundly even though the room is right under their stairway."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! I really enjoyed the garden/patio area. I love how it smells like fresh croissants as soon as you walk outside! Lol
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer and Scott were very responsive and so helpful with all the questions I had. We regret not staying longer it was a short visit. Perfect location and walkable to everything.

We were only in town for a night so didn’t have the pleasure of meeting our hosts, but their communications were super friendly and helpful! The room was clean and cozy. The location couldn’t have been better—situated a short walk to Fells Point and the downtown attractions. We hope to return sometime so we can enjoy the lovely patio when it’s not snowing! :).

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,As a New Yorker I loves seeing all the old buildings being repurposed. Looks like a fun neighborhood. With walkable places. The room had a Wonderful shower ! Clean and comfy bed with a view into a garden. I Liked the art on their walls. As a painter it was fun to discover they have in interest in art.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within walking distance to numerous restaurants and areas to visit.
The room was extremely clean and tidy with an amazing shower! The outdoor area was nice, and we enjoyed watching squirrels from the bed.
Although staying in the same building with the host, the room felt separate. Our interactions with Scott and Jennifer were friendly and pleasant. We very much enjoyed meeting Charlie and hearing her footsteps on the stairs."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came for 2 nights for a conference and this was perfect spot. Nice 10 mins walk to hotel on the harbor. Safe neighborhood and actually this is a historic row of houses. Room with great garden access is brand new! Everything is clean, well designed and with an artist flair. Great shower/bathroom, desk space and good plugs for charging and strong internet.
Really felt comfortable and it is soo quiet I had great nights sleep. Scott is super responsive and helpful with early check-in ; it is easy to come in and out and walking distance to some good bread & cafes. Would definitely stay again and hopefully in spring so I can enjoy the garden more!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would stay at the Secret Garden again if I return to the Baltimore inner harbor area. This was a great option over of the pricey conference hotel. It was easy to find, had easy keypad entry, was within walking distance to my conference, and Scott, Jenn, and their dog Charlie were very kind. The private garden was perfect for reading and meditation. I highly recommend this place."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Jennifer's place was a perfect, quiet nook while I was in town for a conference. A picturesque walk along the harbor to get to the convention center and an easy walk over to restaurants and night life in Fell's Point after work hours. I love the artsy feel of the place and the access to a garden/patio space is so welcome vs. being in a generic hotel room with windows that don't open!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, friendly hosts!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Jennifer were really responsive and very friendly throughout the whole process. Being able to rent the garage was a great added bonus and made this a great home base for a few days. The place was very clean, the code system was easy to use, and the view into the back garden was lovely.
You are sharing the building so you do hear them above you (or smell cooking), but it didn't bother us - just something to keep in mind. For the price it was a great deal and Scott and Jennifer made everything really easy by being so proactive and thoughtful."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great crash pad for the weekend. Wouldn't recommend for a longer stay as there is no fridge or TV, but if you're like us and are out exploring the area most of your stay this place is great! Comfortable, clean, and parking in the garage was a great bonus too!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely stay at Scott and Jennifer’s private guest suite. The room was small, yet airy, immaculately clean, calm, relaxing and modern - I love what they did with the patio and backyard.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Scott and Jen’s place was a great little place. They have a nice hidden garden in the back. Highly recommended a couple. We had our 2yr old with us so it was kind packed, but that is entirely on us. The location was great as it was a short walk to the heart of Fells Point and many good restaurants. We had the pleasure of meeting Scott when we checked in and he was great. Definitely recommend their place!"

We were close to the Fells Pt shopping and waterfront and only blocks from Little Italy.
Thanks Scott and Jennifer and Charlie!"

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ all around!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little spot in Baltimore - walking-distance to the restaurants and bars of Fells Point and easily reachable through the bus (note: they don’t run that often). Communication was great and I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Bed is comfy, outdoor garden space is beautiful, and the neighborhood is quiet."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,The room was as described. Within walking distance to Fells Point. Short car ride from the Inner Harbor. Located on a private street with a beautiful back patio. Hosts were very responsive. Single room with comfortable bed and nice bathroom/shower. Only small complaint was that the room smelled a little musty when we first checked in but we lit a candle and after an hour it was good. Would recommend to others.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This incredible little garden apartment was the perfect getaway. It felt secluded and cozy despite being located in a city!

We visit Baltimore every year or two and would hope to stay in their place again. Thank you for making us feel at home!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The secret garden is an oasis in the heart of historic Baltimore. The home is peaceful, surrounded by row home architecture.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer & Scott were great hosts. Check in was a breeze and the room was quiet and comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and also very nice & updated.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, with a cheap parking garage around the corner. This place is great if you need a place to crash for the night, not the best hangout space unless you utilize the back yard. A mini fridge and a small TV would be a great addition. Scott and Jen were very accommodating."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful hosts and beautiful space! Great location and a quick walk to inner harbor. The secret garden was amazing. There’s even rocks to paint and leave there. Jennifer and Scott accommodated our needs and helped us have a great stay. 10/10 would recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay here. The garden is peaceful and lovely and they have a really cute dog. Spacious bedroom too ! I didn’t notice when booking it was one room in house so was a bit confused to see hosts but they were very friendly and nice. Ear plugs were useful at times just bc could be loud when trying to sleeping in with family and a few visitors. Overall, happy I stayed here and is close to a lot of cool things in Baltimore. Also felt very safe! Hosts were very flexible about me leaving my bag late and picking up later etc."

They were able to accommodate an earlier check-in and bag drop, and the space was peaceful and private. I loved the covered patio and their walled garden—it was just what I needed to decompress. It’s also centrally located and they were super helpful offering dinner recommendations and info about the neighborhood. I had a really enjoyable conversation with them and was happy to offer their pup all the scratches. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan on eating out and exploring, while still wanting some chill personal time!"

The location was perfect for my needs, the shower had great water pressure, and the garden was lovely. Street parking was easy to find less than a block from the house.
For two, you might find the room to be a little small, but it was perfect for me. Everything was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Designed for those looking for a peaceful, quiet retreat, there is no television. Instead, they offer games! There is also reliable and fast wi-fi if you must use your computer. My only suggestion would be to add a small refrigerator and/or an electric kettle.
Note: do not be confused if you look on G* Maps and see a different house! Jennifer and Scott did a complete rebuild a few years ago."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed being so close to Johns Hopkins Hospital and Fells Point - great restaurants and coffee shops, and only a short drive to JHU. The perfect location.

We enjoyed looking out at the beautiful little garden and will definitely return again. Super hosts."

Would highly recommend staying here if you find yourself in Baltimore!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Place was described as the listing. Just be aware there’s no certain amenities such as a kitchen or tv (which is indicated although I do think a freezer or microwave would’ve been helpful esp if you trying to stay here longer.) Overall, pretty cleaned but lots of bugs so just be cautious."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location is great- short walk to the waterfront and ton of restaurants, and parking was easy. It’s right next to a bread factory that makes the street smell amazing. If you are looking for a place that is QUIET at night, this place is for you. The people upstairs are asleep and I couldn’t hear any road noise. The outdoor patio is nice too."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cute spot in walkable neighborhood with restaurants and shops near by. Host was very responsive to questions. Space was clean and comfortable. My only suggestion would be to have a mini fridge and a glass for water. Overall it was a good spot and affordable!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,This was a short stay yet a good one. Jennifer and Scott were responsive all the way through the process. I ended up arriving at the same time as Scott who was friendly. The block reminded me of blocks in South Philly and the space itself looked just the photos. I truly enjoyed having being out in the garden. One thought I had was it would be cool to have a small fridge in the suite to keep water or leftovers cold.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and fantastic hosts!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Just the right size for a night's stay. Beautiful garden to sit beside while enjoying a cup of coffee. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott’s place was perfect for a short weekend trip to bmore. We were in the city for a friend’s wedding party and only need to stay one night and we loved it. Everything was neat and clean, plus the patio/backyard was beautiful! Also, it’s in a great location - walkable to the main part of fells point but on a side street that’s private and quiet. Would definitely stay there again!"

Location was very walkable, I had just ran a 10 mile race the day before so it was great because I didn't have to go far for dinner or breakfast. The backyard apace is beautiful and their home has some creative and fun touches. They also made a great local map with lots of wonderful suggestions. Plus their dog is absolutely adorable. Thanks for a wonderful stay. Your home made me miss the creativity of homes in the Mid-Atlantic where I used to live."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you to Jennifer and Scott! Fantastic hosts, and a fantastic property!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Scott and Jennifer have the cutest space in the heart of Baltimore. We loved how cozy it felt.

The garden area is very serene even when it is cloudy and in Spring :) We would stay again! Thank you both."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was really beautiful, Jennifer and Scott were wonderful as well. Very helpful and patient. We were able to check-in early and had a great time. Great location, very close to a lot of nice restaurants, little Italy and the inner harbor.
The one small detail is that we thought we were booking an entire place, but this was just the room. I think because it’s listed as an entire suite, the filters put it in “entire home”. Even then, it was a great experience and I recommend it!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Jennifer and Scott’s place. The apartment is very well done with modern furnishings and really nice touches to make us feel right at home. There are great restaurants nearby and it’s very walkable to shops and attractions. Scott was very responsive and communicative. We’d gladly stay here again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a little gem of a place. The location is top notch, located on one of the many small residental streets of Baltimore. At night, the street is fairly dark, and you'll need to use your phone to unlock the door (at least I did). Scott and Jennifer were very communicative, with detailed instructions sent before check-in and with printed instructions in the room. It's very cozy and comfortable, with a gorgeous bathroom and fantastic outdoor space. Would recommend to solo or couple travelers looking to stay in the ever popular Fells Point area!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this place! Jennifer and Scott are super friendly and provided a fantastic map of local places to check out. The area is amazing with lots around to walk to. We only wish we had stayed more than one night!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect for the one night we did!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott's place was really clean and comfortable! We only stayed for one night, but we had a really good time. The bed feels almost like a cloud! The place was spotless. The secret garden was really beautiful. The location was also very close to near restaurants. Would definitely recommend staying here for a couple of nights."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Jen and Scott have great little place to stay near Fells Point. Wonderful place and will look to stay there again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Convenient location to get around. Shared entrance and private floor/room location as noted. Scott was very friendly and Charlie was definitely a highlight.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay here. Guest suite was very clean. Scott is proactive with communication and easy to get in contact with.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Helpful hosts. Clean, bright space. Very walkable area!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Great location for a one night stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The secret garden was a cozy and quiet place to sleep. Exactly what I was looking for.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location near the inner harbor. Glad we found this spot for our brief visit to Baltimore.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy stay with a location/suite almost exactly as described. Great communication from hosts -- helpful with early check in. Will stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a high quality and spotless accommodation. Twelve miles from BWI. Great communication with the hosts. Early check-in was accommodated. A quick 7 minute walk to my favorite Fells Point spot: Max's Taphouse (best tap list in Baltimore?). I hope it's available on my next visit to Baltimore.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we were hoping for! Cute place in a great location! It had everything we needed!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott’s place was truly a home away from home. The cleanliness, the communication, and secret garden were 5 stars! Definitely the most friendly and helpful host you can find. They really give a true bnb experience. If you book you won’t regret it!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Scott was great and very responsive to my questions. Would eximirlo stay there again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space to explore Baltimore from
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,👍👍👍
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place to stay in a very walkable part of Baltimore. The view from the room is beautiful and peaceful even during the winter months.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Jen and Scott’s Secret Garden is like having good friends in Baltimore who let you use their MIL suite. It’s clean and comfy, well constructed- right down to heated floors and a properly sloped shower floor so it drains well. The place is tiny but has everything we needed for a short getaway from home. Wish it had been less rainy so we could have hung out in the backyard! Love this neighborhood, where it’s easy to walk to our favorite spots: Patterson Park, Corner Juice Bar, Ekiben, coffee shops, Ministry of Brewing, and the water. Parking was a little tight when we arrived in the rain after 5, but it worked out after a few times circling the block. And Charlie, their dog, gives kisses if you let her, which is an added bonus for us!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and unique space, with tons of shops, etc. in walking distance. Hosts were great - quick communication and clear instructions at checkin/checkout. Will definitely stay again!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott was very communicative & nice! The place was super clean and private. We really enjoyed our experience:)
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near dozens of restaurants and bars, very comfortable space, and incredibly helpful and friendly hosts. We would absolutely stay in this AirBnB again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My partner and I only had one night's stay in Jennifer and Scott's spacious bedroom/bathroom place, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were given very clear instructions for the entire experience there. They were friendly and very responsive responsive to our questions, and were flexible on our departure time. We were impressed on the art and design of the entire space, and would have used the attractive back yard space, just outside our bedroom, had it been warmer outside. We will definitely return if the occasion arises."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott was friendly and welcoming. I did not get a chance to meet Jennifer, but I did get to meet their dog Charlie who was friendly as well.
The space was clean and comfortable and I highly recommend Jennifer and Scott as hosts for anyone stopping in Baltimore"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott were very proactive, communicative, and flexible! Charlie the dog was a sweet touch ☺️ comfortable bed and the spot had just the basics plus a great back deck, which was perfect for us since we spent 95% of the trip out of the bnb."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, loved the private courtyard garden. Nice location, and easy enough to find free overnight parking around the corner."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott was very friendly and supportive! Everything was in walking distance!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott was super nice and the house was beautiful. Great location and able to walk to most places.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Jennifer were excellent hosts. Great location, comfy bed, 5 stars."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So glad we chose to stay here! The location is excellent. Fells Point bars and restaurants are right on your doorstep, Little Italy is one neighborhood over, and Inner harbor is about a 25 min walk away..There is a car rental a couple of blocks away and a parking garage with convenient hours and very reasonable prices nearby.
The guest space is modest, but is perfect if you are planning on spending most of your time exploring the city. Host and and co-host are lovely too!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jen was super sweet along with her co-host Jen. They are very nice people. Her place was absolutely amazing, spacious and comfortable. The art work around the house was beautiful! I would highly recommend this place to anyone needing some peace of mind and comfort. Thank you again Jen&Scott and the co-host Jen, you all were amazing and all so sweet!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Thank you so much for the hospitality. Could not have been better.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Potentially the best AirBnB experience I have had. I had a great time getting to know Scott and the location was perfect.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute place is tucked on a quiet street in a great location, walkable to the waterfront, Fell's Point, and downtown. The house is lovely with a backyard and a terrace, and the hosts are super nice. I recommend it!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott have a very lovely home and I felt super comfortable staying with them. I was attending a music festival in baltimore and they were very accommodating with my check in time. The code to get in was very useful as I was unable to check in until very late. I didn’t see them much during my stay as I was busy but for the short times I did they were both extremely kind and helpful. If I come to the festival again next year I definitely hope I can stay at their home again! Also, the Blue Moon Cafe was a delicious recommendation for a late breakfast. Super cool place only a couple minute walk. Feeling like I was in a safe place was very important to me as I was coming in late and by myself and I was not worried at all staying with them. Thanks again Jenn and Scott!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Everything was perfect. Will definitely be staying again!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott's place is very clean and in a great location. Scott was very polite, friendly, and responded to my questions fast. I had a good stay. I will stay with them again if I go back to Baltimore."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Easy communication between us . Cute residence . Nice backyard .
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott were wonderful hosts, quick responses with communication. We enjoyed their lovely home."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was a perfect jumping off spot to hang out in fells point and the inner harbor. The whole place was really cute though so we could have definitely felt at home on the patio or in the living room if we stayed in more.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and and Scott were very accommodating and their townhouse is in an excellent location, within close walking distance to the harbor and a number of great restaurants, coffee shops and a Whole Foods supermarket. And for anything farther, the electric scooters, Uber and public transportation should suffice.
The luggage rack in the closet was also a nice touch. One piece of advice for anyone using the keypad — the “unlock” button needs to be held down for a couple of seconds after entering the code or it won’t work. Overall, a great experience and highly recommended. 👌🏼"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen & Scott’s place was lovely, very well located, and check in was super easy. In addition, they were very flexible and super accommodating to our needs. I wouldn’t think twice to stay at their place again, highly recommend!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenn and Scott have a great place within walking distance of the Harbor and convention center, as well as tasty restaurants and Whole Foods, CVS. They were very welcoming and polite hosts, highly recommended."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, great location, great hosts."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott are simply great people! Warm and inviting home in a PRIME location! They have the most gorgeous outdoor patio area! It was so close to everything we wanted as part of attending Maryland Deathfest. We will stay here again!!!! 💖 Clean, very communicative hosts and a very comfortable stay!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A little tricky to locate for the first time but absolutely worth it for the comfort, hospitality, and friendliness of the hosts.
As a woman traveling alone to a city with a rough reputation, I was nervous taking the risk of staying at an AirB&B several blocks from where I’d be for work, but those nerves were quickly dispelled!
Scott and Jenn were welcoming, helped me get oriented and had me feeling like family within the first few hours. I could hang out and chat with them in the common areas or have absolute privacy in my room. Sharing the main bathroom was never an issue, I had fridge space and full use of the kitchen, and Scott went above and beyond helping me get laundry done even with an out of service washing machine.
The house is an easy walk to the inner harbor and I did it daily for a conference. If I was out after dark I took a Lyft (in the advice of four different locals—it is a city), and the scooters available through Uber were easy to find and a lot of fun to get around on.
There is a Whole Foods within a few blocks so grocery shopping was no-stress, and another block from there was a Starbucks (I’m from Seattle, it’s an addiction, I’ll own it). I was a little overzealous one day and walked all the way to Fort McHenry (caught a Lyft back) so while I don’t necessarily recommend doing that, it tells you how walkable everything is.
Highly recommended and I hope to stay there again next time I’m in town."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful place to stay!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer and Scott were so kind and welcoming. It was a lovely stay in Baltimore because of their hospitality!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott were great communicators and very flexible on my trip changes. The space is adequate, but in a perfect location to walk to a lot of the inner harbor areas.
The bedroom floor is slanted a bit...which was no issue on the bed but did make it odd when using the desk in the room. Other than that, no real complaints especially for the price, location and great hosts."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We decided to take in Baltimore on a budget and Scott and Jenn help made this possible. Their beautiful space is perfectly located within walking distance to Fells Point. There is a parking garage around the corner that had $4 daily specials on the weekends that is clean and safe. During the week it cost me $21 a day. Scott provided us tips on locations and answered all our questions. The space is clean and it was a special treat for me to have french pressed coffee in the morning. All this contributed to making our trip to Baltimore an exciting adventure.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful space, close to fells point restaurants. Scott and Jen were very easy to communicate with, and made the process seamless"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great deal and convenient
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, clean and exceedingly comfortable stay. Jennifer and Scott were warm and responsive hosts. Would highly recommend."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott took the time to learn what I wanted from this trip in order to give me personalized recommendations on how to best enjoy the city! It made my time in Baltimore feel comfortable, safe, and easy. Their home is very clean, with charming and authentic touches throughout. I’d love to have the chance to stay with them again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Keith's place was everything he said and more. Great stylish place. Wonderful and convenient location. So many great things nearby and his instructions to the place made it so easy to find. Def plan on coming back.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Pros: If you are planning to visit downtown, the location of the suit is great. Silent and calm location. Close to the car park. We loved the location and silent nature of the place. All the stuff is ready to use and enough for your needs.
Cons: Except in summer, if you are seeking for warm place the air condition can not be enough for you. There is an additional electric heater but it will take time to feel warm. We had this feeling for the first 2 days because the weather was cold outside. The curtains could be cleaner but not a big issue for us except cosmetic look.
Neutral comment: Yes, there is an issue with the disturbing walking sound coming from the upper floor. On the other hand, people should learn how to walk while staying in a rental place. Nothing to say about this to owner according to us.
In general, there are some topics for development but the suit offers more than enough compared its the price."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Splendid host, 10/10 experience!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Keith was very friendly and responsive as I got into Baltimore. I was able to easily find the unit and get into the parking garage. The area was extremely walkable, parking was easy to access and I felt safe walking around, getting to restaurants, etc.
A few things that were not explicitly mentioned in the listing:
- There were other people in the unit above me and I could hear them on the stairs and in their unit
- There's a thin curtain that separates the sliding glass door from the outside and across the way is the kitchen of other unit
- The heater is above the door and only warms one third of the room and there were no extra comforters; if you're someone who runs cold, bring sweatshirts
- The alley used to get to the unit was very narrow; wearing a backpack or carrying larger luggage made it hard to maneuver with the gate.
Overall the stay was great! I really enjoyed the location and having somewhere nice to stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,private and quaint. perfect location. easy to walk to activities and cheap parking for Baltimore.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I liked my stay here a lot. It was a peaceful spot--even though it is on a busy street it feels a bit tucked away because it is behind the other house. Walkable to nice areas of Fells Point (Ekiben is great food and very close). There was cute decor there too. My only complaint is check-in--it could have been clearer in the description of how to get in. I wasn't sure which house it was and did not want to accidentally go into the wrong one so waited a bit. If you go here I recommend checking in during the day so it's easier. Keith was responsive and a nice host however and this place has a good vibe.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will stay at Keith’s again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,FABULOUS stay and the BEST location Baltimore has to offer. Literally Fells Point and Harbor East restaurants and shops were within 2 blocks. Centrally located to EVERYTHING and easy to get anywhere. On street parking always available. Keith proactive in communication and appreciated the booklet of information and history of the studio space which was unique and cozy. Stayed for a week and it felt like home. Perfect for a business traveler or couple visiting Baltimore and wanting to be in the heart of everything the city has to offer. Thanks Keith for a wonderful week in Balitmore!
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Neat studio near practically anywhere you’d like to visit in Baltimore. Feels new and comfortable, except for the lock that is jammed and will not lock from the inside. Anybody with access to courtyard can slide your glass door open. Mentioned it my first night to the host and no resolution. Overall chic and cozy"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place for me - one person who spent the days elsewhere (visiting family) so just needed a comfortable bed (check 1) and a great shower (check 2) and strong Wifi (check 3). It was attractive and comfortable, including a good desk chair. I didn't use the kitchen, except for drinks in the fridge, so no comments on that. On my last day, my family drove down to see the place (and they loved it), and then we walked to Whole Foods for breakfast and then on to the inner harbor for morning fun.
Parking was easy - I found a spot on Caroline each time I returned to the apartment. But it was reassuring to have the long instructions on how to find parking elsewhere had I needed it.
There was some street noise on Thursday night but weirdly not on Friday or Saturday - or maybe I just adjusted to it :-)
Instructions were very clear but still, Keith answered the questions that I did have quickly and clearly.
Highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it here. Eastern Ave is a perfect point to walk right to the Harbor, restaurants, shops just everything. Has everything you need for a nice getaway or stay in the city."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the hosts were proactive and friendly, and even shared a list of recommended things to do in the area. I was only in for work, but staying in a converted art gallery was an interesting change of pace. For the most part, everything was fine, and the space itself was surprisingly insulated from noises on the street. The only thing that really surprised me was how thin the ceiling/walls were. I was able to hear every footstep that the person upstairs took, which was particularly disruptive for me as they were most active around midnight.
The hosts do have some solutions for this, such as a white noise machine or earbuds (and have them in the space if you do need them), but just be aware of this ahead of time if you're a light sleeper. In the future, I'd probably make sure to be on the second floor to avoid this (or bring earplugs of my own)."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a quick getaway, cute space and great location in Fells."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I was in town for a quick 1-night trip. Instructions were detailed and made it easy to check in. They provided a map of recommendations which was very useful for exploring before we checked in. The booklet they provide you is helpful and unique as well!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Clearly communicated instructions and solid place.
Only thing is that I would recommend to get ear plugs as there might be noise (walking, not music etc.) if there is another guest above this room."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay here - it was clean, comfortable, and within walking distance to everywhere we needed to go. Free street parking was easy on a Sunday night. While the apartment was quiet due to being a bit off of the street, the noise from the upstairs guest was very loud and unfortunately occurred between 1 and 2am both nights we were there. Just something to be aware of as it did impact our stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay - clean and beautiful apartment. Host did an excellent job of communicating.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was very convenient in location. It was very close to all the main restaurants. Great for a quick weekend trip to Baltimore!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect private studio. Not what one would expect from the outside looks. Easy to get in, clean, private courtyard."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Super responsive host. Comfortable bed and walkable to many attractions! Would stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication with Scott was seamless, easy to get ahold of and he did great checking in with us as well with places to eat and check out.
If you have never been to Baltimore it's a really small big city with a lot to do in a small area.
Lots of museums, observation deck with cool views, Fort McHenry, lots of good eateries and places to grab a nice drink.
Their place is within walking distance to pretty much everything and what I personally liked best is that there is no TV so it really allows you to get out and enjoy what the city has to offer.
Good solid choice if you don't need to have a TV when you're exploring a new city."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was able to get an early check in because I arrived a little earlier than the standard 3pm. A good location and free of noise because the location isn’t directly on the street. Everything was super clean and the price was very reasonable. I plan to book here again the next time I visit Baltimore.
Anyone considering booking here will not be disappointed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay at Jennifer and Scott’s! Would stay there again if in Baltimore!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,good place
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay in Baltimore, for either short or long term stays. I felt very at peace in the suite. 100% would recommend! Also, Jennifer and Scott were super helpful!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The location is super walkable and peaceful. The water was very close. The studio was clean and well stocked. I really appreciated the guide with restaurants/things to do nearby, we went to several of the recommendations Jennifer and Scott listed out. Overall we had a great Airbnb experience!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer and Scott's place was very unique and artsy. I needed a quick break for day for my birthday in the city and their place was good choice.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay! It had everything I needed, and the bed was very comfy! Jennifer and Scott are excellent hosts, and we’re very welcoming and communicative. I’d stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy place and great hosts. Walkable to lots of stuff nearby
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Extremely cost effective and in the perfect area of relying on public transportation. Restaurants and grocery store/convenience stores nearby.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay for a few nights if you’re coming in for a conference. Spacious , very walkable, and a great desk space."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Very responsive had a small little problem and they was so nice to accommodations just like the picture and close to fells point
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"So happy that we found this studio, it was perfect for our stay. The studio is absolutely beautiful, close to so many restaurants. Definitely would come back"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place - was happy that the other residents abided by the quiet policies at night!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super convenient location, walkable to a lot. As pictured. Very comfy bed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very convenient to Fell's Point offerings and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Super convenient, clean, modern space. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful hosts! A lovingly renovated and furnished brick house, in the typical style of the district, ""Fenn's Point"". Everything you need is there, even an umbrella, office supplies and charging station and cable.
The guest manual provides valuable tips. Plenty of towels and blankets.
Jennifer and Scott live around corner and are willing to help and tangible if needed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while attending a conference at one of the waterfront hotels. Jennifer and Scott were great hosts and the space was exactly what I needed!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely area and a great place to stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place , great location, and great hosts! Exactly as described and perfect for my visit."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The sense of privacy and escape in this AirBnB was very welcome and surprising given how it is in a busy part of Baltimore. The little walkway one takes between buildings to get to the small courtyard and studio entrance reminded me of being in Europe and added to a sense of this being a get-a-way :-)
The studio itself feels very open with high ceilings and clean lines. The bathroom is terrific, with a wonderful large shower. Adequate kitchenette option, very clean and it was nice that it was stocked for making coffee :-)."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and very clean! Would absolutely stay again. Close to a lot of places to eat and drink as well.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous little place! Just what I needed for a last minute trip to my favorite town!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place. Walkable from inner harbor (15 minutes) and close to Little Italy for good eats. Scott and Jennifer give good, detailed instructions on how to access the place."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"What a phenomenal little apartment. I loved how modern it was. very cool. Bed and bed linens just wow! most comfortable stay I have ever had at an airbnb. On point. My only concern was one that is my own and out of hosts control, blond small female rolling her suitcase and carryon around homeless and sketch people down on their luck after I parked in the garage. Super happy I checked in before dark to get my bearings. My friend who lives in BWI stayed with me that night and basically said,"" it's Baltimore"" and shrugged her shoulders. Anyway carry pepper spray ladies if you're alone or plan on walking down to fells point and back at night or even to the whole foods a few blocks down. The parking garage was only $4 after 4 pm for the whole night which is awesome. Safe travels and seriously enjoy this awesome setup they have created (no TV was perfect for me)."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful spot! This place is just outside the middle of it all, but once you’re in the courtyard and the room, the city feels and sounds a million miles away. A great find, well priced, and everything you need if your plan is to spend your time roaming the city. Scott and Jennifer are super responsive and communicate well. Great instructions for checkin and checkout. A safe walk to Fells, Little Italy, and Harbor East. Eden Garage is super close, and for EV users they have chargers in the garage. Will definitely look to reserve again when headed back for an overnight in Baltimore."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Convenient, clean, comfortable. Accurate description."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"As a female solo traveler in town for a quick night, this was a great place to stay! It was a quick 5 min. walk to Fells Point area, and I felt safe on all the streets (even when walking back to the apartment at night by myself). I was afraid it would be noisy since it’s right off multiple bus lines, but the apartment was far enough back from the road and with the provided fan in the apartment, I fell right asleep! The place matched the pictures perfectly with a comfortable bed. The hosts were fantastic, responsive, and provided me with many local recommendations. I took the busses to get to/ from Penn Station and the free City Circular to explore other areas around Baltimore. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Both hosts and the place are great
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, great communication. Very quiet and super good sleep. great surroundings. We had a lot of fun in the great apartment. Beautiful architecture, very flexible with check out. Thank you to these lovely people to provide us with such a nice place to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"For the location, privacy, ease of access, amenities and more- this airbnb was incredible for the price. The only trick is parking - but we found a spot easily on Caroline Street right around the corner. Will stay again next time we visit friends and family!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about Jen and Scott's place! The studio was a comfortable size, very clean, and stocked full of little extras that we could access (i.e., extra towels, blankets, etc.) My husband and I were both able to work remotely out of the space for a few hours during the day with no issue. The surrounding area is quiet and had easy, free street parking. We walked to dinner one night with no issues.
The real selling point, however, is how much thought has been put into the overall experience. Jen was super responsive via text the whole time we were in town, and the instructions for how to access the space, check-in and check-out procedures, etc. were clearly laid out in advance. It was overall a pleasure staying at the studio, and we'd happily return in the future!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a business trip. Convenient location with lots of things nearby; I just didn’t get the chance to do them. Place was clean and comfy. Jen was very responsive and helpful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a great stay; the hosts were responsive and provided detailed instructions on how to check in and out of the Airbnb!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little respite, conveniently located for walking around town."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Very easy access, very close to Fells point and downtown. Streer parking and cheap lots near the area. The unit is extremely nice, very clean and tidy. Hosts are very responsive and the organization for the check in and out was great."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place close to the restaurants and bars, parking wasn’t too difficult to find (I found free parking a 2 min walk away) We went on a chilly weekend though and the apartment didn’t warm up very well. They had a space heater to use in the apartment"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a gem! Instructions were clear, I had all the info I needed, and the room is gorgeous. The bed is super comfy!!
Great to be so close to Little Italy and *right on* multiple public transportation lines. Super convenient.
Hosts were responsive, thoughtful, and kind."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Heated bathroom floors, need I say more"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Good location
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value stay in cool location. Once inside, a welcome binder shows the backstory of the space, and it's impressive how the hosts have transformed this into a modern yet inviting place to stay! The place was so unique, clean, quiet, and comfortable for our stay. I enjoyed being so close to Fells and Harbor East.
5/5 overall, but solvable points of feedback for the benefit of future guests:
> I had an unannounced 11AM host visit, which interrupted a presentation I was making over Zoom. I didn't respond to the first two sets of knocks, but felt compelled on the third. The host wanted to pick up paint he forgot in the room. Given we had already established contact via app, I didn't understand why the owner couldn't message me to avoid an interruption and my feeling unsafe about who was requesting access.
> A few details in the binder / first-day messaging (e.g. metered parking, process for physical keys) would be useful in listing or confirmation for fully informed booking. Thanks!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jenn and Scott’s place is our favorite stay in fells point. Super clean and everything you need for a weekend trip
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Very central to shopping and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Upstairs neighbor is a loud walker, but the white noise machine and ear plugs help!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Really wonderful place for exploring baltimore.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Had a nice stay at this cozy studio. Its perfect for short term stays, but is not that well suited for longer stays."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little studio for a visit to Baltimore! Small kitchenette, small courtyard, and lovely bathroom; the ceilings are very high and make the space feel more spacious. Plenty of extra linens and 2 space heaters for the colder days. Walking distance to great restaurants. And Jen & Scott we’re very communicative and lovely hosts."
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,it's ok an ok location besides the parking and noise it's fine
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here for an appt at Johns Hopkins. Found free parking around the corner on Caroline. Space was great, bed was comfy, shower was good, and nice high ceilings. Location was very walkable/ scooter to Fells Point and other nice areas. Would stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott were incredibly flexible, responsive, and friendly hosts! The space was as advertised and very private. The area felt safe to walk around and offered plenty to do! We found free parking around the corner without issue. We would definitely recommend this space to anyone looking to explore Baltimore!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great space. Hosts are very communicative. Close to the restaurant we went to. Only thing to say to other bookers is that the entranceway is very narrow—don’t bring huge bags, they’ll be difficult to get through."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was great- just as described. Easy check in and check out!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very happy with our stay. Getting in was easy, great location for downtown, very clean, good price. Would definitely stay here again."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great studio apartment in a convenient location in Baltimore. All the amenities you need for a short or longer stay, in a clean neat spot.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,absolutely wonderful stay! easy check in and check out and the place was very clean.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved the space it was nice and quiet. it was a decent part of the city and it fit all my needs would definitely come back.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything Jennifer and Scott described was what we found. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. We found the location very convenient for our touristing. As a historic neighborhood they were a little quirks to get used to but nothing was problematic at all for people using the bus the bus stop is right there and easy walking around and feels quite safe even though it is an in transition neighborhood. My boyfriend left his car unlocked overnight by accident and not a thing happened.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This studio is good if you’re in town for a couple days. Everything in Fells point, the inner harbor and Camden yards are within a reasonable walking distance. The hosts are very responsive and check in/out process is simple and flexible."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome small place for a quick trip. Hosts were amazing, and very accommodating to our needs!! They allowed us check in early made trip much easier!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Every part of our stay here was perfect! Clear directions, fast, kind, and thorough communication, beautiful and clean space, And great area of town! Would definitely stay here again:)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jennifer and Scott are wonderful hosts who took great care of us. The apartment is charming and in a great location. Lots of restaurants around.
Would come again ;-)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great Airbnb! They have everything you need. And walking distance to so many great places. Had a great stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really lovely unit! I loved the location near Whole Foods and many great restaurants and bars. I traveled alone and felt safe in the neighborhood, and parked 2 days in the recommended lot which was a quick walk to the apartment. Street parking would have been next to impossible, but I didn't mind paying for the lot as it was safe and convenient. I also appreciated the proximity to the Harbor Connector which runs for free on weekdays! The hosts were very helpful and allowed me to check in early. They also prepared a very detailed binder of info about the surrounding area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect, would stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Private, quiet apartment in a walkable area. Close by to restaurants, bars, and other amenities like drug/grocery store. Good value for the space. Hosts made it easy to check in and out, and we’re flexible and accommodating with timing and luggage storage."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean. Super comfy bed! Quick responses from hosts. We would stay here again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I will be back! :) Fantastic stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! Some of the surrounding streets are not where you’d want to walk alone at night, but it’s got great proximity to the harbor and amazing places to eat in Little Italy. Clean, comfortable, and definitely recommended for a day or two in Baltimore"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Would stay again in a heartbeat.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The space is a great studio right downtown close to inner harbor and a bunch of stuff to do. Parking can be a bit of a pain but there are plenty of meters and parking garages around that you can use. Would definitely recommend for anyone new to Baltimore as Jennifer and Scott are both super helpful and have plenty of recommendations for things to see around!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were in town for one evening and this place was exactly what we needed as a base of operations: clean, private, near restaurants, parking, and within walking distance of Camden, the Inner Harbor, and Fell’s Point.
Jennifer and Scott were friendly and great in terms of providing prompt, helpful tips and feedback.
Highly recommended!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing stay. Jen and Scott thought of everything. Prior to our arrival, we were sent things to do and places to eat that were in a comfortable walking distance. Made it really easy to plan our day. They both communicated fast and are very accommodating. We flew in from TX and landed at 9am. We were able to leave our luggage at their residence until it was time to check in (they live around the corner). It was a rainy day and Jen/Scott ensured our room was ready early and moved our luggage for us. Truly went above and beyond. Not to mention, left us some waters and umbrellas. My husband always complains about where we sleep i.e. the mattress is too hard or too soft. I'll just say, he slept like a baby. Would and will definitely recommend."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The location of Jennifer and Scott’s place is ideal: about 4-5 blocks from Fell’s Point and the same for Little Italy. There is also great shopping and wonderful waterfront drinks/dining nearby. The space (studio) is small but enough room where you aren’t tripping over your luggage either. The communication was great with the hosts and there is a small outdoor space for coffee in the morning. We enjoyed our stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My 3rd time booking with Jennifer and Scott was just as great as the first two times. The space is lovely - it's private, convenient, and well put together. Thoughtful touches such as ear plugs (the space is not loud) French press, microwave, mini-fridge and air purifier make for a very comfortable weekend stay. The bed and pillows are super comfortable. Check in process is easy, host communication is perfect - why stay at a hotel?"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and convenient spot with lots of character, would definitely stay here again. Hosts were very communicative."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great studio! Very private. Super comfortable bed. Perfect for 1 or 2 people for a weekend stay.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Second time staying here, and it's a great little spot. Would recommend for a couple who is just staying in Baltimore for a night or two and want to be close to Fells Point, Harbor East, etc."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean apartment. Was very quiet and modern with great decor. Comfortable and very centrally located. Everything I did was within walking distance. I was able to many food options nearby, the harbor, Orioles baseball game, and Little Italy. Highly recommended."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome property would definitely come back here again so convenient to everything in the inner harbor and my friends home which is nearby four blocks away Jen was phenomenal on her instructions check in check out
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott’s place was perfect. Nicely tucked away in a very convenient part of Fells Point. Great little courtyard, walking distance to everything downtown."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay in Baltimore! Walkable to everything and very quiet and cozy for a short stay. We would definitely stay again our next time in Baltimore.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic location, walking distance to everything we were looking for. Jennifer was easy to communicate with and very accommodating!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, cozy room close to the action in Fells Point. Great communication by the hosts!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The studio apartment was clean and cozy, and the location was super convenient. We only had to walk a few blocks to find restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a bit of shopping. We parked our car in a garage just 2 blocks down the street and were able to walk or take public transportation anywhere we wanted to go. Highly recommend for a comfortable and easy stay in Fells Point!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is definitely one of the coolest Airbnbs my husband and I have ever stayed in. You can tell that Jennifer and Scott put a lot of thought and hard work into creating the perfect space. It was walking distance from many restaurants and bars that have live music most nights. We used electric scooters to get to and from farther areas. I would definitely recommend this location for anyone visiting Baltimore- Jennifer and Scott are great hosts!
2022-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"Very clean and cozy but very basic, no TV, just a bed bathroom
And small fridge really. But convenient and cozy. Guest was responsive and nice. Left snacks and ear plugs which I thought was because of being on a busy street, but come 3am I found out it was because of a very noisy upstairs neighbor…. Loud footsteps, sounded like marbles rolling on the ground and jumping or running.
Probably won’t return to this place because of neighbor. Lucky for me I had to get up at that time anyways to go to the airport"
2022-04-01,2,Stayed one night,This location was unfortunately subpar. It does not feel safe even though you are close to Fells Point. The place is across from a gas station and next door to a condemned building. When we arrived to check in there were men loitering on the sidewalk outside of the gate so we didn’t even stop. We went to dinner and actually planned to just go back home but decided to swing back by on our way out of town. When we went back the people were gone so we took our chances and stayed there. The room itself is okay but it wasn’t worth being in that area & having to worry about our car / who would be outside the gate in the morning - next time I’d get a hotel for the peace of mind. Hate to leave a bad review but I was fooled by all the positive reviews into thinking this was going to be a great place to stay and wished someone would have commented on how sketchy it is.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here two nights, and we enjoyed our stay. Absolutely great location! Jen and Scott provided a phenomenal and thorough list of places (restaurants, museums, breweries, etc.) to check out in the area! Thanks again for having us."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location so close to pretty much everything!! Great place to stay if u like going to the local restaurants and bars and all the food I tried around the Airbnb was great!! It was a overall great experience and I highly recommend!!! :)
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great location, spacious, quiet and clean, friendly and communicative hosts, etc."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is conveniently located in the heart of Baltimore. Fells Point and Downtown are just a short walk away! I would definitely recommend staying here on your next trip.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! Easy check-in and everything was explained on the listing. Parking at the garage ended up being more expensive than we thought, but everything else was perfect!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic hosts. The place was clean and the location perfect. Highly recommended.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little space in a good neighborhood. It was perfect for our trip to visit family. A short walking distance to the water and close to lots of great restaurants. The Airbnb itself was clean, perfect for 2 people. Check-in instructions were very well explained so when we arrived it was easy to get in. I appreciated the desk and table as my fiancé and I worked remotely one morning. My only suggestion would be to bring your own pillow if you need head/neck support. The pillows are flat but I ended up using the spare towels (there are a bunch thankfully) for extra support. The bed itself was comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location, super clean studio. Perfect for a weekend getaway! Safe, quiet, private location. Jen and Scott are very thoughtful hosts. They make it easy as pie to get checked in and situated so you can focus more on your endeavors in Charm City."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome space
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It is a great place to stay and walking distance to many restaurants. We had a wonderful stay.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space with a very interesting history. Clean and well stocked. Loved the architecture and the privacy afforded by the quiet courtyard. A block away from a very inexpensive parking garage and only a walk away from cute restaurants and the harbor.
Jennifer and Scott were both super flexible with our scattered schedule, and great at communicating! Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place in a perfect location! We really loved our stay at Jen and Scott’s place. We’d 100% recommend it to anyone!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot to stay for a visit to Baltimore. Close to everything, as advertised, would stay again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The studio was charming, secure, and clean. Great location with easy parking on the street. It was a quick walk to plenty of restaurants and attractions."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best hosts! Truly goes above and beyond to make your experience great, cleanly, awesome location. Street Parking wasn’t bad at all."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Right near some of the best neighborhoods in Baltimore. Secluded and quiet. Great one-stop-shop!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, private space in walking distance of some of highlights of Little Italy and fabulous food!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,great place!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space was exactly as advertised and very close to everything. I would definitely stay again. My only complaint is the parking, but that's city life."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with Jen and Scott. The perfect location to get out and explore Fells. Excellent and prompt communication was greatly appreciated.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space is so cute and convenient to Fells Point, and very well appointed. I appreciated the coffee being available as well!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place in Fell’s Point! Close to everything but also quite and secluded. Very clean, would definitely stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 3 nights for the marathon. Great spot, loved the location. Space was perfect and host was awesome. Would definitely stay again. Just book it."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect spot for our trip to Baltimore. Location was perfect and within walking distance of everything we wanted to do. Jen and Scott were very responsive and helpful the entire time. The studio was nice and roomy and clean and honestly we didn't have any complaints. I would highly recommend this to anyone who would want to spend some time in this area of Baltimore.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot for a few nights. Check in was a breeze. The apt was clean, easy to get to, felt very safe, and the neighbourhood is very cool. Parking was tricky but we were successful in finding long term free spots around the corner on Bank. Be aware there isnt much of a kitchen but there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Joe at Lil Phils was weirdly hilarious, and Greg at the Blarney Stone poured a mean bitter."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Was a nice little place in a convenient location. We walked everywhere to and from there, no problem (if you like walking).
Little Italy is the next street over. Harbor/Fell's Point is a few lovely blocks away.
I was hoping there would be a fan to use, it was a little stuffy during the day...even with the AC on high. Also I couldn't figure out how to turn the heated floors on in the bathroom.
Oh and you can definitely hear people walking (sounded like stomping) above you, so if that bothers you.
Otherwise...clean & good location"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really great location for exploring Fells/Upper Fells. The room was just what we needed, a quiet, clean place to stay while in Baltimore for a busy weekend. Communication with Jen was great. We'd happily stay again when back in the area. One thing to note, there were a lot of mosquitos on the patio outside the room (probably just a product of visiting in September), but worth bringing bug-spray with you if you're susceptible to bites."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Initially we were nervous about the area never having been to Baltimore. However, a pretty short walk brings you to lots of restaurants, taverns, neighborhood markets, Little Italy, Little India, and Poland. Probably others we didn’t have time to discover. We found the people very friendly. Oh, the instructions for entering the space seem complex, but really aren’t. There is no tv, but it wasn’t missed."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great experience
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay! Jennifer and Scott were communicative and helpful. The space was clean and close to downtown Baltimore.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location and space! Comfortable amenities and within walking distance to MECU pavilion, restaurants, etc. would definitely recommend a stay here."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space which provides a peaceful oasis amidst the hustle and chirp of Fells Point. Artful decor is innovative and thoughtful. Communication with hosts was outstanding. Highly recommended
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space! Everything went smooth
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful studio, clean and well kept. They provided us with all the essentials. Close to a lot of restaurants and shops. There’s a parking garage a block away with a cheap overnight rate. Overall a great place to stay at."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful space to stay in and really great hospitality. Felt extremely welcome and will definitely return whenever I can.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The location was very central & the space was nicely done. Jennifer and Scott provided clear instructions and were very responsive!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nothing but positive things to say about our stay. Very clean studio, easy communication wt Jen, and amazing location. Also we found the AC to work fine, and the temperatures were nearing 100 degrees during our stay. Would def recommend and stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,great job communicating
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cool studio apartment with original artwork. Great hosts, great communication, great location, highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great visit to Baltimore! The location was perfect - quiet and relaxing, while still being within walking (or scooting) distance to everything we wanted to do. We will definitely be adding this to our list of future trips!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Jen was very communicative and helpful. Place was in a great location for exploring the city.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, charming, unique place in a great location. Walkable to lots of terrific restaurants and nightlife, but private and quiet. We'll be back!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night. It's good walking distance to a lot of local shops, and is fairly close to Fells Point, which we liked. For being on a busy street, the room we had was in the back across the patio, so we didn't hear any city noise which was great. You can however hear every footstep from above, which can be annoying (especially since my bf is a light sleeper). The place also seems to be battling ants, we killed 1-2 in bed, and the AC does not cool the place down enough. There is no TV, but WIFI, which was appreciated. The bed is also super comfortable. For what the place used to be it's a nice small, clean place to crash for a night if you need something in the city."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a clean affordable place. The photos of the place are very accurate. Jen was very flexible and rapid with communication. Overall, great stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Jen and Scott's place was perfect! Their communication was excellent and made check-in and check-out incredibly easy. The space is clean, modern, sleek, artistic, and most importantly comfortable. Street parking (especially for overnight) was somewhat difficult to find so I parked in a relatively inexpensive parking garage a 5-minute walk away overnight, which was perfect. Overall I am incredibly pleased with my stay and would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great and funky space.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great property, better value than hotel"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The studio was everything we needed for a couples trip. It was centrally located between downtown/harbor area and Fells Point. Jen thought of all the little touches that make an air bnb feel like home and she was super responsive when we had questions! Definitely a great place to stay when visiting Baltimore.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great place for 1-2 people! Walking distance to amazing restaurants and the harbor! We loved this place, and hope to stay here again in the future!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts were very responsive, checkin was easy, great location for fells and walking downtown. We would stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott’s place was perfect for our weekend trip to Baltimore. Close to many good restaurants, bars and harbor. Their place was super clean and exceeded our expectations. Definitely recommend!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Jennifer is very helpful and quick to respond! The location is perfect- a short walk to the harbor and a short walk to Little Italy. We’ll be back!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great host, perfect for a short stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Scott’s place was the perfect place for a quick weekend trip! The space was clean and a short walk away from Fells Point. They communicated how to lock doors and how to contact them if we ran into issues, which we really appreciated. I highly recommend their place!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"The Place is nice and clean, the location is easy to find and easy to check in, within a block away there is a parking garage, which is very safe and close. One tiny issue is because is we are in the first floor, there seems some one upstairs is walking at the very early morning, it is a bit of noise that wake up us very early."
2021-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute little studio in a great, walkable location. We got everywhere on foot. Perfect for one or two people. The nearby bakery makes the air smell DELICIOUS.
The bed is comfy and the WiFi is great. My biggest issues were the dampness of the space (there was a dehumidifier that was full when we arrived), the noisy upstairs neighbors, and it was very toasty! There is an AC unit, but I'm not sure it's super efficient against the hot nights of summer.
Overall, this is an affordable space in a great spot. Cute little shared courtyard, which I enjoyed."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jen/Scott’s place was perfect ! Great communication in coordinating check in. They held my luggage for me prior and moved it into the studio for me. Had everything I needed when I was there. Would def stay there again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, unique space to stay, perfect for one night in Baltimore. Nice touches like snacks, and a white noise machine to help with city sounds. Location is on the border of Fell’s Point. We enjoyed it! And Jennifer was super prompt with communication. Thanks!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The space is really cool with the courtyard. It's big for a studio. Pretty clean and the shower is cool. They have info on what the building used to be, so it was cool to learn about how the building came about! We would stay again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 in everything - price/location/communication/style. SO MANY SPARE TOWELS/WASH CLOTHS/PILLOWS/BLANKETS!!
AC wasn’t as powerful as I was hoping but otherwise 10/10, would stay again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room was very clean and had all the necessities and little amenities that made our stay an actual pleasure and not just a place to crash. The location is perfect for anyone who wants to visit the beautiful Fells Point neighborhood! Street parking was a little difficult, though."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Scott have a great set up that we highly recommend for anyone looking to spend some time in Baltimore. The location is mere blocks away from Fells Point, and along with it some truly must hit spots. Parking couldn't be easier, as there is a overnight garage one block over. And communication was easy and thorough. The space was nice and modern, and perfect for people looking to explore the city with a comfy spot to come back to. There were a couple points where the neighbors above were a bit loud, but it was rare and in no way anything to ruin the experience. We would (and just might) stay there again for how convenient and accessible it was."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great for a quick trip back to Baltimore. Jen was a great host. Would stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little studio, ideal for a quick trip."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Right in the middle of DT. Most places we needed to go was a 10 min walk or less. Hosts were very communicative too and the little court yard is really cute.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jenn's place was the perfect spot for our weekend trip to Baltimore. We were in walking distance to so many restaurants and things to do. Jenn was very responsive. Highly recommend!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect stay for a weekend getaway to the Baltimore area. It’s a great location that’s tucked away from the main, busy stretch but still within walking distance to the inner harbor. The co-host was very welcoming and available via text throughout the stay if any issues or questions arose. I highly recommend!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very thoughtfully designed space and cozy touches. We enjoyed our stay here and felt very comfortable overall.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a quick trip to Baltimore, and the space was perfect! It was super close to the harbor and all of the bars and restaurants we wanted to hit in Fell’s Point. Jen was very helpful in providing trip suggestions and the room was very stylish."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer’s and Scott’s place was wonderful! It was very clean and stylish. We loved the location - it’s within walking distance to all that Fells Point has to offer. Would definitely stay here again!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very well detailed and clean. Gave a lot of suggestions on where to go!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place! Small yet just what we needed for a nice weekend away. Comfortable and easy!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Baltimore City is my Hometown and the unique historic spaces to die for! Jennifer & Scott’s place didn’t disappoint! Super unique, historic and great location! Love the outside courtyard and can’t wait to visit again! Thank You!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great location and easy access
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What an adorable studio! It was perfectly outfitted for our short stay. The WFH space was nicely set up and the kitchenette was appropriately supplied for our needs. The architecture is fun! I would definitely stay again.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful studio perfect for a weekend getaway. Walkable to anywhere you’d like to go in Baltimore. The location is safe, and it smells like fresh baked bread every morning! It’s a nice way to start the day. The studio is clean and attractive. It’s a small space but feels bigger than it is. Jen is a great host too. She made sure we had everything we needed with some Baltimore flair. Compared to the hotels close by, this is a much better and more convenient value. Fells Point has a lot to offer and this location is one of those gems."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"good:
- good location, minutes away from broadway street nightlife area, felt pretty safe
- nice snacks and a thoughtful note left for us
- good informational binder with local information and history
- clean/no problems with the room
- decent shared courtyard
not as good:
- shower never got very hot, it was comfortable but just not as hot as i would have liked
- concrete floors (personal preference)
- small space
overall would stay here again"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great clean spot! The bed is super comfy and the bathroom was big for a studio space. There was some minor noise from whoever lives above the building walking around but nothing major since we didn’t stay in the Air BnB too much. Would definitely stay again!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer was in frequent contact with us our entire stay to make sure everything was perfect for us. It was a perfect place to stay for a weekend. They even had personal little touches to welcome us.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"perfect location, exactly what we needed for a weekend trip"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute and stylish space in a central, convenient location. Jen was quick to respond to any questions, and I would highly recommend a stay here!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location offered by Scott and Jen is simple and secluded a tender nook to escape some of the noise of the inner harbor and rest easy. We were able to interact with a lovely couple who were also staying under Jen and Scott. The room is modern and quaint a perfect place to unwind and disconnect after a long day exploring the sights and tastes the inner harbor has to offer and the many locations offered by our gracious hosts. The bathroom has a heated floor and was peaceful with a great shower. We did have a little bit of trouble with ants and a leak above the toilet. However, this is not a reflection of the comfort and sincerity for which Jen and Scott care for their residents. Jen was professionally and quickly responsive to any issue and I would be happy to stay with them anytime in the future."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very neat and cute space. My girlfriend and I stayed here and it was the perfect size for us. The bed was comfortable and the heated tile in the bathroom was a nice touch!! The fridge and microwave was perfect for leftovers. They had a booklet with a lot of places to get food, get souvenirs, etc which was helpful. Whenever we had questions or concerns they responded right away! I felt really safe staying there with the custom lock code on the gate and the lock on the sliding door as well! Highly Recommend for a weekend or week retreat."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice hosts and very clear instructions for entrance!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cool studio! Great location! We enjoyed it!

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little stay. Had everything we needed there. Good location close to little Italy and little India. Me and my girl had a great time
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at the this property. Jen and Scott were very responsive and flexible during my check-in. Will definitely visit again when I return to the area. Looking forward to warmer weather to enjoy the inviting courtyard area.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Expect a space that is visually appealing, though a lil bit smaller than expected. The high ceilings and clean space help my significant other and I forget about the covid world outside. Would highly recommend booking and I'll be back!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and very private little studio. Location was good, right at the edge of where it gets too industrial. We were able to find parking outside or one block away all three days we were there and walked down to Fells Point multiple times for food and coffee. The tall ceilings and heated bathroom floors were very nice luxuries. Great little touches like phone charging cables of all sorts were already there. I recommend it if you're looking for a downtown experience close to Fells and the restaurants"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The place is great for business or for a quick stop in Baltimore. Jennifer is great and very responsive
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent AirBnB. I've been to numerous AirBnB and John is a great host, proactive in his communication, accommodating, and very reasonable. Unit was clean, comfortable, and located in a walkable neighborhood. A bit loud cause you are right off the street as others have said but I did not find it particularly bothersome and was able to sleep without any issues. Would stay here again. Thanks John!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you for the great place to stay John! The fireplace was such a treat as well as the comfy furniture! The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the bedding was so soft and comfy. We honestly did not want to get out of bed this morning, lol. We loved all the walkable restaurants. The walks felt so safe and peaceful. We wish we could have stayed longer! Hope to come back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I had such a great stay at John’s! It’s quiet and spacious with all the amenities. The bed was also very comfortable! Highly recommend! John was also very responsive to all my questions and offered early check-in when my flight was changed.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay! Cozy, comfy and private. So many great amenities throughout, everything you need and more. Found parking right out front. Walkable to all the things and more. 10/10 experience! Great space for a couple to get away for the night. Highly recommend! Also, John is an incredible host. Attentive, proactive and available, if you should need! Thanks again for everything!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, clean, spacious. We stayed here the night of our wedding—was the perfect place to come back to after the ceremony! John was easy to work with, helpful, and friendly. Lovely neighborhood and pleasant for a morning walk to one of the nearby cafes. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John’s place was fantastic! A great price for a couple nights’ stay close to fell’s point and the harbor. The space was exactly as described in the pictures — I was actually impressed by the size of the bathroom and the laundry/storage room which did not come across in the photos. The studio was absolutely charming and really made me wistful/nostalgic for Baltimore (I wish I lived there when I was in the city!). The bed, couch, etc were all very comfy and well designed and prepared for the guest.
Lastly, John was incredibly thoughtful and proactive. When I asked for a possible luggage storage situation upon checkout, he really went out of his way to see if this was possible and called me as well. A+ service on top of being available by text regularly.
Thanks for a great stay and hope to be back soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay! It was well kept, clean, and just beautiful all around. John was very responsive and always checked in to make our stay more comfortable."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a delightful time at this Airbnb. Loved the fireplace as it added to the relaxful atmosphere! We simply parked our car for the couple days and walked to everything. It was a safe neighborhood , very close to the Patterson Park and a cute little cafe called Charmed Kitchen where we ate our dinners. Used the kitchen for cooking breakfast. We enjoyed watching March Madness inside this cozy place! Easy drive to the Baltimore airport where we picked our kids up at the end of our stay:)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of my favorite Airbnbs and John is the best host. Always a good experience and I highly recommend it

My favorite part of the apartment is how collected and tasteful everything was — and the double-head shower! 👏🏼 Thank you, John, for your A+ hospitality. I’ll be back. :-)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment is so unique and comfortable in a great part of Baltimore. We immediately wished we could stay longer! Check-in was easy, thanks to step by step instructions in the app that somehow very few hosts actually use. A parking spot is available but we were able to park on the street directly in front of the apartment. And we had our bikes with us and were able to take them off the car and store them in the (locked) stairwell. The decor of the apartment is so well thought out, with neat antique furniture mixed with contemporary pieces. The bed was incredibly comfortable - my husband slept a full two hours later than he does at home! And there were thoughtful touches throughout. We walked to a couple neighborhood bars and then a recommended cafe the next morning for breakfast - loved the places and the neighborhood. We don’t live far from Baltimore and totally take for granted that we can go anytime - and then we don’t! We can’t wait to come back soon and stay here!"

We highly recommend it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and spacious apartment. One of the best beds ever - hands down. Wish all Airbnb listings took their beds seriously. Super soft and comfy. Amazing shower. On a main road, but no worries about that - the windows were nearly soundproof. I slept great. Kitchen is small but well-appointed and I had everything I needed and more. Wonderful that this host does not charge a cleaning fee - I wish more would offer that! Great location in town. I didn't get to explore much, as I was there for a seminar which lasted all day, but the apartment is in a great location - close to everything, but safe and quiet. Temperature was perfect - nice and warm. Loved the fireplace. Highly recommend. John is friendly and responsive."

I love the two shower heads in the shower and black appliances in the bathroom. It was definitely a unique place and I’ll definitely be back when I am in town. John as well was excellent in his communication and went above to make sure I was comfortable. Thank you John!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem!! It has a lot of places within walking distance, and even a fabulous park! Fells point is a short walk and there is a lot to see along the way. The place was very cozy and exactly as described. The real winner is the fireplace! Definitely added to the charm! Would absolutely recommend and we plan to stay again if we come back to town."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wanted to avoid boring so this was the place for me - stylish, comfy, super clean, well thought out - had everything I needed and then some. The row house neighborhood in old Baltimore was great! I was charmed by the festive strings of lights most of the neighborhood had strung over the sidewalks from house to tree to house and again all down the blocks. It felt like a little party walking to a very nice restaurant 3 blocks away.
Street parking was easy arriving before 4pm, parked right in front of the door.
John’s communication was top notch - super responsive, proactive, everything about the stay was clear.
Stay here - you’ll enjoy it!"

It's clean, cozy, and just in such a lovely location. We actually walked from here all the way to the National Aquarium through Fells Point. It's an easy 40 min ish walk that gives you time to explore the neighborhoods. Autumn in Baltimore is soon beautiful! We loved being right next to Patterson Park. John was a communicative and clear. The stay couldn't have been better. That fireplace is clutch!"

We were close enough to walk to the waterfront for shopping and eating. The apartment is spotless, well-appointed, and exudes charm. The furniture and bed are very comfortable. John was an excellent communicator and host and was available for any questions. The off-street parking was a nice bonus. We would not hesitate to stay in John's apartment again and we would highly recommend his apartment for a lovely getaway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Chose this location after seeing hotels wanting more for no amenities! We will return when visiting again for the simple fact it feels like a home with all the comforts. Easy street parking (we brought two cars) Area felt safe/secure at all times. Kitchen has everything you would ever need! Very quiet outside of the random straight piped motorcycle ripping around (as expected) host has the best simple check in pictures/instructions I’ve ever encountered on this site!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"John’s place was perfect for our short stay in the area. It was very clean and comfortable. There were a lot amenities, in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. John was very friendly and helpful. Thank you! We would stay here again."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great rental! Exactly as described, and just what we needed. Host also provides amazing check in instructions; photos and everything. Everything was super easy. Be aware that while the place is air conditioned, there are no controls for the AC within the unit itself, so if you’re like my husband and need an icebox to sleep you’ll need to request that specifically, but the host was super accommodating of our annoying AC demands!"

The unit is awesome - nice & updated, yet features like the exposed brick and fireplace offer the charm/comfort factor for your temporary home-away-from-home. Great bathroom (dual shower is a super plus!), and it was also really convenient to have the ability to do laundry with the washer and dryer.

He was always available, and responded right away. Most helpful though: we had a messed up transportation arrangement, and needed a place to store our luggage a whole day after AM check out. He helped us without charging a fee. we are thankful, his hospitality really made our trip sorry free.
The apartment was an amazing beautiful loft studio. Super clean. double shower was really cool. The bed was really big and comfy. We enjoyed evenings relaxing on the comfy couch watching some TV.
The kitchen looks small, but it's fully stocked. Even got some nice sparkling water for free.
Location is great, it's in a safe neighborhood, we can walk or bus to the harbor and art museum, etc
I loved the no cleaning fee feature. Personally I don't mind doing some light cleaning as an appreciation and respect for the host.

The apartment itself was perfect! The stairs were a little steeper than I expected but doable. The shower was my favorite part (2 shower heads and a built in shower chair!) all the furniture was comfy and the whole place just immediately felt like home to us. The kitchen is perfect for basic meals and re-heating things and even had all the basic condiments. The coffee grinder was a life saver because we forgot ours! Oh also, go walk around Patterson Park it is across the street basically and beautiful!
Highly recommend John’s place. You will love it."

One piece of feedback I will add and this could just be particular to me because I’m not a custom to sleeping in the city I would flip the room arrangement around to have the bed at the other end of the room so that you were not on the street side with the noise. I got used to but it did take me a minute to fall asleep again could just be totally my experience and most people that live in the city or visit the city would not find this unusual it would not keep me from staying there again just some food for thought. Wonderful host and very Cozy bed;)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This studio apartment is a perfect spot to stay at in Baltimore. John keeps the place fully equipped with bathroom and kitchen necessities.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved John's place and look forward to going back. A studio/loft apt. on second floor of charming single family structure in great old neighborhood central to most of urban Baltimore. With full accoutrements. A doable walk to buzzy
restaurants, but there are some restaurants sparsely sprinkled very close by. John arranged for private parking but we hardly used it because street parking was generally available.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"John's place in Baltimore is awesome!! First of all, I love the neighborhood. My cousins used to live nearby, so I've always loved this area, but wow, it's gotten so beautiful over the last few years.
Stayed here with a Girlfriend for a night out in Baltimore. The apartment was so great and comfortable. Parking super easy across the street. We had a glass of wine on the fabulous and very comfortable sofa with the fire going and music before we ubered to dinner in Fells Point...after which we had a lovely walk home, hitting some perfectly Baltimore dive on the way back.
The King bed was so comfortable and for two girls sharing...we had no notice of the other one in the bed...there was an extra blanket in the blanket box, so we each had our own. So many lovely touches like this made it such a perfect stay...tons of amenities in the little kitchenette as well.
We walked a couple blocks to a cute coffee place in the morning and then walked with our coffees in Patterson Park....just a glorious and perfect stay. Thanks John!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John’s place prioritizes all the great creature comforts in life. Fireplace, comfy bed, great sheets, duel head shower, a relaxing space to lounge. Beautiful neighborhood that felt very safe for a solo traveler. I will def be back!"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"John’s place is incredible. I think the pictures don’t really do it justice… it is very nice, clean, and cozy. 😁
I had a little trouble opening the lock box at first— but probably because I never used a lock box before 🙃 just have to push the button in and slide down the small door first, then put in the combination, then push down the little lever to open the whole thing. I was just confused… & this is a heads up for anyone who plans to stay here.
Other than that, this place was PERFECT for the incredible weekend I had. The fire is remote controlled, so I was able to go to bed with the fire still going and then turn it down/off from the bed. 😊 The lighting is amazing— most of the lights have dimmers so you can create your own ambience. Then there’s a surround sound system— I was blasting Christmas music while I got ready for the events I had. 😁🎄🎶 the bathroom was nice & clean and stocked with shampoo, soap, tp, towels… anything you could need. There’s even a laundry room with a washer & dryer— I was able to do some laundry :) so convenient!!
Oh, AND, it’s very close to so many shops, restaurants, Fells Point Harbor… all of it. Great location!! I had a wedding by the harbor and it took less than 10 minutes to get there.
5 stars all across the board, 10/10 would recommend, def will book again the next time I go to Baltimore. :)"

At the time of booking, we didn’t realize it was only 4 minutes away. It was the perfect location. The rental is on the second floor so you will have to climb some stairs. Once there you’ll find a charming environment with ambient lighting and wonderful architecture. The rental is large and very well equipped and the king bed was the most comfortable we’ve had in an Airbnb. John was super nice and very responsive. We plan to go back for a more fun occasion.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Johns place is the perfect Baltimore stay. It had a lot the things we are looking for in an AirBNB: privacy, charm, comfort, well stocked. The unit is perfectly located a half block from Patterson Park on a gorgeous historic street in Butchers Hill. You can easily drive or Uber anywhere in the city and can walk to Fells, Canton, etc. The kitchen is well appointed and stocked. The shower is luxurious. The bed is blissful. The design is hip. We look forward to staying at Johns place for future return trips to Baltimore. Above everything else, John is a great host who is very accommodating and responsive."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amazing apartment in an up and coming part of Baltimore. Tons of food options at walking distance from the place. Super clean, spacious, and super host. John was super responsive. He even brought us some corkscrews at almost 11pm, after I sent him a msg on AirBnB. I was hoping for one the day after... instead he was amazing and gave me a couple plus a stopper. Top place, top host: Highly recommended! Love the fact he doesn’t charge a crazy cleaning fee like others do. Thanks John!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very cool space and a fantastic choice if you want the Baltimore rowhouse experience. Very close to a great park. In-unit laundry is super convenient and the small kitchen still has everything. Enjoyed reading next to the fireplace.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome spot, could not more highly recommend staying at John's due to the neighborhood it's in and its proximity to the park. Very comfortable bed too!"
