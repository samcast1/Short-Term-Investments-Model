2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sent our crew down there for a job. The guys absolutely loved the house and there stay! One thing they really admired was the host changing out the x-mas tree to 4th of July decor! Would def. stay again! Thank you
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sylvia’s place was better than advertised, it’s a perfect central location with everything close by yet very private. We highly recommend her place if you’re ever visiting the Defiance area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice quiet and accessible spot.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space, a bargain for the square footage! It is a reception room, with apartment rooms attached - and we get to enjoy the entire reception area! Enormous kitchen with a cozy breakfast booth. Every piece of cooking equipment you might need. Comfortable beds in beautiful modern rooms. We'll be back!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, beautiful place! Great host!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Second Story Airbnb is a great place to stay, so spacious, clean, and has a nice atmosphere! I stayed in the queen suite, just me and my toddler and had no issues, he loved all the floor space to play with his trucks! I had my family over, we grilled out and had more than enough space for everyone. The location is also great, right on the main street, and walking distance to anything downtown. I'll be staying at the Second Story for my next trip to Defiance!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The best place u could ever stay....With the beautiful outlook of downtown
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is even better than it shows in the pictures. The huge open area with pool table, card table and multiple eating areas is great for entertaining. The sleeping areas are very comfortable and everything is open and spacious. We have a family of six and it was so nice to spread out instead of being crammed into a couple hotel rooms or a typical 'suite'. The location was perfect with a great view of downtown and the courthouse. Several restaurants are within a block - Including Bud's! The library and Kingsbury park are within walking distance. The only drawback is having to go up quite a few stairs to get to the second story. It wasn't a problem for us, but it would be for someone who was less mobile."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,we love staying here! so much room for my toddler to stretch her legs
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place, highly recommend"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,A great stay in the Queen Room at the Second Story. Was the perfect place for a work colleague and me instead of the local run of the mill chain hotel. What a spacious comfortable space.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great comfortable rooms and very clean.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Since I had stayed here before, my expectations were high, and I was not disappointed. A welcome change from the chains out by the highway. I wanted to spend some time on the deck, but the unusually warm muggy October weather kept me inside in front of the big screen.
Thanks Sylvia for such a comfortable, wonderful stay."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The absolute best place you will stay in the entire county. Beautiful and spacious.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay through and through! You will not be disappointed.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the Second Story and Sylvia was a wonderful host. She met us when we arrived, showed us where everything was and reviewed any important details. The space is much larger than we expected and was beyond perfect for us. For the price and location, it simply could not be beat. We were able to cook meals and even took advantage of the deck and grill one night. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Defiance."
2016-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very cool pad in western Ohio, but I had a brief one-night stay before heading off early to work.
There was one other guest staying in the master bedroom during my stay, but he was a friendly guy and it was no trouble at all to share the common areas.
The space would be perfect for a gathering of family or friends and I unfortunately didn't get to make the most of it during my short visit.
Sylvia seems an experienced host, the check in process was seamless and communication excellent."
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Yes, we felt welcome. Everything was as described and more. My family had a great time in Defiance. Sylvia and her husband responded quickly when we had a question about the TV. What a TV!
Sylvia's place, The Second Story, is superb!

The kitchen is phenomenal! We enjoyed cooking on the grill and using this nearly, professional kitchen."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Sylvia was easy to work with! She was easy to reach when we arrived and check in was quick and smooth. The accommodations were beautiful and very comfortable. We will definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this host and facility!
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sylvia Knocked it out of the park!! The place was amazing and I have to stress, the pictures simply do not do this place justice. The layout is very inviting and a great meeting place for extended family and friends to come to and visit. This place offers enough amenities for a group of people to have a comfortable dinner.(Cooking and Serving) Sylvia was very inviting, very attentive and always available to answer any questions. Sylvia was a fantastic host and her place is true gem.

5 Stars!!! I would recommend this place to anyone."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Erika’s home was way more beautiful than the pictures even make it look!!! House had plenty enough room for all of us and upon entry of the home it smelled fantastic!!! I smelled it on and off during our whole stay. Only thing I wish was I could’ve tried the ice cream place attached to the house ☹️
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Would highly recommend! A little of the middle of no where, but very quiet and peaceful."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I stayed here with My family for my sister‘s wedding. It is such a beautiful home! The little ice cream shop next to it so cute! It really was a great find.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Loved staying at Erika’s place. Checkin was a breeze and Erika was very quick to respond. The Ice Cream shop attached is also amazing and great prices. Check out was seamless and easy.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our family was in town for a wedding. Erika's house was perfect! It was clean and accomodating. It had everything we needed for the weekend. And, the ice cream next door was delicious!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Eirka’s home was inviting, cute and absolutely gorgeous landscaping. We found the beds to be super comfortable, great layout and it had everything g anyone would need in a stay. Plenty of towels and linens. Most importantly, the house was extremely clean and inviting. Would stay again if in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home which comfortably slept 7 adults. The inside is tastefully decorated and immaculate. Our host was quick to respond and welcoming.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Erika was very accommodating.
We found the perfect spot to see our 3rd eclipse!! I believe it was the best one so far! It was a quiet spot, the weather was great! The ice cream parlor was hopping! A good time was had by all. Thank you!!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"This is a very cute place that was very clean. It had everything we needed. It is attached to an ice cream shop, which would be great for kids."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful stay and highly recommended! I loved the look of the house. Everything was clean and spotless. Quick and friendly communication. Highly recommended!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home. We enjoyed our stay. Everything perfect
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,2nd time staying here. Very clean and homey feeling.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was immaculate and stylish, a beautiful blend of farmhouse and Boho. Comfy mattresses, large rooms, and the light was on when we arrived at 9 pm. We 100% would stay here again and recommend others to snatch this up!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Erika’s place was clean and cozy. All comforts of home. Easy to find. Great scenery.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, cozy home that’s perfect for the family"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10 host and stay. Couldn't find a thing to complain about if I tried.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It fit our needs for our brief stay for a family function. She was kind enough to allow additional family members visit for dinner after a family celebration of life. It was a bit chilly in the upstairs rooms. Being from Texas, the snow and dinner bell outside were a hit with a 4 yr old!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Erika’s place was lovely. Well-equipped, spacious, and well-maintained. It was easy to host family there and she made it easy to check in, figure out where to go, and settle in.
If you’re sensitive to road noise, it might be a be loud, but I didn’t find it bothersome at all. If someone in your party struggles with steep stairs, plan on them having the downstairs bedroom- it’s a beautiful older home with steeper stairs than homes built more recently."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Huge space with 4 bedrooms. Ice cream shop was awesome as well. My daughters loved the trip.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"I was thinking that some of the farmland might be more walkable, and there wasn’t really any place to take a walk, but other than that, it was great."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay at Erika's lovely house. We came to Napoleon (my husband's hometown) for a family wedding. The house is just as advertised...very clean, nicely decorated, and every need addressed. Our location was 10 minutes from the church and reception venue."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great stay in a country home attached to a family owned and run coffee shop / restaurant.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home with everything we needed!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice traditional style house that fits in great with local tradition. Would be amazing in the summer. Clean and well-maintained. Definitely will look here again if staying with the family, but even alone is much better than what you'll get from the local hotel/motel for the price."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place and the cafe is awesome too.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place! Only stayed one night as we were just visiting Cedar Point. Brought dinner with us but the ice cream shop next door had some good food at a great price. Wish we could have stayed longer. Will stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exceptional stay and the ice cream shop next door was awesome! Great variety of flavors and tasted delicious. I’d highly recommend this location if you’re in the area or want a nice peaceful getaway.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our large family needed a place to stop for the night. They did a good job of fixing up an older farmhouse. Plenty of space & beds, clean, and a well supplied kitchen. My 6 year old daughter loved the room with the floral wallpaper and had to sleep in there. All of the decor was pretty but simple and uncluttered which is the way I like it. I’m sorry they can’t have a larger supply of toilet paper available. One of our young sons accidentally had a roll drop off the stand into the toilet almost as soon as we got there so we had to make do with one roll for 2 toilets! :-) Right next to a busy road so there’s plenty of noise from passing vehicles. Not a deal breaker though, definitely would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Erika was quick to answer any questions. It was clean, comfortable, and the sunrise over the cornfields was beautiful."
2023-09-01,4,Group trip,"Clean, spacious. We are on our way to a wedding. The location and number of bedrooms suits our need."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family stayed here for my daughters wedding . It fit our family great. Very lovely home. Enjoyed it tremendously. The only fallback I would say would be the parking. You share it with the customers with the ice cream /café, which I really didn’t care for other than that it was a perfect trip. Thank you so much for your hospitality"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Erika’s place was exactly what we needed for our trip to Napoleon. Quite charming and attractive aesthetics. The family and I had a wonderful time and will definitely come back, if we’re ever in the area again. We also frequented the Sweet Dreams Ice cream shop next door. Here we found excellent ice cream, prices and fast and friendly service. Definitely a great stay and value. Thanks again for the charming stay and pleasant hospitality."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house. Loads of beds which is perfect for our family. Nice open space living room/dining room. The backyard was our favourite, words can’t describe, must be there to experience it. We really wanted to try the ice cream / lunches there but unfortunately we were in a rush and there was a bit of a line up. Wish we could have spent more time there. Erika was an amazing host, very accommodating and helpful and always responded quickly. No issues at all. We do a lot of Airbnb and hotels in many cities and towns - This definitely was one of our favourites."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had everything that we needed!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We traveled to Ohio to give my mother an opportunity to revisit her roots. Erika's house was the perfect place for us to not only revisit my mother's hometown, but also to allow for family to visit. The opportunity to visit right next door at the Sweet Dream Ice Cream shop was so convenient, not to mention the food and ice cream options are not to be missed. Erika was an exceptional host, we had a little glitch with the house lock, but Erika was responsive and was onsite to fix the concern. Erika was extremely accommodating with our travel needs with our arrival time. The house is cozy, comfortable and met all of our needs. The descriptions were accurate and I recommend paying attention to the description regarding the stairs leading to the three bedrooms upstairs. They are steep and narrow and can be challenging for some. I would not hesitate staying there again the next time we are in town. Thank you Erika and Barry for being such a wonderful host."
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful and spacious. I will be honest it is a little weird that customers from the ice cream shop are sitting in the front and back yard.
The rooms were huge! Lots of space which was so nice.
Made a very memorable weekend with my friends that I haven’t seen in over a year and a great start to my first week visiting Ohio."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful garden. I slept very well downstairs Traveled with 6 family members. Some family members have disabilities with service animals so we really appreciate the home could acommodate a family of 6. I wish we could have tried Sweet Dream ice cream, but our check in and out times didnt align with business hours. Gps had trouble finding with address provided. There were a few spiders, but I guess thats expected with the lush landscape. I loved it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, nicely decorated.
Yard was great fir kids to play in and ice cream shoppe attached to the house was a hit."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just a perfect modern day farm house, clean, comfortable, truly a little gem! Highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This was a wonderful place to stay. The accommodations were clean and very welcoming. It was the perfect spot to spend the weekend for a wedding in Defiance.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"It was a great house, perfect location. Perhaps she could get in touch with the owners of the Barn at Honey Blossom Orchard. It is a wedding venue, and that's why we rented the house!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Erika’s place was great! Tastefully renovated and spacious house. Suited us well:)

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home in a beautiful setting and wonderful host! A welcome sight after a long cross country drive. As we walked through the front door, we immediately felt at home. Comfortable beds, spotless and well-stocked kitchen, fast and reliable internet. Close to downtown Napoleon and grocery shopping. Checking in and out were a breeze. Thanks so much for having us, Erika!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was lovely. Perfect for my family coming together from different states for my son's wedding. The ice cream next door was an added plus for some of my family 😁 Definitely keep this home in mind the next time we have family traveling to this area. Thank you
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what was needed for or large family and extended guests. Large open concept perfect for hosting a college graduation dinner. Too bad we found this gem so late in our college visits. Yummy ice cream and dinner too!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful quiet country stay. The ice cream parlor right next door is definitely a big plus!

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home. It was very clean, had everything we needed from linens to stocked kitchen. We were in the area for a family birthday party. It was a great place to stay accommodating 9 people comfortably. The landscaping is beautiful with lots of spring flowers. Would like to come back when everything is in bloom. The attached ice cream stand and restaurant were awesome. Definite 10/10 rating. Would stay here again and would highly recommend!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pictures don’t do this one justice. Super cute, cozy farmhouse with everything we needed for our party of 8. Plenty of towels and beds for everyone plus a well-stocked kitchen. We spent the weekend at a tournament in nearby Archbold, and it was so nice to have a home base to return to each evening. Ericka was super responsive to any questions and a great host. The ice cream shop next door was a huge perk as well. Would love to come back in the summer when the flowerbeds are in bloom as they look very well maintained 🌸🌺!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was very nice. Lots of space for activities. The beds were very comfortable to sleep on.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,This home was perfect for our family wedding weekend. It easily accommodated our 7 guests and provided large “hang out” space for our family to gather together. The home is lovely and Erika responded quickly to any questions and requests. I love the country setting while being only a couple minutes from town. And my family enjoyed the delicious ice cream too! Thank you so much for providing such a lovely home!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place for our large family to crash plus a delicious ice cream place attached. Very clean and well appointed. Would stay again!

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Few hiccups at the beginning but host made it all right in the end. Would recommend the home.
2023-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Place was not the cleanest dirty dishes left in dishwasher, dusty, noticed dried toothpaste in sink, bathtub wasn’t very clean. Very disappointing for the price. It should at least be clean."

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Clean and spacious place to stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and two of my sisters stayed here while in town for our family's Christmas gathering. We originally booked for December, but a snowstorm caused us to reschedule. Erika was very accommodating in making the change of date happen for us. We loved the house. It was spotless and had everything we needed. From a kitchen stocked with everything needed to prepare each of our appetizers for the party to enough bedrooms and bathrooms for the 7 of us to get ready. We will definitely be staying here again for future family gatherings. We all loved the ice cream next door as well, such an added plus!! Would recommend to anyone looking for a location in this area."

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Erika's charming Airbnb home was just perfect for what we needed for our family's small Christmas gathering.

We would definitely consider another stay!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home was more than we expected! It was such a great stay. The pictures do not do it justice. Erika was great as well! She was very quick to respond and was so friendly. We would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. And we ourselves will be back!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely adorable place! It was perfect for a weekend visiting family.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place to stay in NW Ohio. It’s big, clean, has a nice yard, and it is a great place to stay in the country. Sometimes I think I won’t be surprised by how good an Airbnb is, but this one is exactly as advertised and really nicer than you would image. I wish I could have stayed much longer and also hit the ice cream stand more often."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for what we needed! I took my daughters on a girls’ trip and we LOVED the house and scenery! The house was so welcoming! We’ve stayed at an Airbnb for all of our family vacations and this was by far our favorite! We will DEFINITELY be going back!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely home, nicely furnished, beautiful garden and next to a great ice cream shoppe!"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This felt like a really homey place to walk into after a long day of driving. We had a quiet and comfortable night. But we were disappointed to learn a few days before our stay that the ice cream shop would be closed, as that was one of the chief reasons we had booked it (and drove a bit out of our way for it too). But overall the price was right for us and we we would stay here again. Be advised that there are a few basic check-out to dos that aren't always required for airbnb guests (stripping beds, linens into baskets, taking out the trash)."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay at this newly renovated house. Decorations and landscaping were beautiful. Highly recommended trying the local cafe for lunch & ice cream! It was great!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great clean place to stay in lieu of a hotel during my business travels. Johanna was not only responsive, but proactive with extra offerings. Comfortable bed and pillows. The instant oatmeal was super handy for me and plenty of coffee with cream and sugar and a few snacks. Very nice. Beautiful surroundings…I hope to come back when it’s a little warmer out and enjoy the pond and a walk around the landscaped and well-kept property."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Okay first things first - Napoleon, Ohio is adorable!

Lisa & Mike's listing was exactly as described. super clean, they had all these little extras like lotion, fans, snacks and just obviously took extra care to make surethe stay was as seamless as possible. I would recommend this place hands down. The only issue we ran in to is that the stairs leading up to the bedrooms upstairs are a bit steep. My 82 year old mother was unable to navigate them (bad knees, hips, all the things) so she stayed down on the couch and was just as comfy there as anywhere!"

Driving 2 hours one way was very stressful but I needed the job, around day 70 and only 21 days left for me to be hired in and get in the union with benefits. I found Julie’s place, A place that was comfortable and allowed me to get some rest and be closer to my job and not far from my Mother. I’m a full time employee at Eagle Machinging now with 401k etc. and couldn’t have done it without the assistance of this Beautiful place that Julie has provided. I am deeply humbled and appreciate people like Julie. Thanks for everything here and I will continue to tell everyone about this Wonderful place.. Heaven sent!!!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I’ve lost count of how many times my dogs and I have stayed at Julie’s places in Napoleon, they are all absolutely perfect! I love the Marigold Suite at the Emporium.

Julie is always a gracious host who communicates proactively and is available if you need her. I always look forward to our stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Julie was very helpful and accommodating. Loved the decor of the whole building. Loved having access to laundry and a kitchen even though it was just a bedroom. The bedroom is small but having access to the entire building makes up for it. Would definitely stay here again. Actually, might try to book her bridal suite if I ever return to Napoleon. Got to see it in person and it is amazing. Thanks Julie for the pleasant stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,awesome place

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Julie’s place was perfect for us! Small and cozy, the bunk beds were super comfy. The shower room was SUPER clean, soft towels, body wash, shampoo and conditioner inside as well which was a lifesaver for me because I forgot to pack mine😂, it was a perfect stay!!"

Thank you again, Julie, for another wonderful visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place to stay! We have been here before and plan to visit again! Very grateful for such a comfortable, clean and safe place to stay with my dogs!

2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Host was great, guests complained about our 1st shift schedule but that's nothing on the host. Big beds."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We needed a quick rest from a long drive, and this was perfect for my husband and I and our 11-year-old son. We love to support local businesses like this, and it was much more interesting and fun than a cheap hotel. We will definitely use again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The water quality is excellent. I am sensitive to hard water but the water here was even better than my water at home 😀 there were weighted blankets and the bunk beds were big enough to sit up in. The desk was too small to use for a workspace but complimentary coffee was a pleasant concession.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a hidden gem! Love the place and location. So clean and comfy and great hosts! Our friends rented the other room and we had a great time at this locations ! Will stay again! Don’t pass this place up ❤️

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location in my hometown is great. Easy to walk to shops, church, restaurants.
Two issues which are more about me than the space. The room was cute, but I would have preferred less cute and more comfort/practicality. I knew the room would be small, but had hoped for at least on comfortable chair and or a small workspace. I would have gotten rid of some of the cute furnishings and made the room more usable. It is fine for sleeping, but not for hanging out in. I have learned that I would never make it in a tiny house.
Also, despite our best efforts to keep the hallway door to the parking lot locked, it was routinely left open.
But we do plan to return."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great a little awkward sharing a shower in the hallway for the price, and my door was very difficult to open. But other than that everything was fantastic!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you again Julie! Can’t wait to boom again!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice stay!

Julie was very accommodating when we needed to flex our check out time. We will most likely use her facility again for guests."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean and simple. Just what we needed o
In between the two long legs of our drive."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Was in the area for work and knew I would be working long hours, so mainly need a place with a hot shower and a bed. The room, although small, is cozy and welcoming. The bed is a little firm for my liking, but that's more of a preference thing. I didn't spend much time in the town that it's located, but seemed peaceful and quaint. Overall I was very satisfied with my stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean! Recommend it 100%
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Julie’s Airbnb’s are super clean. We weren’t able to get into our space we rented the first 2 nights so she put us in a suite instead. The Marigold Suite was where we stayed the rest of the time. Aside from almost no parking due to events at the Elks next door on the weekend and some commotion from that, it’s quiet inside and we had no trouble sleeping. Everything was very clean and the hosts are communicative and respond very quickly!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely recommend Julie’s place to everyone who is traveling on a budget and is looking for quiet, functional, stylish place. The room is small, but large enough to fit a young family of four, or a group of friends who are ok with sharing the place. It has a small refrigerator and a decent size bank bed. Julie was an awesome host."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time here! Very cozy and an easy check in.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place, will stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I really liked Julia’s place. Even though the room was was smaller in size, it was very well designed and could technically fit up to four people because of the decent size bunk bed. The shower was in separate room and it was also very nicely designed and comfortable and well stocked with the towels and shampoos etc.. There’s a Keurig coffee maker in the hallway that is constantly refilled with the pods of different flavor. The place is clean and cozy for a business traveler or a small family on a budget. I recommend it to everyone and will stay there again. The best bung for the back. Thank you Julia!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a SPECTACULAR faculty with unique touches at every turn & throughout the entire building.

Clean n tidy !
Coffee machine was a highlight for me . Also appreciated the security- can’t beat the price-

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was a wonderful stop-off point and an overall nice location/room! I even needed to extend my stay, which was very easy to do so, and got some helpful advice on car repair locations in town. The town is adorable and walkable, and I would suggest trying the Daily Grill Indian restaurant (despite its location inside a gas station), Season's Eatings, and Country Gourmet Coffeeshop."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,AMAZING!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This is my 3rd time staying here when I travel back and forth from MI to KY & it’s my favorite little spot! So quaint and easy to access. Quiet and absolutely lovely.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of my new favorite stopping points! I thought the room was very efficiently set up, the shower felt luxurious and the bed was very comfortable. What a cool space! I highly recommend and it was well worth the small detour off of 90."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,E rented two rooms one for us and one for our friends traveling from out of state for our daughters wedding. This was so convenient clean and comfortable.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a charming and absolutely perfect little place! I loved staying at Julie’s amazing gem in such a quaint town that I look forward to visiting again during my long drives from the East Coast to the Midwest. Every attention to detail has been taken into consideration, and it’s just a magical stay! Julie is so incredibly kind and accommodating, and she’s thought of everything that will make her guests feel like you’re at a boutique hotel. The amenities, easy self check-in, and parking make your entire stay convenient. The decor and special details make you so comfy and feel absolutely taken care of. I’ve already booked my next stay and look forward to another after that. Thank you, Julie! What a treat!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,awesome room with all the comforts and an amazing shower!! easy in and out access right down town. loved it and would definitely stay again
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying at the Emporium! I got to relive my childhood with the super cute bunk beds. We would definitely recommend this place.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The most charming and perfect little room for a quick overnight stop on a long road trip. Julie was very accommodating & so sweet. I can’t wait to stay here on my way back through town!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful host! Very accommodating room is quiet and quaint! Was perfect for the wedding we were attending across the street
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful host!! Great communication.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect place to stay after a long chaotic day at Cedar Point. It was so cozy and the beds were pretty comfy. Super easy check in and Julie is very kind. The whole experience went very smoothly:)
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,always a comfortable visit
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The Marigold Suite is charming and comfortable. It's small, but cozy. With only two adults in the suite, we managed just fine. The location in downtown Napoleon can't be beat! Restaurants and shops are easily walkable but a car is necessary in this area of Ohio. Access to the building through the rear entrance right off the free parking was safe and easy. The smart TV in the suite was really nice. Plenty of pillows on both beds stopped any arguing over how many pillows each person got! This is a great value and one of the only non-hotel places to stay in the area. When you find yourself in Napoleon, this is the place to be!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great accommodations. Everything you need in a cozy space.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely adorable! Everything was just like the pictures! Fully read the description, my friend did not understand it was a single room like a dorm room, and from the pictures she was very confused cause it looks a lot bigger. However everything described and pictured was correct and there! Very clean and neat"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little room, easy to find and check in!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such an cool building! The decor was superb, cozy beds and access to Netflix were a bonus. This place was clean and comfortable. 10/10 recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice stay in a neat space
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing experience, wish we stayed longer than one night, but for a small suite it felt extremely spacious, had all the amenities you could need! The design was so well thought out, and the best part was how safe the neighborhood felt, as we were moving with all our belongings with a moving truck and trailer, and there was plenty of parking for all of that in the back. There was even laundry that was quick and easy to use, nothing was ever waited for, we were able to shower and do laundry the whole time we were there. The shower and laundry are communal but the bathroom, mini-fridge, microwave, desk are all private in your room. We definitely plan to stay here again! (Another plus is that it's dog friendly!) Also, it's easy to get in with lock codes, so if you want no contact you can do so! (Review is during 2nd covid summer 2021)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I don’t know where to start! This room was way better than the pictures show. Such a cute and well decorated space! Just feet from parking it was easy to unload and bring in all that I needed (so convenient). I was instantly at home. In this seemingly small town, I would not expect a place like this. It reminded me of something you might find in a boutique hotel in a big city. I was able to get the experience of acquaint small town but with all the amenities I would expect to get at any big city hotel. I was totally blown away. I wish I could’ve stayed longer than I did. Kudos to the host for all the little touches put in when decorating and the thought in building this space."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute and amazing place to stay
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great find!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie’s place is a quiet, clean place to rest. We enjoyed our visit."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is the perfect spot for a little getaway! It’s small but intimate and has everything you need. Stayed on the top bunk for fun! Would definitely stay here again in the future. Check out her other property as well!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, not in Toledo"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was nice. It was easy to check-in/out and the area seems very safe. The room is very clean, but small. It’s the perfect location to get a nights rest and we were so happy to know it was pet friendly. We did not need the shower room, but that area looked clean and secure."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute place!!! Nice and clean would stay again!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable place at a very reasonable price and all of the details were spot on. It’s a small space but it packs a punch and all of the personal touches and attention to details did not go unnoticed. Can’t wait to find a reason to stay here again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great place to stay!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great space for a great price. Although there wasn't a lot of room to move around for four people, it worked for very nice sleeping quarters while visiting family."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Shared shower room. Not what i expected but the luxury of the room and shower makes up for it! Great location too. Gas station and bar are just a walk away.
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice little room!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great price!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie’s space is comfortable, stylish and was perfect for my needs. It was very easy to check in and would stay there again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Wish we could’ve stayed longer than one night (cross- country road trip). It was very relaxing and easy after a long day/evening of traveling.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I always enjoy my stay here!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an adorably, cozy space. Love that it is pet friendly and my dog enjoyed her time. If there is an event going on at the attached area, be aware you can here it in the other space."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at the emporium suites. Very nice!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always enjoy my stay here!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute room, perfect for a romantic getaway weekend. Awesome tv, comfortable bed. The duel queen bunk bed is a unique touch! We liked it here. Bathroom was nice too."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I work in the area from time to time and always try to stay here. Perfect place with a perfect location and great value!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great room with everything you need for a quick overnight stop. Highly recommend!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great room right downtown. Walking distance from dining and shopping.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Stopped for a night here on a long drive. So much nicer than Ye Old Off Ramp Inn and only a few miles off the turnpike. The queen-size bunk beds are great!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Marigold Suite at The Emporium is a little jewel. Easy keyless check-in, safe off-street free well-lit parking and a convenient ramp make it a step-free entry.
Open the solid wood door reminiscent of a storybook, and your suite boasts built-in queen bunk beds complete with a library ladder, clean and stylish 100% cotton sheets, and fluffy pillows.
Each bed has a recessed shelf with a convenient power/usb charger outlet, and a fun wall-mounted light for reading.
The room also has a myriad of other lighting options; my favorite was the touch-free vanity mirror!
Room has a large wall-mounted smart TV with Amazon prime, Netflix and other channel apps.
Wifi and a small secretary desk for your work needs; although with the tiny stool you won’t be comfy for 8 hours there. The room has a recliner instead.
Rounding out the room amenities are an attractive and sparkling clean half bath, and a cube or dorm-style fridge and microwave.
This is a small yet well-planned space that you will enjoy; but four adults will find the space great for sleeping but not for spreading out due to it’s tiny footprint.
The shared shower room was also a delight with fluffy towels and a modern no-step double door spacious roll-in shower.
Keurig coffee station and full size washer and dryer are also in the shared hallway, along with a drop-leaf table and chairs.
There are tenants in the building who were friendly and helpful, but the room was quiet at night.
Restaurants and shops were also within walking distance. We liked Eddie J’s with a stop at Flatrock Distillery for a free moonshine tasting.
Enjoy your stay in the lovely Marigold suite-overall a great value and highly recommended!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Napoleon is a sweet little town with eclectic shops, dining and a church bell that peals on the hour!
Your stay begins with free off-street parking and a ramp entry-no steps!-convenient for rolling luggage. Well-lit keyless entry.
The solid wood door to your suite has a storybook vibe, and within you will find a small jewel of a room.
Every inch is maximized, with double queen bunks that have thoughtful touches like usb/outlet combos for your devices in a recessed shelf, under-bed storage and a beautiful half-bath.
The decor is fun, functional and eclectic complete with wall-mounted tv, a mini fridge and microwave, and a Keurig coffee station in the common area.
You’ll be impressed with the compact design, and the sparkling cleanliness! Beds are comfy, and the lighted vanity mirror was a plus.
What the room lacks in floor space, it makes up for in the details-fresh cotton sheets, fluffy pillows, efficient heating with remote you control.
The toasty warm shared shower room is large with clean fluffy towels and a huge walk-in shower, complete with combo shower head and hose.
A clean, safe, cozy space that allows you to enjoy all that Napoleon has to offer!
Tips-Check out Hill’s Family Restaurant for a bountiful breakfast; Eddie J’s for homestyle and large menu; and a free moonshine tasting at Flatrock Distillery next door.
Take a trip back in time browsing Memory Makers Antiques-Kim will take good care of you with reasonable prices and a large selection of furniture, housewares and ephemera.
The Emporium is in a convenient location for walking downtown Napoleon. Overall a great stay and a great value!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A very nice, and clean place to stay that fit my needs perfectly."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place; all you need for a brief stay.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great room and accommodations! Everything you’d need for a quick stay.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful room and great location. We will definitely be back in the future.
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest space! I was concerned about sharing a shower, but it wasn’t an issue at all! We did have trouble getting a turn with the washing machine to clean our clothes, but that was an issue with the other guests leaving their laundry in there all day, not a host issue. The beds were comfy and when we asked for more towels in the shower, they were freshly washed and folded in the bathroom before we got hone that evening. It was great! The space is tight for 4 people, but if you pack light it is great! We loved staying here and would love to know the history behind this neat building!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Emporium is a fantastic space with clean and tidy rooms, as well as a fun and stylish decor. I stayed there as a fun pandemic-safe weekend activity and especially appreciated the proximity to downtown. Plenty of wineries and restaurants are nearby for takeout food, the Emporium includes a pleasant kitchen to dine in."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to stay! Very cute and a great host
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A bit more little than I expected but still good size. Nice and clean. Would stay again.

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie was a great host! She was very nice and fast to communicate with us. Everything was clean and comfortable for our stay. We highly recommend staying at her place!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed staying in both the Mint and Marigold rooms during my recent trip. Julie was so kind and responsive to any questions I had. I highly recommend staying at either room at the Emporium.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Comfy spot with lots of character!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at the emporium! What a neat place!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,It's great to have a place to settle since I travel frequently to this area - I always feel welcome. My goal is to stay at all of Julie's places - they're so cozy. If anyone is hesitant about the Emporium place not being entirely private (a shared shower)- don't worry! I always felt comfortable in that space and didn't notice other people around. I was surprised by how much access I had to the shared spaces and felt like I could move around with ease. Will definitely return!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend staying at The Emporium! Julie is absolutely fantastic and the room was spotless. Cozy room with everything we needed, and the bed was so comfortable!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to spend the night. No parking issues. We felt safe and secure. The exterior door has a combination lock, as did our room door."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here along our way to CO and just loved it! Super cute and the kids thought it was so cool. Cozy, clean and very well decorated."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot felt like a hidden gem. Very clean and nicely designed and had everything you need in a cozy unit. Easy access and check in, perfect for a quick trip."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay! Cozy beds & so clean! Was very refreshing after a long drive 😀
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed last minute at Julies place, it provided a great location to catch up with old friends, and close to everything. Great for sort or long time, and we were able to bring our pup. Thank you!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s highly recommend the stay here!! Best Airbnb Nápolean has to offer
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It's perfect and quiet.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I didn’t spend many waking hours here, which was unfortunate because this place was so cute and cozy! Luckily, the bed was sooo comfy because I pretty much passed out as soon as I got in each night. I had everything I needed for a great stay, and would definitely stay again if I ever am back in the area! The town of Napoleon looked super cute, but I was too busy to check it out! (I was in town for a wedding, which occupied all my time!)"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting NW Ohio, Eastern Indiana or Southwest Michigan you should consider this place"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a wedding
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The bathroom is separate from the room accommodation so you'll need to
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute place in a cute town - we had a short visit but it was a nice one. The space is very compact, especially for three people, but it was so thoughtfully and aesthetically set up that we were happy to make it work. The amenities we used were easy to find and accessible all the time. Wish we had more time to explore the area!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic spot. Myself, my 2 daughters and my niece stayed overnight on our way to Michigan and were so pleased. The beds were fantastic. We all slept so well. The decor is fantastic, and Julie was an incredible host"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay on a budget! And Julie responds so quickly! I was totally shocked by how nice it was for the price. The only thing I was bummed about was that there was no stove in the kitchen area, but other than that, it was great! Thanks Julie!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Never nice, clean place to stay. The hosts are exceptional people who will help anyone out with anything they need. All of Julie's places are very nice. I have been staying in them for the past few months and i have no complaints at all."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is very clean and comfortable! Julie is an extremely responsive and accommodating host. We knew we would be arriving later in the evening, which was no issue. Check-in was easy, as we were given a code to the door to allow us to enter at our convenience. The beds were very comfy, and I’m a tough critic in that department. I slept in the top bunk and had no trouble getting in and out. The AC gets super cold, which is nice after a long summer day. The shower was also great- hot water, good pressure and very roomy. This place is a major deal for the price. I would stay here again in a second and highly recommend it."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is the perfect little getaway spot. The rooms have little touches to them that make them unique. Clean, cute, and accommodating. Julie was a great host and I’ll definitely be back."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! Not only is it clean, reasonably priced, location is great (downtown Napoleon) but Julie and Steve try to make your stay comfortable. Who would’ve thought that one of our most comfortable stays would be close to home, here in Northwest OH?!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little place for us to stay. Very clean. Private. And quiet. Very affordable in a great little town. Julie is awesome! Thanks again.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy's place was just what we were looking for. It's comfortable and has a nice feel to it. We really liked the interesting wall decor.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful surroundings. Clean place. Host quick to respond. Place is what was described.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying here. Never disappoints. Dorothy is an amazing host. Very helpful and communicative. Love the place. Very clean and quiet property. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Dorothy was very helpful in getting us set up in her cottage. The space was perfect for our family of three and large dog. The kitchen was well supplied with essentials and the beds were very cozy. We'd definitely stay here again.

Host was very nice and outgoing.
Id stay here again without any reservations!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stay here often. Great as always.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We love staying at Dorothy's cottage! She is so very accommodating and is very responsive to messages. This was our 3rd time staying and we cannot wait to go back! It's so enjoyable to sit at the kitchen table and watch all the birds, black squirrels, and chipmunks. The fresh fruit she provides is always an added bonus as well!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Waldon Cottage! It was very cozy and comfortable! It had everything we needed and more. We loved watching the bird outside our window as they came to eat. The entire space, while small, was so thought out and planned! I loved the antiques throughout, even the radio that still worked. I highly recommend staying here and would love to return!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Dorothy was very helpful! The loft the cozy and very enjoyable. All of the instructions and directions were very clear. Dorothy even checked on us a couple times to make sure we had everything we needed (it was super cold while we were there). We can't wait to visit again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I always stay at Dorothy's when I come to Defiance. Very nice place, VERY CLEAN which is important to me. Dorothy is very responsive and helpful."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Dorothy’s place was the perfect place to stay for a short trip to Defiance for a conference. The space was clean and the perfect size for two of us.

I would recommend this place to anyone!

Would definitely rent here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you're looking for a peaceful, convenient and comfortable place to relax along your journey or to explore the area around Defiance, I strongly recommend Walden Cottage. It perfectly suited my needs and was accurately presented through the online posting. My pup and I were comfortable and settled in quickly. Dorothy was an excellent host and has done a lot to make guests welcome and well informed. I know that if I'm ever in the central western Ohio area again, Walden Cottage will definitely be a place I'll hope to return to."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely cottage in rural setting. Immediately felt right at home. Arriving after dark, the light was on awaiting our stay. Everything we needed was provided and easily located. A gem hidden just outside the city limits."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I travel, I look for quiet, peace and comfort. Dorothy’s place was all 3. After hours of travel and attending an event, we were bone tired. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. I think I used the word ‘heavenly’ when describing it to my husband (who wasn’t with me). Several amenities were provided, the surroundings were peaceful and we felt right at home. We enjoyed a couple walks at the nearby wildlife refuge within walking distance from Dorothy’s place. Overall, we are extremely thankful to have found this place and would return!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ed & Dorothy are wonderful hosts.
Currently, I believe there is no better stay in defiance, Ohio.
Whether you just need a place to stay for the night or maybe want somewhere quiet and well put together to get away for a little bit, if you're in/near the Defiance area staying here is a no brainer.
Not to mention, I believe it's the only place around that is pet friendly 👌🏼💯🐕."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a lovely place to stay! We were road-tripping through and appreciated the calm setting, complete with a yard space for our dog to get some energy out with some fetch. The cottage was cute and clean and a really pleasant place to spend the night. It struck us as even better than the photos when we arrived. Dorothy was a kind and considerate host. Would recommend this place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dorothy always stayed in contact with us throughout this process which made it so easy, as this was our 1st stay at an Airbnb. It was very close to shopping and restaurants. It was very clean and cute. Loved the bird feeders as you can watch them as you eat. She had a lot of organic things in the bathroom to try out.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you're a lover of nature needing to visit Defiance, this is the place for you. Dorothy's place had everything I need for a quick trip away - comfortable beds, a clean bathroom with hot water, coffee, bird feeders, and a TV with a Roku for binging from bed at the end of the day. There was plenty of space for my dog to explore out back. I was super excited when I saw at least 10 different bird species outside a large viewing window by the dinner table to include rose-breasted grosbeaks and red-breasted nuthatches. We also had a baby squirrel that visited us each morning. Dorothy kept the feeders nice and full. Very close by is Thoreau Wildlife Reserve - also great for walking dogs and exploring. We walked though with a pair of towhees entertaining us. I will definitely be back to explore more. Dorothy was very friendly and easy to work with. We felt safe and right at home."

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love Dorothy's place. The country setting with a beautiful view out the kitchen nook was perfect for sitting with our morning coffee. The size of the studio was just right while traveling with our 88 year-old father with limited mobility. He was able to sleep in the 1st floor bed, and could use his walker to easily navigate the space. My 2 sisters and I were able to fit in the loft for sleeping and even enjoyed a movie one evening. We were in town for a funeral, and Dorothy & Ed were so accommodating of the grand-kids stopping by to see Grandpa for a few hours in between services. We had fun playing a game and putting together one of the puzzles. We also really appreciated the farm fresh eggs and the natural cleaning products. Thank-you Dorothy & Ed!"

From a reusable shopping bag when you need to go get groceries and an umbrella in case it rains to a gate at the top of the stairwell and eco-friendly cleaning supplies. I had two wonderful peaceful nights with no problems and glorious mornings watching birds as I ate my breakfast. I couldn’t ask for a better place to stay.

2018-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Walden cottage. The space was cozy and quaint, but not outdated - and definitely bigger than it looks from the outside!
Amenities and thoughtful touches made our stay feel more personalized - having a few breakfast items on hand, an extra towel for our dog, and easy communication was appreciated.

During my week-long stay I needed WIFI for work and school and it was fast and reliable. Parking was easy and spacious. The cottage is in secure comfortable area, I felt safe day/night.

It was located very conveniently to downtown Defiance and within a mile from where family lives, so that was great! I would definitely recommend this cottage to anyone visiting the Defiance, Ohio area and certainly would not hesitate to stay in the future. Thanks, Dorothy, for everything!!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"First experience with Airbnb. I couldn’t have been happier or more impressed with Walden Cottage and our hostess, Dorothy.
Dorothy has created such a serene space that my son (15 yrs old) and I hated to leave.
So many homey, thoughtful touches made this a home away from home.
From the oh-so-comfy beds with lots of cushy pillows, a cedar chest with handmade quilts, the lovely textiles on the walls and pillows, the huge selection of books (if I’d only had time to read them) and wonderful games (including a vintage croquet set) the juice, milk, coffee, fruit, cereal, breakfast bars, toaster oven, microwave and a full kitchen to the perfect picture window two feet away from the dining table for watching the Cardinals, chickadees, Red headed woodpecker, nuthatch and the occasional wren and squirrel all at the bird feeder.
Top all of that off with the fact the entire space was sparkling clean and uncluttered.
Thank you Dorothy, we hope to visit again and I’d give you 10 stars if I could. ❤️"

2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Located in a peaceful setting, with Dorothy's lovely home nearby (but not TOO close), and a bank of towering conifers on the other side. You'll feel like you're in the country, but town is actually quite close.
Banks of beautiful native flowers border the driveway entrance. There's a front yard with a wooden swing, and a small seating area in the back for reading and relaxing.

You will enjoy the amazing bird and squirrel show that is always playing outside the picture window! We checked the handy bird guide, and think we spotted nearly all of them listed.
This was my third visit, and hopefully not my last."

2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I were in town for the yearly Northwest Ohio Blacksmiths group Hammer-In, and it was also our 10 year anniversary. Dorothy was quite responsive whenever we communicated, and was flexible when we ended up arriving many hours later than planned. Walden Cottage is absolutely adorable, smelled great and was stocked with Earth-friendly and organic products. Dorothy asked us what we'd like for breakfasts and provided gorgeous, farm fresh, multi-colored eggs along with milk, cereal, english muffins, and juice for our breakfasts; there was even salt, pepper, and butter for cooking. A bird feeder right outside the dining nooks' window was oft visited by black squirrels and various birds. We enjoyed looking thru the bird guide on the table to figure out what types we were watching. The decor was quite inviting and warm, lovely without being pretentious. Thank you Dorothy for the wonderful stay!"

We highly recommend this place!"

2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay here and everything was perfect. The fridge was well stocked with milk, butter, eggs, coffee and a bunch of other items. The kitchen has a small stove which is viable to cook a reasonable meal. I was here a whole week so brought a cooler of food and prepared myself meals most evenings. The refrigerator is a small unit so if you are planning a longer stay bring a cooler to keep the extra items you cannot squeeze in. The bed is comfortable and the heating/aircon is great. The cottage is charming and I recommend this very highly."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really a great place to tay. We were with my elderly mother and it was perfect with a downstairs bed, bathroom. Lively homecoming to Defiance. Thanks!"
2016-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place! We've stayed twice now, and enjoyed both visits. Totally private and cozy, and stocked with healthy snacks and environmentally-friendly supplies. Feeder at the picture window offers a daily showing of beautiful birds, and squirrels performing laughable antics in the quest of a treat. Better than anything on TV!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy's cottage was a delightful place to stay! The cottage is perfectly decorated and equipped with everything you need to feel at home. Loved the breakfast nook and all the birds that came to the feeder. Only issue was the weather - the rain and downpours did not allow me to sit out back and enjoy the backyard (Dorothy had nothing to do with this!). Would love to come back!
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Walden Cottage was perfect for our stay while visiting Friends of Felines for Catstock. Everything was as described. Hosts very pleasant.
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It is really a great experience staying here. It is really quiet and the view here is gorgeous.
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The neighborhood was quiet and we took a nice walk around the area. The fresh fruit was a welcome treat. It was very private and very clean
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house and great people!
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful cottage!! It was spacious and charming and a wonderful extra touch of snacks and juices. Communication was great and everything in the post is accurate. The grounds are beautiful. We even saw a bunny in the back yard!!!
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great experience.
2016-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Walden Cottage was everything we hoped for and more! A wonderful private space with so much charm and convenience! Very clean and cute! Dorothy was so wonderful and accommodating. I highly recommend Walden Cottage to other Airbnb-ers.
2016-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,The house is perfect. Dorothy is very nice and helpful! We were in the house three days with our little children (2 years old).
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter (age 9) and I stayed at Dorothy's cottage over Memorial Day weekend. Everything was perfect! The place is clean, cozy and comfortable, and looks exactly like you'd expect from the pictures. My daughter loved sleeping upstairs in the loft and relaxing in the little floor rocking chair up there. She is really into birds and had a great time identifying the various birds that came to the feeder just outside the window. We did a bunch of fun things in central Ohio (went fishing, saw sprint car racing Saturday night, and went canoeing down the Auglaize river). We had a great weekend and would highly recommend staying at Walden Cottage."
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Walden Cottage. It's located in a beautiful rural setting but within a short drive to shopping and a good selection of restaurants. Everything was ready for us including a nice fruit basket, various coffees, cereals and eggs for breakfast. The cottage is charming, very clean and cozy. Downstairs is small kitchen, chairs for relaxing, dining set, sleeping area and very nice bathroom. The loft upstairs has TV, lots of DVD's to choose from and many games, puzzles and books. We enjoyed watching all the birds at the feeder right outside the dining area window. It's a very welcoming home away from home. We hope to return in the future."
2016-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Walden Cottage. As described, the apartment is in a quiet neighborhood and contains all of the comforts of home. The photographs accurately show the layout and condition of the unit. The surrounding area is lovely, although we didn't have time to explore due to other obligations. Dorothy was very prompt, and incredibly helpful, in addressing our pre-travel questions/concerns; she also accommodated our middle-of-the-night arrival and provided excellent directions to the property, in addition to placing a sign outside to further help us locate the property in the dark. We really appreciated that Dorothy stocked the apartment with some beverages and food, in addition to toiletries and cleaning supplies. Dorothy and Ed are generous, gracious hosts and we really enjoyed meeting them. We hope to stay in Walden Cottage again the next time we are in Defiance."
2016-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed at Dorothy's cottage for about one and a half months and my stay was absolutely fantastic. The apartment is well equipped with all the essentials. It has a very cozy-cabin kind of a feel. The kitchen is sized down and Dorothy made sure there were some breakfast items and ample coffee in the pantry. The bird feeder attracts a variety of colorful birds and squirrels and is quite a sight while you are dining next to the window. The backyard opens to a mini lake and on good days you can see wonderful sunsets. My boyfriend would visit me on the weekends and she would let us have the garage too! Dorothy took care of the tiniest details during my stay and I give her a 11/10 for hospitality. When I was leaving she was kind enough to give me some goodies for my new apartment. If you are traveling near the Defiance area I would highly recommend staying at the Walden cottage. Ed+Dorothy+their dog Guinness make wonderful AirBnB hosts:) So glad to have met them.
2016-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful space! The kitchen allowed for us to make a nice breakfast and dinner, and it was just a five minute drive into town for lunch. My friend and I came to consult one another on writing projects and the dining table made for an excellent work space--the bird feeders right outside the window provided a lovely array of birds to watch in the quiet moments of consideration of our work. When I walked into the apartment it had the warmth and comfort of a home. I fully intend to return. The amenities, the low cost, and the gracious hosts--I want to invent occasions for excuses to go back!"
2016-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As usual, Dorothy provided a great experience at the Walden cottage. It was cozy and welcoming. My MOm loved watching the birds at the bird feeder."
2016-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay at Walden Cottage. Dorothy made sure we had everything we needed, and we were very comfortable. The provided breakfast was generous, the kitchen was well equipped, and we were easily able to cook our own meals during the day with food we had brought along. We really appreciated the provided receptacles for compost and recycling. The apartment is cozy; for us there was plenty of space for two people. We really enjoyed watching the birds out of the big picture window by the breakfast table, and we also really enjoyed relaxing in the loft."
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I much enjoyed our second stay in Walden Cottage. It is very conveniently arranged and decorated with lovely woodwork and furnishings. We especially liked the view from the picture window and watching bluejays and redbirds visit the bird feeder -- what a nice touch to locate this feeder there for guests. I was sorry not to see the owners this time but they had everything arranged for our convenience. Wishing them a happy new year!
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Both Dorothy and Ed were very welcoming. Their apartment is great with a good little kitchen, loft with DVD player, full size bed -- everything you need. I stayed three nights, which were very restful for me."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely lovely B&B option when you are staying in Defiance, Ohio. The cottage is a charming little annex built onto the end of their garage so you're tucked well away from the main house and have convenient access from your car. Inside, the space is small but extremely comfortable for one or two people and you could even squeeze a couple of kids into the futon upstairs. You'd be extremely cramped for a family but if you are traveling on your own as I was this was the perfect space to live for a week. The kitchen was perfect, the bed comfortable, the internet reliable and the bathroom functional. All was well and I have nothing but the best recommendations for this lovely spot. The photo's don't do this space justice as one of the previous posters mentioned. I am very particular about my accommodation and will always choose to stay here when I visit Defiance. To be honest, I was torn between wanting to keep this a secret and wanting to help the hosts when I recommended it to the people I was in town working with this week.

The hosts were lovely, Dorothy made me feel extremely welcome and very comfortable.

Quite simply put, don't stay anywhere else if you are in town, I certainly won't be!"
2015-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled in a small community off the beaten path, Walden House was a sweet getaway. The bird feeder traffic outside the dinette window kept me entertained at every meal. Cozy, quiet, clean, with easy access to town, it was a wonderful oasis."
2015-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing and rejuvenating stay at Walden Cottage! Our hosts had very thoughtfully provided not only coffee, juices and cereal, but spare toiletries in case we'd forgotten them. We enjoyed relaxing on the patio watching the birds and squirrels, walking the nature trail, and choosing a movie to watch in the loft. At bedtime, the sounds of cicadas, crickets, and tree frogs lulled us to sleep!"
2015-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our visit to Defiance and Walden Cottage. The cottage is charming and inviting. Dorothy and Ed were very welcoming and available, while also giving us space to be in our own little world. Their recommendations of things to see and do in town were much appreciated. So peaceful and quiet."
2015-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Dorothy and Ed's cottage. The place was comfortable and clean, and the surroundings were beautiful. The hosts themselves were friendly and helpful. Recommended!"
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Dorothy came out to introduce us to their cozy and cute place. It had everything we needed and so much more. The place was clean and Dorothy made sure we all had beds (4 ppl). Many extra little touches made the stay wonderful.
2015-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Dorothy and Ed are awesome! They tell us a lot about the location and recommendation of good restaurants! Room is comfortable! I would highly recommend!
2015-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was beautiful, the photos really don't do it justice! I wish we had stayed longer so we could have spent more time there. There was even a nice little walking trail next to the place. We got in really late and Dorothy was so gracious and accommodating. She had drinks and snacks ready for us in the fridge/kitchen. I highly recommend staying here if you're in the area. You will be very comfortable."
2015-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Walden Cottage! Dorothy and Ed Singer are gracious, caring hosts! The location is beautiful and serene. We felt totally at home and welcome. Highly recommend staying at Walden Cottage. Also, so enjoyed all of the birds frequenting the feeders right outside the dining room window. Saw 15 different types of birds within two days time. Might have been the Spring Migration, but what fun."
2015-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,The cottage was wonderful and Dorothy made us feel at home. She went out of her way to make the place feel comfortable. It had all the amenities and comforts you could ask for. The description is accurate and I would highly recommend it.
2015-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dorthy and Ed were the most gracious hosts who were warm and personable, greeted us immediately upon arriving, and stocked the cottage with fresh, ripe fruit and other goodies. They are truly people of hospitality.

Their cottage was beautifully and artistically designed, was immaculately clean, and was very relaxing.

We enthusiastically recommend both Walden Cottage and the hosts."
2015-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thanks to Dorothy and Ed for a wonderful experience in their Cottage. We have a one year old son, and they were able to supply a sleeping crib, high chair, and everything that a baby could need. Their place was wonderfully kept and was perfect for our stay. Thanks again for all the extra amenities like the fruit and drinks, and natural products. They absolutely made our stay wonderful. The blue jays and cardinals are amazing outside and if we come back to Defiance, we will definitely stay with you again!"
2014-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dorothy and Ed's cottage is lovely, with beautiful light woodwork and tasteful decor. It is conveniently arranged -- a great place for us to spend a few days at Christmas time. Very quiet and peaceful. We were sorry we did not get to meet Dorothy because she was ill but we had nice conversations with her husband and son. Highly recommended. Thanks for sharing your place with us."
2014-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at ""Walden Cottage."" The space is very nice and spacious enough for two couples. The kitchenette made it easy to prepare meals. We arrived to find a basket with fruit and chocolates, which was a nice added touch. Dorothy and Ed were incredibly nice to chat with, and gave us great suggestions for local places to eat and visit. We enjoyed long walks in the nature preserve that is right next to the house."
2014-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a welcoming place this is! Our kind hosts at Walden Cottage were able to be flexible with our changing arrival time and when it was clear we'd be trying to locate them after dark, placed a very helpful sign out at the road. That, along with their very clear directions, made it very easy to locate this delightful spot. The cottage was very clean and comfortable, with 2 separate sleeping areas, and we appreciated the snacks left out for us and the cold drinks in the fridge. Our only regret was that our schedule didn't leave time to get to know our hosts better!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Very spacious, comfortable beds, great place to stay. We were in town for a wedding during the eclipse. It was perfect!"

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,This home in the Defiance is perfect for family gatherings. Very comfortable for a family group with double kitchens and lots of room to spread out.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Excellent stay

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"The Inn on Third is a comfortable, stylish, and very spacious traditional-style home ideal for small groups visiting the Defiance area. McKenzi provided excellent customer service! Recommended for those with a group-size budget. Our stay was excellent."

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"A wonderful location in a HUGE home on a plat from the 1800s at the edge of former Fort Winchester. This house is easy walking distance to riverside trails, Fort Defiance park, the beautiful, sandstone public library, and historic, downtown Defiance.
This was a great and convenient place for our family to spend Thanksgiving - traveling back and forth to Bryan to visit my grandparents.
We enjoyed trying the different spaces, beds were cozy, showers nice and hot, design and decor a fun mix of vintage and modern. Plenty of plugs for working remotely and decent internet."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful home
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second of Sylvia's properties that I have rented for myself and some out of town guests and they are always exceptional. The Inn on Third is just gorgeous, and we had the added bonus of staying here while it was beautifully decorated for the holidays. (NINE Christmas trees!) The space is generous and welcoming. There is plenty of room for folks to gather together in a common area and plenty of ways for folks to have their own space if they need. The bedrooms are beautiful and comfortable - the master suite is GIANT, a great asset if you were traveling with very young children. Location is perfect - walking distance to downtown, the Stroede Center, and the river, but totally quiet. Lots of parking, TWO kitchens, and, as always, Sylvia and her team leave treats and snacks for everyone for their stay. Highly recommended, you will enjoy your stay at the Inn on Third so much."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sylvia was amazing at answering every question from the day of booking until check out. Will be using The Inn for any future trips to Defiance!

2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at the Inn on Third for the weekend of our son's wedding. We have 5 adult children and renting the entire Inn was so much more economical and convenient than renting multiple hotel rooms. The house was absolutely gorgeous, clean and much larger than we expected. We loved being able to spend time together as a family in the ""homey"" environment for the weekend. Sylvia was so kind to text to make sure we were able to check into the house easily and was so gracious to accommodate us as we asked to check out a few hours later. I would highly recommend the Inn on Third for anyone staying in Defiance. Thank you for all the extra added touches of coffee and tea and making our weekend extra special!"

Our group of six women totally enjoyed our stay. The decorating was beautiful and each room was comfortable and inviting. Thank you, Sylvia and husband for your help and kindness in allowing an early check in and late check out."
2016-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Sylvia was not available face to face at the time of our stay but made any necessary contact via kind & considerate calls/texts. She said she has only had the inn for a month and we were first to stay on the white siding half of the duplex. She stocked the dorm fridge with plenty of soda pops, OJ, sweet tea. The listing was bigger & better than her photos depicted at the time. She listed breakfast as part of plan on website but when we inquired at registration, she stated there was none provided. Washer & dryer was included but not listed on website."
2016-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time using AirBnB and it was fabulous. The Inn on Third was everything it was advertised to be and then some. We had enough room for our whole family to enjoy the weekend together. Highly recommend this gem!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I like the fact that it is located in a quiet neighborhood and it was close to everything that we were doing and places we were going. It is very nice having a kitchen when you are on a special diet and cannot eat out a lot. I plan to stay again.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stayed with my Mom, we were born and raised in Defiance, but sold our childhood home a couple years ago. It was nice to have a place to stay that wasn’t a hotel.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jacob’s place was perfect for me. I travel for work and spent two and a half weeks there. I’ve stayed in quite a few Airbnb’s. His was very clean and well accommodated. One of the things
That I enjoyed the most was the couch. Many of the Airbnbs I’ve stayed in do not have a very comfortable couch and most do not recline. Usually they want to use furniture as decorations and not usability. I enjoy putting my feet up at the end of the day. I plan to stay there again when I come back. Thanks again Jacob!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We felt right at home at The General’s Quarters. It was very homey with many antiques throughout. Jacob gave multiple recommendations and we were able to visit some neat shops while in the area. We can’t wait to visit again!

This was such a nice little retreat to come home to and so close to some of the most beautiful spots that Defiance offers. This sure beat staying in a hotel! Jake was also so helpful with recommendations and instructions. I highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Defiance.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was the best option for our stay in Defiance.

Julie was very responsive and easy to communicate with. The best part was the space is totally unique. As it is in an old armory, the building itself was cool.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Honestly, this air bnb is stunning and beautiful. it's right in walking distance of a coffee shop and a lot of other city things. We were just passing through and we absolutely loved it! If you're ever in the area you should see it. It was a last minute since I was moving my mom out from Michigan just driving through and it's like suite for a girls weekend or honeymoon. She was very kind as a host and great with last minute booking."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,this was an experience I'll never forget. everyone I met was so kind. my cat actually got loose and Steve was the hero I needed that day. I would recommend thus spot to anyone! please extend my thanks to everyone there.

We took lots of walks. Azul Tequila was a great Mexican restaurant. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for 2 days and wow.. you will get amazed as soon as you enter the property. This place is by far one of the best air bnb’s i have been in. You can tell that the host has put so much work and love into it. The pictures listed give no justice to how nice this place was. I am going to list the pros and cons that i experienced during my stay:
Pros:
- the place is an art gallery and its absolutely beautiful.
-extremely clean and organized
-HUGE space with a big kitchen and bathroom.
-the instructions to get in was very easy.
-host was responsive and friendly.
Cons:
-it was cold weather when i stayed and he bathroom didnt have much heat so the floors were very cold.
-laundry and drier is available but accross the street at the imporium.
Conclusion:
The quality you are getting for the price is unbeatable. This is a luxurious place (better than 5 star hotels) for an average price. I will be staying here everytime I visit for work!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"amazing and unique stay, more than worth the price!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The nicest most comfortable place that we have stayed at in Ohio! Napoleon has such a cute little downtown area as well.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The host was there to greet us as they were planning for an event the following day. There were multiple people there setting up for the event and they were incredibly friendly and inviting. We even got an invite to the event, but weren't able to stick around the next day. One of them gave us a tour of the Armory and showed us all it had to offer. Very impressive place.
The AirBnB was HUGE! You could easily live here and be very comfortable. It's within walking distance to several local bars and restaurants downtown. The decor was perfect for the space."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"pictures don""t do this place justice. It is gorgeous. Comfortable seating in living area, fully stocked kitchen, comfortable bed with beautiful linens, stunning bath.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,if you are questioning if this space is too good to be true I'm here to tell you it's not. by far the nicest and most beautifully decorated Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. I didn't want to leave! so cozy with all of the amenities you could want or need.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most charming stays I've had in a very long time.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay in Julie's wonderful apartment! It's quite large and filled with beautiful and unique decor. Julie is a great host and was very welcoming and especially accommodating with our larger-breed dog. Highly recommended!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a perfect first Airbnb experience, my pitbull was the happiest in such a spacious, beautiful, & private place. Always so grateful when no breed restrictions; there was more than enough space for his crate, toys, & blankets to sprawl out. Sets the bar super high for all future trips."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is the most adorable space! Julie has such great attention to detail and wonderful spaces- this is the 3rd airbnb of hers we’ve stayed in and the largest! For a family of 4 it was great- used couches as beds plus bedroom. Super large living room that was so cozy! Full kitchen! Huge bath! Great location! Very impressed with the historic armory building and how beautiful it is. There’s even a cute hair salon and vintage boutique in the basement adjoining! Will be booking every trip back around the availability- which seems super popular on weekends- what an amazing wedding destination!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This AirBNB is beautiful and clean. The interior is an artistic arrangement of eclectic antique items mixed with modern comfort. The bed is comfy and the rain shower is relaxing. It is located in the heart of Napoleon.. a quaint quiet downtown area… with a short walk to restaurants. There is an event center, a boutique and a hair salon also located in the Armory building. There are beautiful summer flowers and a lovely porch/ sitting area on the side of the building.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Julie's place caught my eye while I was looking for somewhere for our family to stay on a road trip. The looks of amazement when my kids walked into the place were worth it alone but the place is so much more. It was quiet, comfortable, and convenient and in spite of seeming like the greatest place for a group of traveling friends also incredibly family friendly including a cabinet full of toys and games. The area around was great for walking and Julie suggested some good spots for us to check out. If you love a cool find and a great experience this is definitely the place for you."

The bathroom and vanity area were really neat. I really enjoyed the down filled couch in the living room, and sleep number bed in the bedroom. Having Roku tv available was a nice surprise, too. Plenty of extra quilts and it was easy to control the temperature with the AC/heat units. They even had a few games and books available. I can't wait to go back. Frankly, it was hard to leave."

It is close to town and residential area, so walking to get something to eat or taking the dogs for walk was not a problem. We didn't need to go out every meal with the kitchen being stocked with pans, pots and dishes. When we weren't meeting with family and friends, we felt very comfortable just staying at the rental and relaxing."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this place is simply stunning! Everything is even better than described and I felt right at home.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely stay if you are looking for a little get away. Lovely venue if you are looking to get married. The building is historic, unique, and thoughtfully designed. Rustic meets chic meets hometown. Julie and her husband were welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie and her husband were actually outside of the suite when we arrived. They were so friendly and accommodating. She even gave us a tour of the beautiful building! We got a great recommendation for the Mexican restaurant in town and one of the local wineries. Our stay was short, but well worth it! We would definitely return!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for allowing us to stay at your place! Everything was great and we enjoyed the comforting vibes of every room in this Airbnb. The kitchen was stocked with everything you would need if you want to grab groceries to cook or there are restaurants close by. Very roomy. Quiet area.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, but would have enjoyed more time here. The host was very kind and accommodating. The apartment was clean and decorated with it's own cool vibe. Although we did not use the kitchen, it was fully stocked and ready if we had. The bathroom and makeup room were beautiful. Parking was right next to entryway door. Felt very secure and comfortable here. There is a beautiful sitting area/living room with tv to relax in as well. We met Julie when we came in and were reassured if we needed anything to call, but we did not need to. We hope to return for my son's graduation in the spring from Defiance College, which is a short 20 minute drive from Napoleon."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at the Amory. The space was just like the pictures, very spacious, well stocked kitchen, cozy living space and comfortable bedroom. Very easy check-in/check-out."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an awesome stay at the Armory. Beautifully decorated & very spacious suite. We felt comfortable and right at home. Would definitely recommend staying here! Thanks, Julie! :)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stop whether you’re just a few or several folks! Well heated & well lit— plenty of comfy areas to relax and hangout as a group. Easy, clear check in and check out. Comfortable bed, too! Julie offers local recommendations for meals as well!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay. Space is very large, well kept, and pretty. Sleep number bed is comfortable. Kitchen is well stocked. The stone tiled shower and the claw foot tub are wonderful. Napoleon is very cute, and the bean and ham soup and pie from Spenglers nearby are delicious. We also ventured over to nearby Grand Rapids to Wild Side Brewing and enjoyed their beers and pizza."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb. The suite is beautiful and huge! Plenty of room and comfortable couches to lounge and relax. Very clean and tidy upon arrival. The room temperature was a little cooler for us and the only minor detail left out was extra blankets (unless I missed them somewhere!). We highly recommend eating at Spengler’s (walking distance) and then going next door to get a sweet treat at the bakery. Everyone in town was so friendly, including the hosts Julie and her husband. Grand Rapids is not too far of a drive if you want to explore a quaint town with boutique shops, a yarn store and antiques. We would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a leisure vacation or want to check out a unique Airbnb 😊"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great space and a lovely retreat for us during the hectic holidays. A unique space with great amenities where I could comfortably spend a lot more time when visiting in the area. Julie was very responsive, even during the Christmas holiday! Great place and host-- would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location for my needs. Set up would be great for bride to get ready before a wedding.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a great stay for the money. Lots of space. Luxury feel. Super nice bathroom. Comfortable bed. I have no complaints. Would definitely recommend this place.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie was a wonderful host and her space was one of a kind. I appreciate being able to park right at the door. The space was secluded, large, and well decorated. I enjoyed watching Netflix, a warm bath under the chandelier, and a good night's rest on the comfy bed. A bowl of ham and bean soup at Spengler's per Julie's recommendation made the visit just perfect. I would highly recommend the space for the hospitality, the value, and overall proximity to downtown amenities. Would definitely stay again if in the area. Thanks so much for hosting me, Julie!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Can’t rave enough about The Armory! Our suite truly felt like we were borrowing a friend’s home and not at a rental. The furnishings were all extremely comfortable and clean! We utilized the suite as home base to come back to our NW Ohio roots from our new home in Virginia to connect with local friends & family and prepare and host Thanksgiving Day feast for 8+ plus our pups! It couldn’t have been more perfect! Julie was a gracious host finding and loaning us an electric roaster because I forgot to bring mine. But pretty much anything else I could need in the kitchen was there! By far though my favorite part of the suite was my bubble bath in the claw foot tub- SO comfy with the wood trim! Outside of the suite I recommend a walk downtown and across the bridge.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is my second time staying here, I live close but it's such a beautiful hidden gem. Perfect for a tiny staycation but absolutely spot-on if you're in town for a long bit. This is a wonderful place to stay if you want somewhere that's aesthetically pleasing and relaxing. They've made sure you'll have everything you need to be completely comfortable and then some, thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome space. Love it! Looks just like the photos and a great value too!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best of the best in Napoleon! The comfort and beauty of this little hidden gem is extraordinary!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We HIGHLY recommend this property! Checking was amazingly smooth and fast, even after we arrived so late at night! Property was PERFECT! Size was so large! Kitchen was well stocked with everything we could ever want! Furniture was so comfortable! And … the shower is to die for!
Thank y’all so much for such an awesome and memorable stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you want a quiet and beautiful place to spend some time, stay here! We were traveling across country from New York and found this lovely bnb hideout the perfect location for resting, eating our food from our road-trip — excellent kitchen — and a walk around the well groomed town square. If you are seeking a relaxing vacation in a country town, this is one of the best places you can find!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed one night here on our way home from vacation. If you are looking for a place to stay in this area, don’t hesitate to choose this location. We stayed on a weeknight and enjoyed a nice quiet evening. Cute restaurants and shops in walking distance. Thank you for sharing this space with us Julie"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"As veteran air b&b travelers, this is by far the best place we have ever stayed. The Armory is a wedding venue, but the suites are also available for air b&b. The creativity, imagination, attention to detail combining modern features with old classics is astonishing. A well done and we’ll executed vision. Thank you for pouring your life and funding into this historic treasure."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We got a response very quickly with every inquiry I had.
Unique and absolutely beautiful. The building itself has so much history. The cleanliness and many details to make our stay comfortable. The pictures can’t even capture the truly beautiful décor. They provided everything we could have possibly needed. This is the most unique and beautiful home I’ve gotten to stay in. Anyone who gets the opportunity to visit this cute place is extremely lucky! I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we did."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The suite was quiet, safe, luxurious but comfortable as well. I was staying alone but I see how this is a most awesome bridal suite with its top notch accommodations. She thought of everything."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a great place!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Armory is an unexpected gem. The setting is perfect, Napoleon a beautiful little town and the people friendly.
The unit was spacious and had all the amenities listed.
It is unfortunate that we could only stay 1 night. It was worth the extra miles driven."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So unique and cute! Loved it, will definitely stay again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just a perfect Suite!

(Sleep number) and the furniture in the living room is so comfy!! Everything you need is within minutes, and there’s even food and shops within walking!! Wish we could’ve stayed another night or 2."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous suite-huge rooms, super clean, unique decor and a real deal! You can feel the love the owners have put into the place. A 5 star experience at a bargain price. A+++"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and location.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place you must check it out!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Huge, beautiful apartment centrally located in a quaint town. Julie was quick to respond and very nice. I would recommend the apartment at the Armory for anyone, any time."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent stopping point for our family on a very long road trip. Had enough room to spread out (which is needed after 11 hours in a car together). Absolutely beautiful and very comfortable
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Armory apartment is really fun and charming. It is exactly as described: very spacious, very well equipped, charmingly decorated, appealingly quirky and well located. Julie has an eye for detail. It was a memorable stopover for us on a long drive. We even had a place to plug in our car. Napoleon also has some unexpected charm. We look forward to coming back to the Armory."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Julie is a SUPER HOST in all aspects of the word. The place is amazing! The decor is beautiful. The bed is comfy. The location is perfect and very quiet. Walking distance to a winery, and several restaurants. Definitely a place to stay at again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie was fantastic! Super nice and helpful. We looked forward to staying at this place for months and it did not disappoint. Very cool spot and we will definitely stay here again if we return to the area.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay (as usual)! A gem in a sleepy town.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a true hidden Gem!!!! The Armory is one of our favorite places to stay ever. Every detail has been considered. Accommodations were absolutely AMAZING! We will stay here again!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at the 1st floor apartment at The Armory was very comfortable for myself, husband and 2 miniature schnauzers. It is nestled between downtown and residential area, so walking downtown for food or taking the dogs for walks on tree lined sidewalks was very convenient. The kitchen has plenty of pans, dishes, glasses so cooking in or bringing back carryout was no problem. It is also setup great for a late arrival if you don't have time to get to the store. Kitchen had coffee, creamer and sugar. Bathroom had body soap, shampoo, conditioner, travel hair dryer and plenty of fresh clean towels. This will definitely be top of my list next time I go home to visit family."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A rare gem on Airbnb. So unique with so many cool touches. Great price and location in a fun little quaint Americana town.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous place! Conveniently located and quiet despite the other businesses
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place and easy to arrange
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our family was absolutely delighted by Julie and Steve's Airbnb's in Napoleon; we stayed 4 nights total. We booked the Mint Suite at the Emporium for a night and then stayed in The Armory Airbnb. Both Airbnb's were stunningly beautiful and clean and we immediately felt right at home in both! We cannot thank them enough for their help. We will always recommend Julie and Steve's Airbnb's!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an unusually spacious, and comfortable Airbnb, that is beautifully furnished in a fun and eclectic style.
The host was welcoming and responsive. We would not hesitate to return next time we are in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stumbled upon this beautiful Airbnb while looking for a little trip for our anniversary. I instantly fell in love with it. It’s very spacious, which we loved. The decor was spot on. So many places for photos. The furniture in livingroom was different from what’s posted. If you plan on having 4 people, I’d bring at least one air mattress. Keep in mind this is a historical building, so if there happens to be an event upstairs, it can get loud due to the Airbnb being on the ground level.
Bonus, you can bring your dog if you have one!
Julie is a very sweet Host also. Again, this Airbnb is beautiful!! We definitely plan on booking again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"When I say this place is beautiful, that's an understatement for sure! Such a treasure to have come across! Communication was very responsive and I highly recommend this suite to everyone!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space. Great location. A perfect place to relax!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay…

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The suite was beautiful. I would recommend staying at this location.
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very unique place to stay! Very large and decorated nicely. Entering the space is a bit intimidating but after closing and locking both doors, it is quite homey. The bathroom is pretty with a claw tub and nice shower. No toiletries and unable to figure out heated floors. The bed is comfortable and the kitchen well stocked. The area is an older small town. Few restaurants within walking distance. No fine dining in town. We used it as a stop on the way home and it was more than adequate for that purpose!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place in a beautiful spot of town! Julie and her husband were very friendly when I arrived. I look forward to staying at this beautiful location again ☺️
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so cool! Very spacious and clean. We were just there for a quick stop but it was perfect for what we needed! Check in was a breeze and parking right outside the door was very convenient as well. Excellent stay!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a great unique place!! Very comfortable bed and extremely comfortable furniture! Thanks for wonderful stay!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, responsive host. Nice place to relax with a Sleep Number bed, Roku TVs, and comfy chairs. Fair warning: you do get a bit of noise during the day from the event center (employees talking/event set-up) as the suite is part of the center on the ground floor. However, the evenings are very quiet. On the whole it’s a lovely place with lots to see and do within walking or short driving distance. Thanks so much!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space has everything you need for your stay. We did end up needing to get shower soap and used our own shampoo. Everything else was provided and we didn’t need a thing (besides food and our preferred condiments, etc.)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed our stay at Julie’s suite. Spacious, clean, well appointed, visually pleasing and very comfortable!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you find yourself in the area, the suite at the Armory is a gem.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was fantastic!!! Always feels like home!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,the place was a little chilly given all the snowy weather but other than that the place was beautiful. you can hear creeks and noises throughout the place as well but nothing bad. i’d definitely recommend this place for a little getaway for any couple
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place. Renovated from head to toe. Everything is new while still staying comfy. Julie seems to have a good eye for design and color and anyone who stays there, gets the benefit of that with their surroundings. You can't ask for a better location, and the historical significance of the city is all around. Napoleon is a lovely little gem of a city and I enjoyed every minute of my stay. Thank you Julie!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Just as pictured and easy to check in!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space. Well appointed with everything you will need. Bring salts and bubble bath for the tub, it is not one to miss."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The suite is absolutely stunning and much larger than we expected. Easy to heat and cool. Tons of cooking supplies in the kitchen, including some basic spices and ingredients. It was very clean and we enjoyed just looking around at all of the decoration details throughout the suite. Thanks for a wonderful weekend, Julie!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay with pets, and great communication."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a good stay at the Armory. It was located perfectly for our visit from AZ to see family. We were able to cook some thanksgiving dishes in the kitchen comfortably. Take note that the bathroom is through the bedroom and the bedroom door is not one with a latch or lock. Just something good to know if you are staying as a family. The space was even larger than the pictures depict. Will probably stay again if we get to come back.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such perfect place to stay! The place is amazing. The bed was so comfortable we didn’t want to leave. Napoleon, Ohio was a perfect halfway stop between Minnesota and Pennsylvania. A very lovely Airbnb in a charming little town. We can’t wait for our next visit!"

Centrally located and a just a short alley walk to Spenglers, where you can enjoy ""two Dogs on Rye"" or other local specialities. Check-in was a breeze and Julie was very responsive to questions. I grew up in this area, and finding this gem was a pleasant surprise in my return visit."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous apartment on the ground floor of a historic building. Lots of space and all the amenities you could need. The hosts have done a fabulous job updating it with an antique feel and modern luxury. I loved staying here with my little service dog. One of the coolest Airbnb’s ever! I would very highly recommend staying here in Napoleon. Great hosts.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, comfortable, spacious suite that feels like a hidden retreat. Everything was just right for a lovely evening. Julie was communicative and accommodating."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I love staying here with my puppy. Julie was so responsive in and the place with cute, clean, comfortable and just wonderful. I drive back-and-forth from New Jersey to Colorado often and I typically stay in Toledo, but that place was booked. I am going to stay here from now on. I really can’t say enough about the place.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Julie place is the best!! I’ll always come here whenever I’m here, Julie’s place makes you want to live here. Me and my Girlfriend slept in our vehicles until an opening came available. We have been here over a month and we couldn’t see ourselves giving our hard earned money to live in but Julie, considering her place made me feel not only comfortable, but felt like home away from home. Again I would permanently live here if me and my girlfriend could get a good long term rate. Thanks again Julie."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Julie’s place is Amazing, I love it here and would pick this place every time I’m here in Napoleon. I’m able to rest and feel like I’m home here. Thanks for everything Julie."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful spot!! Very cozy

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Julie’s place was wonderful, my husband and I enjoyed spending the night. The room was well laid out and easy to use. We had a great sleep and felt rested in the morning. We would stay again if we are in the area. Great job getting the most out of your space."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's listings are always my first choice of where to stay when I come to Napoleon, which is often. Always squeaky clean and beautifully appointed, her properties showcase her eclectic style. They are so charming and the amenities so welcoming. And the price is so reasonable!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stay was great quiet, comfortable.
Our room felt just like home.
Shower was great plenty of hot water.
Coffee maker and water in hallway across from shower room.
Just sorry our stay was only one night this time instead of an entire weekend
Great location for exploring the surrounding area or staying in town and explore.
Julie is on top of everything no matter what come up during your stay
Hope we get the chance to stay again real soon."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great lil place for an overnight trip. Very cozy.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Julie’s place is so charming, clean and comfortable. It feels like home away from home. Napoleon, OH is a nice historic town with so much character. Great places to eat. Dog friendly! Thank you again Julie for another wonderful visit!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cozy & clean room! We definitely enjoyed our stay for the night! Appreciated that our host was attentive and responsive.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely would recommend to anyone staying in the area! Awesome vibes, vintage eclectic style/high end hotel finishes.
Private entrance, dark rooms, a great escape from the outside world!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Julie's place is perfect! The pups and I loved our stay and plan to visit again. Thank you Julie for hosting such a great place and for permitting pets to accompany us! I appreciate you. We enjoyed staying at your place and felt right at home. It is so cozy and decorated so beautifully. Thank you again for a great visit!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was unique, super cute, and absolutely perfect for our stay - will definitely 💯 stay here again someday :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Cutest places ever. Great price!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a comfy, sweet space at a great value! I stayed at the property across the street previously, so I knew it would be similar in amenities and tasteful decorations.
The upper bunk is easy to get up into if you need the space. The lighting is great, the in-suite bathroom clean, and it has a great shower room in the hall.
Thank you for allowing dogs! We had a peaceful night’s stay. Hope to be back soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A favorite stay in NW Ohio!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Super thankful we came across this room on a short notice trip to town! Will definitely be staying here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We cannot say enough about how much we love this spot! It was our second time at the emporium- at first we didn’t think the Mint suite could top the Marigold- but it did! 2 adults 2 toddlers 4 suitcases for DAYS- and it was so thoughtfully designed that it was not messy, it was super fun and easy, and surprisingly spacious.
We walked to Kyras Bakery and the Country Gourmet several times (as well as to our families homes) Napoleon is a surprisingly family friendly place- we love the fun art on businesses and different benches- paw prints on the street- AND THE DRUM WALL. Obviously kids kingdom and the public pool is now a water park?! It’s COOL. We easily drove to many other cities- from Cleveland, Toledo, Grand Rapids, Detroit, Bowling Green, Defiance, Archbold- it’s got great proximity to everywhere!
We’ll be back again next year to visit family- and also for more time at the emporium- it’s just too cute and easy- especially for the value!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay for a great price.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful find this evening.
This location may be one of the most thoughtful places I have stayed at and not just with AirBnB.
This self serve location was able to accomodate us super late at night as we came through town and we are thrilled to have found it.
The attention to detail on decor was spectacular and really demonstrated the host's care for the little things. Easy access and clear rules and instructions, coffee from the generous coffee station in the morning, beautiful, soft fresh sheets and plush white towels all at a calm and safe location. And of course one of the most important things to mention, this place was exceptionally clean.
I was a little worried about the shower not being in the room but that was quickly dispelled by the level of comfort in the common space as you took the very short (10 steps) to the shower. The shower room , like the guest room was beautiful and the decor again just made you feel welcomed and like you belonged.
Thank you so muc"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie is a fabulous host and the way she’s transformed the space into such a comfortable, beautiful space is amazing! Everything you need and then some :)"
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This was pretty nice, there were some problems. Like the water wouldn’t go down in the sink. And there was some dust. But overall it was really good for what I paid. And they always responded to my texts. It was amazing having access to all the places. The room was smaller than I expected but worth it and nice and cozy. Julie was a super host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay for a night on a road trip. Easy in and out, clean, felt safe, Hosts are kind and inviting. Would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location! Clean and close to town.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,The stay was great and made my kid feel at home. It was cozy and comfortable would highly recommend! We will be absolutely staying here again when visiting family and friends. Exceeded all acceptations!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was very convenient for a stop on our road trip. The surroundings were quiet, the room was well-appointed and the AC felt great! The shared bathroom was very clean and comfortable, and is only shared with one other unit."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie and her husband were delightful and easy. They had a longtime friend demeanor. The place was so cute and comfortable I really did enjoy it. Originally I booked to be in town for one of my granddaughter's graduations. My oldest daughter and son-in-law were in a horrible car accident. The flexible hours to self check in was wonderful as I didn't get in till 3am after spending time with my daughter. So grateful the place to stay was the least stressed I was the whole trip.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was smaller than a hotel room but when you only need a place to sleep and relax for a little bit it was great for the price. Will definitely stay there again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had wonderful interaction with Julie! The room was as expected and was perfect for my visit!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,In town for a wedding and this was a perfect spot for a short stay! The room was super clean and comfortable. Everything was exactly as listed. Would recommend!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a little hidden jewel of an Airbnb! Loved everything about it
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little place and perfect for my overnight stay.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a charming spot. Julie’s place was a nice place to land on our way east. Highly recommend!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem! My best friend moved from Jersey to Napolean, OH and I try to get out there as often as possible to visit. This location was just minutes away from her house. It is tucked in the back of an adorable storefront. The entire building was super clean and super adorable. I loved all of the little touches such as a writing station in the hallway, a coffee maker and access to toiletries for the bathroom. At first I was a little turned off by the idea of a community bathroom, but it was beautiful and very private. We were the only guests there and we stayed during the week so there were no big events going on. I am not sure how the experience would have been different during an event. They were setting up for a New Year's Eve wedding while we were there. It was so quiet and so peaceful. Even our pooch felt safe and comfortable. Thank you Julie! I will definitely make this my regular stay when visiting Napolean!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was cute, clean and perfect for our needs. We would definitely stay there again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, quiet room. Very clean and comfortable. so glad I booked this instead of a hotel room!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cute place!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice place clean and comfy.thank you
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"For us it was exactly what we wanted. Once settled in it was extremely comfortable. Fresh coffee, nice shower and accessability to kitchen area amenities."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was super cute and clean. Loved the keypad room access. It made my late arrival nice because I didn’t need to disturb anyone to get into my room.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Always my go-to place when traveling to Napoleon.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Every time I head down south from the U.P. I stop at the Emporium. Lovely rooms, quiet neighborhood, kind host & great value. Very clean and so, so adorable. I’ll always recommend Julie’s place!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay yet again
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value. Will be back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t get much better than this. Cute. Clean. Roomy. Best landlords ever.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AGAIN, fantastic. Clean, cozy, inexpensive and just a great rental. I love it."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, comfortable, and cozy. Loved it!
We were in the Mint Room.
Huge margaritas at the Mexican Restaurant nearby were a big hit; and breakfast at the combo pub and breakfast fare place the next morning was excellent.
Napoleon is an interesting, friendly town. The courthouse is impressive, too."
2022-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I as well as my grandparents were visiting for a wedding at a Napoleon winery. My husband and I rented the Marigold room for 3 nights while my grandparents stayed 2 nights in the Mint Room. This is my review for both.
Check in & check out was very easy. The rooms themselves were nice, accurate & pleasant. Very cutely designed & comfortable. Also the shower room was beautifully done & well supplied. We were happy with these accommodations.
We do however feel like there were some misrepresentations or emitted details that created an experience different from what we expected.
First was the access to a kitchen, cooking basics & dishes/silverware . The rentals are presented as private rooms with a shared kitchen space & shower but the kitchen can actually only be accessed by going through the event space that is also hosted in the Emporium building. At the end of your rental hall there is a door to the event space & then the kitchen at the opposite side on the same wall. This commercial kitchen had no pots, pans, cooking essentials & the countertop had been removed ( it was the plywood underneath ). It was also not as clean. When I asked the host about the pots, pans etc thinking I just couldn't find them I was told that the pots, pans etc were in the full kitchen at their other AirBNB listing across the street. I was told ""You are more than welcomed to cross the street to the Armory & use the full kitchen there"". When I tried to clarify that there were no pans in the kitchen of the building of my rental she said she could bring over a dish which she did end up doing (and I appreciate it) but our conversation about attempting locate pans took 2 hours. Also the other HUGE issue with the access to the kitchen was the fact that you have to go through the event space ... where they're having events. On night 1 they had a rehearsal ( wedding? ), late afternoon 2nd day was another event and the 3rd day there was a wedding. We didn't want to be rude & be the random people interrupting someone's special day so we avoided the space entirely. The listing shouldn't say there's a kitchen when none of these unique challenges are represented in the description or photos.
Secondly is the actual privacy or lack thereof in the rental space. It is presented like you're renting a private room with a shared shower & hall. Since we were renting with my grandparents it was more or less going to be private for our stay. Well the hall as I mentioned leads to a door that goes to the event space, (which has no lock). On the first night guests left through our ""private entrance "". On the 3rd day we encountered the hairstylist who apparently has a suite in our hall way as she came in through the ""private entrance"" along with her client & they proceeded to have perm service you could smell through the hall. Her suite is not mentioned in the listing nor is it visible in any of the photos so it's not like I could have inquired after seeing something in a photo or whatever. Also on the 3rd evening either the florists or someone from the wedding was in the hall as we found bits of their flowers later. It's a bit frustrating when the rentals are not presented this way & the shower is also accessed through that hallway. I don't want to be running into salon clients in my robe.
My grandparents TV was broken. There was a large break in the screen rendering the left third of the screen displaying nothing but scramble & lines went across the whole screen. I let the host know & she said it must have been the previous guest. Not the hosts' fault but I would have thought they or the cleaning people would have noticed considering the size of the damage before my grandparents checked in & at least gave us a heads up.
Finally the parking space/lot is share with all the businesses which is fine & there are a lot of spaces so it's not likely going to be an issue even if there's an event . But the door to your ""private entrance"" is completely transparent glass like a storefront. So anyone walking by, (especially at night when its illuminated) can see right in. It really should be frosted or something if the shower access is in the hall.
I was conflicted when writing this review because the rooms themselves were fine overall & I appreciate that the owners are trying to maximize their business ventures but it feels like all those ventures are crashing into each other. The lack of clarity & transparency in the listing is misleading & I think if those things can be adjusted we would have had a very different expectation & experience."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great affordable suite in a nice part of town. 👍
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our son enjoyed the night he spent in the Mint room. It was a clean and comfortable place to spend thenight. Thank you Julie for letting us know it was available.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I travel a lot so I really appreciated being able to do a load of laundry. The entire place was super clean, light ,airy, and in a safe neighborhood. The bathroom had safety bars, the shower had a fixed and removable shower head, a seat, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Plus plenty of wonderful towels! Julie was immediate in her response and told me to contact her if I needed anything. My pup and I were very happy to escape the high heat and storms!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place! I really appreciated finding such a gem in my travels for work. The place had everything I needed, was VERY clean and well-organized, and was in a great neighborhood for walking dogs. I very much appreciated the affordable price which also included my two dogs at no extra expense. If I end up in the area for work longer term, I will definitely look to see if Julie's place is available."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We rented both units and it was exactly as expected.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place- fit my needs perfect!I’m in town visiting and the location is awesome, right in downtown. Julie and Steve have done such an awesome job with this place and The Armory across the street. They were wonderful hosts. I had such a nice stay, I don’t want to leave lol hope to be back sooner than later"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,good stay
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful little space in Napoleon. Julie used every little inch of the Emporium to make the location very unique!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute spot! The space was clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower area was clean and huge! Location was excellent as it is in walking distance to stores, restaurants, etc. We were lucky to have a BBQ festival going on down the street the one night we were there."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unique place and value for money , highly recommended."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A clean, private place to stay, as long as you are ok with using the shared shower just down the hall. Of special note, the room seems very mobility accessible, with elements specifically designed to stylishly host guests who use a wheelchair or walker."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a great couple and great location
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location! The personal touches were evident. Would’ve loved better toilet paper, though"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Came here with my boyfriend and we loved it. 10/10 would stay here again. Way better than any hotel near the area. If we have a reason to return to napoleon we will 100% be staying here in the mint suite.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have stayed st Julie's place twice in the last few weeks while looking for a job. I can't say enough what a deal it is. So much more than a hotel where you'll pay twice as much. Speedy wifi, lovely furnishings, comfy bed. There's access to a washer and dryer and commercial kitchen that has an oven and lerge fridge space, but no stovetop, which worked for me. Great walking town and neighborhoods with a number of food and drink options. The floors weren't as clean and the fridge was on the fritz during my second stay, but I brought these to her attention and she couldn't have been nicer. A true gem!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Mint Suite is delightful. Cozy and comfy. I was traveling alone and had more than enough room. Napoleon is very walkable and the location is great. The building feels safe and secure. Plenty of free parking if you happen to have a car. The Mint and Marigold suites are my go-to choices in Napoleon.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing!!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,My friend and I last minute requested to stay at this Air Bnb. Julie was very accommodating and set us up with a kitchen as well so we could cook the food we brought.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This room is very clean and central to the center of Napoleon. I use any of the hosts rooms when I'm in Napoleon. All are excellent and the host is exceptional and caring.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My dog Max and I drive back and forth from Boston to Iowa to see my parents, and Julie’s Airbnb properties have made this trip less stressful, more comfortable, and very affordable. I look forward to getting to Napoleon each time we drive! The Mint Suite is dreamy, comfy, chic, and convenient — as is the Marigold Suite and Julie’s other Airbnb across the street at The Armory. Gems! All of them!"

2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,This Air B&B was great for the wedding we attended. It was easy to walk to the Armory and back. I recommend to anyone who wants an easy place to stay for a night or two.
2021-12-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute place. Can’t see TV from bed. Otherwise great.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as usual. The commercial kitchen fridge came in handy for traveling with holiday food. appreciate the cozy stop to rest when visiting family

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's a smaller town but don't let that fool you, the room was cozy and felt like being back home.

The nearby restaurant that the host recommended was also a little gem to go and eat at during our stay. 10/10 would recommend"

I’ve already recommended you to a friend!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well-appointed room with antique country atmosphere. Had good tv channels, microwave and mini-fridge. Comfortable bed and nice fluffy blankets.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Great place!

2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Julie's place is so creatively decorated. Her directions for check-in were perfect and the place was great. The decor is amazing and very well thought-out. Definitely cozy and private. The use of the washer/dryer was an added bonus after a day at Lake Erie. Will definitely come back.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My grandmother and I stayed here and everything worked out wonderfully. Everything was very convenient. The bathroom was close to the bed and the shower is very roomy and has handles on the wall, which also helped out tremendously. We sat in the hall and had coffee in the morning. Before I checked out, my grandmother was able to walk over and attend church because the suite is located diagonally across the church. Great location! Thank You."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a small space, but clean and comfortable."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you can stay here...do it! We loved the interior design. The room had all the amenities you need. The beds are big and comfortable. It was great to have a tv, fridge, and microwave in our room! The host are super nice. We'll stay again for sure!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stay here all the time. Julie is an awesome host and this is a great place!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The suit and the shower were gorgeous! We were very well taken care of!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful space! We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend for our son’s soccer tournament and had a blast! Everything was sparkling clean and the little touches made the space feel special and homey! The events in the larger room down the hall were noticeable, but not once we got settled into the room and turned on the air. And the shower was dreamy!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really cute space. We rented both suites (Marigold & Mint) and it was very convenient since they both share common areas. I however didn’t realize that this area is also connected to a hall type space by a door without a lock or latch. With a party going on, you can hear it all. Since we were in both suites, we were planning on keeping the doors open but our dog was too bothered. Julie was responsive when asked about the event & did let me know that the event space had a sign saying there were guests."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Really nice suite. This is our second time and we would return as we like the area.
Our stay wasn't quite as nice as our first stay, however. To manage expectations next time, we would ask before booking if there are any events happening (the rooms are connected to an events space). Last time there was no event, but this time there was an event till about 10:30pm which we could hear in our room.
Also, I'd bring some black paper or something with non-residue tape to temporarily cover the LED displays--they are a quite bright for sleeping at night an illuminate the whole room."

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Julie is a great host! Our room was set up nicely and was very clean. Cute weekend getaway.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Free parking located right by the back door; handicap accessible entrance and the suite appeared to be as well . Shared laundry, shower, and kitchen in the building. Keurig coffee in hallway. Two suites on site and the one we stayed in was absolutely gorgeous. Every inch of our room was perfectly designed and decorated with quality materials and was so very clean. The room was a tight squeeze for four people as the upper loft bed is very snug for two people. Good internet, large TV, nice chair in the room as well as a very good mini fridge and microwave. The room and bathroom could use some wall hooks for hanging things but we had plenty of place to store luggage beneath the loft bed ladder.
I cannot explain how beautiful this entire building is inside. The flower shop, wedding venue and tiled hallway at the front of the building look so romantic and nostalgic!
If you don't mind sharing a hallway shower room with one other suite (not the toilets and sinks-those are in private bathrooms attached to each suite) then this place is an INCREDIBLE value!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little location, situated within walking distance from Napoleon downtown where we enjoyed the cupcake shop, coffee shop, restaurants, and local shopping.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice space conveniently located close to downtown and a short drive from shopping and other restaurants. Julie is a very sweet and gracious host.

We walked into town one evening for dinner and dropped in at a winery for a tasting. So exciting to see that most of the downtown spaces are still occupied and thriving. The town hall is absolutely beautiful!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This home is just perfect. It's in a quiet rural area about 15 mins away from an outdoor mall, movie theater and big grocery stores. The house itself has been remodeled beautifully in a modern farmhouse style with high end materials. The grounds are gorgeous with hosta and other perennials and the lawn is meticulously cared for. Have your coffee on the front porch in a rocking chair so you can see the sunrise! While I wasn't able to enjoy the fire pit because of weather this trip, sitting out on the deck with a fire is a great way to wind down. The kitchen is stocked with every imaginable device and utensil and the pantry/fridge has everything you could possibly need in a pinch. The bed is so comfy and with two kinds of pillows and country quiet you'll have no trouble getting some rest. I also love the couches, the large shower and having access to washer/dryer. The owner is quick to respond to any questions and very kind. I love this place!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was well-kept, clean and comfortable! Full size refrigerator which was nice and big kitchen. Off street parking was nice.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle stocked the place better than any host ever. Didn’t charge a ridiculous cleaning fee and had clear expectations that didn’t feel like an overwhelming chore list. The bed was very firm. Clean, helpful, possibly best air bnb I stayed in.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle's place was a great place to stay. VERY clean and well furnished with great new appliances, including a washer, dryer, and dishwasher, nice furniture, and everything we could need. Lots of extras too that are often missing at other places, like plenty of electrical outlets, a phone charger, night lights, plenty of towels and places to hang them, openable windows with screens, local channels and others available for free on the smart tv ( often can only access those you have a subsription to), plenty of off street parking, not far from the main highway and yet in a nice small town area, and lots more. Since we were there the week before Christmas, we loved that there was even a lighted Christmas tree! It was not cluttered with lots of stuff like many are, but felt like a home with things like family pictures around. Kyle's place was just warm and welcoming and we hope to stay there again while attending family events in the area."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed any many Airbnb's over the years, but have never had an AirBnB that was as well kept and stocked as Kyle's place. The untinsel drawers were impecably organized. He had a variety of chargers available to the guests. A lovely Christmas tree was set up. Truly remarkable! I hgighly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Book it! It's perfect! Second stay and although it was chillier outside, this beautiful home was so cozy. I LOVE that I was able to cook everything from soups in the crock pot to casseroles in the oven and then easy peasy clean up as there is a dishwasher. The washer/dryer are such a wonderful convenience. Everything you could think of is here from coffee to shampoo. I LOVE the comfy couches in the living room so you can relax and watch tv. The new bed at the house is fantastic. The location is very rural. Wake up and watch the sunrise over the fields from the front porch or take the trail and enjoy a more natural setting. In the back yard the fire pit is just perfect for a relaxing evening. It is approximately 30 mins from Toledo and has all variety of restaurants and shops about 15 mins away. Dollar General comes in clutch with anything you forgot and is 2 mins up the road. The host is SUPER responsive and kind, even if you are just trying to figure out how to use the TV."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle's place was perfect for my trip to OH. I attended my nephew's wedding and it was only about a 15-minute drive away from the venue.

I now realize I need to purchase a new mattress, lol. I would definitely stay again!"

As I visit the area frequently, I will absolutely be planning to return to this darling farmhouse!"

This little house was so homey in a quiet location, and I was able to get a lot of walking in because it's right next to a trail with gorgeous views. After the trail closed at dark, I did some more walking on the nearby streets which are well lit and felt safe. What a nice town and neighborhood. You can see so many stars on a clear night.
The house itself has absolutely everything I could need with a full sized and well stocked kitchen, full size washer/dryer, walk-in shower and a comfortable bed. I wish I could have stayed more than 1 night...I would definitely stay again if I am in the area!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a short but lovely stay. The home has a great flow, an amazing kitchen and very comfortable couches. Our little son really enjoyed discovering the porch. The only downside was that the bedroom door was squeaking, which meant putting our son to sleep and sneaking out was a little more difficult than usually. There was a pedestrian and bike path very nearby, but we sadly didn’t have enough time to check it out. We‘d love to stay here again if we are ever back in the area!"

It’s a really nice place and we will definitely stay again if we come back to the area.
Also, I know it might sound silly to some but I was really glad he had nightlights throughout the home as I normally take a few & forgot them this trip … It’s always helpful to have a lil light at night when your in an unfamiliar area. And I thought it was pretty neat that they are dimmable! I’ve never seen that before. Lol.
Thanks for being a great host & letting us stay in your cozy lil house!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value! We originally were looking to be close to Oak Openings, and then we saw the posting for Kyle’s place. It was perfect for us. We loved the privacy and the country atmosphere. And it was very clean and well decorated. It’s pretty close to Providence Metropark, and they happened to be having a special event, so we got to go inside the mill and enjoy some live music and refreshments. Also, the Wabash Cannonball biking/walking trail was right by the house, and we enjoyed the peaceful walk there as well. To top it off we went to church close by at a place built in 1845 😲 and then went to Oak Openings."
