2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This definitely was a hidden gem. Why stay in a pricey motel when you can relax in your own living room with a deck to enjoy the outdoors. It's tucked back off the street behind a 4-plex, so no cars driving by your window. There's a tree line by the deck to enjoy birdwatching and your own private oasis. We really enjoyed our stay."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Luxury at budget cost! I rented this unit as I was in town for business, but I only wished I could've stayed longer. It is a great place for a staycation and I would love to go back! Just a heads up that when you navigate to the unit, GPS will take you to the driveway in between a church an another triplex. The actual unit is behind both. Not anything negative towards the owners as it's nothing they can change, but just a heads up if you're directionally challenged like myself ü§£."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Evacuating Florida from Hurricane IAN wasn‚Äôt the original plan a month ago, I was fortunate that it just happen to work out the way it did; David and Christy were very communicative and extended my stay at a fraction of there daily price to accommodate from the hurricane!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this stay! It was a perfect getaway for me and my husband. We enjoyed cooking and relaxing, mostly stayed in the Lewisburg/Lynnville area but did take a day trip to the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville which is an easy 50 minute ride north. Beautifully decorated, exactly as described with comfortable bedding we absolutely recommend booking here! The deck is a bonus- I did yoga in the mornings on the deck and then we enjoyed coffee in the rocking chairs."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"David and Christy's place is so perfect for a couple! Location is awesome if you're exploring middle Tennessee, south Tennessee, and northern Alabama. 52 mi to Nashville and 51 mi to Huntsville. 35-40 mins to Lynchburg. It's a perfect base for exploration and a warm cozy place to come back to at the end of a long day. Close to lots of restaurants and a Walmart that's like a mile away. We enjoyed relaxing on the deck and watching the squirrels. Is you have a chance to book this place, you can't go wrong. They also communicate excellently and quickly. It's our first time in Tennessee and nine days wasn't long enough. Looking forward to coming back and hopefully David and Christy's place will be available!"

(If you come as a family with kids, you can probably make it work for more than two people, but it may get cramped.)

I reached out about needing a crib for my baby and she offered to buy one for the place so I wouldn‚Äôt have to travel with one.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Natalie's ""A Place in the pines"",
is a great AirBnB for us as a couple. it's in a smaller town (Lewisbirg, TN), and was convenient for us to drive to Culleoka for a David Phelps Gospel Concert.
Their place was an attached room to their main house at the rear, but totally setup as a stand alone apartment with two entrances, (probably per code), with an open plan, it had a kitchen, eating area, and TV / couch area. The balance of the unit had a great bedroom and beautiful bathroom with shower. This unit was recently remodeled or built and is well appointed and layed out well with all things needed. (Here are a few things to add though (that would make it better for us: a fly swatter, toaster, ant spray or traps, maybe a box of tissues. Further, an adjustment of the back door keypad deadbolt lock might be in order. (It locks, but double-check it, you possibly have to pull the door a little as the deadbolt is throwing into the locking position).
We were very happy and pleased.
Good Job!!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Very dog friendly place to stay. Private porch area with a small clover filled yard for my chocolate lab to play. The space was well shaded which was great because my WI pup isn't adjusted to TN heat. We enjoyed say hello to the deer that visited the area each morning.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Natalie‚Äôs place was EXACTLY what we were looking for! The setting was so quiet and peaceful. There was adequate room both for us AND our two dogs (Labs).

Thanks Natalie!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for a homesteading festival in Columbia. It was very easy to find and the commute back and forth was nice. The space is small but has everything you could need and exceptionally clean. Extra linens and towels were an added bonus.
Also we bought our kids a pool to entertain them when we were back from the festival and they helped us get the hose and let us fill it up. Great hosts!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wish all airbnbs were like this one. It was perfect. Clean. Private. It had everything you need. It is clearly cared for and kept up.

The bed was extremely comfortable, made it a little hard to get out of sometimes! The neighborhood was great to take walks with the dog, and the neighbors seemed friendly.

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,The place was exactly what we needed for the weekend. It was very homey and perfect for my husband and I with our 3 month old. Natalie made sure we had everything we needed. The extra perk was that we woke up to about 8 deer outside of our window and was able to watch them for several hours eating! So peaceful and beautiful!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was peaceful and pleasant, but because of illness, was brief and had to be cut short. We only got to stay one night of the four we booked. Natalie gave us a very generous refund which is very appreciated. Thank You, Natalie."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place at a great price. Natalie is a great hostess and goes back to the original spirit of airbnb. The space is great and the bed slept so well I tried to find out who made the mattress lol.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my second time staying at Natalie's place. everything was as perfect as last time. Very clean, new, and locaton is so peaceful. perfect for my dogs as well. highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! Easy to access, comfy bed, and super modern and clean! The unit is on the back side of their private home, but you don't hear them, it's so private! We loved having movie night with our toddler on the pullout sofa in the living room! Host was EXTREMELY responsive & so sweet!! If we ever make our way back down, we'd 100% stay again!"

Beautiful surrounding area, very clean, everything we needed for our week and a half stay. Would definitely stay there again! Thank you, Natalie!!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted a real Tennessee experience by living on a farm and this farm has well exceeded my expecations. Coming from a dense suburb of SoCal, I wanted to live a different lifestyle, this was the place. Loving the scenery and peacefulness, it was the best way to detach from reality. Lush greens and trees, birds chirping as you wake up, beautiful sun with breeze, what more can you ask for? During a week, I formed a bond with the goats and Herman, the brown horse. I called him that I was leaving and he came to me from his shed. I will definitely be back!! Location is close to Alabama if you want to go deep south."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed a few days at this place and everything was great. We loved being off the beaten path.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, nice farm life while being fairly close to town when needed. Nice cozy place for one bedroom, large kitchen, nice deck to relax on. Our host was very easy to get ahold of and helped make our stay comfortable any way possible."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful place to stay and very friendly host
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay at this place. Kristin was responsive every time I communicated with her. For a 1 bedroom space it was very roomy and had a large kitchen area. Very comfortable bed (although it is very high and can be a challenge to get into as I found out as a shorter person). Wish the weather had been nicer and we could have enjoyed the beautiful deck out back! Thanks Kristin for a peaceful stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristin and Bill were super friendly and helpful! The airbnb is a sweet cozy apartment with beautiful views of their property. It is private and comfortable! The king bed was so comfortable!!
Thank you for a great stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kristin was the most responsive host I‚Äôve ever had. She was very concerned that our stay went well and offered up and beyond.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,I can not say in words how positive my stay was at the farm. Out away from noise. Visited the goats & doggie daily. Was just what I needed. Will go back when I can sit on the porch & quilt. Host responded quickly & the directions for getting in were exactly as stated. I‚Äôd give 6 stars if I could.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen was an amazing host, responded quickly and very friendly"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful stay. We had a concert to go to in Nashville and we found ourselves so comfortable after when we came back to the air bnb. Rufus the dog was the sweetest greeter. Our host, Kristin helped us out and went above and beyond for us. It really felt like we were taken care of. Thank you for such a comfy and cozy place!"

Thank you Kristin and Bill."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoy staying at this place.
I loved that they were very generous at leaving some tooth brushes (I forgot mine) and tooth paste, shampoo, etc! It was very convenient.
Beautiful place, with gorgeous animals. One thing to keep in my is that the family dog has his daily spot (in the middle of the driveway), so very careful when driving. After all, it‚Äôs his home and his space üòÖ. He was Super lovely and friendly and just enjoying life In that spot! We loved that!
Thank you Kristin, it was a nice staying!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Very peaceful and quiet. We loved meeting Rufus and the farm animals.

The apartment has absolutely everything you‚Äôd need, and it‚Äôs incredibly peaceful and quiet. I love all the trees and the deck is perfect for morning coffee. It‚Äôs a nature lover‚Äôs antidote to the busy-ness and traffic of Franklin. Two enthusiastic thumbs up! I‚Äôm looking forward to my next stay üòä"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful farm environment. The location is above a stand alone garage but never saw or heard anything below. Very nice rear deck to observe stars and enjoy morning coffee. Everything worked. Seniors be advised the bed sits a bit high but is very comfortable.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW! What an oasis!
If you enjoy peaceful country escapes, this is your place!
Kristin's place is super clean, quiet and beautiful.
Kristin is a great responsive host and she is very kind!
We're a traveling family in the Air Force and Kristin made us feel immediately at home!
You occasionally got to hear their dog Rufus saying hello down below which just added to the country charm!
We also made friends with some adorable goats and enjoyed watching the sunrise over their field and tree line from the balcony.
The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking and there are some great local areas near by!
Not far from Nashville or Lewisburg without the big city buzz!
Very grateful for this gem of a find!
We'll definitely be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I always rent from airbnb because we have never had a bad experience. This was no exception. Kristen's place was clean, check in was easy, and Kristen was very quick to respond. This place is very quiet and peaceful, and the king bed is very comfortable. We are from SC and went to Tennessee (9 hour drive) for the David Phelps' Mule Day Barn Bash. We enjoyed a long weekend, and we are glad we chose Kristen's place to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristin's place was exactly as described. She was very helpful and responsive. Her place was clean and comfortable. Very relaxing and peaceful. Even though her home was right next door, it felt private. Our favorite part was seeing the deer play in the back. Would definitely stay again and recommend."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I really enjoyed my time here. The property is beautiful, private, and quiet. It's close enough to I-65 to be convenient but far enough away that you don't hear any traffic AT ALL. I had business in Franklin and this place was a wonderful respite from all the busy-ness and traffic up there. Kristin was wonderful- always responded right away and was super accommodating. The apartment was very comfortable- spotlessly clean, with a comfortable bed, and had everything I needed. Loved the fully stocked kitchen and washer/dryer. I'll be coming back to the area in the spring and this apartment will be my first stop when looking to book housing. Thanks again for a lovely stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amazing place. very peaceful and quiet. Had a pleasant welcoming from Rufus the dog and his party of goats. Very clean and has all needed amenities. Would stay again.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a week here whilst visiting Nashville, it was beautiful ! so peaceful away from the hustle and bustle whilst still being a car ride away from all the sights.

Host are lovely we highly recommend a stay here."

As far as the place is concerned, it is well located in the countryside, very quiet and relaxing. Everything was very clean, and we were provided with everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and, for people sensitive to laundry like us, you can book the place, there was not chemical smell on the sheets nor in the house. We will go back if we can."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was my first time in an Air B&B and after staying on Kristin's farm, I can say its going to be a hard bar to reach. The home was clean and fully equipped with every amenity needed for a fully operational home! My favorite part of the home was the deck where I spent many nights watching the sunset.
 
The farm was soo beautiful! I took many walks and runs around the farm greeting the various farm animals (the goats are my favorite). The hosts are are accommodating and pleasant people to meet! If you are looking for a quiet, peaceful Air B&B, look no further!  "
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place in every way! The apt is sparkling clean, well equipped, and so comfortable. The farm is beautiful!! We loved sitting on the deck watching the gorgeous sunset and then the lightening bugs over the field. The goats are so friendly and cute!! Highly recommend!!"

I would definitely recommend this beautiful spot and stay here again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kristin and Bill's place is AMAZING. The property is beautiful and so quiet (except for the beautiful nature noises). There's green all over, fresh air, birds, deer, squirrels. The goats, cats, doggos, horses, and all the animals were the cutest and most incredible. Before settling in, please read the binder with all the animal info since there are some important details about the farm animals that we guests need to know about.
The house had everything we needed, was sparkling clean, cozy, and warm. For people who love to cook (like myself), the kitchen is super well-equipped, from baking pans to pizza baking trays, all kinds and sizes of pans, utensils, it was a dream! Kristen and Bill were so wonderful, kind, flexible, and quick to respond to any questions we had.
This property was one of the best stays I've ever had and I can't wait to come back."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Upon returning to Tennessee, I had to attend my son and brand new daughter-in-law‚Äòs reception in Lewisburg. There were no Airbnb‚Äòs in Lewisburg so I went between three and Jan looked the most accommodating and well kept. Cornersville was about a 21 minute drive to Lewisburg. It was not a bad drive at all. I absolutely love the tiny house, and it was exactly as Jan had described and posted pictures. If I am ever in corners again, I would love to stay at the tiny home once again. Beautiful beautiful I had utter peace."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved it here! We are looking forward to coming back again! Thank You Jan for sharing this wonderful place! We will be back!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny home was clean and cute. The view was gorgeous! Thank goodness we left a day early, though! A tornado ripped through the county and there‚Äôs no storm shelter anywhere near. The tiny home is about like being in a camper and would be extremely unsafe in severe weather. The closest (24 hour) structurally sound building is several miles away. When I asked to change dates last minute bc of the severe weather forecast, I was told no bc of it being last minute but that I could cancel and receive 1/2 of our full amount back. We still lost out on that last day but at least we were safe and sound!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We always have enjoyed our stays here over the years!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This tiny home was adorable with amazing views. Easy directions/check in. Short drive to restaurants / hwy. We stayed for our appts at Platinum Wellness in Pulaski. A short 15min drive. The home was spotless and very comfortable. Thank you so much Jan!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,perfect !
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall this place was pretty good.
I stayed for 2 nights for around $450. Overall, an ok deal; granted I did stay over spring break so I‚Äôm assuming prices were possibly inflated. However, while an adorable little house with a beautiful view, you will be 15 minutes away from the nearest town.
Im assuming they do not use a cleaning crew, due to the remote nature of the house. They also expect you to clean all dishes before leaving which is fine.
This leads to the first minor problem: none of the dishes were clean. I had to rewash everything by hand. Also, some parts of the counter and floors had crumbs/etc on them, as well as the bathmat.
Also, if you are allergic to pet hair, probably best to choose somewhere else; my allergies were horrendous here. Not faulting them though as they do disclose pets are allowed and I never saw any pet hair from previous tenants.
Knives are cheap; couldn‚Äôt cut cilantro.
Negatives aside, place is gorgeous, quiet, and perfect for a romantic getaway
4/5"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay. Jan is a very communicative host The space is lovely getaway but close enough to restaurants, shopping and parks to make travel and access easy. Will stay again!!!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"From beginning to end our mini vacation was just what we needed and Jan‚Äôs place did not disappoint. The view from the deck, the yard, the surrounding, feeling safe, private‚Ä¶ what a treat and a great find. We have found a new vacation spot that is within driving distance‚Ä¶ and the golf at Saddle Creek was great as well. Thanks Jan for making this wonder spot available. ;)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My pup and I had a wonderful weekend at Jan's house. It was easy to find, not far from highway, but felt a million miles away! Super comfy bed and couch, huge TV, cozy electric fire and gorgeous, pastoral view..just perfect! Hope to visit again!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being less than 10 minutes from the interstate as well as the great views made this place an awesome location to stay.

Jan (I believe he pronounced his name ""yahn"") as a host couldn't have been easier to deal with. He never intruded, but I did flag him down when he was working on his property. The conversation ended with him offering the golf cart he was in for us to see the surrounding area. We will definitely book this home again when we return to the area."

Jan's German Shepherds at the main house are incredibly well behaved, didn't bother with us as we took our morning walk! Thanks again Jan, see you soon~"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing stay!! Perfectly clean home. Better than the pics. Spent the afternoon walking the roads and checking out the locals farms - plenty of cows, horses and deer. Grilled out on the porch, stayed warm by an outdoor heater, listened to all the evening sounds while we watched fall leaves and beautiful fields. Perfect day!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our short stay. Jan was very kind and responsive when we had a couple of questions. The house was super cute + clean and so comfortable. And a beautiful spot.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! We will be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the view! The place was cute and clean and just as described. Nice getaway for our family.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,My second stay was just as lovely as the first!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place that was very accommodating. Stayed there one night to break up drive but would stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place. Clean and welcoming. would stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was so peaceful and relaxing!! For a tiny house it felt big and cozy!! We spent the evening grilling and sitting on the covered porch! We enjoyed watching all the humming birds!! Even though we could see the house across from us we still felt secluded! It is very beautiful!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful tiny house with a great view! We enjoyed relaxing on the deck and having a few days of getting away. The home was super clean and located far enough out of town to relax but easy to go to town if needed. We can‚Äôt wait to plan another trip!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny home far surpassed my expectations. It‚Äôs in amazing condition and on such beautiful land. The views were amazing, the sounds of cows in the background, and the buzz of the humming birds made sitting outside in the cozy chairs so enjoyable. I highly suggest staying here! Plan to keep this place on my radar whenever passing threw the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great views, great location and everything was super easy with Jan. Definitely will stay here again, my
Only complaint is there is no wifi so couldn‚Äôt end the night with a movie, but it‚Äôs still a perfect place to stay for a little getaway!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful space and was so convenient and private for us to visit family nearby.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was beautiful and had everything I needed. Very easy check in process and the space felt private and secluded. The outdoor sitting/lounging spaces were my favorite.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Phenomenal. Loved the porches and the view. Fantastic. Comfortable beds. Clean and cozy. I would absolutely recommend and would stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful weekend here. It poured rain on Saturday but it didn't matter because we could still enjoy the view from the covered front porch. When I asked Jan about any local hiking spots, not only did she provide a suggestion, she printed out a map and hand-wrote instructions on how to get there. She left the map on the counter, and it was such a thoughtful thing to find there when we arrived."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing views, peaceful stay. Perfect little getaway place away from hustle and bustle. All the comforts of home. I wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House was as pictured, everything was nice and new. Beautiful views and private setting. We only stayed one night as a stop on a long drive so we didn't get to spend much time there but it would definitely be a place I wouldstay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, perfect for a small family."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"My wife, child and I ultimately enjoyed our time at the Alexander but were somewhat disappointed with the overall experience. We had every intention of utilizing the outdoor space most of the time there. That was cut short when I got stung by wasp 30 minutes in. After some pain, investigation, and a bottle of wasp killer I had discovered several nests. By the end, there were at least 7 nests either on the roof, patio furniture or house. I texted Jan letting him know I had used the entire bottle of wasp killer. He arrived shortly after with two more bottles. He informed me that he had sprayed the house earlier that day, but stated that he needed to start knocking the nests down in the future (that didn‚Äôt happen while we there). After he left I continued to see wasps and took it upon myself to knock several nests down. By the end of our trip I had killed at least 20 wasps, 4 inside. We spent most the time inside.
The creek isn‚Äôt one you can enjoy.
Property itself is beautiful."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As mentioned in my last review, we loved the place so much we booked it again for the end of our journey. If you love nature this is the place for you. We woke up to deer, cows, and hummingbirds galore. Jan took every precaution from bug lamps to sprays and diffusers to ensure a comfortable stay in the outdoor space. We loved the chairs on the porch so much that we will be buying a set for home. The place is clean, organized, and cozy. The guide book was very thorough and helped us choose a great place for dinner on our first stay. Not to mention my nephew‚Äôs excitement when we told him he could sign the guest rock! Truly a gem of a stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great visit in this hidden gem! If you‚Äôre looking for peace and a fresh of breathe air this is this place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan‚Äôs place is absolutely brilliant. Beautiful view, private, wonderfully decorated and cared for. We loved every moment of our stay so much so that we booked the place again for our return trip. It was clear that a lot of thought and caring touches were included in our stay. The space was perfect for us and we enjoyed sitting on the porch watching deer and cows in the field. 10/10."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is wonderful! It was very clean and comfortable. We took a walk up the road and the countryside was lovely. Grilled our dinner out and sat on covered porch in the rain and at dinner. We would definitely come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little getaway thank you Jan for hosting
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jan's place was amazing! As soon as we walked in I was already planning my next visit there. The views were beautiful. The home was cozy and so cute. My husband and loved it so much we wished we could have stayed longer. Definitely recommend and we WILL be back. Jan was very welcoming. Very helpful and gave great suggestions for places to visit/ eat. Can't wait to go back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place in a country setting. Great communication from host. Jan's place is super clean. Its not a huge space but plenty big enough for my family of 3 plus 2 small dogs. Nothing but positive to say!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was great.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jan's cottage was absolutely beautiful. It was better than I thought. Beds were super comfy and the view was spectacular. We were only there for a night as we traveled through, but will definitely keep this gem in mind when we are in the area again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for a weekend getaway. The view from the deck is stunning, the guest cabin is far enough away from the main house that it feels private, but close enough that if there had been an emergency, it wouldn't have been difficult to get help. The cabin was cozy, the perfect size for two adults and our dog. I can't say anything about nearby hiking, shopping, eating, etc. as my mom and I stayed in all weekend to read. ;) The Keurig was such a nice amenity, given that we were determined to make the weekend as simple as possible. We walked the dog along the road leading to the house, and we encountered a couple folks on motorcycles, but that was it. This place truly is out in the middle of nowhere and off the beaten path, so if you're looking for somewhere to go that feels out of the way, this is a gem. :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place
Beautiful views
Easy to find
20 minutes from town

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved it!!!‚Äô A complete Zen retreat. It was a perfect place to land after a twelve hour car drive. If you love nature want a heavenly escape this is the place for you.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely perfect! We wouldn‚Äôt have changed a thing. It was a perfect stopping point from Ohio to Destin! Minutes from the highway. We will be back :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Alexander was by far the best stay I have experienced. A quiet, beautiful respite.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just about an hour drive from the city and it is absolutely amazing, gorgeous views, all the amenities one could ask for. I had one question while I was there and I got a response very quickly! I‚Äôd definitely come back here soon, for the price and location this place is an absolute steal in my opinion!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and surroundings! Tiny home felt spacious and plenty of a room for a family of 4.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this place and we will be back. We are staying at local AirBnB's and Bed and Breakfasts' to find ones we like for quick overnight or weekend get-a-ways. This place will be at the top of our list. The pictures don't do it justice. The views feel like you are in the Smokey Mountains and the Cottage is perfect for a nice peaceful time. I can't express how much we loved this spot. 5 stars across the board!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely delightful. Great place to relax. Rest and unwind. The views. Wow. The home and amenities were perfect. Definitely plan to come back again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Jan‚Äôs place for a night, 4 adults and 2 kids. Just a place to stop on a longer trip. We got in late, around midnight and were gone by 9am. The place was immaculate and we commented how we would definitely stay longer there. Beautiful view and quiet outside. Wonderful setup."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect stop on our I-65 south journey!
Clean, easy, peaceful. We took a beautiful morning walk waiting for family members to wake up. Spectacular scenery!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had another wonderful stay at the Alexander. The cottage is perfect.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jan's place is beautiful! We stayed with our two kids (7 and 12) and they loved the bunk and loft! The beds are very comfortable and the kitchen is well-stocked. Everything is very clean and the view is gorgeous.
We only had a couple issues to be aware of if you rent the place: 1) the power in the back half of the house went out a few times. The breakers are in the back bedroom, so if you run into that issue, turn them off and on again; 2) there are lots of wasps on the outside deck this time of year (spring), even though she tried to spray them before our arrival. That put a damper on our stay because we were really looking forward to cooking out on the deck, but didn't want to take our chances.
Otherwise, we loved our stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed on our way down to the beach for spring break. It was very nice, clean, quiet, and beautiful views. It was close to the interstate but a world away. Much better than a hotel for our family of 5. My only warning is that the bunk beds have thin mattresses and are really meant for smaller kids and aren‚Äôt comfortable for teens or adults. But otherwise this place is great and we‚Äôd definitely stay again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect spot! And the tiny home was so cute! Thank you for all you do!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for allowing us to stay at your beautiful tiny house.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"I really liked the place -- awesome location, and a perfect place for a weekend getaway. I wanted to love the place so much, especially given the small touches that Jan included, but the only thing that I wished was better was the bug situation. I had to catch 2 stinkbugs, and found more. But I understand that it would be near difficult to completely get rid of them, since it is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nature. Overall good stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed overnight on a road trip to New Orleans from Pittsburgh. Jan‚Äôs cabin is super welcoming and luxurious. Well equipped with everything you‚Äôd need except Wifi. Our dog Hugo loved the yard! We would definitely stay again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely fantastic stay! We were looking for a peaceful getaway with a good view and small town vibe in the area and that is exactly what The Alexander is. Location is as described and the photos are dead on. We will definitely be back and would highly suggest to others.

The layout is great and was easily comfortable for the 4 of us."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved our time at the Alexander! It‚Äôs quaint and beautiful. We would gladly come back again.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This a beautiful place and it was perfect for our stay for the night as we continued south the following day. Our dog loved roaming and her athletic self took advantage of all the space outside. This place had everything we possibly needed and provided so much firewood for the fire pit. The scenery is peaceful and we really enjoyed this stay.
2022-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"the place in general, it is beautiful, I like the surroundings it has, only rural landscape and the house is very beautiful, it has access to a heater outside, they have coffee to prepare, it is the best for a frozen morning, I did not like that it did not have WiFi and hot water but the rest was wonderful"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect, peaceful getaway. The cabin was cozy and had everything we needed. The scenery was beyond beautiful this time of year. I highly recommend this property if you‚Äôre looking to relax and recharge. We will definitely go back!"

Beautiful view from the patio and such a relaxing atmosphere. We wish we had several days to stay there. The layout of this place makes it feel bigger than what it is. One of the most comfortable beds that we have slept in when we stay at Airbnb's. The location was very convenient. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. There is everything you need for a very relaxing stay. If you are traveling through this area and need a place to stay, don't pass this up. Thank you Jan."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jan's little house in the woods is charming. The outdoors can be fully appreciated with plenty of covered and non-covered seating. We slept comfortably in the bungalow ""room"". Our overall stay was fantastic. We highly recommend this airbnb listing."

The house is fully stocked which made it easy to cook or make your coffee. I appreciated the brita filter in the fridge, the toiletries in the bathroom, and the cute little game corner that kept my kiddos entertained. It‚Äôs extremely easy to come and go using the lock with your passcode. It sits on a quiet street which makes it nice to take evening walks. We will definitely be staying here the next time we visit our family in town!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved staying here!! We were visiting for my cousins wedding in Chapel Hill with my family and it was only 20 minutes from the venue so was a perfect spot. The house is also designed very beautifully and is very unique. It was a big enough house to allow everyone to not be on top of each other getting ready and give everyone space when needed. It also was extremely accessible, as my 84 year old grandma was with us, so the handicap ramp and accessible shower was also very nice to have as well. The home was very private and it was a beautiful drive through the countryside to get there. It is a very peaceful area and Kim was a great host as well. 100% would recommend to anyone!!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Awesome stay and smooth check in and check out!

The home was well maintained and the kitchen had everything one would need to cook a meal or just enjoy a fresh cup of coffee. The host reached out shortly after our arrival to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and when I had a question they were quick to respond.
Enjoyed my stay here and we‚Äôll definitely stay again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were in town on a work trip and Kim and Matt made us feel right at home. They were very responsive hosts and their house had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. They checked in on us during the cold spell and snow we had to make sure we had everything that we needed. Bonus, they have some cute animals on their farm that make for a great breakfast view! We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!!! The home is well equipped throughout and very spacious and comfy!!! Our family loved it would definitely stay again!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What can I say about this home, words do not express the level of attention that Kim and crew have taken to provide a remarkable Home away from home.
The area is absolutely beautiful, the farm in the background is a postcard setting. With horses in the pasture , chickens (producing some delicious fresh eggs) to the other animals providing a truly memorable experience.
The screened in porch give the perfect opportunity to enjoy your morning coffee or evening cocktail. Before you retire to the most comfortable beds adorned with high quality cozy bedding.
Do your self a favor, and add this home to your itinerary, I promise you will not be disappointed."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had so much fun!! We needed a few days away from the kids and thought this was the perfect spot, we were correct. The yurt so so cute and had everything we needed. We enjoyed the hot tub and the creek as well. A great get away to reset and relax. It rained while we were there and my wife highly enjoyed watching the ran with the ‚Äúsunroof‚Äù in the yurt.
We called the kids while we were here and the kids were begging us to bring them to the Yurt. Still deciding if we want to bring them - or keep this place all to ourselves. But we already have plans to return!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely time. The area was quiet. Great experience! Keith was so helpful in accommodating us this weekend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first glamping experience, let alone staying in a yurt. It was fantastic! Keith greeted us on arrival and showed us the layout of the land. Everything is easily accessible. It is very quiet area and we felt really secluded. You cannot tell that you‚Äôre staying on someone‚Äôs property. Keith was accommodating, helpful, and really friendly! We walked around the creek line and also hung out in the shade. There is a spot in the woods with chairs in case you need to cool off. We had everything we needed‚Ä¶heat and ac work and we did use both. The hot tub was very clean and easy to access. I look forward to staying here again and will recommend to friends & family. We plan on visiting again. Thanks Keith and Misty!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This experience was one we will never forget. Amenities were above and beyond what we expected. Keith and his family were so warm and welcoming. If you enjoy camping but want a more luxurious stay, you have to check this out. And the yurt was decorated so cute!!
We had the best of both worlds, a day trip to Nashville (about 1 hour) and a day trip to hike the waterfalls (about 1 hour). Grocery/gas was only 5-10 minutes in case we needed something quick.
I recommend this everyone looking for something different for an affordable price.
Thank you for a perfect vacation!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Aunt Mel's place is comfortable and quaint. There is a mixture of country with updated features. The beds are comfortable, the living room furniture is comfortable and functional. We loved the wood floors, the front porch and the backyard.

The host was very responsive, helpful and friendly. We highly recommended a stay at Aunt Mel's!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed two nights there because of a family wedding at nearby Bullbourne Bison farm. (Nice venue.) Cornersville is a peaceful small rural town with two goats, some chickens and a rooster next door to the Carriage House. Took a walk and neighbors were friendly. Only restaurant we found was the Tennessee Truck and Travel Stop (huge and incudes donut shop). It was very nice and breakfast was the only meal we needed to get.
The Carriage House has a wonderful rainforest shower in a spacious bathroom and a comfortable queen bed. Roku TV in living room works well. Kitchen has full-size appliances but only a few dishes. We didn‚Äôt cook there so it wasn‚Äôt an issue for us.
Enjoyed our stay."

Beautiful home and the goats next door were adorable/ friendly!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House is absolutely gorgeous! The living room/kitchen are beautifully designed. Our favorite room was the bathroom.

We only stayed overnight while traveling home, but would love to be guests again. Thanks for a relaxing stay!"

There's not a lot to do as far as shopping and restaurants. But if you are looking for small town with quiet and peaceful surroundings, this is it. We used it as an opportunity to enjoy driving through the countryside and visiting other small towns in the area.
It is just as described, and the hosts are very responsive. Be sure and say hi to the two goats and chickens that live in the pen next door and marvel at their very posh accommodations as well."

2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Such a cute, charming little place!!!! It smelled homey, it was clean, the bedding was luxurious! The internet/wifi was spotty at best so don‚Äôt plan to get any kind of anything done using the internet, bring a book and snuggle in and enjoy the peaceful fireplace.
The hot water lasts for about 5 minutes, then you‚Äôll get a lukewarm warning for about a minute before it goes full on freezing so be aware of that.
Other than those things it truly was a relaxing, peaceful stay. The goats right next door were so cute, and the whole ambience made me feel like I was much further away from ‚Äúsociety‚Äù than I actually was."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the second time we have visited the carriage house and we will definitely return again! We tried the local cafe our host recommended and highly suggest you visit Cypress Cafe if you stay here :) Beautiful, clean, and private with added bonus of chickens, goats, and tabbies who are so friendly and greet you as you arrive and leave. 10/10"

Sharron was patient understanding and proactive and was able to accommodate another evening. so so so much better than all but the most luxurious hotels I've stayed at. reminded me of a really nice ski lodge I stayed at in Tahoe. excellent!"

The home and atmosphere itself is a perfect gateway in a little world of its own. Very roomy and comfortable, yet modern and up to date with all appliances. Everything you could need was made available, even lists of places to eat and things to do. Our favorite part had to be greeting the animals outside after every visit to and from the house!

Luxurious shower/bathroom, a mini apartment with all the benefits of home (stove, fridge, TV, cute kitchen. laundry) . the bedroom was elegant with a romantic ambiance.

Gina was so prompt with her responses and even offered to take the time to turn the heat on for us as she knew we were going to be getting there later in the evening. They gave us a wonderful tour around their property in the morning and let us get to spend some time around their three beautiful horses. Overall, it was a great stay, and we would absolutely recommend staying here and look forward to coming back in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was amazing!! We really enjoyed our few days away!! The horses were so beautiful too! We will definitely be back! :)

First of all the drive in is GORGEOUS! Lewisburg looks to be a very equestrian are so the whole way there you're really seeing some of the most beautiful homes and horses; its just a dream if yiu love horses.
The apartment itself was so beautiful üòç and something super fun is the windows that look into the horse barn from inside the apartment. The fact that everything runs on well water was so amazing. My hair and skin were SO GRATEFUL for how soft the water was in the shower. As well as I'm just a country girl who appreciates well water.
Mr. Gina and her Husband were just very pleasant and acomidating people and my stay was so comfortable and relaxing its definitely on the top of my list for places I wouod love to return to just for the fun of staying there. üòä"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight! This efficiency barn apartment is so cute! We loved the decor, location in the horse barn, and surrounding area. The room was very comfortable, as was the bed. Super value!"

It was just as pictured and, for those wondering, it did NOT smell like a barn. :) The place was decorated adorably and had everything we needed. The property was beautiful! I wish we could've stayed longer! I even took advantage of the horseback riding lessons offered. It was a one of a kind experience and I would absolutely stay there again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a fun spot! Wish we could have stayed longer to really experience all they had to offer here!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is beautiful. The bed sleeps amazing on my back!üòç Mrs Gina, responded within minutes and answered all questions! Is a very quiet place. The horses first thing in the morning in the field were beautiful! Definitely would love to visit again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, they were accommodating for our pet. Very responsive."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gina and her husband were very easy to get ahold of and very pleasant to speak with. The unit is as described and pictured, clean, and has all the necessities. I had incorrectly assumed that there was a bunch of units just based on the size of the front of the barn, but the rest of the barn is just that- a barn- so I saw no one other than the hosts (and only saw them in passing) so it was a very peaceful stay. There is a Dollar General maybe a mile from the property, and a gas station a bit beyond that, so there are the basics close by, and everything else is an easy 8 minute drive away. If you are in search of an easy, safe, and friendly spot, this will perfectly suit your needs. Thank you Gina and Randall!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay at Gina‚Äôs and got to see some horses the next morning. Loved the country feel and being able to see the stars.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect and just what we needed! Gina was awesome and super flexibly with everything. So glad and thankful that our fur babies were able to get out energy before our long drive in the large grassy area. Definitely would stay here again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was perfect for me and my dog to stay for our competition. Private, safe, and comfortable. Jennifer was the most thoughtful host. She proactively reached out when severe storm warnings were issued to ensure my dog and I remained safe. Great stay!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay. Spacious, peaceful. Gordon was a helpful and responsive host. I would definitely stay here again. Beautiful property on a hill surrounded by trees and wildlife."
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,This place is very peaceful and beautiful. Not as many rooms as noted on the AB&B site. Thank goodness was some of our friends couldn‚Äôt make the trip. For the most part a great stay.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great home and spacious rooms. glad we picked this house to stay at. We will definitely be back to stay here again. Gordon is also a great host who was very responsive and helpful with everything!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place for the whole family! Absolutely beautiful surroundings! Gordan was very accommodating and responsive! He went above and beyond!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The property is amazing and there is plenty to do and see. There is a Dollar General super close and Kroger about 10 mins away. Franklin is under an hour away 100% worth a visit to the downtown square and cute shops. It is obvious that Gordon has a great eye for decor and the home feels fancy but also welcoming. The 2 cats are fun to have around as are the chickens! If you have access to the small cabin outside, it's adorable! The basketball, bikes, board games, and nature are great fun!
Things that you may want to know: There is only one TV in the home and no DVD player. Wifi is available, but not great and phone service (T-Mobile) is spotty. However, nature is always on - we saw turkeys and deer on the property; that was pretty exciting. Most of the cooking supplies are available, but not all that you may expect if you're used to staying in AirBnb's. There is a lady bug encroachment issue around the kitchen and living rooms. The bathroom doors are a little tricky to keep closed."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home sanctuary was just what we needed for reconnection. Off the beaten path, surrounded by nature and all its glory. Our family had a nice weekend away from life‚Äôs hustle and bustle. The home had everything we needed. The kids enjoyed playing basketball and ping pong. Also, loved the cats (we named one Garfield) and watching the fish and chickens. Gordon was a nice host and very responsive.
I would recommend going to the residence during daylight hours initially, so you can get a feel for the driveway leading to the home."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay. The property was beautiful and peaceful. Gordon was very responsive and accommodating to our needs. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gordon very good host, we had 10 guest staying and all happy with accommodations. A nice peaceful area to stay"

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The property was awesome. Very peaceful and private. Lots to do on the property. My daughter and I picked blackberries! I was looking forward to the chickens and fresh eggs but none were on the property as advertised. The house is beautiful! Tons of games are provided, we enjoyed the swing on the property as well. I noticed a few small ant like insects on the sheets in the small bedroom next to the master suite . Other than that this place is perfect. Gordon has thought of everything! there are tons of amenities available. this property is beautiful and my family is already discussing returning soon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gordon is a great host! He was quick to answer all my questions. House was beautiful. You‚Äôre in your own world with no neighbors in sight, which was great for my loud family. Make sure to follow his directions!! Check in & out were easy, no issues. Great outdoor areas to hangout. We were upset the hot tub wasn‚Äôt working, but that was the only minor issue. Overall we had an awesome time and would return!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Out stay at Avalon was fantastic! Gordon was quick to answer any questions, and following his directions we found the house with ease.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A perfect place for our family to get together for a weekend away from the hustle and bustle!!! Thank you Gordon
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was perfect for our lowkey Bachelorette weekend. Gordon was very helpful and proactive with his communications. His directions definitely helped me find the place when my GPS was lacking. A few girls were disappointed that the hot tub was not functioning during our stay, but it felt like we were somewhere secluded in the mountains despite being so close to town.
One of the beds was much firmer than I am used to, so my son was not a fan of sleeping there. The girls were huge fans of collecting fresh eggs from the chickens.
Overall, we genuinely enjoyed our stay and had plenty of space and lots to do. We would definitely recommend it to others."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"We had such a wonderful retreat at this cool spot! Everything was as described, the location was quiet and comfortable. Can‚Äôt wait for a return visit!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our weekend at Avalon. The large house and spacious yard offered plenty of space for our needs. Gordon is extremely responsive and great to work with. We will definitely be keeping this place in mind for future getaways!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Gordon's amazing property. It is definitely secluded so be sure and follow Gordon's instructions. GPS will not get you there...
The place was spotless and we were very comfortable. The bed in the master was very comfortable but there are no curtains so be ready to wake up when the sun rises. :-)
There is very limited internet (as described in other reviews) so do not plan on watching television. However, we knew that going in and had a lovely weekend with friends and family exploring the property, cooking and playing games. The cats were also a huge hit with the kids.
Gordon was amazingly responsive. Upon arrival, there was a strange smell that had us slightly worried. I reached out to Gordon and he explained that the HVAC is propane and the smell appeared when the unit was turned on after not being in use for a while. He told us it would dissipate soon and he was correct. We had no issues at all after that.
All in all, it was a very great stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"What a great house! Exactly as advertised and extremely clean. You could bring your large family, or use as a romantic get a way because the setting is so lovely. Would use again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay! We had a Christmas/ New Year family get-together with kids and grands---- Gordon was very responsive to all questions. We spent time in Nashville as well as exploring the small town of Columbia. We all loved the outdoor grounds----used the firepit almost nightly-----The outdoor kitchen was also well utilized! Plenty of room for all to enjoy.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here with our adult children over Thanksgiving and it was very nice. Lots of activities to do, and plenty of space to hang out. The setting is very peaceful and private. We had our two dogs with us and they loved exploring the grounds. We also saw so many deer. This was exactly what we were looking for. The only disappointment was the hot tub was not going. I know it says seasonal on the listing, I find spring and fall the best season for hot tubs. But overall that was minor! The kitchen was easy to cook in, and had sharp knives (which is rare in Airbnb). The bedrooms are spacious."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is really a great place. It‚Äôs relaxing, surrounded by nature, and there are extremely friendly cats around the property. The space was clean, there was a variety of things to do around the house, and the host (Gordon) is extremely responsive. We had 3 separate cars come and no one had any trouble finding the place or getting up the driveway ‚Äî which was on the steep side, but again, no issues.
As my group was staying there, I heard a couple comment that they‚Äôd love to return and take Gordon up on his offer of a cooking class."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We had an awesome stay at Avalon! The land is gorgeous, the house is terrific, and Gordon was a very responsive and accommodating host. My only note: the wifi is not great, so browsing the internet (or streaming the TV) was a challenge.
Overall, 5-stars and highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Gordon‚Äôs place is prettier than what it looks in the pictures. We had a fun stay plus hosted a baby shower at the venue. Gordon was very flexible with timings, party size and so forth. He is super responsive and clear about all the communication. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends for a weekend getaway."
2022-10-01,4,Group trip,"The property was beautiful, the cats super friendly and Gordon was friendly and quick to respond to any questions. Just a little disappointed in the shape of the outside grill. But an overall good experience."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Avalon is picturesque and perfect for our family. Gordon is friendly, helpful, responsive and quickly became a family friend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,the place was great
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nature at its best! We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful, quiet farmhouse, which looked even better than the pictures. It was spacious, clean, and comfortable with lots of indoor and outdoor seating areas. The friendly cats greeted us when we went outside. We saw several deer and ducks on the property, which was a pleasant surprise. Gordon provided bikes which were great for riding around the area -- better going downhill than up. Lewisburg itself is a little sleepy but nearby Columbia is charming and worth a visit. We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was comfortable and nicely decorated. Make sure you follow directions and driveway conditions provided by the Host. The landscaping was high from the heat and rain, but I am sure when that is taken care of the courtyard and grounds would be great. The Host is a good communicator and made sure we were taken care of. Would definitely go back."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home! My family had an amazing time. Perfect change of scenery with a combination of rustic tranquility and modern amenities. Highly recommend.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Great stay
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Just be sure to follow Gordon's instructions on finding the house, rather than following GPS."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful stunning outdoor space for nature lovers!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Avalon is a great retreat for country relaxation. Nestled in the hills of Lewisburg you are surrounded by the beauty of the countryside and just miles from necessity shopping. Reception is spotty so plan in advance the use of WiFi on devices.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Home is nestled on the hilltop and offers privacy. Great home for adults and children alike.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"perfect farm house - our kids loved the nature. Every morning they would go collect the eggs from the chickens and then make fresh scrambled eggs.
The house is fully stocked and plentt of room for everyone.
We really enjoyed our stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gordon was, by far, the most attentive host. He made sure we had everything we needed and went above and beyond with even getting us some s‚Äômore sticks. The house is gorgeous and so peaceful. We often enjoyed meals on the back deck and my kids loved checking for eggs every morning and playing with the cats. I would highly recommend you considering Avalon. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing location and very comfortable home! Extremely relaxing time with family and no distractions. Gordon is very responsive to all questions and made our stay easy and fun.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home and property. We found everything we needed and beds were comfortable. Great weekend for our party of 7!
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay. The house was extremely clean and had plenty of towels, blankets, etc. An added benefit are the cats and chickens and wildlife. The stars were magnificent. Highly recommend this ridge top country retreat."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If I run away from home, you can find me at Avalon. What a lovely property! Indoors and out, it's a pleasure to spend time there.
We had 6 adults and an infant, and there was PLENTY of space for everyone! The weather interfered with our ability to spend a lot of time outdoors, but the property itself is very pretty. I'll bet it's gorgeous when everything is in bloom.
Gordon was a pleasure to rent from. He's easy to reach, and answered all of our questions. Everything we needed was provided at the house. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spacious home. Nice and quiet property. Gordon is a superb host.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gordon's beautiful home and property is a special place. It sits atop a hill and allows you to appreciate the stunning scenery while also lending full privacy. There is so much to see and explore on his land from the chickens to the koi pond to the greenhouse that you may not even feel the need to explore elsewhere. There's so many other spaces too - an outdoor kitchen and pergola, a swing and fire pit and a big red barn that has a small walking trail behind it. Despite the bitter cold, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves exploring all Gordon's property has to offer. And for those that want to get away but don't necessarily want to spend all day outside, there are numerous indoor games as well as table tennis. The kitchen is fully equipped for those that enjoy cooking and there is both a tea kettle and a coffee maker for a morning boost. We utilized two bedrooms in the home and the beds were quite comfortable and the sheets were of nice quality. I appreciate that there were plenty of toiletries left at the house as well (tp, soap, linens, etc). In addition to the home and property being lovely, the host, Gordon, was equally so. He was quick to respond and provided detailed driving instructions prior to our trip. He even made sure our 5 year old daughter ""found"" an egg in the chicken coop. It's this kindness and attention to detail that separates good hosts from incredible ones. If you're considering this beautiful property and home, book it. You'll be glad you did. We're already planning another trip in the spring so we can experience the property in a different season. Also, the location is great - it's 15 minutes to just about everything in the surrounding area."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home in a secluded and picturesque area of TN. The house is expansive with plenty of room for a large party of folks. The property is beautiful and fun to explore. As mentioned you will need an SUV or similar to get up the hill to the house. Highly recommend and hope to return!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at Gordon's place! We are already talking about coming back when the hot-tub is running and all of the plants are blooming.
The property is beautifully landscaped and the sunrise and sunset views are amazing from the top of the hill. Despite it being a very cold January weekend, we enjoyed sitting in the greenhouse during the day to play games. There are also a ton of stars visible on nights with few clouds.
The house itself is very well outfitted and the kitchen really does have everything you may need for cooking. The dining room table is big enough to squeeze in 10 people for meals and games.
Things I'd suggest to people looking at booking this house:
-Try to have at least one vehicle coming that has AWD. Front wheel drive cars will not make it up to the house, and carrying all your stuff up the hill is quite a cardio workout.
-If you want to hook a game system up to the TV, bring your own extension cord because there is not an accessible outlet near the TV.
-There are not many lights outside and it is very dark at night, so I'd suggest bringing headlamps or flashlights with you if you want to go outside at night.
-If you want to sleep in, bring an eye mask to block out the light because the bedrooms get very bright in the mornings."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our weekend getaway here! Could have spent hours just looking at all of the interesting decorations around the house and spent a ton of time outdoors exploring the property. If you‚Äôre looking for some time away, this is a great spot."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great get-away! Enjoyed the deer roaming the property, fresh eggs in the morning and the peace and quiet. We had a quiet Thanksgiving there to enjoy family without distractions. Gordon's communication was very prompt and informative."
2021-11-01,4,Group trip,"As city folks coming to a country hilltop estate, it was a huge difference, but we had a great time! Gordon was very responsive and he had an amazing property.
Please please please, read and take snapshot of the details of how to get to the location. We arrived at night, which was not recommended because of the dark roads, but because of work and where we were coming from, that was the only time possible that we could make it. Your GPS will likely take you to the wrong spot, and we were trying to get into Gordon's neighbor's house (oops), until we called him.
Also, the service and wifi is a little iffy, so this is an amazing place for a getaway with your family. Being from Chicago, I rarely ever see chickens, so it was an amazing site when we woke up in the morning to see the chickens and even get a chance to get some fresh eggs.
Also, during the day, the property is beautiful! You must go out and explore! There's a small pond, bikes to explore the property and a cute greenhouse! The reason why I say during the day is just because it's super dark at night, so you can't see as much. That may be one of my only suggestions, if there could be a few more lights so that maybe people want to hang out on the property at night (i.e. hot tub, balcony/decks, pond, outdoor kitchen).
In addition, Gordon was very very responsive throughout both the day and night (even when I called him late at night because we were loss trying to get to the property).
Lastly, this location is a little further out from restaurants, etc. so just something to keep in mind. We visited for a baby shower in Spring Hill, which was about 40 minutes away. But there is a nice Mexican restaurant about 15 minutes away.
Would stay again, if I need another family get away."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful little plot of land. Great place to unwind and rest. Really enjoyed the space and amenities. Gordon was delightful to communicate with!
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,We could not have asked for a better place to stay. The home had everything we needed and was so comfortable. We felt at home right away. Outside the home was the perfect setting . We enjoyed the atmosphere and country living. The outdoors brought us such serenity and peace. The animals and goldfish pond were a great bonus. This was the perfect place to get away from our fast paced lives. We are already planning our next visit. Gordan was also the perfect host.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,All of us had the best timeüíó. We didn‚Äôt want to leave. Everything was so wonderful but stay was way to short! Look forward to another stay in this wonderful farm house soon! Gordon was wonderful getting right back to us when I ask questions or needed anything. A bonus. The awesome dog & chickens were so fun & friendly. We loved the experience highly recommended ü•∞
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,An absolute gorgeous yet peaceful getaway‚Ä¶this place was perfect! The host (Gordon) was awesome and his communication prior to and throughout the stay to ensure that we had everything we needed was much appreciated! Hank (the dog) and his crew ensure the place stays safe and sound each day and were an absolute pleasure to hang out with during our stay. You will definitely want to drive an AWD or 4x4 vehicle‚Ä¶the driveway was the only (minor) obstacle and thus the reason for the 4/5 star rating for the location. Everything else was 5/5. We will definitely be back anytime we return to the area. Thanks for an awesome stay and experience!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great and relaxing place to stay! All the animals were friendly and fun! make sure you drive a AWD vehicle for the steep gravel road!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Gordon and his beautiful estate served my coworkers and I superbly. After long, long days of hard work we were able to decompress on the beautiful drive home. When we first arrived, Gordon warned us that the driveway was hard to find. He was right! He stayed patient with us and helped us find the proper driveway. I really appreciate and commend his kindness and love for cooking. He made us a delicious meal one night, and we all shared stories together! There are animals on this property and one of them is a White Great Pyrenees named Hank. Hank is the best and most interesting dog I have ever had the pleasure of meeting!
Thank you so much, Gordon and Hank for making our stay so unique and unforgettable. The two weeks I stayed in Tennessee were some of the most stressful weeks of my life due to work, but when I arrived back ""home"" to Gordon's estate and was greeted by Hank, the cats, and the chickens I just could not stay stressed any longer. I hope someone else can have as great of an experience here as I had with my team!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We would highly recommend staying at Jade's. When we arrived,and entered the home, the first thing my granddaughter(6) seen were a box of donuts,& that was a great way to welcome us:) Jade is very responsive to texts,she immediately responded.
The property is beautiful,& peaceful and would definitely stay here again!!
The best part is her & her family truly care about their guests safety & well being...
a tornado watch was issued for the area, they came to make sure that incase of a tornado we had shelter to seek in such an emergency!! I appreciated that so much!!
Ya'll are wonderful & thank you again for allowing us to stay at your home while visiting family!!
Best wishes always !!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Farmhouse was beautiful! Environment incredibly peaceful. Loved the barn kitties! Jade response quickly to all of my texts. Super clean. Shower was the best shower I've ever been in! Bath towels thick and super soft! She left us donuts which was super sweet!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful country ! Comfortable farm house for a wonderful stay . Friendly people !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our week at this Tennessee farmhouse was lovely! The rustic charm and peaceful surroundings made for a delightful stay. The host was responsive and replied very timely.
A couple things to note; the amenities were sufficient for a quicks stay. For those staying longer, keep in mind that Hygiene products such as shampoo and conditioner are not supplied, the toilet paper is single ply, and the knifes in the kitchen are very dull. It might be worth stopping at the store on your way in.
Another consideration for out-of-state guests like us, is we were caught off guard when we were issued a tornado warning. We were unsure of where to take shelter since there was no basement, interior room, or other shelter. It would be nice if the host provided a pre-planned suggestion.
Despite this, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would consider returning. Overall, a wonderful retreat in Tennessee's countryside!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful area, Jade was very responsive to all our questions. Place was perfect for our trip."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was exactly as described. Had a very wonderful stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying at the farm house. It was very peaceful and a great place to rest after a long day of driving. Everything was well taken care and we just loved being there! My two kids (5 and 3), my mom, and myself were very comfortable and we would stay there again if our travels ever take us back to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great stay! We so much enjoyed the enclosed porch and the reading chair in the kitchen. So worth the money and so peaceful!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic place!! Very cozy and comfy. Peaceful and a perfect place to relax. We will come again!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Will definitely be back! Perfect place to get away for the weekend! So peaceful!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a great place to stay! Big thanks to Jade for having us!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The setting for this airbnb is just amazing. We loved staying there overnight and would have enjoyed staying longer!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was really cute and clean! We all enjoyed all the farm animals and scenic views of the house and surrounding areas! It was a great getaway for our spring break
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank y'all for sharing your delightful farm home place! We enjoyed the calm pace as well as the beautiful views and went home refreshed and grateful. The long side porch was a favorite spot to start the day and watch the sunset as well as nap in between! Great location and water pressure!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We adored this spot. Absolutely beautiful and serene. Perfect spot for a restful and relaxing weekend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Jade was great and extremely understanding. Also responsive to my communication and the place was as described and very comfortable. Thank you very much
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was amazingly peaceful. It was such a homey and inviting experience for my family. I can‚Äôt say enough About the hospitality and friendly atmosphere. I would recommend this location 10 out of 10.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very sweet farmhouse and we are thankful to have been able to stay here.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Anyone would be lucky to stay at Bluff Springs Farm! It is so peaceful and beautiful!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jade answered the texts right away and was always helpful. The place is exactly as described and shown in the pictures and you always have a pretty view of the cows from your patio. Also nice if you are a bird lover. Lots of wild turkey, black vultures, hawks, mockingbirds, bluebirds, etc. to watch!. Bring your binoculars for a special insight into cow life!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great out of the way location. Peaceful and quiet. We visited during an infrequent cold snap/snow event and really enjoyed the location.
House is an old farmhouse that has been updated/remodeled a couple times and has great character.
Jade and her team were very responsive and quick to act when we needed a little assistance."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cute house in a beautiful spot!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wanted a peaceful weekend away from the hustle and bustle, and definitely got it! Adorable lil‚Äô farmhouse with plenty of relaxing fun in nearby towns. Would visit again just to read on the porch!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place 10/10 will book again
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the absolute best stay at Bluff Creek. Coffee in the sunroom every morning and reading on the back porch in the afternoons were hilights. As were the holiday decorations. It really made our stay special. Jade is a very responsive host (even late on Christmas Eve‚Ä¶ sorry about that! lol). We can‚Äôt wait to visit again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place I have been. The original farmhouse is so lovely. It is so clean and comfortable. It has fresh spring water coming straight out of the tap, and it is delicious! It is heated by an outdoor wood stove, and it gets hot. That stove also heats the house, but it is all taken care of and regulated by a thermostat in the house. It is such a cool setup! The water pressure is FANTASTIC!
The property is 5 minutes from town, but you are on a farm in the country. We LOVED seeing the cows out the window.
Jade and her family could not have been more accommodating and kind to me and my family. This is the ONLY place we would stay when we come to town."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Bluff Springs Farmhouse was so peaceful and relaxing.
The house was clean and decorated for Christmas, which kept our Holiday spirits lifted.
There were tasty doughnuts waiting for us on arrival and the quiet surroundings were so pleasant.
Watching the cattle receive their morning hay was a treat.
The stay was a pleasure and we will definitely return when we visit Lewisburg again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super great. 10/10. On a scale from 1 to Han Solo, I would rate this place ‚ÄúMacho-Man Randy Savage‚Äù."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jade‚Äôs place is a quaint and cozy farmhouse that is very well maintained. The Christmas decor throughout the home was a very nice touch. The scenery is beautiful, we enjoyed watching the cows every morning. We had everything we needed for our stay including fresh donuts upon arrival. The family was very friendly the few times we happened to cross paths. We would definitely visit again. Thank you for sharing your home!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A comfortable, cozy home! My kids loved watching the cows. We'll definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family stayed here while on a hunting trip! The farmhouse was absolutely beautiful, and the scenery was amazing! The home was equipped with everything we needed. The best part is that the house was decorated for Christmas in every room! We felt so at home and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we prefer more rural locations when choosing a place to stay and this one was exactly what I needed. The home is minutes to Lewisburg or Cornersville.
The interior was decorated nice and the amenities were exactly as described.
I would definitely recommend a stay at Bluff Springs."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our getaway at the Bluff Springs Farmhouse was very pleasant! The farm suroundings were very serene, very quiet; it was a true getaway. Both bedrooms and beds were comfortable and spacious. We went mid-November and the Christmas tree was up already so it added a festive touch. Appreciated how sunny it was inside the house: many places to sit and enjoy the warm rays. The home is truly cozy. My husband and his brother were able to enjoy the walk to the nearby lake. The stars at nighttime are beautiful: It's nice to really see the stars away from the city lights. There wasn't hand soap in the bathroom when we arrived but Jade's dad came by to drop it off rather quickly.
Communication w/Jade was easy and always prompt. We appreciated her providing a pack n play for my baby. The local donuts on the first day were a nice treat. We also appreciated her flexibility for check-in and check-out. We also appreciated her picking up the recycling!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is everything it is portrayed as and more! Beautiful & peaceful setting, charming home, well maintained, meticulously clean, lovely & comfortable decor/furnishings and all the small touches to make you feel welcome...including fresh dounuts! You will wish you could stay longer!! Thank you for all the care you put into your guests having a perfect experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a peaceful getaway.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family of 4 stayed at Jades farmhouse in lewisburg and it was awesome. Just far enough away from town to still be close. Everything was clean and organized. Jade even left donuts for us! We will definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, old farmhouse! Pastoral views, and very relaxing"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,This was the most idyllic vacation we have ever experienced. By observation of the wildlife and farm operations we felt very much a part of it. Jade‚Äôs family was very personable and welcoming. The placement of the farmhouse had a view of beautiful sunrises and sunsets! New Lake had great fishing and birding opportunities. We would very much love to return and would recommend this to those who want a genuine farmhouse experience! Thank you Jade and family for welcoming us into your home! We felt truly blessed.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Jade and Bluff Springs Farm were more than I could have hoped for. We needed a place to stay after our wedding that‚Äôd be private and near the venue. We happened upon this listing and it was perfect! Jade was very quick to reply and very detailed with all instructions. They even left us some cute mugs that say ‚ÄúMr.‚Äù and ‚ÄúMrs.‚Äù !!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jade's place was quiet quaint and cozy. It's was close to hiking and although off the beaten path and a large cattle property - it was minutes from conveniences like Walmart and Alex's Tacos. As a heads up, get there during the day, because it's pitch black at night, hard to find the drive to turn on to the property, and there is an edge on the left with barb wire where the car could go off. We didn't find it dangerous, just hard to navigate the first time in the dark. Parking was easy and there was room if we had a second car. Jade and her dad was available right away for small repairs. We would definitely stay their again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For Spring Break, we usually head to a beach location, or we travel up north to visit family. This year, we wanted something different. We have visited the Nashville, Franklin and Columbia areas in the past, and enjoy that area. We wanted an option to hotels this time, and discovered the Farmhouse thru AirBnB.
We had a wonderful stay for the week. A very unique choice. The house great, and you could feel the history. Spacious bedrooms and living room. The kitchen had a reading area in the corner, with windows looking out onto the cattle fields. The old-time front porch, a back deck, and a large enclosed side porch - many spots to relax!
The farm is about 100 acres. Fun to watch the cattle moving around during the day - and the young calves running and playing. Nice sunrises over the field.
We explored some of the local small towns, and did a lot of thrifting.
We all had a fun week. The hosts were great. No issues during the stay. This was a very enjoyable vacation. We will come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would!! This is the most fantastic place and family. It was so relaxing, private and beautiful, inside and out! The location is great, it‚Äôs out in the most serene countryside, but a close enough drive to the interstate to get you anywhere you want to go! We had the opportunity to meet the family while we were there, they are the most awesome, kindest and hospitable people ever! Thank you for renting this beautiful farmhouse out, it was a privilege to get to stay here! We will definitely be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, simple & comfortable. Easy to get in and out. Perfect for my needs."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôve stayed here a few times and it‚Äôs always great! Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best place we could have picked out to stay. We were in Nashville for a conference and I knew I would want somewhere peaceful to go after each day. Aaron's place was about 30 min from the conference in a quiet area and we LOVED getting to sit with the highland cows each afternoon to sort of debrief what we learned at the conference each day. Everything was perfect and we will definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay. Couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough. Aaron and his wife were hospitable, and had great communication. The room was very clean and had everything I needed."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cool airbnb! we loved seeing the cows and pigs. thank you!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful setting and a nice private space - great for my one night stay for work.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thanks again we had a blast and we will be in touch soon for another stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this stay!! My wife was all in when she saw the Cows!! They‚Äôre so friendly and we even got to feed them, Aarons Wife was very attentive and told us all about the animals on the farm and was very helpful! If we go through the area, we will be staying again for sure! The place was very clean, well kept, and they provided coffee, tea, water, and some snacks and breakfast bars!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A friend and I stayed here for a weekend and had a great time. We enjoyed meeting all the animals and had a quiet, peaceful stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Although it rained during our stay , we were able to admire the highland cows from a distance. It is very peaceful on the property. The place was clean and stocked with water & snacks."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Me and my fiance stayed there with our 3-year-old. We absolutely loved the privacy and the country atmosphere. The mini Highlands and the pigs were definitely adorable and we loved having them right outside our window. The privacy and the quiet country atmosphere was amazing and we rested so well. Aaron was very responsive and helpful. The next time we stay at Tennessee we will definitely be looking with them. I'm a huge coffee drinker so the little coffee station in the toaster oven was definitely appreciated.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was outstanding. It was clean and well stocked. The animals was an amazing bonus! The owners were super friendly and helpful!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really nice stay. Room was clean and comfortable. Hosts were politely quiet and private but accessible.
We were delighted to wake in the morning and have the cows be right up by the fence!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Aaron‚Äôs place was easy to find and was a great place to chill out after a day of sightseeing! The bed and pillows were comfortable, and the corner lounge was SUPER comfortable.
Having the bathroom downstairs ended up being ok as we just left the light on overnight. If you don‚Äôt like stairs then maybe you should think carefully about booking this.
The coffee maker and toaster oven made it reasonably easy to get a meal together! TV had all the options you need to binge watch movies and shows whilst on holidays! The barn is out in the country so having a car is important! Overall a comfortable and peaceful few days!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed for a night for a ball tournament, but they were very responsive. Worked with us on check in time. We loved the barn loft, and all of the animals. Our niece was obsessed with the highland cows which were also very friendly. We would stay again for sure."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an awesome stay, and highly recommend this place. The owners were super helpful and responsive. The Airbnb was comfortable and clean. Not only are you out in the country but Aaron and his wife have done everything they can to make this a peaceful place to stay. I left better than I came and I am looking forward to my next visit."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Aarons place was perfect for a little get away! He was super responsive and easy to communicate with. The place itself was very clean and had everything we needed. Overall a wonderful place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice stay! Aaron‚Äôs place was clean and all the necessities were available. Added bonus was cold water waiting for us! He had multiple options for coffee and even togo cups to fix one for your departure. Enjoyed our stay and I know you will if you stay!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot located away from any busy streets. Everything was as described in the posting and exceeded our expectations. We absolutely loved getting to feed the cows and seeing the pigs. Aaron was extremely responsive and was ready to answer any question we had. We loved our stay and would rent again.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here with our 2yr old son and was worth it for the farm animals alone. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice farm stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Aaron was very helpful.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Things were neat and cozy for our quick stay and it was a treat to see the cows just before we left! Things were quiet, and the accommodations don't feel too close to the home on the property. We appreciated the Coffee and tea available! It was nice to be able to brew a cup to-go on our way out!
If you're staying in cooler months I'd recommend packing house slippers or thick socks to wear when moving around on the first floor as the floor is very chilly, but the room itself was quite comfortable!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,Aaron was quick to respond and the place was so cute and perfect for a nights stay! The rug could use a wash and the floor could be mopped. The highland cows were the cutest ever! I‚Äôd stay again!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Aaron's AirBnb! In mid December, I booked a writing staycation for myself, looking for peaceful surroundings with proximity to downtown Columbia. I got that and more. Each morning, I had coffee outside and looked out at the animals on the property (later, I got to meet them, too). Gracious hosts. Would highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean comfortable and just what we needed.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed the space so much I wanted to stay longer to soak it all in. The farm animals were so nice to watch grazing in the pastures with a beautifully peaceful backdrop of the countryside. So many thoughtful touches were set up; there were lots of snacks, coffee/creamer, and bottles of water already cold in refrigerator. The bathroom was stocked with everything you might need plus special things that often aren‚Äôt thought about. The accommodations were separate from the main house so was very private and even had a fire pit with a beautiful view. I highly recommend this space to enjoy so farmland and small homestead living."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really liked this place it was cozy! Would stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the stay! The space was nice and simple, but I kind of enjoyed the mother-in-law quarters vibe to it as well. I think the family was at home during our stay, but we didnt ever pass. It was nice to know though in case of any mistakes with the lock or something. And I was confident that Aaron was a really responsive host. Definitely a nice find, would consider coming back next time I‚Äôm stayin in the area!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,would be a great place for a mom's daycation for quiet & beautiful/peaceful surroundings
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely lovely stay! Perfect spot for quiet and rest. And easy drive to dinner. Aaron was very responsive.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a comfortable space to spend the night. It‚Äôs convenient to make breakfast in the Oven toaster and thank you for the Coffee & Tea.

We wish you all the best for the future with your projects around the house!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed getting to feed the animals and the beautiful country views. It was as pictured. We didn‚Äôt realize the bathroom is down stairs just something to take note of. Very sweet family. We felt very safe.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we really liked petting the pigs. we also enjoyed the fire pit and the room itself. the scenery was beautiful and the room was amazing thank you for a nice weekend
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Aaron and Jessica were amazing hosts! Their place was really nice to stay in. They let us see and feed their cute piggies. They had a good guide in the room for what to do and where to eat. They also had a nice area outside for s‚Äômores and just chilling. They offer kayaking as well, which I wish we would‚Äôve had the time to do. Would stay there again and highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is was an EXCELLENT stay. Aaron took our extremely last minute Friday night reservation. He was flexible with check-in.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"These guys are amazing hosts! The space was very clean and private. There are little touches of home sprinkled throughout, and the coffee bar was super appreciated.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was exactly as listed. He Aaron was incredibly responsive and prompt. The place was super clean. 10/10 would recommend
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place is as described. I just have a complain about the fact that by just adjusting my stay from one day to two days, I ended up charged twice for the service fees and cleaning fees which doesn‚Äôt make sens to me. And there was a trash by the coffee machine that was not empty when we got there.
Beside these, everything was fine."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I needed a last minute spot to sleep when my air conditioner at home started acting up in this blazing TN heat. The local hotels were just as expensive as a private, more personable spot, so for me, the choice of this AirBnB was a no-brainer. Aaron was super accommodating and quickly got the loft ready for me. The toaster oven was perfect for the dinner/breakfast I picked up from Kroger on my way in‚Ä¶ and the loft was just what I had hoped for. Somewhere safe, quiet, and homey. Glad to know there are local options in emergency situations and not just while traveling for vacation."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was beautiful and spotless! Very peaceful neighborhood!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jennifer and Shaun are amazing hosts! They were quick to respond to any and all questions or concerns I had.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming back to the Cabin feels like if we were coming to our own place in the country.

We highly recommend this wonderful place."

2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"Randy's cabin is so beautiful and unique! The property is so pretty. You will fall in love with this place. It's far enough off the beaten path, but yet so close to everything you need (Walmart and restaurants are just a mile or two away) You won't regret staying here! Randy is so sweet and friendly. He is very welcoming and makes you feel right at home. If there's anything you need or if you have any questions, he's so quick to respond. Also, if your not from the area, there is a place my friends and I found that's about 20-30 minutes away where you can go tubing down a river. It's less than $10 a person for the day. It was at Henry Horton state park. They also have kayaks and canoes."

Sitting on rockers on the front porch in the morning with the view of the farm and a cup of coffee was my favorite! We didn't want to leave this bit of Tennessee heaven!

It was truely a wonderful experience on his beautiful ranch and his home is amazing. Stocked with everything you need!
I highly recommend his home to anyone who loves beauty, nature, privacy, and really nice people!
Thanks again Randy,
We will be back!
Melanie from Michigan"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything and more! I was in quick need of a place due to the hurricane evacuations in Florida. Randy was very prompt to get back with me, he met me at the cabin to get me all checked in. Me and my guest got invited out to the fire the had going just outside of the cabin, a kind gesture on his part. When I get the time I will defiantly make a return."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a relaxing stay with my parents and husband. The view from the front porch was serene and well maintained.

2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! Worth the stay - great place to relax and unwind!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to get away from the stress of everyday life. We were within 45 min drive to Nashville and 3 minutes from Lewisburg. Nestled on a horse farm, isolated in a beautiful, cozy cabin. We could walk the property and visit the boarded horses and Beany the 'mayor' miniature donkey that runs the place. Randy his son were very welcoming and left us to ourselves but a text away. Everything we needed was in the cabin, including coffee for those that need it. We found an amazing place to go horseback riding within 33 miles of this place, Natchez Trace Stables that were fantastic. We wanted a ride that would allow some trots and gallops and got a 2 hr ride, they will arrange whatever you need. That made the trip perfect. The plan here is to eventually have riders come and have that opportunity for those interested here, and we will be back the minute they get that part set up. This is a perfect place to come and I hope it will always be this affordable, you get so much for such a fair price. I'm sure this place will be booked all the time, so sign up when you can."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great cabin and the pictures don't do it justice. Very clean very friendly host. Close to everything you would need. Very secluded and private. I loved our stay.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No doubt an amazing experience. Randy met us to familiarize us with the cabin and we then enjoyed five days on his beautiful horse farm. Quaint, quiet, and safe, the cabin was just what we needed for a vacation. Randy even gave us a tour of the farm that included the farm's history and his vision for the future. Stay here if you get the chance!"

2017-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved the Cabin so much that we had to extend our stay over there; at the end of the first week we booked it up for another week. The Cabin is surrounded by woods, it is beautiful, peaceful, and quiet, and at the same time, it is about a five-minutes drive to Walmart. Randy was a very accommodating host, communicating with us very efficiently and accurately.

This is one of those great secrets you don‚Äôt want to get out but honestly, this was a perfect rental for my wife and I for a four day trip to TN. The hosts are amazing in communicating and provided the Southern Hospitality we all have heard of. The location is excellent, the house is well kept and maintained and is definitely a cottage home. The amenities the house has to offer makes you feel like you are at your own home.
We appreciate the hosts opening up this home and allowing our first visit to TN to be a great experience as my wife and I were looking forward to arriving every evening after the days of visiting other attractions. This has definitely set a standard that all of our other rentals in the future will probably not measure up to."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute and comfy space. Hosts were very responsive. Would definitely come again!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is clean and comfortable! We were able to relax and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and charming! My favorite Airbnb. Excellent hosts. You will be in a beautiful part of the state.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect quiet get away for us during the weekend of my daughter‚Äôs wedding at Goose Creek Farm. The cottage was spacious, the shower was INCREDIBLE, and we loved talking to Phineas and Ferb, the goats, as we came and went. üòä What a gem of a place!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Book this beautiful space for yourself to recharge for a night or two, it was designed with love and is as pretty as it looks in the pictures. Sharon was friendly and responsive, through the app. The shower was luxurious as were the convenient amenities provided. I loved the recommended short walk around the block to see the town‚Äôs church and historical homes. I will be back the next time I need to recharge!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The Carriage house is a perfect place. We stayed for 2 weeks and were very comfortable. A bonus features for us was the Ninja Coffee Machine. This is the first AirBnB we have stayed in that had a proper sanitary Coffee Maker. Being in Midldle TN just about everything you may any want to explore is within 1 hour in each direction. Finally, you could not ask for a better host family. We felt like family by the time we departed. Sharon is very kind and engaging as is Nathan. Their kids are very kind,polite and busy helping with the animals. Having the goats,chickens cats and a dog just made even more fun. This is a fun happy place. Definitely recommend staying here.üëçüëç"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Carraige house was by far my favorite place I have ever stayed. Plus the goats were so cute I loved it!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our first experience with an Airbnb and it was awesome! Sharon is a wonderful host! So helpful and kind. Makes you feel at home from the moment of arrival. Being greeted by Phineas and Ferb was a treat! So fun to watch their antics! Highly recommend The Carriage House for a nice peaceful get away! It was clean and inviting, beautifully decorated and just right! If ever in the area again, would love to stay again for longer!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The Carriage House is one of our favorite places we have stayed so far! It was so clean and beautifully decorated. Sharon was very sweet and helpful! We will definitely be back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at Sharon's cute carriage house. It's cozy and has everything guests need for their stay. The goats made an adorable welcoming committee. We liked having our vehicle right outside of the door, and the code on the entry door made for an easy check-in."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We found this place a charming surprise. Situated in small town Tennessee, in what is a wonderfully historic and unpretentious neighborhood, is this a little hamlet of a guest house. Tucked within the owners property, with goats and cats on hand, is a remarkably appointed guest house. everything has been taken into account in terms of amenities and thoughtful extras. Each room is beautifully decorated, and all of the furnishings are first class.
Loved it!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and comfortable. Everything you need. Right on our way off of 65.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon is a great host. She did a great job with the space. We loved the Carriage House. It was 4 ‚ÄúC‚Äôs‚Äù clean, cozy, cute and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, great for a walk or jog. We would stay hear again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,If I could leave 10 stars I would! This place is a diamond in the rough! Just a short drive to Nashville with all the accommodations! It was so accommodating in such a short notice! The best best air bnb we have ever stayed! It was quite lovely with the best shower and all the personal touches! Would 100% recommend this stay!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were looking for a quick escape to take advantage of no kids and this place ended up being great! Got to tour a winery, went to Lynville for a distillery and dinner and then just relaxed. Totally recommend it for a quick trip!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really like this place; it was super comfortable, clean and love this place!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Carriage House is fabulous! Everything was perfect. The inside is beautiful and very comfortable. We definitely would not hesitate to stay at Nathan and Sharon‚Äôs fabulous Airbnb!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet town location. Clear and prompt communication. Great bathroom, full kitchen and comfortable bed. Thinking this would a great place for a traveling healthcare worker to land if it isn‚Äôt too far out of the way."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful little place! We've stayed at a lot of Airbnbs, almost all 5-star rated, but this was probably the nicest place we've ever stayed. It is so cute, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. Bed was great, HUGE shower, fluffy towels, easy check-in, and the glass rock fireplace was on when we arrived. It's just off the interstate, so a perfect stop on our way between Louisiana and northern Indiana. The only thing to be aware of if you're not bringing your own food, is that there aren't any restaurants close by. We were trying to outrun a storm, so we stopped for take-out on the way - which worked out great. It looks exactly like the pictures and there are even a pair of goats in the yard to admire!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sharon accepted my last minute reservation request and we were there a half and hour later. Fantastic, quick communication. The place is stylish, clean, and a perfect setup! Would stay again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little guest house did not disappoint. It‚Äôs in a cute, quiet little neighborhood and was so clean it was hard to believe anyone had ever been in it before us. The two goats were very well behaved as well!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay at the Carriage House!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean space. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here for just one night in March 2022--we were looking for a place approximately halfway between central IL and Gulf Shores that wasn't too far off the interstate. We found everything to be great--the place was super clean and, most importantly, we were greeted by two goats and a cat after parking our car:-) We picked up food in Lewisburg on our way in. Fireplace is nice, an insane amount of TV channels, bathroom was huge with shampoo, etc., provided. Cute little place."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cozy place that was a perfect stop for us on our way from Columbus, OH to Orange Beach, AL. We loved seeing the goats right outside! Definitely recommend."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The carriage house was a great place for my husband and I to retreat to! It was clean and comfortable. Sharon was quick with her responses and even made it a point to check in on us during our stay. This home is located in cornersville, which is super quaint and quite but is close to major TN towns & amenities!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little quiet spot to spend the night...bathroom is very nicely done...comfy couch to watch TV from....and, you are parked right at the front door. Easy check-in and check-out. If we are in the area again and need a place to stay we are hopeful Sharon has her carriage house available."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Sharon place is definitely worth the value. To my suprise i met Phineas and Ferb! The home was spotless and of the highest quality. 100% worth it and I personally got more value out of it than i had anticipated. Bed was wonderful as well as shower btw. Couldn‚Äôt be happier üòÅ

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint, clean and charming stay in the carriage house. First night we enjoyed some Lawlers BBQ and stayed in. The next full day we spent at Henry Horton State Park, hiking and golfing. The hike was along the Duck River and very scenic meeting fishermen and other hikers along the way to the ‚ÄúWetlands area‚Äù. The golf course was a great deal and the greens were some of the nicest we‚Äôve played anywhere at any price!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sharon‚Äôs place is not big, but is very comfortable with some nice touches. Definitely off the beaten path in an old Tennessee town. A couple goats, cats and a rabbit in the yard were a pleasant surprise!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The carriage house was a perfect getaway! Such an adorable place. Great recommendations too! So cozy but close enough to a city to enjoy both worlds! Sharon was an angel and went above & beyond. We already want to go back!!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent experience!!! You will enjoy üòâ
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sharon‚Äôs place is absolutely adorable! She and her husband Nathan have seen to all the details that matter, like a comfortable bed, cozy living area and stunning bathroom. Everything was clean and inviting!
Sharon is a great host! She communicated well and even suggested a restaurant she thought we would enjoy!
The neighborhood is quiet and we got a kick out of seeing their 2 goats out in the yard."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so cute and comfy. I wish we would have stayed longer than one night. We had everything we needed. It is beautifully decorated and Sharon was super helpful and very quick to respond. We would definitely stay again, it was amazing."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Carriage House is stunningly beautiful! From the peaceful, serene atmosphere to the most amazing shower, to the tiniest details, we loved our stay so much! We are truly in love with the pet goats (Phineas and Ferb)! I love them! We enjoyed cooking a meal together and celebrating our anniversary as Mrs. Sharon decorated the entire place with lovely romantic touches! You will absolutely love the charm of this town, The Carriage House, and the most graceful hosts! Thank you!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved this Airbnb so much! I‚Äôm a travel nurse and I felt like it was my home away from home. They were very accommodating and worked with my weird schedule of working nights. They even cleared my car off when it snowed. I would definitely recommend this air bnb to anyone (:
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a location ‚Äúaway from life‚Äù but also convenient and not too far away. We found this place a few days before we confirmed we were able to go. Location and amenities were perfect for us. An hour from Franklin and close to Walmart and groceries as needed, but far enough away traffic and loud noises weren‚Äôt an issue. A comfy small kitchen and an awesome spa shower helped us to relax on vacation and take care of ourselves. Highly recommend this charming place to stay."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun and cute little place to stay
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, comfortable bed!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little getaway! It's quiet and the right distance from city life to get that faraway feeling without having to drive for hours on end. Sharon was communicative, and understanding when I showed up a little early. Also, that shower is the highlight of the space. I could live there..."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute location. Modern living. The bed is very comfortable and the shower is heavenly. The even bigger surprise was the two cute little goats we got to see during our stay, as well as the outdoor kitties. Cute country feel while still being modern and luxurious! Would definitely recommend."
