2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gary was amazing. We made our reservation day of and Gary immediately offered us an early check in. The house is a lovely little place. It is perfect for a cozy weekend getaway. The lofting is a fun addition. Everything you could want is within walking distance and Gary was more than helpful in picking the best places to go.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic space, location, and host! Will absolutely use again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay here! Everything was just as described. Can't beat the location, walking distance to everything. Gary was an amazing host. He provided recommendations of things for us to do as it was our first time in Traverse City. He even offered one of his bikes so my brother could use. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Gary is a fabulous host. He greeted me and did a walk through of his airbnb. The location is what drew me to this Airbnb. Walking a few blocks and you’re in downtown TC. Quaint and beautiful neighborhood. Pay attention to the loft and ladder set up. I wasn’t comfortable with it. I was very careful going up and coming down. It was a warm first evening and Gary walked me through cooling the loft down via the window unit air conditioning and ceiling fan. That helped! (The windows don’t even have an option to open!) Last but not least: I wish we had an extra refrigerator around here and the hosts def utilize the freezer in the unit. In my 100 plus stays that might have been a first.. like staying with family but paying for it :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gary’s place was wonderful! Beautiful and quiet setting, but within walking distance to downtown coffee, libations, and eateries. Gary himself was a wonderful - even providing a few homemade muffins. Highly recommend!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's a GORGEOUS space !!!!!! Free parking. Yummy dining. I wish we could have stayed longer.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place with great amenities and Joshua was super responsive when we had a question. The beds were very comfortable and the grounds were lovely. Super cool place with interesting history.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joshua is a wonderful host! The condo has space and light and rain sounds lovely on the roof. There is space to curl up and read, as well as enough room to be in separate spaces. The high ceilings and architecture make this home uniquely beautiful. The linens and bed are heavenly!! We enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Trattoria Stella before a concert at Interlochen, and had brunch downstairs in the morning. Joshua has photo books about the historic buildings and a folio of suggestions of things to do in the area. I love that the trees on the grounds are mapped out. This home is lovingly cared for, with great attention to details!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really fantastic spot , high ceilings and open concept really makes the place feel spacious and comfortable"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a cool spot! The perfect base to explore the area and come back to with restaurants and services at night. Bright, airy, comfortable beds and well stocked kitchen. We enjoyed it very much."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. The condo was beautiful and the super high ceilings made it seem so roomy. The bottom floor is full of shops and restaurants, and it was fun to bop around the shops and then just pop in the elevator to get back “home.” Great place in a historic building!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was easy to find, cozy and clean! Perfect spot to crash in tc for the night!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The condo was in a great complex with lots of history and charm - and walkable to great shops and restaurants! It was a fun place and great stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Clean, comfortable, spacious and had all the things needed to prepare a meal when staying in. Clear, easy instructions for checking in. The Village has wonderful shops and restaurants worth visiting. Stop at Earthen Ales for a beer, Red Spire for brunch, and Pepé Nero's for an incredible Italian dinner. Highly recommend doing one of the walking asylum tours-fascinating! Reservations for Nero's and the tour are recommended. The condo faces East and is bright and cheery first thing in the morning (important info for the non-cheery morning folks). Walkable to downtown TC. Can't wait to visit again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a nice place to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay, with lots of restaurants in walking distance. Clean and well appointed!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joshua was the most amazing host. Not only is his place amazing but he was more than willing to help me when I left my toiletry bag behind.
I plan to book his plan anytime I come back to the area. I just can’t say enough great things."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time renting an Airbnb and my expectations were exceeded beyond belief. The condo was unique, beautiful, immaculate, and extremely comfortable. Decor was creatively and beautifully appointed. My daughter and I only stayed 2 nights, but wished we had planned a week there. Condo was conveniently near to all downtown sites and areas, but still provided a quick 3 minute respite from all the bustle of a busy day. Also, the breakfast at the restaurant 3 floors below was spectacular! I am extremely finicky and my daughter was happily surprised that I had nothing but positivity about this stay! Loved, loved, loved it here!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was just wonderful. After deciding last minute we needed to stay in the area another night to explore more, we were able to book with ease and quickly. On site parking and a great location. The space itself is just gorgeous with the high ceilings and spacious rooms. We would most definitely stay again and wish we stayed longer this time."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our very first time ever trying an AirBnB, but we may just have become overnight converts! This condo was amazing! The price was very reasonable (especially considering what local hotels are charging). As rookie AirBnB'ers, Joshua's instructions were super clear. Driving instructions directed to the parking and front door of this large estate. My kids loved entering the secret code for elevator service as well as sleeping on a (very comfortable) Murphy Bed for the first time. Because of dietary needs, it was great having a full kitchen! The complex is absolutely gorgeous. The building has such rich history and we found it fun to learn all about it. The local boutique's and restaurants on the campus make this a special treasure as well. The location off the lake keeps you out of the heaviest traffic and lets you park for free which we thought was a great bonus. With a 30 minute drive you can go to other areas like Sleeping Bear Dunes, Empire, Glen Arbor, Sutton's Bay, & Leland."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at Joshua and Chad’s was perfect. A last minute reservation ended up being one of the best Airbnb stays we’ve ever had. The condo was perfect. Spotless. Comfortable. Close to everything. We would have stayed here longer if we weren’t already committed somewhere else! We loved everything about this property and condo and will stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful, brief stay at Joshua’s place! The apartment is roomy, pristine, and in a great location. Our host left clear and helpful instructions, which we appreciated. Both beds were comfy, and the Murphy bed was easy to use. It’s an easy walk to restaurants and the coffee shops in adjoining buildings. Would definitely stay again if they’ll have us!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joshua was very friendly! Gave us a great description on how to enter the building. The space was very spacious and clean. Will be staying again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Staying at the commons is always a unique experience. The history of the buildings alone is worth a visit. It's been a busy week in Traverse City - highly recommend.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, Joshua was very responsive. Very specific directions to get in building, and you need them! Quiet spot. Lights in hallway go off at 1030 and it's DARK. Just a heads up. Could not get door to lock, but really never saw a person on our floor so we were not concerned. Then it locked when we left, so all good. Joshua also allowed us early access because we needed to get ready for our event. Would definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, kind hosts, comfy beds!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and cool grounds.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very good place to stay in TC! Everything we could need is provided here.
2. Concerns -
a) the window shades are a see thru type that lets in a lot of light. We were there June 19-22, sun up 5:30 and down after 10pm. Very bright during these times.
b) we were contacted the first night regarding the people in the condo below ours that we were making excessive noise and jumping around? Nothing could be more false, unless the place is usually vacant and there are no sounds???

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of room in this condo. I really appreciate that the bedding was good quality and that not only the bed sheets smelled clean but the cover did as well. Plus on that one. The Native shampoo, conditioner, and body wash was a treat. The hallways in the condo areas are so quite. Not a sound. The only take away. which has nothing to do with the condo, was the facilities staff of this building were out clearing snow on the sidewalks with their machine at 4:30 in the morning. Since there are stores in the same building one can understand why the early hours. One could easily fall back to sleep."

Choose this place for our visit and again didn’t disappoint!"

Within the Commons, Red Spire is excellent for breakfast/brunch - highly recommend it. We had dinner at Stella one evening…thought it was average, but is a unique setting.

If you are considering a trip to TC, absolutely try to score a night or more here! Great host (easy check-in and quick to respond) and space (clean and comfortable) all while being just an elevator away from fantastic restaurants and shops... we'll definitely be back!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ryan always communicated quickly whenever we had a question. The condo was clean and exactly as pictured, and it seemed even bigger in person than we expected. Ryan provided coffee, a bottle of wine, tissues and even Dove soap in each of the bathrooms.
The one negative for us was that the bed was too hard, which made it difficult to get a good night's sleep. Otherwise, we loved everything about our stay."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, and great price!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this condo was spacious and beautiful. I was even able to extend when my trip went longer. will definitely look for Ryan's properties again

The location was great. ""Downtown"" was just a few blocks away - an easy walk or a short drive. We had two vehicles and Ryan accommodated us no problem with off-street parking. If anything, the on-line pictures did not do justice to how nice the bedrooms and bathrooms were, as well as the living area. Would not hesitate to stay here again when we are in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ryan's condo. It was spacious, comfortable and quiet, as well as beautifully furnished. While initially we had some difficulty getting the TV in the living room connected, Ryan responded right away with troubleshooting suggestions. I'd love to come back in the summer so we could open up the living room patio doors and enjoy being part of the neighborhood."

We loved it so much we’re already planning our next stay! Emily is a great host too. Super responsive and has the space set up with all sorts of amenities, including a kitchen full of equipment to prepare meals on site!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the most amazing and adorable cottage. Very private and peaceful.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this adorable cottage for my 40th bday! Emily’s place was super cute and charming and very well equipped. We felt right at home when we walked in. I’m a stickler for clean places, especially when you’re sharing someone else’s place and her cottage was spotless! Our stay was in November, but would definitely come back in the summer with the kiddo to enjoy the beautiful lake and the outdoors. Thanks for sharing your happy place!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gorgeous little cottage right on the lake! For a small group (two bedroom), this is an ideal getaway. Clean and well-decorated, your surroundings will bring you well-deserved rest & relaxation."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home and setting right on the lake. Spotlessly clean with everything we needed.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Emily, your cottage was perfect for my wife and me. The open living room/dining area were so relaxing and practical. Love the oversize windows affording the view of picturesque Lake Leelanau and the fully-equipped kitchen. The weather was not cooperative during our week there but the coziness and charm of the cottage kept us dry, warm and pleasantly distracted from the wind and rain outside. Thanks again for making your beautiful cottage available to us. We would love to return at a later date. - Rog and Marilyn Merrifield, Grand Ledge, MI"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. We loved the lake and spending time sitting outdoors enjoying the really spectacular view. Even brought our paddleboards and went paddling in the morning.
The attention to small details like a host book on the counter, cozy couch blankets, outdoor towels if you needed them etc make this place very comfortable to stay. Had everything we needed for a very comfortable 3 days by the lake."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place to stay! Very cozy with all the essentials — Emily was so kind and helpful when looking for places to eat/activities to do! The view was stunning & it was fun to use the dock to fish! We didn’t end up doing this, but bringing a kayak or paddle board would be perfect!!! That’s the only thing we’d change 😍"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for a mother-daughter getaway. Location was close to shops, music, water and great food! We knew the parking situation upfront, and it was only a short walk to the overnight garage. I fractured my ankle 2 weeks before our trip but condo was decorated very nicely and clutter free so I was able to get around just fine. Directions we received for check-in we're very clear and helpful. Thank you for sharing this great place with us."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic spot! Such an easy walk to downtown. The only reason I put 4 and not 5 stars is the parking. The only overnight parking is a block away and is $20 a night. If you stay more than a a night or two the cost really adds up.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Could not recommend this place enough! Great location, very clean and Carrie was very responsive. We will be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing weekend getaway at this place. The location couldn't have been better with so many fantastic restaurants just a stroll away.

If we find ourselves back in Traverse City, there's no doubt we'll be looking to book here again. Highly recommended!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for a weekend getaway!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo and host are great. The off-site parking, though noted, was a bit of a bummer and pricey for a longer stay."

Carrie is just wonderful. Answered every question in a timely matter.
We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place within a short walk of all that Traverse City has to offer. The home was clean, and modern, and all the furniture was extremely comfortable. Would absolutely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Condo location was great and close to everything in downtown TC. A little tricky finding where the entrance was. Wished there was a keirug rather than a brew coffee pot. A little noisy with neighbors in and out late at night, but overall an enjoyable trip and comfortable accommodations."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie’s condo is in a great location, close to downtown restaurants, shopping and walking distance to the bay. Parking was inconvenient and pricey but that’s the price you pay for a downtown location. The place was very clean and comfortable.
Coffee was excellent!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with easy check-in and good location. Clean and spotless interior. Would recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our time here! So accessible to EVERYTHING, cute condo and a comfy bed! Will definitely book again :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and clean apartment. The description is accurate. Just need a few beach amenities to make the apartment that much more attractive.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place that is a quick walk from downtown. Beautiful place in the lovely Traverse City.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The apt was close to everything in downtown Traverse City. It looked just like the photos. If you arrive at night the hallway will be dark but lights come on immediately via sensor. We wanted to rate 4.5 stars: the bedroom is not for light sleepers; the AC unit outside the window is loud. Parking situation is not ideal (but manageable) and the wifi was not working during our stay. It is a very lovely apartment for a couple to stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within walking distance to restaurants and downtown shopping, but away from busy streets. Exceptionally clean and comfortable. Well appointed kitchen. I especially appreciated that coffee was provided, as well as shampoo / soap. Many special touches to make you feel valued and at home: Q-tips in the bathroom, air freshener, toothbrush holder, fuzzy throws for snuggling in the evening. Carrie communicated very well and timely with respect to check-in / out instructions, location, and parking. We had no trouble using the adjacent parking lot or the Harding structure for overnight. Highly recommend this space and would stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great in-town location, with a perfect mini-balcony for enjoying breeze and sunset skies. The condo is very clean and well organized."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect place for a quick Traverse City trip! Plenty of shopping and food options within a short walk as is the beachfront! There are no elevators so be prepared to carry your luggage up a couple flights of stairs. Worth the climb though 😊
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Carrie was very helpful and responsive.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My wife and infant son enjoyed our time at Carrie’s place. It was extremely easy to find and parking was close by. Everything was walkable and the restaurants and coffee shops were awesome.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time visiting Traverse City. We didn't know the area, so based on maps, we chose Carrie's Modern Condo. It was exactly as pictured in the review. It did require being able to climb two flights of steps (FYI), which wasn't a problem. There was paid parking behind the building. The condo was super clean and had a full kitchen and one bedroom. We liked the big windows which allowed us to see the weather and some of the action outside. There was a huge TV inside and a smaller one in the bedroom. Washer and dryer with laundry soap in hall closet. We liked how walkable the location was. We were literally a block away from the main strip. There is a walking/bike path not far from the condo. We also found various places to kayak. We hope to stay in this awesome condo again. Thank you Carrie!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nicer than the photos looked, and was no more than a 10-20 minute walk from anything in downtown traverse city. Highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place great host!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Carrie’s place. It is very well located right in the middle of the downtown area. Restaurants, bars, shopping and beaches are all within walking distance. The unit is clean, comfortable and quiet. It has all of the amenities for a weekend or week long stay. The Wi-Fi worked well and the television was set up for both cable and internet broadcasts (a rarity these days). Overall, a great weekend."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, walkable to all of TC. Neat and clean. Owner communicated sign in, sign out, and any other procedures well throughout the stay and reiterated that they were available for contact should we have any questions."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and comfortable place with a good location.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time in Traverse City driving around M22 seeing the fall colors.

We would definitely stay again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I truly recommend staying here! The location of the apartment, communication with Carrie, ease of check-in/out as well as the comfortability of the place made our time in Traverse City so memorable! Thank you, Carrie!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Agree with all of the good reviews. Found out a workaround with parking. Overnight behind the building was free after 6pm until 8am next morning (may be seasonal rules). Set a reminder to go out and pay for x amount of hours starting at 8am. worked perfectly. pros: location, cleanliness, value, NEW."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location! Extremely clean and comfortable. Communication was a breeze. Walking distance to downtown with hourly parking directly behind the building and overnight parking was super close. Will stay again when I’m in the area. Highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"location is perfect, in downtown.
Place was like New. Quiet nights sleep.
Perfect!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was SO CLOSE to everything downtown. It was clean, cute, modern and cozy. Perfect for a girls trip (3 of us). The only downside was paying extra to park in the parking garage (super close!) which was 20 bucks a night, as the lot right behind the condo does not allow parking overnight. If you can overlook this, this condo is perfect for a TC stay. Walking distance to literally everything including the beautiful bay. The host was also super communicative and quick with responses! Will stay again for sure. 10/10!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location of this condo, which is right downtown and in walking distance of most of our favorite breweries. The living area is relatively large and was comfortable for the four people in our party. The nearby parking garage is pretty pricy (we paid $46 for a weekend), but you can probably find a cheaper one if you're willing to walk a bit further. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment was perfect! It was right in downtown and walkable to shops, restaurants, and the beach. It was clean and check in was a breeze. We only stayed a night but it had all the essentials for a longer stay, too. Would stay again next time we’re in town!"

We hope to be back soon!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great location right downtown! It was so great to do so much downtown and come back to the room multiple times a day if we wanted. Lots to do very close by. The condo had a modern feel. The bed and pull out couch were both super comfortable. Kitchen had everything you needed, but no spices including salt and pepper, heads up! We had a little trouble with door codes/building codes but the host was very good about helping with prompt communication. Thanks for our stay!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location and pod for a few nights. One thing to note, the walls are thin as paper and you will hear everything in the units that are attached. With that said, nothing was bothersome and the location is perfect. Just a couple of minutes walk to everything downtown and if you’re into craft beer and cider, this is your place. Overall, great stay and a very cool little town."

I slept on the pull-out sofa bed and it was very comfy!
You do have to pay for parking so factor that into your costs (I think we paid $26 to park from 7pm to 11am the next day at the Hardy parking garage).
Given the location and how nice and comfy the condo was, I would definitely stay here again!"

For 180$ for one night you’d think that the place would at least have lightbulbs included in the lighting fixtures.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Paper thin walls that you could hear a sneeze through. Do not stay here if you value your privacy and/or a good nights rest. Spend the money a get a hotel room instead.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"So close to downtown, love that it’s walkable to so many things. Walls are paper thin. Could hear people in all the neighboring units. One of the neighbors snored and kept me awake most of the night."

This was my second time booking something from Riley and I look forward to more stays in the future."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location and great price!

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place. Really easy getting in and out of the apartment. Parking was great. Pretty expensive for the small space. Not great climate control inside. Cute, clean room but not somewhere to hang out, just a place to sleep."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, location, communication…highly suggested!!"
2022-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was very nice in terms of convenience, location, and cleanliness.
The host is professional and responsive, even late at night.
However, be sure to consider the strong lingering odor from years of smoking in this older building if you are sensitive to this type of smell. We had to leave the window open in order to neutralize this smell and tolerate being in the room.
The room itself is quite small as well as the bathroom. This is important to note if you have a lot of luggage/toiletry storage, it is suitable for up to 2 people. It is about half the size of typical hotel rooms.
As many have stated. The walls are very thin, but as long as guests in other rooms are aware and respectful of this, it should be manageable. We were fortunate to not have anyone loud and rowdy staying during the time we were."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint room in a great location
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We will absolutely stay here again. The unit was very clean. The location can’t be beat, we walked all over downtown and to the beach as well!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Room is best suited for at most two people, but is in a great location. It is a great room for a weekend getaway and for those who prefer to be out and about enjoying the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little place is perfect for a quick stay in Traverse City. Close to everything on Front street, even closer getting to the Boardwalk for fishing or running. Riley answered all my questions quickly as well.
My only gripe was the noise level. The doors all slam pretty fast/hard and the floor projects from other tenants ‘stomping’ their feet. It made sleeping a bit of a chore."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The is Airbnb can’t be beat! Location is everything. It’s right in downtown traverse city. We just walked to downtown and it was perfect! Not only was it clean, but also updated as well! Would definitely stay again!"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was perfect. You can discover downtown Traverse City with ease without the use of your car.
The room is small, but it's the perfect size if your goal is just to have a comfortable place to sleep.
It is bit noisy (not so much the city sounds themselves), but due to the lack of soundproofing between rooms and hallway."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a centrally located Airbnb to serve as your home base as you explore Traverse City & Sleeping Bear Dunes, this is perfect. Everything is walkable, especially the food trucks! Super convenient and well decorated. The unit is small, but it has everything you need, and you’ll probably be spending all your time outside anyways! And you can’t beat the location!
Thanks again - we will be back!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren's place was nice and as advertised. My wife is very sensitive to smells and had a difficult time dealing with the smoke and dog smells. Occasionally, I smelled the smoke faintly, as if the owner was a previous smoker or the house was occupied by a previous smoker, but my wife said it seemed quite strong to her. The dog smell seemed to be emanating from the couch, because we did not smell it elsewhere. Otherwise, the space was clean and inviting."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, affordable rental in a peaceful neighborhood. Short drive to all TC has to offer. Will definitely stay again when in the area."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Shabby Chic apartment was amazing! Everything was exactly as the host (Lauren) described it. It’s close to Traverse City, Elk Rapids, and a lot of other cute towns. But, it’s away from the maddening crowds of town - quiet, peaceful, close to beautiful views of the Bay. Lauren is a genuinely nice person who cares about her guests. We’ll definitely be back!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay! The place was so beautiful, cozy, and very clean. We felt at home from the moment we arrived. We hope to stay here again when we return to Traverse. It is one of our favorite places to visit :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb did not disappoint a single bit. When I’m away from home, I typically have trouble getting a quality night sleep. This was not an issue here whatsoever. The apartment was very clean and so cozy. Small gestures like leaving candy in a dish or a few water bottles in the fridge for guests goes a long way. Not to mention, the location is perfect. When I return to TC next, I hope to be able to stay here again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful clean and cute place to stay! We were given plenty of local recommendations that were very helpful. We definitely recommend staying here!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place. Everything was clean and just perfect. With the exception of the shower, did not have a handle and was hard to regulate, hot and cold, and the television reception was not the greatest. Movies would freeze and not come back on. These were minor and if returning, I would still stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As advertised and very clean. Lauren was communicative and her place is peaceful and in a very nice neighborhood. Would stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived, we were enchanted by this incredible property's breathtaking beauty and warmth.
First and foremost, the location was absolutely perfect. Tucked away in a serene and idyllic setting, the property offered a private oasis where we could unwind and reconnect with nature. The panoramic views of the surrounding landscape were awe-inspiring. It felt like stepping into a postcard.
What truly set this AirBnB apart, though, was the genuine warmth and hospitality of the hosts. From the moment, we booked, they were incredibly responsive, offering valuable suggestions and ensuring that every aspect of our stay was well taken care of. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, providing us with a warm greeting upon arrival and taking the time to show us around the property. Their knowledge of the local area was invaluable, as they shared insider tips on the best restaurants, hidden gems, and must-visit attractions nearby.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is about as close to perfect as you can get. Great communication, easy check-in, everything was right where Lauren said it would be. The apartment was immaculate, absolutely spotless. The kitchen had everything you need to cook all of your meals, right down to cooking oil and condiments. The place was filled with so many lovely extra touches -- fresh fruit and wine in the kitchen, a selection of travel guides in the living room, different soaps and shampoos in the bathroom, and a selection of books and an extra fan in the bedroom. Location was great. A quick drive to downtown, but far enough away to be super quiet at night. We wanted a place that would make it easy to explore the area, and this was it. Would definitely recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was great! The listing of the property was accurate and everything was very clean. Check in was easy, too! And the waters/wine was a nice surprise in the fridge upon arrival. It was in a good location with a quick drive to anything you wanted to see in the TC area while being in a quiet neighborhood. Despite this being in the basement of the owners' home (separate entrance) it wasn't noticeable at all! Plenty of privacy. I will also say that the bed was probably the comfiest I have ever slept in! Thank you to the hosts for a great stay!"

And it was really nice to have our own outdoor patio!"

Lauren was so easy to communicate with! Totally recommend this place!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect 5 stars across the board. The place is clean and looks like it should be on the cover of Home and Garden's Magazine. Lauren provided some good recommendations for wine and beer and it only added to an amazing weekend. She is quick to respond if you have questions, it's quiet and peaceful. Hard to decide on whether I wanted to stay in relax or explore. We will definitely be coming back."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our first Airbnb experience and I must say Lauren set the bar very high! She was a wonderful host and we couldn’t be happier with our stay. The apartment was so cute and clean and perfectly decorated I told my husband we were moving in! She had great recommendations for local spots which was perfect for our first time in Traverse City. The location was ideal as we were close to downtown and the Vasa Trail (we brought our mountain bikes) but was tucked away in a safe and quiet neighborhood. I would say she far exceeded our expectations and we would absolutely recommend her for your stay! Would give 10 stars if possible :)
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful, clean, very nicely decorated apartment in a safe neighborhood not too far from downtown Traverse City. The private entrance made us feel we were not imposing or disruptive to our hosts. The hosts were welcoming and helped us find a good restaurant ""off the beaten path"". We would definitely stay there again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The fire place out on the back deck is a great addition. We brought our dog with us and Lauren even left a waterdish out for him.

It is in a very nice neighborhood with your own entrance, parking space and deck area. The apartment is spotless and my husband said best towels we have ever had at an air b n b. Lauren gave us some great recommendations for things to do and restaurants in the area. There is a firepit so we even had a fire and enjoyed relaxing and looking at the woods located behind the house. We had a very enjoyable stay. Thanks for everything!! Paul, Sharon and Winston"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location- walking distance to downtown and barely a block away from our favorite breakfast spot and bars. Bed was super comfy!

We will definitely stay here again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Me and my girlfriend had a wonder time and would go back again. The location was a perfect place to walk to local restaurants and shops.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay and Dave was very responsive to any questions we had. The condo is a walkable distance to the downtown area and we loved the recommendations to restaurants and things to do Dave had during our stay. It is good to note that the parking situation is on a first come basis. Parking wasn't difficult to find as there is also a parking garage next to the condo that charges $20 a night, but it is something to be aware of for your stay. Otherwise, we had a great experience and we'd come back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Davies’s place is as advertised and very clean. We would stay there again when visiting Traverse!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot with lots to walk to, also the only Airbnb I've stayed at where the checkout policy was simply to lock the door. Refreshing change of pace from the typical half-hour long chore-list at other stays. Would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Condo is situated in Downtown Traverse City, almost new, Fantastically Designed and Appointed. Very Clean. You could not ask for more. It had everything. Very clean with a bottle of Sparkling Wine waiting for us.
From enjoying the restraurants a few blocks away, to having a nitecap accross the street. Shopping for ourselves, and enjoying the offerings of the downtown area, while listening to the waters of the Boardmen River and the gathering of birds that enjoy the waters.
Traveling to the Pennisula and other areas was close at hand and always enjoyable, but the best part was coming back to the condo with a Kitchen to fix a few morsels that we picked up on the way back.
Dave and his Staff are fantastic, we did not have to reach out to him, as we had clear instructions and great ideas that were left for us to explore.
We will be back, maybe for a Fall Color trip!
Robert and Debbie, Spring Lake Michigan...."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave’s place was awesome- super clean, easy to access, great location! We unfortunately had to cut our trip short due to unexpected circumstances, and I wished we could have stayed. A great place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were so many great things about Dave’s place that I hope I can remember them all! First of all, the location was great. Just across the river from the main part of downtown, but also with several bars and restaurants right by the condo. We walked everywhere and could be at the waterfront in less than 15 minutes. The inside of the condo was beautiful and they thought of everything- outlets everywhere, chargers, lots of dish ware and several small appliances (loved the hot water pot for tea!), fluffy towels and sheets, clean, beautiful bathroom, comfy beds, and even chairs and beach towels in the closet. We will definitely look to stay here again when we return to Traverse City!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have no complaints about my stay. The place and the location were perfect. And Dave was prompt in communicating with me. Looking forward to returning!

Dave is a great host and makes everything easy.
The location is wonderful because it’s walking distance to restaurants and yet it’s a quiet location. We are planning to come back again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, super clean and great location!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was fine. Host did mention that parking was on a first come first serve basis as there are not enough spaces for all of the units. While Dave did mention that there was a parking garage next to the units the parking garage is very expensive.
Host did not respond to text message question regarding WIFI PW not being correct. We used the phone number that was on the listing to text him but got no answer.
Unit very clean and nice. Close to downtown."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, great location"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect! It will be a definite go to place when I travel back to Traverse City.
The host had detailed instructions for checking in. There was a well detailed list of everything to do nearby.
The host even left a gift for me when I arrived.
I highly recommend this location or any other locations the host owns."

Parking was also super easy, and I didn’t have to worry about moving my car once during my entire stay. Highly recommend, would definitely come back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, we had a great experience. Dave was friendly and super responsive. The apartment was beautiful with a very comfortable layout and bed. It was convenient and clean.
There are a few things we wish we knew before going. This is on the top floor of an apartment (three flights up) with no elevator. If you're staying for a while and need to bring things up, it is hard to do that due to the narrow hallways and the annoyance of carrying heavy luggage. The parking situation was also frustrating. There are limited spots out back, so we were having to pay $20 a night to park in the garage next door.
Last, if you care about privacy this isn't the place for you. The big bay windows in the apartment all face each other so you look right into each other's places. We sat with the blinds closed most of the time.
I would highly recommend this place again- just a few things to consider depending on your trip. Dave was great- and the place was well maintained."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was right next to downtown and walkable to it all. And it was clean and tidy and I would stay here again.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was worth every penny! It’s a super cute space that Dave clearly takes pride in making sure each guest feels right at home. The location is only a short walk to Front Street and with the great weather, we thoroughly enjoyed a stroll to grab coffee each morning. This spot has everything you could possibly need & then some - including an extremely detailed list of restaurants, wineries, shopping, etc.
Thank you for a great stay, we will be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An amazing place from top to bottom. We stayed overnight and wished we could have stayed longer. The area was so walkable and we had the most fun exploring and then getting to come back to such a lovely condo. Check in was seamless and the hosts were easy to reach and provided us with literally everything we could have needed for our stay. Thank you so much for your hospitality, Dave. We can’t wait to visit again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this beautiful condo! Clean, great location and the condo had everything we could need for our weekend stay. Parking and checkin/checkout were a breeze. We hope to come back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a gem. It is walkable to so many restaurants, breweries, and attractions. The parking is close and convenient. It was super clean and there were lots of little touches that really made the place special. The kitchen had everything that we needed, the bathroom had shampoo and soap and the chargers next to the bed were so thoughtful. The bed is super comfortable and the pillows are some of the best I've slept on. I meant to write down the name of the pillows so I could get some for home...lol
Book this place, you won't regret it."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay for a weekend getaway. Great location!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave’s condo is exactly as described and depicted. All of the previous reviewers were spot on with their commentary. The location is ideal and quite convenient (made easier with the parking permit!), the space is immaculately clean, and Dave’s communication is prompt, friendly, and thorough. We even enjoyed a performance at the local Old Town Playhouse across the street. Thank you for the Midwestern hospitality! We would love to stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the rental unit! Modern, beautiful decor and well equipped. Location to downtown is ideal. Great communication with host. Would highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used Dave’s condo as our home base to explore around the Leelanau peninsula/M22 area. The location was so convenient to Front Street and we liked being able to walk around town instead of having to drive and find parking.
The condo had everything we needed and the bed was so comfortable that we actually slept well.
We parked in the parking structure next door and were able to take advantage of the free ChargePoint EV charging, which was a real perk.
The only thing we slightly regretted was having no elevator after hiking the sand dunes one day and our legs being so sore lol.
Check-in instructions were well detailed and we had no issues during our stay.
Our weekend stay at Dave’s condo was terrific and we would definitely stay here again if we’re back in the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maybe the cleanest, nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Very clean, modern condo within a few blocks of Front Street in downtown Traverse City. I was able to snag a deal due to last minute travel, but I’d say the full price is worth it."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous condo situated right near downtown TC. Dave even had bubbles on ice waiting for us when we arrived- what a treat! Don’t think twice about reserving a spot here, if you can- our stay was nothing short of fantastic."

The place was very clean, modern, and had everything we could have possibly needed. The parking lot behind the building was very convenient and we really appreciated the parking pass for when the lot was full. Dave left a bottle of wine for us in the fridge and had a long list of recommendations in the area. Dave was a wonderful host and I would highly recommend his place if you’re staying in the area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful unit with a great location. We felt very safe. You could walk to where all the action was on front street. After coming back to the unit there was even a bottle of bubbly in the fridge to toast to a great get away.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Clean and minimalist decor. Would recommend with the exception of having to hike your stuff up five flights of stairs. Great location though.

Parking can be tricky in the condos lot, but thankfully this one came with a parking pass for the garage next store which is only a few extra steps away.
Also The Benedict is a great spot for breakfast/brunch and a block away from the condo!
Highly recommend Dave’s condo for your stay in the TC area!"

A perfect location to walk to everything in downtown TC, plus parking (either in the lot or adjoining garage if the lot’s full.) The only slight downsides to be aware of are that it is a third-floor walk up with no elevator (not a problem for us but good to be aware of if it’s an issue), and that it’s a little tricky to get around downtown for the next few months with the Cass St and 8th St bridges are both shut down to car and pedestrian traffic.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This condo is wonderful! We walked to dinner each night since everything is a 10 or 15 minute walk away. So nice being right in town and on the edge of a beautiful neighborhood to stroll through.
There were lots of extras in the condo, we stay in 6-8 places a year and have never seen a condo so well stocked. Coffee and a bottle of wine are waiting for you, plus a generous supply of clean towels, laundry soap and best of all...aluminum foil and plastic wrap to use for food/leftover storage😊

Dave is also very responsive and is clearly committed to being a terrific host. 10/10 would recommend!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The rental looked even better than the pictures showed. The most important thing to me when staying in a VRBO is that it is very clean. This one was exceptionally clean. Bathrooms and kitchen were spotless. Beds were very comfortable. The only thing that could have been cleaner was the patio. Lots of spider webs. We just used the furniture on the beach instead. But I do feel like that’s harder to keep up with and it wouldn’t keep me from staying again. We really enjoyed walking right out to beach. Overall, great stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great, exactly like the pictures, just as expected, gorgeous and an excellent vacation spot."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the 2nd year we stayed here. Everything was as clean and cozy as last year. There is some road construction that made for some traffic at rush hour, but that is supposed to be finished in November. The view from the condo is great, right by the water. It's a great place to relax. A couple of day trips took us to see lighthouses and sand dunes. The condo is very clean and well decorated. Three bedrooms and 3 bathrooms were perfect. I definitely recommend it."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly what we needed for our stay!
Larger even than it looks in the photos, which was a nice bonus. The building is quiet with a lovely view. Would absolutely stay here again."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, always try and book when we come to the area for work."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"If you're looking for a place in Traverse City to make forever memories with loved ones, this is it! Definately not the cheapest Airbnb in Traverse City, but worth every penny. This place is absolutely worth splurging on. Right on Sugar Beach with breath-taking views. You cannot go wrong with this rental."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The view is indescribable - gorgeous! Very nice space with all the amenities you could need. Everything you could want to do is right nearby.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was beautiful and spacious, upscale with everything we needed to relax and to entertain. We loved being just steps from the water. The view was gorgeous! Katy is very responsive and a great communicator. We would definitely stay there again. :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We have stayed at the condo 2 times now and are already booking for next year, Katy is a great host and love the accommodations!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful condo, with the beach literally right outside the back door. The space was amazing and had everything our group needed to feel at home for a long weekend - fully-equipped kitchen, comfortable bedrooms, plenty of towels and blankets, and lots of amazing ""extras"" that show a lot of thought and care has been put into this home. Katy was also an excellent host - very communicative with extremely quick responses. We're definitely planning to book again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very comfortable space with great amenities and proximity to Traverse City. This was a wonderful landing spot while attending a conference nearby! If anything we wish had had more downtime to enjoy Katy's rental.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Just finished a long weekend at the villa and absolutely had a great time. Katy was an outstanding host! Very responsive and accommodating. The Sugar Beach Villa was very comfortable for our group of 6 (3 couples). Clean, lots of amenities, comfortable beds, and beautiful views of the bay. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katy was very responsive and helpful. The condo unit was beautiful and super clean. It literally is on top of the private beach on East Bay.
Oh ya, the heated floors in the bathrooms and kitchen are great on a chilly morning.
We can’t wait to return with more family members. It is perfect for our young family."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pictures do not do this place justice! Very pretty and welcoming! Beautiful private beach! Marisa was sweet and caring!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,They were incredibly accommodating with our stay. Great communication when we mistook Sugar Beach resorts with sugar beach villas (I suggest you don’t make the same mistake or you may face the sarcastic wrath of your partner). Quick response rate. Beautiful private beach and lovely home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Steps out the back door is a nice sandy beach and beautiful lake. Jet ski and boat rentals are next door and so are bike rentals (we did it all). The condo is very nice, clean and comfortable. The beds were comfy, the darkening shades were a bonus. Big bathrooms with plenty of plush towels. The open concept kitchen and living area are great for family time. The condo living was great for our family of 4, we felt very comfortable. The location to Downtown TC is a bit farther out then I was expecting (had hoped to bike and walk more into town, it’s way too far for a walk, the bike was a good 30+ min, be sure to use the awesome bike trail behind Einsteins bike rental, the kids and I enjoyed the 6+ mile bike ride there and back as long as you use the trail). The farm club was a new restaurant experience worth a visit, and the wineries on old mission are easy to access from the home so that’s a plus too. The jet skis were a big highlight. A+ rental. Katy is a great host very responsive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The condo is a perfect place for a family reunion, especially one with small children or grandchildren. The beach is beautiful and the water is shallow enough for young children."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent! Thanks!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katy is an excellent host. Definitely a 5 star. There were a couple of issues during our stay. She responded quickly and everything was taken care of in a timely manner. The condo was beautiful and in a lovely area. Would definitely look for a rental from Katy again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katy’s place was unbelievable. The inside exceeded my expectations and more. The instructions were perfect and we all felt right at home. Highly highly recommend.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was beautiful! The kitchen was fully stocked!! Very impressive, the heated floors were amazing and felt great! Lots of room, decor was so beautiful and felt at home, beds were comfortable and the views spectacular!! We only wish it was warmer to sit on the deck. Thank you, Katy for everything, you're a great Host! Definitely would book again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The only thing that was a little complicated to understand was how to turn on the tv. Other than that it was a beautiful place, & we really enjoyed our stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay, beautiful setting, hospitable hostess. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Where do I start! The villa was exactly like in the photos; spacious and well-furnished. View was amazing. The villa is MORE than well-equipped with everything a family would need - from cooking, baking, entertaining (wine chiller too!), board games and cable TV. There were plenty of towels, beach towels, pillow, throws, etc. Katy was a great host, incredibly responsive at all hours of the day & night. I can only imagine that this villa would be fully-booked at peak season and deservedly so. Definitely a 5-star recommendation based on location, accessibility, amenities, comfort, cleanliness AND responsiveness of host."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our first time stay here in this beautiful waterfront condo! The view was unmatched and there were plenty of local things to do. We enjoyed the sunset and sunrise everyday and all of the amenities that were included. This Airbnb had everything you could think of in the home from the kitchen appliances to the plate ware and cookware! Not to mention the heated floors (which was a pleasantly unexpected amenity) Katy was the perfect host and was very responsive and super informative, which we appreciated! Only negative was that the deck was not assembled and beach chairs were not present as pictured when we stayed and blocked what would’ve been a full 360 view. I’m guessing it’s because we went while it was still relatively cold. (Beginning of April) Nonetheless we worked around it and had an amazing time! We will definitely be returning as soon as we can!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katys place was a wonderful home away from home. We had access to a private beach and the airbnb was perfect for our family getaway. Everything provided here was well thought out and intentional from the decorations, to how cozy the bedrooms were, to the fully stocked kitchen and game closet. We just happened to be here at the right time and got to experience the beautiful Northern Lights displayed over the East Bay. We highly recommend this property or any property that Katy maintains as we are sure all her properties are held to the same standard. We hope to be back soon!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are two couples that have been doing a winter weekend getaway for well over a dozen years. We have stayed a lot of places over the years. This was the perfect Cinderella fit for us. A nice spacious common space, and well spaced sleeping quarters each with their own bathroom."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent the majority of a week at the condo and had an amazing time discovering new places to eat and drink. Even though it was winter, the view is amazing. Comfortable furnitures and beds, heated tile in the bathrooms and kitchen was a nice luxury with the cold temps outside. We would absolutely stay there again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a gorgeous home with every amenity you could think of. Katy has done all the work to ensure that you can settle in and enjoy your stay.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful condo with a stunning view of the bay!

2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"An incredible place, Katy is an awesome host! Have stayed in many rentals, this is one of the best! Looking forward to our next stay as well as looking at some of Katie’s other properties."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Katy is amazing! It was beautiful and peaceful and communication with host was quick responses, super nice and helpful! Would love to stay here again but for a longer period of time, we didn't want to leave!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Katy was such an amazing host! We had to change our weekends last minute due to a family death and she was SO accommodating. Katy was so flexible and kind. The Airbnb itself was absolutely beautiful. We plan to stay there again in the summer! Thank you Katy for everything!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was AMAZING!!! BETTER THAN THE PICTURES!!! We came and stayed here for my fiance's 30 th birthday and had an amazing time being on the water in this wonderful place. Plenty of towels, kitchen items, games, shampoo, conditioner, soap, and more! It was very peaceful, and the location was really convenient! I would recommend this place. 👍"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Katy was an excellent host. She checked on us every day to see if we needed anything. The condo was beautiful and comfortable. We had a very enjoyable and relaxing weekend thanks to Katy!

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful stay!! The beds were absolutely amazing, almost didn’t want to get out of bed because of how comfortable they were. Very quiet relaxing weekend with not many people around. Had a little trouble checking in but everything was truly amazing!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Beautiful space inside and out. Only down side is that the residents within are not happy about having Airbnb within their building and are watching constant so they can report anything they see/think you should not be doing. Not a friendly and welcoming bunch…
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect cozy cabin for a weekend getaway for 2 people! The view of the lake is gorgeous from the deck or firepit at all times of the day. Communication with the host was quick, considerate and professional when needed. Only about a 25 min drive to the Sleeping Bear Dunes, wineries/wine tastings and 10 minutes to downtown Traverse City."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for a long trip or a quick weekend away. Everything is exactly as described. Would definitely come back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a cozy little cabin- with a great view of the lake - Riley is an excellent responsive host. The cabin is well equipped and comfortable. It is convenient to Traverse City - yet gives you the feeling of being on vacation-a great place to relax.

Great Apartment!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay during our visit to Traverse City. It’s very close to the downtown area and near a lot of beaches. The kitchen was a great amenity to have when we wanted to cook a couple meals instead of going out. There was plenty of utensils, plates, pots, and pans to use. Riley was quick to respond to any questions I had and gave clear instructions when checking in. I will be staying here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Riley’s apartment was a perfect home base for our Traverse City adventures. It was just as advertised, clean and ready for our arrival. Adjacent to the TART Trail. Although not quite walking distance, it was a very short drive to downtown shopping and restaurants and, importantly, it was centrally located for exploration in every direction … Sleeping Bear Dunes to the west, the Leelenau Peninsula to the northwest, and Old Mission Peninsula to the northeast. Met all of our needs and expectations!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice clean place with great amenities. Wish the pull out sofa was a bit more comfortable. Street noise was a bit loud but the location is great. Right on the TART bike trail was the highlight! We were able to get everywhere by bike.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Overall very pleased with our stay. Plenty of parking by the building and it was easy to check in. Location makes it very easy to get into downtown TC. Building is located on a major road and the noise from traffic was significant.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The apartment has everything we need for a week long stay. I really liked the location - there are a few food/coffee places and grocery stores that’s ~5-10 mins walk away. The TART path is right by the apartment complex and it took us about ~20-30 mins to walk to Front street. Overall, would recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking to spend some time in Traverse City!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Layla's house was clean and appeared to be a new construction. Location was good, not too far from sleeping bear or downtown traverse city. Be aware (we didnt read carefully enough) that one bed is an airbed. Ours had a leak but Layla replaced it immediately."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house and Layla was very friendly and helpful!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"T.C. rooftop rentals was amazing during my stay here. While there was an issue with the AC unit, they were very quick to accommodate me. When I was set to check out, another unit was offered to me an additional night to offset the warm nights I had in the prior unit. I would definitely recommend this company, the communication and friendliness alone will bring me back. Additionally, the second unit they put me up in is 10/10. Beautiful, cool and very clean. Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Rooftop rentals condo was really nice. We enjoyed one of the hot tubs on the roof. The Tv in the bedroom was a nice touch. Liked the decor. Would stay there again.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was in town for the Bayshore Marathon. This property was perfect! The tub was excellent for an ice bath and the rooftop hot tubs loosened all my aches and pains. The space is so beautiful and clean! Loved the location and it was very quiet! Would highly recommend
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure staying in this condo! We found the place exactly as pictured, very clean and comfortable. The hot tubs on the roof were wonderful! There is construction going on but we never heard a thing; it was very quiet and peaceful. We appreciated their wonderful suggestions for trails etc. and visited a few during our stay. It was very thoughtful for the owners to include essentials like spices, aluminum foil and body wash for us to use during our stay. If you are looking for a place that puts you close to everything in TC, this is the place you will want to rent."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic stay! The hosts were very nice, understanding, and responsive. The place was clean and close to many beaches. The pictures posted on the app are exactly what the place looks like. I highly recommend taking a 30-minute drive to hike Pyramid Point it’s an unbelievable scenery that doesn’t feel like it should be in Michigan! Also, don’t miss soaking in the hot tubs on the rooftop."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay. The place made me feel like I was at home! I love that it was in walking distance of downtown traverse city and the fact you could walk to the beach! It was over all a welcoming place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful condo! An amazing, quiet place to stay with amazing hosts."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very good experience. The host responses are super quick, super proactive, and helpful. The apartment is located super close to restaurants and parks. They even provide a guide with activities close by. The building is on construction, but I barely could hear anything, very peaceful. The pictures are accurate, it is open and modern, with lots of windows. They also have a full kitchen with lots of equipments."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Love this place! Easy check in and check out. Hosts are the nicest and so accommodating. Highly recommend, but also don’t want to because I want this place to be a secret!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, booked at last minute and it was easy. Great location, very clean.
Great price and will stay again"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was very well designed, and clean. They made it feel like home, and thought through every detail, such as a fan in the wardrobe, spices to cook with, and laundry detergent so we didn’t have to go home with dirty laundry. Plus the body wash smells amazing!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect and really comfortable! It was really easy to get to all the places we wanted to. We really appreciated the accommodations and hospitality over the two nights we stayed. Already looking forward to coming back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best nights of sleep I’ve ever had! …and I know it must’ve been the bed since I had my fur baby with me. With that said, for a pet friendly spot that’s closer to some busy streets (one was noticeably busier because of construction), the unit was so quiet. I love the overall design of the place and all the interiors were well thought out. For a business trip, this was such a great find. Loved the rooftop hot tubs and the space was perfect for WFH. The hosts also put a lot of effort into sharing local
Gems (the welcome guide inside the apartment was a charming touch). I’d agree that the restaurants and coffee shops they recommend are fabulous and it was nice being a very short drive from some of the best! For those traveling with family (kids), it’s worth noting that the location doesn’t have park or water access. It is close, however, but there is a precarious intersection to cross to get to the bay and local parks. Regardless, I would stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place to stay! Overall satisfied with our experience!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place in Traverse City. Unit was spotless, very clean, and very comfortable. In a great safe location but a quick Uber to downtown Traverse City. Would stay here again! Thanks for a great experience!"

Everything we could possibly need was available (beach towels, charger, spices for cooking, clear instructions etc.) The rooftop hot tubs was a major plus! Perfect for our girls weekend trip getaway. Communication was immaculate! Next time I’m visiting Traverse City definitely would stay here again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the TC Rooftop condo. The place was spotless, and so cute. We loved how close it was to everything, and despite construction still going on, it was very quiet. The bed was so comfortable we are going to buy the same one for our home!
The hot tubs were a fun addition, and the bathtub in the bathroom was lovely. I bought some bath salts in town and used them in the tub for a relaxing night!
The owners provided clear and easy directions, and made sure we knew they were available if we needed anything. We were greeted in the condo with a book of their local favorite places to eat and things to do.
We will definitely be back and tell all our friends and family!"
