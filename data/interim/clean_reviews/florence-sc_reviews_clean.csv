2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"We did enjoy our stay and it would’ve been great to utilize the pool if it was warmer outside! Unfortunately we did have a very hard time sleeping because the AC/Heat unit on the wall, made a very loud noise the whole time we stayed. And no matter what setting we put it on, we could not get the noise to stop. We also had to login to our Hulu account on the TV because it was a smart tv. But not logged in to anything so we had to utilize our own account. Other than those couple of little inconveniences, we were happy with our stay. The place was clean and we would’ve slept well if the AC wasn’t making such loud noise lol they are very nice people and they’re very helpful/respectful."

We would definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I had asked if I could come one day later and they were ok with this. I had to actually do this on ABNB. When I arrived I went to the door, and Reeves didn’t know why I was there. His wife takes care of the guests usually. That was fine, but I couldn’t figure out how to get the TV to work with the stated programs. I let them know, but I ended up just going to bed because they had prior commitments and didn’t have time to help me. Unfortunately, I think the change in arrival date, wasn’t actually convenient for them. I loved the place though. Great bed, nice kids and sweet dogs. I would go there again- in good weather so we could enjoy the pool."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot to stay for a night! It was very clean and comfortable.

The studio has just what you need for a short stay. I liked that i could open the windows for fresh air and the tv had amazon prime offerings for relaxing.
The host is very interested in making your stay as good as possible and goes out of his way to make sure
everything is as you need it to be."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The Poolside Cottage was a perfect place for us to stay for our granddaughter's gymnastics meet. It was comfortable and accommodating for us and our 2 aging pups who can no longer stay with a sitter. Plus, it was 8 minutes from the Florence Center. Reeves and Rebecca were very helpful before and during our stay and Bella and Gracie were delightful daily visitors. If we need to visit Florence again, we will definitely return."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This sweet and darling place is away from the hustle but yet close enough to grab a bite, it was perfect for us and our long travels. Everything you could think of or needed was there. We were so tired and just wanted rest, shower and calm our minds form what was ahead. This place is just darling. I can’t help imagine how even more beautiful this place would be in the summer time. Very nice owners and their children were very friendly and polite. I am a firm believer in that things happen for a reason, so us finding this place in a quick look up was nothing short of HIS plan. Thank y’all so very much! Many blessings.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were not looking forward to staying at another semi-clean, pet friendly hotel along 95 on our way home like we had in the past. We were so excited when we found this place not far off of 95. And so happy once we got there. It was in a great neighborhood where we could walk Barkley. It was very clean and had everything that you need for an overnight stay. The bed was very comfy. There was an easy to follow check in/check out book which included local restaurant recommendations.

They were very accommodating for our last minute stay. Reeves offered to pull out the couch for us, so when we got in late the place was all ready for us to get a restful night. We appreciated that so much! We fell asleep to the sound of crickets and woke up to birds singing. We came in late and left early in the morning, but everything was really perfect and just what we needed. Getting on I-95 S in the morning was a breeze. We will surely stay again on our next trip between Virginia and Florida! Added bonus: the fenced in pool area was great for our dogs to stretch out their legs after a long car ride (us too!)"

We like staying here vs a hotel because we don't have to worry about our dog and our car and bikes were safe. The hosts were accommodating and let us park our SUV ""behind"" the gate to be extra safe. The neighborhood is upscale and looks very safe."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly and Pack’s place is a fantastic stay that I highly recommend. It is very cozy and clean with special little touches. It’s quiet, yet in the heart of Florence. There are many restaurants close by, and shopping. The place itself is very easy to find and easy to get inside. I felt safe in the neighborhood and it’s peaceful. Most importantly Kimberly was so responsive. I made this reservation literally last minute and they were more than willing to accommodate me and ask if I needed anything throughout the stay. Fantastic hosts!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is for rest and relaxation. It is a very quiet neighborhood setting where you will enjoy the sounds of nature. I loved sitting outside and watching the trees and listening to the birds. If this is the kind of place, you enjoy, then you will love this.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Outstanding amenities for a night's rest. Kim and Pack went out of their way to prepare for the weary traveler. Plenty of snacks and coffee. Great bath necessities to get the the morning started. The only improvement to suggest is the bed needs something firm underneath the mattress like plywood. It sunk to the middle and made sleeping nearly impossible. The host is crafty enough, I know they can fix the bed. Definitely will stay again if our travels go through SC."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"They were able to help me out when I needed it at last minute, very helpful much appreciated. Would stay again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From the mouth of babes...my 11 year old said 5 stars! She and my husband stayed here 3 nights for the United Methodist Conference. My daughter gave me a virtual tour as soon as they arrived. She was in awe of the unique refrigerator. She said the place was very clean and liked the snack selection.
The hosts were kind enough to refund us one night stay when my husband realized he only needed three nights and not four. They were also understanding that I was the go between for communication from them to my husband as he doesn't have an Airbnb account.
Husband and daughter said they would stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We found the apartment to be well furnished, VERY clean, and comfortable… the bed and mattress were extremely comfortable. We both slept soundly and neighborhood was quiet. The sound machine was great. We both woke up at our usual 6 am time so we made coffee and went out to bench in carport to enjoy coffee, birds singing and watching nature wake up. We never heard the rooster crowing until we were outside. Loved hearing them. Great communications thru text and written instructions. Any questions we had were quickly responded to. WE WOULD DEFINITELY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APARTMENT. Great experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place in a quiet neighborhood with a very comfortable bed and the place had everything we needed. Quaint downtown area, checked out Cru Wine and Tap and walked around the downtown area. I would stay here again, highly recommend it."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"PHENOMENAL! They have thought of everything. Snacks, coffee, sound machine, you name it. We are already planning our next stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This isn't just a clean comfortable place to stay; it has personality that shows ""above and beyond"" planning on the part of the host. We've been spoiled by some very nicely decorated places but none have had such a perfectly themed and well put together feel. The kitchen was modern where it needed to be, new glass top stove and countertops, yet the refrigerator had the theme of the house nailed. There were games, snacks, waters, cabinets with everything you'd need for a great meal. The living area had a large couch and collection of pillows for ideal comfort. Good thing because the stay that we planned ahead for, happened to be right in the middle of a semi-tropical storm. Instead of being on the go, walking and sight seeing, we spent more time than usual at home, and felt like the weather didn't interrupt our fun at all. The bathroom is spacious, spotless, and updated. Laundry area with full sized washer and dryer. Everywhere we looked, there were nice touches."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the best places we’ve stayed at on our trip. Thoroughly recommend and wish we could have stayed longer!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really cool décor, our hosts put alot of effort and thought into this place. They provided everything you would need for your stay and anything you may have forgotten. Nice 1 bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood with quick access to I-95. We stayed here for one night to break up our trip from Florida back to Delaware. Our host found we had left some items and were helpful in getting them back to us. This is above and beyond hospitality and we are grateful for the friendliness and thoughtfulness."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay. Perfect location 3 minutes from where my daughters were playing basketball.

Attention to detail including a welcome basket of snacks and bottled water was really appreciated. While traveling through the Florence area, if you book this Airbnb, you will not be disappointed."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kimberly & Pack were wonderful. You can tell they love being Superhosts. We only stayed one night. Typically, you wouldn’t expect to use an A/C in early March . They had the one on in the living room but we were unsure about adjusting it. You can tell they take pride in their home. Thank you."

Kim and Pack are super responsive and wonderful to communicate with. I highly recommend staying here."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's always a pleasure to stay at Kim and Pack's converted garage. Comfortable and cozy.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great to have our own space for Thanksgiving weekend. We were able to come and go from our son's house and have our own space which was priceless. There was no way in the world we could sleep in the tall bed or be prepared for just how tall it was. Thankfully we always travel with a suitcase of linens for a queen size bed so we slept on the pull out sofa. Late the last afternoon we decided that another night on that sofa bed was more than we could take and headed for home early. We would stay again if the bed is ever changed to one we could sleep in. They do make kits to lower those old beds. We know because we have an antique pineapple post bedroom set that it works on. We have no complaints otherwise.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in. Comfortable couch for movies and bed for a good nights sleep. Very clean! Loved the magazines and books. There was some street noise, but it quieted down after 9p. Very good value! Thank you for having us!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great private space with easy access to I95. We were on the drive back to NC and stay here. It is very clean and cozy. Both me and my wife worked remotely from this space during the day and the internet was great. The hosts are very friendly and accommodating as well. It is also close to restaurants and coffee shops. Couldn’t recommend this more if you are traveling on I95 or if you are staying in the Florence area.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,From the moment we arrived everything was great. Snacks and drinks if we wanted upon our arrival. The decor was so wonderful we felt warm and welcomed. Definitely going to stay again. Close to everything!

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This airbnb was very nice. It was very clean and the kitchen was well equipped. The bed was comfortable, however it was a bit small for two people.

I would consider staying at this airbnb in the future if I am passing through the area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will definitely be back! It’s such a cool private space, only a mile from downtown, 20-25 minute walk. Check out Lula’s for coffee and Jazz on Dargan for good tunes."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just book this place…you won’t be disappointed! We booked last minute as we were driving back to Miami from New Jersey. Such a cute town and an amazing stay. The decor, space and location was perfect and the guesthouse was immaculate, beautiful and the hosts were incredibly kind and quick to respond. Will definitely stay again when we make the drive! It’s close to the highway and near so many restaurants as well as a mall. Great place to stop off and enjoy."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very lovely, the yard and the chicken were the icing on the top. The pictures don’t really do this lovely place justice. It was very homey !"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So cozy!!!! The price is great for all the guest house has to offer!! It feels like your own little home during the stay! Would love to go back!!!!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a comfortable overnight stay at the Boho guest house. It was clean and cozy, and communication with Kimberley and Pack was easy as was the check in and check out. Love the decor!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in Florence to watch the Flamingos play the Savannah Bananas after spending several nights in Charleston. It was wonderful to have somewhere that felt like home the moment you walked through the door. Small touches like lamps on and ready for you with a snack basket just said ""Welcome"".
The bed was soo comfortable."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Love the cabin feel of the home.! The beds were super comfortable after a long night of visiting the relatives!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the opportunity to book Collins Quarters for our in-laws to come in from North Carolina for my grand daughter’s Christening. The property was very well maintained and the hosts were very responsive. We didn’t have any issues to come up that required us to reach out during our stay, but Ashley answered all questions promptly and throughly before hand. The lighting was a bit dim in that room, but we could see that it was completely spotless! In fact, the entire home was very clean!!! So if you have someone who requires lots of quiet, that’s their room, for sure! Other than that one thing, this place is definitely worth the price and it’s being added to my favorites when we have to bring in family again!!!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Book this one! It is breathtakingly beautiful. The master bed is so comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud. The pictures don’t do the actual view justice, and the pictures are amazing themselves. It was clean, exactly as described, private, comfortable, and convenient. 10/10"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super nice stay! My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the property. Very comfortable surroundings with everything you need nearby. Host very responsive and accommodating to our every need, although we didn’t have to ask for much but when we did she responded right away. If you’re in the area don’t waste time looking for something else. This is it!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ashley and Gene’s place was clean and spacious! The decor is wonderfully eclectic and it was the right size for our party of 4. You won’t find another property like it in the area! We especially appreciated all the small touches like bottled water, snacks, coffee and creamer in the kitchen, fresh linens, and the extra blankets in the bedroom. The downstairs bed and half bath were definitely a bonus if you have a light sleeper or someone looking for their own quiet space in your party! It was perfect for our family trip, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to stay in a quiet spot close to everything you need in Florence. MUSC Hospital, Starbucks, grocery stores and restaurants are all less than a 5-minute trip away, and it’s also convenient to downtown and Francis Marion University. They had thought of everything, but with the small questions we did have, they were also very quick to respond and assist. Book this place! You won’t be disappointed."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. House was very clean and served our needs well. There were a few much appreciated amenities such as cold water in the fridge and coffee for the mornings. Ashley was super easy to work with and responsive when I had questions. Overall, the stay was excellent and we’d stay again if we are ever back in Florence."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow Wow Wow!! The perfect spot with everything we needed. Walking around to see and feed the animals was the perfect thing to do after our long drive. Also perfect for dogs, walk right out the door to as much room as a dog could need! Will be back!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very well clean and beautiful place.
Love it. Easy to get into.
Vary nice people.
Highly recommended"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was very beautiful and we enjoyed seeing the animals. The host was great to communicate with. The only issues we had we were with not being able to access the internet, even with being connected to WIFI. Also, it was a very cute place, but I would recommend it for 2 people, not 4. The bathroom and bunks are connected without locks and offer very little privacy. The bathroom door does not even seal. So, yes, GREAT for 2 people, great area, great price."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"our kids absolutely LOVED this pit stop on our way home to florida! they were charmed by all of shannon’s sweet animals, including the new baby horse! directions to the property were very clear and the cottage is well appointed. my kids are already asking when we can come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time at The Cottage, Shannon was a great host and the animals gave us a hearty welcome too. Lots of good food in Florence too, so this little oasis was a great base for exploring the area"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved staying here and seeing the animals! Also amazing that we got to feed some of them as well. Cute place and got to explore on our own at any time
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stayed at Shannon's cottage in order for my husband to get his teeth done at Sexton dental clinic in Florence SC about 13 minutes away. We had a wonderful time. Shannon was very friendly and thought of everything we would need for a perfect stay. The petting zoo was lots of fun and I enjoyed feeding the animals. I would recommend staying there anytime, especially if you have young kids. It was worth the money we paid and a lot more."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the rain, we had an incredible stay. Our pups enjoyed meeting the animals and we even had a mini donkey come right to the door and say hi. (They decided to be naughty and bust out for a Saturday night stroll 😂) I could watch the chickens run around for hours and never get bored. Great location, close to restaurants and shopping. Will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I would recommend staying here. It was the halfway point for my travels between NJ and FL. peaceful place with friendly hosts.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really fun two nights at dream Akers! And it was great that we could bring our dog. The goats and alpacas were very friendly. And we enjoyed the nice fire pit area outside. The space was really cozy, but had everything you need. Do note that if you are using the extra bunkbeds, they are only about 5 feet from the toilet, and separated only by a curtain. Shannon was an awesome and responsive host!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had another great stay at the ""farmette."" The location is private and peaceful and the neighbors (goats, horses, chickens, etc) were warm and welcoming. It's a unique and fun place that everyone would enjoy."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and easy great instructions and wonderful stay
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first experience and it was delightful. It was just as described, and what we needed for the one night stay. We wanted to make our trip back to NJ a little more than just another night in a hotel and it was just about the same for a hotel room. The experience was a bonus.
We loved that we felt safe. It was nice to have game night after being on the road all day. Keyless entry was definitely a bonus. Although we didn’t have to bother Shannon, she left her number available for us to contact her along with all the information we needed to enjoy our stay. A few things I would note is that the beds in the back are for small kids, and one of the 3 dogs barked non stop all morning lol. Having a five month old, the sound didn’t bother us, actually made it feel more like home. We hope to stay with there again on our next trip.
Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great Host. Beautiful place. Already booked my next stay!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was there only to sleep with my dogs attending a flyball tournament. I felt it was very safe and I could comfortably walk my dogs. It was a very pleasant venue and plenty of space for our needs.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This space was great! We appreciated the instructions to access the property, and that the cottage was toasty warm when we arrived. Our toddler absolutely loved the alpaca/llama theme and the bunk beds. The space was efficient and has everything you need for a short stay, but is also super cute. Our son also absolutely loved checking out all the animals in the morning. Made our overnight pitstop seem much more like a destination. While we did not use it, there is also a great fire pit spot in back. We’ll be back on our next road trip!"

We will definitely be staying again next time we are down that way!! Thanks again 😃
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay!
Beautiful, well kept farm with fabulous haPPY animals everywhere you look at this delightful Shangri-La.
Hidden out beyond the main house was the terrific, clean and cozy Airbnb cottage. Totally private with trees, a pond, stables, huge fenced in land with aninals and a large yard to walk about.
AND,
Shannon left us yummy treats to enjoy inside the cottage, including 6 FRESH eggs just laid by the sweetest hens!!
We bought an extra dozen fresh hapPY hen eggs to take home too!
Shannon was kind, extremely generous and super helpful.
I highly recommend this lovely place!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shannan's place is located in her farm with nice view and open space and a pond! This is really we were looking for a peace and relaxing time. She also provided feeds/treats for us to feed her goats and alpacas. They are so cute and friendly. It is a wonderful experience and beyond AirBnB eperience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a fun place to stop on our road trip! We arrived after dark and were worried the animals wouldn't be out, but sure enough, the goats and alpacas were ready and waiting to be fed as soon as they saw us.

I travel up and down this highway multiple times a year and without a doubt this is the best place to stop and rest. A beautiful cottage that is better than any hotel in Florence. 10 out of 10 recommend. Already booked my next visit :)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and our puppy stayed at Dream Acres farm for one night during an east coast road trip. The space was beautiful and Shannon was very kind to talk to the kids about the horses on the property. The space was warm and welcoming and we felt right at home. We would love to stay longer next time to enjoy the peaceful sanctuary. The kids LOVED feeding the goats and sheep and alpacas. Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dream Acres is exactly that - dreamy. Shannon is a marvelous host who was highly responsive. We needed to change our night early on when our plans changed and that was flexible and easy. The day of arrival we knew we would be arriving late and reached out to Shannon who was lovely about it. She left the light on and assured us that she could accommodate us. Her communication was on point and it was so much fun to wake up and see all the animals and give the goats some treats.
The location was easy to find with great signage and easy to follow step by step instructions. If we take another car trip from NY to FL we’d definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location not too far from I-95, superb hospitality with fresh farm eggs and such. Kids were so excited about farm animals feeding and running around. Definitely will become our must-stay when driving by this area."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at Dream Acres. After a long day on I-95, it's the perfect place to unwind and relax. Going back and forth from Delaware to South Carolina we finally got tired of the hotel situation in Florence. I found Dream Acres last year and had to stop and stay again this year. It's quiet and private and there's nothing is better than waking up to the sound of the farm coming alive for the day. I'll take a rooster over loud hotel guests any day. It will be our regular stop from now on."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always incredible! Stay every time I’m making the drive down the coast. Got to feed the animals this time because I was more flexible on time than usual and it was so cute and fun. Recommend to everyone!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute gem. Book it you won’t regret it! Great spot when traveling 95, wayyyyy better than stopping at some raggedy hotel.
My dog and I had an amazing time and would’ve loved to stay longer if we were able. The place is exactly as pictured, so super cute and functional. The eggs are a nice treat! The bed was comfy and the shower pressure was good. Plenty of creature comforts
The highlight is obviously the farm itself. It was a tonic to interact with llama, goats, sheep, horses. The goats were especially sassy and entertaining. Cool looking chickens, some cats and the donkeys were also a delight. My dog kissed a donkey and my heart was full.
Shannon was super cool and helpful. We’d move in if she let us lol
Peaceful setting and gorgeous sunset and rise. Highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Road tripping from Ft Lauderdale to Upstate New York up the 95 with 3 dogs.

We would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is amazing. It’s the second time I’ve stayed here and will continue to on my drives to/from Florida back up north. It’s a peaceful place and a nice place to unwind after a long drive. Waking up in the morning and taking a walk around the farm with my dogs and feeding some goats and alpacas is a great way to start the day.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shannon was very friendly and made it easy to feel at home. The cottage is beautiful and peaceful, and the animals are all adorable and fun to see. Would stay here again."

It looks exactly as the pictures show, probably even better because it is the sweetest little farm all around you. Shannon and Kevin are friendly, responsive, proactive and full of information about the local area. They gave clear instructions for how to find the property and how to enjoy it (as well as what not to do which was super helpful in setting expectations for our kids). The interior is adorable and the porch was a fabulous place to end and then start our day. There are also a decent amount of food options that are extremely close, though you feel tucked away from the hustle and bustle completely at Dream Acres. Our children had a blast, we cannot wait to go back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Shannon was very nice and accommodating! Would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Shannon’s farm stay is a little oasis a little outside of Florence. It’s hard to find dog and kid friendly stays so we were so appreciative of this stay on our way back down to Florida. Our 6 and 4 year old loved feeding the animals and Shannon ( “farmer Shannon” to our son) let them follow and help her on her nightly chores which was an added bonus after a long days drive. It was an especially hot and humid day so we didn’t get the full farm experience as we couldn’t stay outside too long, but the hour or so we did get to spend was very worth it. An amazing seafood joint (Tubbs) is a short 10 minute drive away and we spent an hour or so there hiding from the heat with the kids as well. Our two small children slept well on the bottom bunk while we shared the Queen pullout sofa and had our baby in a pack and play next to us. The farm fresh eggs served as an added treat when we arrived to help keep the kids going! Thank you Shannon!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a busy weekend, and it was nice to have a beautiful and peaceful place to come back to. We were able to relax and be ready for our next day. We actually wish we would have had more time to spend at the cottage relaxing, enjoying the farm, the animals, and peaceful surroundings. We have already recommended this to others."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were so very happy with our stay! We rented both the bunk house and the RV for our family for a 3 day event we were a part of in Florence. We had the most peaceful mornings watching the sun come up with a cup of coffee as the rooster crowed, and spent quiet farm nights feeding the farm llamas, goats, and sheep and swinging on the tree swing with our 3 year old baby grand. What more could we have wanted with our family then what we had at Shannon’s slice of peace? Absolutely nothing."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful spot. We stayed on the way up north for the summer and loved it so much we booked it again on the way back. The boys loved the open space to run and swing. The eggs were delicious and Shannon was delightful!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Shannon,
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Wrapping up my summer trip as the “Aunty who can” was made so much easier with your beautiful farm.
The children were so content and happy knowing we were surrounded by beautiful animals who are cared for so well. The property was well maintained and allowed us to just bask in nature.
If you are concerned about places to eat, simply download door dash and you will have multiple options to choose from. Keep in mind, farm experiences are on the weekends, so if you want a more personal experience with the animals book during the weekend.
This farm, is full of love and I will be back with my hubby and daughters for a weekend getaway soon. Thank you so much again Shannon, you made a tired Aunty/mommy feel right at home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second time staying here and it did not disappoint. The place is clean, private, peaceful, and you have the experience of feeding the goats, sheep, and alpacas. My boys love coming for the animals and bunk beds! My in laws live nearby so the convenience of location and farm life is perfect, has become our “spot” for when we come visit!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dream Acres was lovely! I was there with a couple of my children enroute to another destination. We loved seeing the animals and everything was as described. Very quiet, peaceful and excellent communication!
Would absolutely return if we pass thru again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing! Came with my boys (5 and 8) and they LOVED it!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome place, Shannon was an awesome host!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is very charming. It's on a quaint little farm. We got in late, and Shannon had the beds set up. The bunk beds in the back are narrow but really comfortable. I'm a bigger person, and I slept great. She had a keurig with cream and farm fresh eggs in case you feel like having a snack. I felt nurtured and peaceful. Next time we're staying for a full week :)"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Horses, goats, chickens and Alpacas how fun."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location for a stop during our road trip, not far from the highway. Beautiful farm, perfect stop for the kids to enjoy! Definitely would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stop with kids! we had a place to stay and animals and a beautiful yard to keep the kids busy without leaving our spot! Shannon was friendly and shared all about her animals. She took time to engage with our kids! Would highly recommend a stay here!
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,The location of the cottage is great. Our kids loved the “farm atmosphere.” It could’ve been a little bit cleaner. But overall a good spot.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A DIAMOND IN THE RUFF!! ❤️ABSOLUTELY Fell in love with EVERYTHING about our trip!! Shannon was amazing. You could tell how much passion & love she has for the farm & animals. She's very knowledgeable about her animals & shared whatever she could. She allowed my 8-year-old to help her with chores in which he LOVED! We will definitely be back. Arrive as strangers ... leave as family!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved Dream Acres! We had such a long drive and it was the perfect peaceful spot to stop on our long road trip to Florida. The minute we arrived we felt like we could relax and rest, and visiting with the sweet animals was an absolute dream. My daughters were so excited - animal therapy is a real thing and it happens here. My youngest daughter fell in love with the farm cat ""Lil Kim"", being here definitely put wind in their sails to get through the next part of our drive. So grateful to stay somewhere as unique as this gem on our trip! We will definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We always love staying at Dream Acres. Such a beautiful and peaceful place. This is our halfway stop on our way to Florida. Easy to get to and inside. My daughters love all the animals.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would Highly recommend Shannon’s farm house. Our kids loved the animals and it’s very convenient from I95.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a last minute change in plans and the hosts were extremely accommodating to the short notice. This was more than an Airbnb night stay... it was an experience that my daughter and I will remember forever!
Waking up to the beautiful farm, feeding the animals, swinging from the tree and just walking around the property was such a great way to start the last day of our road trip."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed one night and wish we could have stayed longer. What a great peaceful little get a way.

She went above and beyond for us, and the cottage was perfect. The design of the space is impeccable and every part is the most efficient use of the space - not to mention so clean and great looking.
And, all of Shannon’s directions were very clear and detailed.
She’s put so much into extra touches to make the stay a wonderful experience.
It’s perfect!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shannon was an amazing host! Her farm cottage was a little piece of Heaven! We so enjoyed our stay! Waking up on her farm and having coffee on the porch with the beautiful animals surrounding us was peaceful and a much needed break from our busy lives. The cottage and grounds are impeccable. I could have stayed indefinitely! I will definitely be back! Thank you, Shannon ❣️"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,easy access on/off I-95. Perfect if traveling with kids that enjoy farm animals.

Our family of four fit perfectly and had everything we needed. Shannon was an amazing host, so kind and great with communication. We will definitely stay again. Dream Acres was a dream visit for us!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Agree with other reviews…this stay was great! Our girls loved the bunks, although a bit firm compared to their own beds. The highlight was definitely the animals for them, from the grey tabby cat to the baby goats, sheep, alpacas, and horses! And they appreciated the games and coloring books and crayons there, too! Place was super clean and warm (it was rainy and cool the night we stayed), with combined heater/ac wall unit which was more than sufficient. Overall, a place we really enjoyed and will be looking forward to staying again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing weekend at this Airbnb. The space was cozy, well-equipped, and provided a perfect retreat for a relaxing getaway."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Just lovely. We were traveling between MD and Fla and knew that we would get a late start day 1, so this was a perfectly timed and placed overnight break. Easy to access from I-95, but what a secluded slice of paradise. Shannon had anticipated every traveler need and addressed it. Thank-you! There isn much to choose from for dining, so you may want to grab something and bring it with you. We got take-out at the nearby chinese restaurant and it was surprisingly very good! It didnt look like much on the outside, but their vegetarian options were plentiful and done very well. I would recommend this stay to anyone. Oops - almost forgot the lovely animals, very sweet alpacas, goats and sheep - just fell in love 10X over."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was a fun place to stay with our kids. They really enjoyed the animals and the bunk beds. The cottage was very clean and comfortable, and Shannon kindly provides some fresh eggs for breakfast! Location provided easy access to 95 and plenty of places to eat and get gas too."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I always stay here. It is clean, safe, in a beautiful setting, and they’ve got lots of fun animals to hang out with. They know I have some PTSD about ticks (long story with Lyme) and they even mowed very recently which made me feel extra good. They really care❤️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shannon was a great host! The cottage is very charming and comfortable, and the animals on the property are just adorable. Shannon gave clear instructions on visiting with her menagerie of goats, sheep, chickens, alpacas and more – it was a real treat! You can tell they are totally spoiled (in all the best ways)! We are looking forward to enjoying eggs we got while there. All in all a fun one-night stay for us!"

Being able to feed the animals was an unforgettable experience at the farm and I definitely will be back in the future and recommend this place to anyone driving through South Carolina. Shannon and Kevin were amazing hosts and super kind. The farm fresh eggs in the morning was such a great bonus! Animals were super friendly, can’t wait to visit again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect little get away, a home away from home. It was just enough space for my two daughters and I. Easy check in/out instructions, not difficult to find, not far from restaurants, grocery stores, and gas stations. Can’t forget the farm animals! 😍 Very neat and clean all the way around, inside and outside. Would absolutely come again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing time at Dream Acres. The Cottage was the perfect overnight stop on our road trip. It was spacious and had everything we needed! We all loved being able to explore the farm and feed the animals, especially our 2 year old! Shannon was always very responsive, and we even got to say a quick hello as she worked around the farm. She really has thought of everything here! We only wished we were there longer! We definitely plan on making another, hopefully longer, stop in the future!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much for the lovely stay on your farm! We traveled from Pennsylvania to Florida and this was a great halfway point to stay overnight. The kids loved feeding the alpacas, sheep, and goats."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay. We loved meeting the animals and had so much fun feeding them. We loved just hanging out and relaxing on the farm. I felt like we were way out in the country but it was only a short drive off 95 to the property. In the morning it was equally easy to get back on our route. I checked out Shannon’s guide book and found the recommendation for the Eggs Up Grill- we grabbed a great “to go” breakfast from there. We would love to come back again to the farm and spend more time with the animals!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,10 out of 5 this place is absolutely amazing super clean super beautiful I stayed with my two daughters wife and dogs and we all love it
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All the animals had unique personalities. The fire pit was nice at night, and even porch lit in lights was relaxing. Shannon has done a wonderful job make this an inviting stay away from home. Both her and her husband, put a lot of work and care into this farm. Absolutely adorable cottage."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A MUST STAY! Cute little place to stay. Spotless. Super friendly hosts. They have a lot of animals to feed and see! Free roaming chickens. We got to cook fresh eggs in the apartment for breakfast. I would move in if they would let me 🤣 10/10

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect pit stop on our way home from Florida! Shannon was very helpful and responsive. The house was so cute and very clean! Loved all of the amenities but the best one by far was feeding the animals!! Our kids really enjoyed running around the farm and feeding the goats and alpacas. What could have been a plain old pit stop on our way home from vacation turned into a fun little experience for everyone. We’d stay there again in a heartbeat!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great stay and host, will definitely book again when in area!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a fun stop to break up our drive between Cape Cod, MA and Tampa, FL. My kids (2 and 4 years old) loved checking out the farm animals and feeding some of them. The cottage itself was clean, comfortable, and unique. Shannon was very friendly and helpful. It was so much more interesting to stay here than some chain hotel off I-95. Hope to return in the future!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed overnight in the cottage. Had a beautiful view of horses in the barn. My daughter loved feeding the farm animals.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for 1 night as a stopping point on our drive home. Shannon was super friendly and very accommodating to us arriving after 11 pm. The place was easy to find with her direction and felt very safe when we arrived late. The property was beautiful and our girls LOVED feeding some of the animals. We enjoyed a tree swing and walking around the area as we took our time. Perfect place to recharge for the trek home. The cottage was very peaceful. I had a brief encounter with Shannon in the morning and she was very friendly.
We would definitely stay again. Absolutely a wonderful stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I travel a lot and I can say that dream acres gave me a peaceful respite as I drove from Florida to DC! The animals are a wonderful collection of interest and joy. The cottage is safe, private, comfortable and beautiful! Thanks Shannon for a wonderful experience!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy stay!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for another great stay Shannon 🤗
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dream Acres was exactly as described! Easy to find, private, very clean, and well stocked with everything you may need and more. Staying here with our two younger boys was accommodating and fun for them, they enjoyed feeding the animals. (Bunk beds were a huge hit!)
Definitely would recommend for those looking for a private place to stay with a farm experience!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Great people. Awesome stop on way to Florida from Philly! Thanks Shannon!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful and quiet place to stay just off the highway. Loved getting to see all the animals. Shannon was very helpful and responsive. Would definitely consider staying again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay! Thanks Shannon😁
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Shannon , the property, the beautiful animals and accommodations..,.Outstanding!!!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy clean and comfortable stay. Farm animals were very cool to see and were as interested in us as we were in them.
Very quite and peaceful.
Would most certainly recommend to family and friends.
Would stay again for sure."
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"Shannon was kind enough to allow our pets to stay with us in the booking so we truly appreciate that. The place itself looked just like in the pictures.
We did have some trouble locating the cottage entry. We called the host's phone # at least 3 times but seeing that there was no response and that the message from the host we received earlier that day indicated check-in ended at 11:00 pm we need it to find the cottage quickly. When we booked this place nor the next day after our check-in was this displayed on the listing. We were very nervous to miss the check-in time reason why by mistake we entered the neighbor's property. Terrible mistake as we were approached with firearms. We apologized and exit out their property. The host provides pictures but that's on the ""how to get in"" instructions which typically are for instructions on how to get in inside the property once located. The fact that it was already dark didn't help and being able to reach the host would have been great."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 stayed for a long weekend on Shannon’s farm for New Year’s. We had such a great experience. The farm is small and peaceful, perfect for disconnecting from day to day life and making memories. Our boys, 11 and 6, had the best time exploring, feeding, petting, and making friends with all the animals. It’s obvious Shannon loves the farm, everything is well cared for. The cottage is in the middle of the barnyard, there are free roaming chickens and cats (all friendly), and the larger animals are fenced. It is quite cozy inside, which works well for us. Everything was clean and had just what was needed for our stay. We brought food and our InstantPot and only left for 1 meal out while there. The usual variety of restaurants are maybe 10-15 minutes away. Bonus: We had farm fresh eggs for breakfast each morning! Shannon was very kind and easy to talk to, always responsive. 5/5, we hope to visit again!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Another perfect stay with Shannon. So happy I finally got to meet her during my last stay. This is a must stay, can’t say enough great things about how perfect my stay always is at Dream Acres."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Dream Acres was the perfect little getaway for our whole pack! We had a great time interacting with the animals and the cottage itself was extremely comfortable! Can't wait for our next trip maybe when it is a bit warmer 😉
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great host. Great Farm. Close to I-95. Super great all around.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had such a great stay. It was just 2 turns off of 95 but felt like we were secluded. It was charming and peaceful and the kids loved feeding the animals. Super responsive. Looking forward to this being our normal stop on our trips to Florida
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed here quite a few times now as it is a great location, great value, and it makes it very easy to have a dog with you. You are able to pull directly up to the front of the house which makes loading/unloading the car much more accessible."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exceeded my expectations!! The photos did not do this place justice. ABSOLUTELY will be staying here again!!!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our second time enjoying the “Cottage” farm stay. Easy check in and check out with clear directions. Cute and cozy. My daughter enjoyed feeding the animals before leaving.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Extremely easy to find and access. My kids loved the ability to wake up in the morning and just walk outside to see the animals. Would stay again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,AMAZING. One of my favorites
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very relaxing and cozy stay. My daughter enjoyed feeding the goats and the pretty alpagas and the swing by the cottage. Beautiful horses!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful, peaceful stay that my children won't soon forget. They loved feeding and petting the animals so much. They felt like they were part of the farm and loved every minute of it!. Thanks Shannon!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’ve stayed in many AirBnB’s all over the country and this is by far one of my favorites. The host has really thought through your experiences from initial booking up until when you leave. The place is very peaceful and charming. The animals are friendly and cute! We were really pleased. The highlight was our livestock guardian dog skipping, running, and wagging her tail when she saw the goats and alpacas. She was elated and we couldn’t get her to sleep through the night because she was so excited. We highly recommend this place!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great communication, nice cottage, everything was good! our kid enjoyed feeding lamas:)"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another perfect stay. This has become a mandatory stop during my holiday travel. Shannon is the best!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was clean and inviting. Shannon was a warm and welcoming host who communicated with us promptly throughout our stay. We will definitely stay again and will recommend to friends and family.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were lucky enough to book both locations on Shannon's property this past weekend. Our stay was nothing short of incredible!! ** Everything in both locations was VERY CLEAN and smelled fresh. Cleanliness is of utmost importance to me, especially having a 2 year old. ** Waking up to the sound of the rooster crowing, and peeking out to the animals was exactly what we needed for a little family getaway. In our family, it was my husband, our 2 year old and myself. If you're not familiar with country living, don't expect to be inside since the internet could be spotty at times. However, there's so much to do outside that we didn't care to be inside. The bed was spacious and comfortable, and there were two other bunk beds located off the bathroom. The shower was relaxing and water got very hot, which is a plus. There was everything we needed to make food for us as well. Overall Shannon and Kevin were kind, down to earth, and willing to go above and beyond in helping us with whatever we needed! To note, the eggs they provided from their free range chickens were delicious. Although we have chickens and ducks at our little farm, it's still exciting to wake up on another farm and have eggs for breakfast. We definitely cannot wait to be back again and visit everyone."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Shannon’s home was pristine. The farm is well manicured and beautiful spot to spend some time. We brought our young kids and they loved the animals. Food for the animals is provided and you can explore at your own leisure. Shannon is very attentive with requests (she lives just across the pond) and was at our door in under 2 minutes with our special request. We Will return and would definitely recommend.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic stay just minutes from I-95. This is the midpoint for a drive I make several times a year. Shannon is a wonderful host. The Cottage is a clean, comfortable, and quiet (but it is a farm! She was clear about the presence of farm animals, and their noises were entirely expected and welcome). We brought our dog with her approval. He was delighted to sniff and stretch. Ask about fresh eggs! We will return on our next trip, if The Cottage is available!"

The house was very cozy and much larger than what the pictures made it seem like. The yard was massive, plenty of yard for the dogs to run around in. It's was nice to know that Wanda lives right across the street in case I needed something."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall the house was cute, it was a little off putting having them across the street/coming into the side yard to go in the garage."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wanda’s place was very nice for our overnight stay on the way to Florida. The home was clean and comfortable. We had our pups with us. There are no pups allowed on the beds, so we brought our kennel inside for the one pup who is less inclined to listen. The yard was very nice and it would have been fun to enjoy if we had more time. Also, it’s nice and quiet."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were thoughtful labels on cabinets and switches, all over. Quaint positive affirmations throughout the home made it feel really welcoming. The sheets and towels smelled clean and fresh. The floor was so clean that when walking around in my light colored socks they didn't get dirty! A lot of nice little touches were throughout like the Kureg coffee bar and brown sugar packets, snacks and quick breakfast options. The kind sized bed was super comfy. It was a beautiful space."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wanda was very accommodating and responded very quickly. When we arrived at 1am we appreciated that Wanda had left the porch light on and a few indoor lights for us. The cottage was very clean, beds were comfy, and we loved the snacks and coffee! Wanda checked in with us the next morning to see if everything was okay with our stay. We wished we could have stayed longer to relax and enjoy this cozy cottage! Thank you Wanda"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay as a family of 4 adults with a dog. Accommodating host is a great communicator. Comfortable beds. The kitchen made it easy to prepare a simple morning meal. The cottage is located in a rather rural area (which we loved). Look for street names not route numbers, and save the turn by turn directions in case you briefly lose GPS as we did for a minute. No trouble finding it with that info available. Fine cell signal and wifi at the cottage. We look forward to visiting again next time we're traveling through the area. In fact my family would like to stay a bit longer than overnight and enjoy the back porch and fire pit sometime."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wanda’s place was the perfect rest stop for my family and our dogs to stay the night on our roadtrip.

Perfect midpoint stop with dogs."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We have been traveling for 10 days and Wanda's house was the last stop. We looked for a house where we could relax and rest after a long drive.

We would highly recommend this home to anyone."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a super-cute, super-cozy, 3 bedroom home in a very peaceful setting near I-95. It was very clean. It was lovingly decorated, and tastefully done for the holidays! I stayed one night with my senior dog, on my way to Florida. It exceeded my expectations! Wonderful place to stay longer, if I had time. I will definitely book for my return trip. Wanda, the host, is very responsive and helpful. I also appreciated their clear love of pets, and low/no stairs for my senior, hardly-walking, dog. Furniture was comfy. Nice, big TV in every room. Lovely backyard with fire pit. After driving on the crazy interstate, this was the peaceful, relaxing place I needed! Thanks to the hosts!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice home in the country with a large yard as well as plenty of room inside. Wanda was quick to respond to the couple questions we had.

The directions in house are outstanding - everything marked, explained and easy to find. The cottage is roomy with comfortable furniture and every possible item you can envision needing. Big yard. Carport to park in. We walked on the rail trail (pretty), did some antique shopping and went to local winery on our in between day. Wanda responded instantly when I messaged. Would definitely return."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Wanda’s place! She was very friendly and responsive, and there was plenty of room at her house for our family.

The only downside was it’s a little out in the country so any restaurants or activities are a drive, and the road noise was a bit loud in the front bedroom. But we would definitely stay with Wanda again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wanda's place is a ***** for us, cute place. It was our first Airbnb Stay after traveling I-95 all day and so much better then any hotel we may have stayed at.

I think I left everything as she asked. When booking the check out time is 10:00 am. On the fridge in the kitchen check out time is 11:00 a.m. I could of slept an extra hour in that nice cozy king size bed. So I wasn't sure which time is correct.Other than that It was lovely and would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice country peaceful getaway.
Great Job Wanda❤️"

It is very convenient to I-95 and very close to Florence with lots of restaurant choices. Her place was very clean, welcoming and comfortable for our family.

We definitely plan on staying here again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The reviews are 100% Correct!
After being in South Carolina for two weeks with pups in tow, we began heading out on the long journey home. Abruptly however, we had car trouble that took 8 hours to resolve and caused essentially a lost day of travel. We needed respite close to the dealership and quickly found this beautiful home away from home. Thanks so much to Wanda, who responded immediately and welcomed an early check-in. Our stress from the day melted away as we circled round the back and stood under the tall trees and felt the calming breeze. Bliss! Pictures do not capture justly the property which is fantastically decorated for that sweet tea and fresh from-the-oven cookie feel. Speaking of happiness, yummy snacks were left abound, likened to a buffet. Nom. Nom. Thank you! Rest assured your visit will be idyllic and I recommend that you stay as long as you can, for THIS was the ONLY Airbnb location we’ve visited where my husband said it felt like home.
Happy Travels. XOXO"

the house was perfect, off the highway enough to be in the country, but close enough not to be out of the way.
the house is definitely a country chic farmhouse, very clean, everything labeled, and very well stocked. it felt like a family member's house, not a rental.

The home smelled fresh and clean without the use of air fresheners and cleaning products. There were thoughtful details throughout like snacks, throw pillows, throw blankets, magazines, and children's books. The toiletries and kitchen items were beyond our expectations.

The cottage is very comfortable and well equipped. The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful. It's close to I-95, but far enough away to feel as if you're truly in the country. We look forward to returning. Highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is beyond extraordinary! If you need to stay somewhere around, go for it! 5 mins to I95. The house is full of cares and loves you can feel it that the host put it in. We would definitely stay here whenever we agave vacation there."

Check-in was easy and Wanda was responsive and proactive but not at all demanding which allowed us the chance to rest and relax after a long day in the car with little ones. There was a high chair for our baby and a lot of snacks and amenities around the house that made for a hospitable stay. The king bed in the primary bedroom paired with the Roku TV was just what the doctor ordered and our kids loved the basket of books in the living room. We’ll definitely be staying again!"

My kids would have loved stretching their legs in the yard if we hadn’t hit traffic and arrived after dark. The property was comfortable and had everything we needed. The closet restaurants/grocery stores are 15-20 minutes away in Florence, so just make sure you plan ahead."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved being able to bring our dogs, relax by the firepit, and walk around in the woods.

We feel like we are 'home' when we are here. Furnishings and decor are marvelous. Host has left things such as candy, microwave popcorn, and a variety of Keurig pods so you feel welcome. There even is a dog bed and dog dishes in case your canine companion is with you. Beds are comfortable. Heat and a/c function well (and you have control of the thermostat which is marvelous).
This was our second visit and it affirmed our feeling that this is our favorite airbnb thus far.
Will definitely return if we are in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. This place is absolutely adorable and very well stocked. The snacks were such a great touch after a long drive.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"An absolute hidden gem! Our family stopped here traveling to and from Florida, and it was such a perfect airbnb. We arrived both times in the evening time, and the home was well-lit for us to find (also was only about 5 minutes from i95). The home was sparkling clean, cozy, cute, and we felt right ""at home"" as soon as we walked in. Our family sure did appreciate the snacks and coffee bar provided! We also loved resting and relaxing on both the front and back porch with our pup, Lucy. A very peaceful backyard - just what we needed for us to rest after driving long hours. We also felt very safe knowing that the owners lived directly across from the home, if we needed anything! We can't say enough good things about this little treasure of a home, I'm sure that we will be back when traveling down south again. Thank you so much for opening your adorable home and hosting us!!"

The bed was very comfortable. We watched a movienin comfortable livingroom. There’s a nice big yard perfect for our dogs to get some exercise after a long day of driving. Quiet rural area but close to I-95 and other attractions, restaurants, stores etc.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wanda’s place was great! I appreciated her accommodating us with our dogs after traveling all day on our way to FL.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was in town for a funeral. It was my moms first stay at an Airbnb and everything was perfect. Who would have thought their would be an Airbnb in Timmonsville. Staying here close to family helped with the grieving process. Will stay here again with future trips to the area. A 100 times better than staying in an hotel and cheaper.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Charming cottage. Very welcoming atmosphere. Beautiful master bedroom. Cottage was very well equipped.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wanda’s place is always accommodating, peaceful, quiet and clean. A favorite of ours when traveling back and forth from PA to FL. Convenient to 95. Our dog loves it as much as we do😊. Highly recommend."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our 3rd (I think) stay here and we always feel welcomed and cozy here! Nice touches with snacks and sweet treats 😊. A bit remote (which is fine with us!), but just know it’s 15-20 minutes from grocery store or restaurants, so plan accordingly. Nice big fire pit in back yard! Master bedroom/bed cozy and so comfy!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We love this location as it’s the perfect spot from Ct to our place in Florida to stop and rest. Just 5 minutes from I95 but very rural and quiet which we were looking for with our dog who barks at everything .We arrived late and the lights were turned on for us. The house had lots of little touches . Coffee bar,snacks(ding dongs),doggie dishes and bags, xtra blankets ,nice towels and good shower pressure .As former AirBnB hosts were picky and this will be our new stopover . Oh and really important…CLEAN.Thank you!"

It's a great location and Wanda & Steve are really thoughtful hosts; they provide amenities which are unexpected - but appreciated (microwavable popcorn, instant oatmeal, a coffee 'station'...even crackers and Ding Dongs!)
We like this place so much, we recommended it to our in-laws who will be staying there later this month on their way from PA to FL!
And we plan on reserving this again for our way home in early May."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,so cute and cozy
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great spot to stop when driving between the northeast and Florida. Stayed here twice and everything was as described. It was really great to be able to grab a couple waters, coffee and snacks at the rental. Shower was good and had body wash and shampoo so we didn’t need to unpack everything. Comfortable beds too. Thank you!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wanda was a great host and the accommodation was convenient and well appointed. The only ding concerns the website disclosures. Specifically, the pets on furniture rule and corresponding fee is buried on the website so we did not learn of this until arrival, at which point, it was too late to make other arrangements. I suggest that simply charging a flat $50 fee for pets would be more transparent and consistent with a 'pet friendly' policy. We would have gladly paid this up-front. Additional fees for any pet-related damage (beyond residual pet hair) would, of course be warranted."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent several nights here while a family member was in the hospital (MUSC). It was comfortable, the hosts were friendly and proactive communicators, and the location worked well for me. I’d stay again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was perfect for an out of town wedding! We rented the 2 units that are upstairs/downstairs & our best friends rented their house that is right next door- it was the perfect set up to be with fam/friends but still have our own spaces. Great hosts too!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was just right for a one night stay.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Collin was very interactive and so pleasant. The place was just adorable. I felt right at home when a framed photo of Old Sheldon Church ruins. A place with fond memories for me. I did not bring my dog but they’re pet friendly so when I’m in need in March to be in the area for 2 weeks I know I’ll be choosing them and their house option.
Very easy to find and get into. Felt safe and secure, private parking and space.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Adorable place! Had everything we needed. Great, prompt communication. Perfect stop for us between the Northeast and Florida. Would definitely come back again! Really good experience!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed staying at this place to rest on a long road trip with my dog. It definitely beats staying in a hotel. The patio was really convenient for dogs and they had everything I needed to be comfortable during my stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It’s a short stop from Florida. Just a few minutes after getting off the highway. We felt at home right away. We really enjoyed the overnight stay in this nice place.
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Overall I had an amazing stay place looks as described and comfy home. Great location. Although after check out I was accused of leaving paint on the bathroom wall and a pull from vanity. Oil and wax residue being left I took full accountability for oil and wax even though I went through and cleaned as much as possible and scraped up wax easy enough for it to be swept up and oil residue just to be wiped over nothing harmful to damage anything by the way it was baby oil… after assure host that I had paint no where in bathroom for it to be put on the wall and that the pull for the vanity was there before I arrived I was told the “paint” that was told I left on the wall was cost by some type of reaction for the dishwasher to whatever oil was used that created a “red stain” on the wall(keep in mind I only used butter to cook & I left a paint tray for others) and baby oil that was was only used in the room but the satin appeared as purple still unsure of the pulled vanity accusations.

2023-12-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"This place was really run down and old! Broken furniture, unconformable bed and extremely noisy from upstairs."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"So this could be a real top notch stay and I very much liked the place but noise is an issue. It was clearly stated in the description so I was well warned, but I had a young child screaming and jumping and a large dog above me and it was less than ideal. Perhaps providing ear plugs and with some sound insulation installed it would be better? Still it was very clean and I felt safe. Bed was comfortable and the blankets were nice. Host was helpful and kind."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! the fenced in patio was perfect for our pup to run around in after a long day of driving
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay at the Kuker St. cottage. Everything was great (again). Great location for visiting family- nice neighborhood that is walkable to 2 different parks.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"this is a wonderful place to stay. we had issues with our U-Haul trailer lights being disconnected on the drive there. Aron and Collin were so understanding of the issue and offered to help! U-Haul took a few hours to get to us, and Aron and Collin were super flexible and kind about the situation. This Thanksgiving, we are thankful for kind people like Aron and Collin that we meet along our massive move to the other side of the country. beautiful place to lay your head and let your pet relax. thanks so much!!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I never saw another person while in the property, but I did see cats.
I would stay here again as it was very convenient to a work assignment. The instructions were excellent, the place was well equipped, and while I could hear people in the apartment above me it wasn’t bothersome. The hosts were very responsive and gracious to allow a flexible check in/out time.
I’m grateful I found the Kuker Carriage House!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent hosts, great communication and easy instructions! We came in for a stop overnight on our road trip and it was a nice spot. We did feel the neighborhood was a little sketchy but the cozy vibes in the unit made up for that. The unit is on the first floor, the walls are very thin and we could hear the second floor walk & talk until around 12am. Other than that I have no complaints! Would stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Aron and Collin were so so sweet and their place was perfect for us to stop and get some rest as we were traveling south on I-95. Highly recommend! I would definitely stay again if I’m back in the area.

We usually stay in a dog friendly hotel but for essentially the same price we were able to stay in a tastefully decorated, immaculate apartment."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at the Kuker cottage on the way to a wedding in NC and then at the Kuker carriage house on the way back. Both were clean and very unique. They were also as described. The neighborhood was quiet and we rested well at both locations. There are also some good restaurants and breweries nearby, and we met some nice folks. We will definitely stay at either location again. The hosts are super nice, too!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I were passing through Florence South Carolina heading to North Carolina. If you have to stop in Florence, this is the place to stay. I would highly recommend Aaron and Collins home to anyone needing a home away from home. We will definitely use their place if the need arises in the future."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Their place had everything I needed, and I was able to walk my dog in the neighborhood in the morning. I thought I was staying in a stand-alone cottage, but my rental was the lower apartment in a duplex next to the cottage. However, I heard no noise from inside my unit and I slept well."

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peeling furniture. Unstable dining chair. Huge step-down upon entry that seems unsafe or a hazard. Extremely noisy. People upstairs should be asked to attempt to have a light step and minimize going up a d down the stairs and avoid slamming the door seeing that it is directly next to the bedroom on the 1st floor. I would not stay at this location again. May want to take the rugs in the bedroom up because they are a fall hazard because they slip right under your feet. Overall, it was nice."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a perfect place for our family to stay. Aron and Collin were so easy to communicate with and very responsive.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the first time I was driving from NY to FL with just my teenage son. I wanted to make sure I rested well in a comfortable, safe, private place. This was PERFECT! Felt right at home, we were able to get takeout from a restaurant 2min away, and really got to relax after the first half of a long drive.
I want to also note that I have chronic health issues so resting well is particularly important for me. The bed and room was super comfortable and my 17yr old slept really well in the smaller bed.
I would happily stay here again!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the unit…larger than I expected. Place was very cozy, and clean.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed here for a few days for work and it was a nice relaxing place to come back to. My husband and doggo were also with me. We walked to the restaurants as we were so close to downtown. Loved the layout of the place as well.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,good pet friendly place for a quick stay. enclosed courtyard is nice and would be even better if gravel were replaced by grass.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Comfy beds is my number one thing and they had those. Very clean and cozy and charming. Very roomy and cute decor and I loved the character they left from the old building! Very responsive hosts! The sound machines was a helpful touch!
We are perfectly nimble but if you have trouble getting around this might not be a fit for you if you have a cane, walker or wheelchair, as there are lots “funky/charming” ups and downs to move around the space.
The listing says house so that confused me a bit to realize it was a downstairs apartment. So, just know there could be someone walking around upstairs at 7am. But it wasn’t too noisy at all and the whole downstairs has its own courtyard and entrance which is really nice!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The whole process was seamless, and the hosts seemed to anticipate every question. I only wish I had paid more attention to there being a step up to the bedroom and bathroom, because I tend to be clumsy, but nightlights are provided for nighttime walking!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As always, quick and easy check. Always clean and never have any issues. This is my go to when I need to stay closer to work. Thank you for always being so welcoming and sharing your home with me."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was nice, cozy, and clean! Aaron and Collin made for an easy check-in process and gave clear instructions/guidelines. As mentioned in the place description, you can hear easily to the upstairs so just be mindful of that (not a huge problem though)!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was my first air bnb experience and it was great! Aron and Collin were great to work with! They answered all my questions within minutes. It's a very cute and clean space! My daughter was doing a clinical rotation for her college at McLeod Regional Medical Center for 7 weeks. We needed a safe and comfortable space for her to stay that was close to the hospital. My daughter really enjoyed the space. She said the bed was super comfortable and enjoyed being able to control the air conditioning. She had everything she needed for a long term stay, including a washer and dryer. As a mom, I also appreciated that the owners came by the property to check on things and made their presence known. I felt that my daughter was safe while staying there. It was a great experience and we highly recommend! Aron and Collin were great hosts!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Aron And Collin were great hosts! Being a travel nurse this cottage was a home away from home.

My only recommendation is that anyone who is a light sleeper bring sound canceling headphones or earbuds. There was noise (just people walking around, nothing loud) coming from the upstairs part of the duplex until well past midnight. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep without my AirPods. It wasn’t anything terribly disturbing, but for anyone who is sensitive to noise, it’s something to be aware of!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a cozy, cute cabin nestled at the edge of the woods behind the main house. Well remodeled and decorated w/great selection of furnishings. Sofa was cushy, but not saggy. Nice appliances, nice shower/tub and linens. Double bed was ok, but rather squeaky. Back deck was delightful & peaceful, but quite dirty. Narrow driveway very bumpy over tree roots with tight turn around at cabin, but worked fine for our mid-size SUV. Very nice neighborhood close in. All-in-all a very good place to stay."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Spot on to the description. Hosts were great with communication! Note the heads up that driveway is tight and rocky, but do-able. Very comfortable and everything we needed. We stayed on a particularly rainy weekend and could smell the dampness inside the space. The hosts were trying to be proactive and had a dehumidifier running which surely helped a bit, but not entirely. Would stay again if in the area."

I saw deer in the back yard twice (like feet away) during my short stay! It's very lush and quiet. I wouldn't worry about the driveway as mentioned in the reviews. It's tight, but if you have a small car or suv, just drive very slowly. There's plenty of space in front of the main house to park for larger vehicles or if you're concerned about the tight space. Kali's space has everything you need!"

We stayed for the Darlington races, so it was an easy drive to and from Kali's place. As the other reviews mention, the driveway down to the cottage IS VERY TIGHT. I have a Nissan Rogue, so definitely need a smaller vehicle to navigate the driveway. But, you can park at the top of her driveway if you feel more comfortable. Hoping to come back in September. But would highly recommend, and will definitely stay again, when in town."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was very appreciative of Kali’s response time and understanding as my visit was last minute and for an ailing family member.

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are many positives to this place! It was clean, comfortable, quiet, and very cute. Everything you need was there: toiletries, dishes, coffee, and big comfy towels. However, the bed mattress/box springs are worn out and sagging toward the middle. Also the driveway was rocky and narrow. We have a midsized truck and were able to navigate it. If you have a larger vehicle you'd need to park near the main house."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very nice place. Clean, cozy and comfortable. Kali is a great host and is available if you need anything."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location in a cute neighborhood, nice clean guest house, responsive and accommodating host!"

Great host will definitely stay here again we had wonderful time."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay and their place will be the first I look for when I return to Florence. Its a separate guest house on the rear of their lot, which backs up to a forest. It was new, clean, tastefully decorated, and well equipped and kept. Large bathroom and shower, nice kitchen/dining with a peaceful view. If it was cooler I would have been on the deck more. Bedroom has a dresser and closet, the bed was a double and a little hard (but I'm older too). The driveway is long and narrow, it's a little tight where you park but just have to go slow."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Private, clean and in a very beautiful neighborhood. We will definitely remember next time we’re passing through!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pictures are accurate to what you see. It is a well decorated, clean space. We really enjoyed it. It has everything you need towels, dishes, extra blankets ect."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kali’s Guest House was the perfect pitstop for us on our way home to Florida from NY. The location was great, only 10-15 minutes from I-95. I appreciated the private parking area off the street, especially since our car was packed inside and on the roof rack. It was super clean and comfortable. I’m looking forward to staying there again on our next road-trip. 🙂"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter and I stayed here one night. Super clean and nice little cottage to stay in. Everything has been updated and it is light and airy. I wish we could have stayed longer. The host is an excellent communicator and very helpful. This is in a very good location and great place to either relax in, or see the surrounding area. I would definitely stay her again."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kali’s place. It is beautiful! Nicely furnished and decorated. The pictures don’t do it justice.

We will definitely consider Kali’s place first if we get back to Florence one day!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is amazing! I was traveling through and Kali’s guesthouse is better than ANY hotel around. She made me feel welcomed and comfortable. The bed & pillows were super comfy. My family and I will all be booking with Kali when we are passing through again!!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place. We were only there for a quick over night but it was everything we needed and more! Definitely recommend this place to stay. Easy to get to from 95 and quiet for an overnight.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had an awesome experience! Very easy to find And had a wonderful stay. Only thing I would say is the driveway is a little narrow for bigger cars. But a minor detail. 10 out of 10 would recommend and will stay again! Thank you!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Can't say enough good about Kali's place. The photos don't do justice. It is better than advertised. Beautiful, super private unit and extremely comfortable. Would definitely stay here again when in the area."

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was remarkably clean. It is updated, spacious and well-equipped, down to fun games. Patricia was responsive, helpful and kind. The house was bigger than the pictures showed, IMO. We were 5 women in town for tennis state championships and the various venues were all within 15 - 20 minutes from the home. The home is in a low-rent community of similar, respectful homes of seemingly hard-working people. Some nights were loud outdoors (neighbors coming in late, hanging out outside) but we never once felt unsafe and we all just used White Noise apps on our phones to ensure a great night's sleep. Directly across from the community is a large and nice-looking park. Otherwise the home isn't far from amenities like grocery stores, gas stations and chain restaurants. I'd definitely book this home again when we're in town for tennis again. (Of note: the home allows pets, so one of our teammates had to get a hotel room after the first night due to allergies...the rest of us didn't react.)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, comfortable and exactly as described. Patricia was easy to communicate with and very accommodating to our needs. Highly recommend!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was in a quiet neighborhood close to stores and restaurants. I felt safe there and the house was very clean. I am a neat freak and felt completely comfortable here. It had everything we needed, the beds were comfortable and the house was decorated with a cute decor. The master bedroom and bathroom are both very large with the house being a perfect size for our group of 4. I would definitely stay here again and it was the perfect distance for our trip to Darlington Raceway. Patricia was also very responsive and helpful with any of my questions along the way. Great all around!"

I would definitely book there again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"She was a very good host, very responsive… I was a little thrown off by the neighborhood, but it’s a cute little neighborhood tucked away. It was very quiet and peaceful, no loud noises.
The clean up person I’d say needs to dust the floors and under the bed and refrigerator… the couch cover kept coming off, other than that I would most definitely stay again. My teens loveddddd it..: the games were so much fun."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My experience was all positive for one the Communication with the property owner was amazing and the home was clean and beautiful just like the pictures. The area is

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was close to town. Good place for the price. You are hour n 30 min to Murtle Beach. You could tell it was dog friendly. The beds were pretty hard. Not to good for old back. The back yard if you had a dog it could get out through whole in picket fence. It was just bam right next to other houses. Im not use to that. We were there for my daughters wedding and her location had me 30 min from the venue. Over all house and location was great for my purpose. Thank you

2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I were in town for my daughter’s graduation, which is not only an exciting and wonderful time, but can prove stressful as well when trying to accommodate a large group of people. Tania‘s place took that extra worry away. Her place is located in a beautiful, quiet residential neighborhood and when we walked into the house we were quite impressed. Everything was beautifully decorated and her place was spotless. For a group of 8, we never felt crowded and were all very comfortable. Beds are always the deal maker or breaker for me, and THOSE beds were COMFORTABLE!!! I wish I could’ve stayed in the bed much longer 😄:) Each of the bathrooms were stocked with the necessary toiletries and the little snack basket in the kitchen added a nice touch. We got lucky with this place for sure!"

Love 💯"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Leslie,
Thank you for the great stay. As I previously stated there was not 1 item I needed or wanted as home was fully stocked and one of the best places I have stayed. It was almost unbelievable a home could be presented so beautifully and clean. I felt at home, we enjoyed our stay for sure and the Christmas tree was a nice touch! Job well done!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"I've stayed in a lot of airbnb's, but this was without a doubt one of the best ones. It was updated, had enough furniture to in the living space to accommodate 6 people, the beds are relatively comfortable, and it was VERY clean. I never had to worry about getting in touch, because the communication was fast and consistent. We were very grateful for the ammenities that were provided, specifically the coffee products and the shower items. One of us forgot our toiletry travel bag, so it was a relief to find shampoo, conditioner, body wash AND lotion! We also enjoyed exploring the area and some of the local events going on during our time here; this space is near one of the main strips with gas stations, restaurants, shopping, and not too far from the downtown area. The price tag might be a little bit higher than most, and it can be scary to choose a space without a lot of reviews, but I assure you it's worth it! If we ever find ourselves back in Florence, this will be my go to :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was beautiful! Leslie was an amazing host, quickly answering any questions I had. I will definitely book again in the future!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"I have traveled allot in last 8 years, I am a very picky when it comes to hotels and vrbo’s, having said that….
We had an awesome stay here. The house is on a corner lot and has a double car garage with ample parking. It is in an older quiet family neighborhood with a mix of ages and diversity. The inside has been completely renovated and is very nice. The master BR is spacious and all the beds were very comfortable. Leslie was very responsive and friendly to deal with. If I need a airnb in Florence again, I would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Easy to fine, nice stay. Would definitely recommend for those visiting Florence!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay in this beautiful home. We are regular Airbnb travellers and would rate Leslie’s house as one of the nicest, best-located, and real value of all the places we have stayed. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. I highly recommend this home."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great home and host! Will definitely be back!

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Leslie was a wonderful host! She was very friendly and responsive. The house was very cozy and had wonderful amenities.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"-At first I was skeptical about renting a property with no review, however, Leslie was transparent and always available with any questions I had. The property is amazing and looks exactly like the pictures! It’s also very close to the hospitals and eateries.
- I stayed here with 4 of my family members and they could not stop talking it. The words they used to describe the house is “homey, comfortable, and clean”. The king suite has its own bathroom and living area, and the two smaller rooms provide optimal privacy. The kitchen had everything you needed including seasonings, pots, appliance, tea and coffee. The bathrooms were stocked with toiletries and great quality towels. There is also a washer/dryer, which Leslie provides detergent for. I have already recommended the property to others and would not hesitant to stay here again. Thank you Leslie for the Southern Hospitality!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, modern and had everything we needed to feel at home. It was very hot outside, so parking our car in the garage was awesome. The house was easy to find and a short commute to all the places we wanted to visit. Also close to a supermarket which was handy and close to restaurants . Communication was great too. We would highly recommend this beautiful home."
,,,"Beware! This air BnB is not as listed, I was fooled by the photos, reviews and rating. It is not clean, smells horrible, ac unit and humidifier (which u assume is for the smell) are extremely noisy. The pool is so gross and not clean.
The photos on this air BnB are so deceiving. We had to immediately leave and check into a local hotel after driving for 10 hours. And we didn’t even get a full refund from the host."
