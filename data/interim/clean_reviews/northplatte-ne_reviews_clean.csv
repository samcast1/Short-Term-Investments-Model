2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dustin’s place was perfect for a cozy stay on our roadtrip. It had everything we needed, was perfectly clean, the parking spot was right outside, and private. It was easy to check-in and comfortable! Couldn’t ask for a better spot to crash!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for the overnight stay while traveling through Nebraska
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect place to stop off the interstate for the night! Very clean and no weird smells. Dustin was clear and responsive with messaging. The back patio space is beautiful and shaded and it was nice sitting out there in the morning.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend and I stayed here with our two dogs for a few days, and we really enjoyed the space. It is a tiny home, but they have maximized their space and it is extremely cozy. Definitely a cute little town and would recommend staying here if you’re passing through!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My golden retriever and I had a perfect stay at this super clean, quiet spot on our road trip. The location was excellent - close to Rte 80 and stores, and Dustin's directions were very clear and easy to follow. I especially appreciated the full, well-stocked kitchen. Dog walks were easy around the neighborhood and Dustin even provided a few other suggestions for places to exercise my pup. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just did an overnight on my way through the area, was close to the freeway, food, gas and Walmart. Super cute, pretty quiet even though you're near a major street. Hot water on demand is always great!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautifully decorated above and beyond high end hotels.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a nice tiny home to rest in. Dustin was great and communicative. I got delayed due to a blizzard and he was quick to respond and was nice enough to refund the night I had to cancel. I came in the next day and was glad to see a notebook with local suggestions. I had a delicious dinner at North 40 Chophouse and saw a little bit of North Platte. Everything was easy and the house has everything to make a stay comfortable & cozy!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great stay! Cute little house with parking available off the street. I couldn’t fit my trailer unfortunately but my truck fit perfectly and we had a nice night.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I needed a quiet place to relax after a very long drive and the nest was just what I needed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ""nest"" is adorable. It was perfect for my husband and I - everything we needed. We got to see all of North Platte that we made the trip for and everywhere was easy to get to from the ""nest"". It was just like new! And it brought us good luck as we watches our Iowa State Cycylones mens basketball team rock to be Conference Champions!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place with great communication from hosts. Would happily stay here again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and comfortable. We were able to make the meals we wanted in the kitchen. It had everything we needed. There is limited seating, even for two, but the listing was clear that it was for two people only. We would stay again and recommend to others. Dustin was very responsive and replied quickly. We were able to experience a lot of the sandhill crane migration during our stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Noelle's Nest was wonderful! Super clean, comfortable bed, and lots of thoughtful touches. Perfect place for us to stay the night while traveling through North Platte. Quick and easy to find off of I80. Also appreciated that we could stay with our dog, Ollie. Friendly and proactive communication by Dustin. We hope to stay again on our travels!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place really close to a bunch of places to eat and a couple of blocks from the Walgreens. Easy to get to from the interstate. I'd definitely stay here again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a night during our road trip. The place was very clean and cozy, and they even left out treats for my kitties."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We used Dustin’s place as a quick overnight stop on a roadtrip back home—it was perfect! The nest was convenient, easy-to-find, cozy and well-kept. Thank you for allowing our two dogs to stay; we would stay here over a hotel any day!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay over on a roadtrip!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I passed through North Platte on a road trip and booked Noelle’s Nest last-minute. Dustin checked in with us right away to give us arrival details, and their place was updated, fresh, and cozy. The bed was super comfortable and we appreciated the extra touches (treats and dog bowls for our pup, snacks and coffee for us, and easy phone charger built into the nightstand). It’s close to everything in town and convenient, but also very quiet inside. We’d absolutely stay again if we find ourselves back in town!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the coziest and most beautiful home to stay in. Dustin is an amazing host!! Spotless, wonderful amenities and beautifully decorated. A terrible snow storm came through and he made sure there was a snow shovel and also informed us he would be by to shovel the walk. Being able to stay in such an amazing home allowed us to be with family for Christmas and that is priceless. Thank you Dustin and Noelle!!!!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Lovely home and very clean. Everything was in its place. Would stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a really great place to stay for a few days in North Platte. Although it is small, it really was the perfect size for 1 or 2 people and the layout was thoughtfully planned. Getting in was easy and the place was really cute and clean. The bed, pillows, and chair were all really comfortable. The kitchen had all of the necessities that I needed to cook for myself. I really appreciated how thoughtful Dustin was in providing pet dishes and a few treats for my pet. He also thought of his guests with coffee and a few snacks. The heater and tankless hot water heater both worked great and the instructions to use the Roku were clear. I would definitely recommend this place if you’re going to be in North Platte."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was a nice little place that was clean and well cared for.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Never stayed in ""tiny house"" before . such a charmer!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Tiny Home was so adorable. Everything we needed and then some. Kitchen and Bathroom was spotless. Appliances, pots, pans, like new or were new. I even took the wrappers off pans that had not been used, EVER. We enjoyed our stay. Our fur baby really enjoyed treats left by Dustin. You couldn't ask for anything better."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I must say that we were pleasantly surprised by the interior of the place. I was probably a little judgemental standing on the outside as it looked so small and I thought it was a shack. however, once the door opened I was amazed. it was so beautiful and done really well. the shower was amazing with never ending high pressure water. after a long day driving it was relief. if I could pick up this rental and put it in the middle of nowhere for hunting season, I would. very nice place and probably one of the best we have been to in a while now."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"House was adorable, very cozy, and clean . I felt right at home. My stay was enjoyable and would gladly stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My daughter stopped here for a quick overnight on a road trip to Salt Lake. Dustin, was very responsive, I let him know she was arriving on the later side and he left a light on. The place was squeaky clean and very comfy. Thanks Dustin!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place is freshly remodeled, cozy and clean. Easy to find and close to shopping & restaurants. We had a great stay and would definitely book again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My wife, pooch, and I stayed at Noelle’s for one night on the way to Colorado for a long weekend. As the first guests of Dustin and Noelle, we can say their place is a fantastic AirBnB. Although small, it seemed spacious! The space was very well planned out, the bathroom was VERY nice and the entire place was immaculately clean. The location is close enough to the interstate that it is easy to find but not so far into town that it is away from restaurants and businesses. The dog park is only about a mile away as well. I would highly recommend staying here for traveling through or even if you are in North Platte for a visit. We are hoping we get the chance to stay again! Thanks for having us!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Grat host! Great stay@
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The host was sooo nice and the place was very clean and comfortable. I was moving cross country with pets and the moving company made me arrive middle of the night. They were so sweet and responsive. I am soo grateful!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s place was a great stay in North Platte! 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a large kitchen/den area was perfect. Everything was clean and exactly what we needed for our stay. Mary was the best and made sure we were taken care of. During our stay, there was a tornado and Mary invited us to hang out in her basement until the storm passed!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Probably the best bnb option in north Platt to sleep 6+

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Would be nice to have end tables & master bedroom bed uncomfortable.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We got caught in a snowstorm on our way home to Colorado after Christmas. The interstate was shut down and we were panicked. We were able to book Mary’s place with our three dogs so quickly and we’re so incredibly grateful to be able to drop in on such short notice. It was such a lifesaver and we were so cozy in a very, otherwise, stressful situation. Thank you again for accommodating us!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice clean place to stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mary’s place is a great spot for families. We had 6 stay there comfortably. The walkway was shoveled for us before entry. Felt right at home. Great stay right off the interstate.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,WE feel right at home.
2023-11-01,3.0,Group trip,"Mary's Place: Host was easy to contact and very responsive. House had nice layout and was nicely decorated, easy access, nice neighborhood. However, needs to clearly let people know there is a 1st floor rental and basement rental because some people may not appreciate sharing same house or may want to rent both. Furniture is dated and could use more end tables/coffee tables. House was dirty and needed a good cleaning (EX: Dusty, counters dirty, animal hair on floor, appliances dirty inside and out, tubs/toilets washing machine dirty (Suggest cleaning service). Closets, one door broken and messy. Unused decorations just shoved under curio. Refrigerator didn't work but they did replace it promptly with new one. Stove on main floor had baked on food and digital panel didn't work so couldn't use. Shower floor a little slippery and could use some safety bars and better floor mats/towels/wash clothes and more toilet paper. Also had to share driveway with owners ( Inconvenient )"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little home to stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. Host is very responsive. House is close to local attractions and clean. Nice back yard area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary's place was a great place to stay. She gave clear instructions for check-in and how to locate things around the house. The house was very clean and spacious. It was very convenient that the house was pet friendly. There was plenty of yard space with a very green yard. Mary's place was in a very quaint area of town and a short drive from numerous restaurants and venues. I will definitely recommend people stay here and would stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary's place was comfortable and in a quiet neighborhood. Perfect for my week visit to the area for work.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary was very friendly and responsive. Great house in a nice neighborhood.
2023-08-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary's place had a communicative host, easy to use lock, safe neighborhood, and free laundry. I come to North Platte frequently and usually stay at a hotel, but I couldn't find a hotel room for these dates, so decided I would try air b and b. This was my first air b and b experience and it makes me not want to use air b and b again. The furniture was very poor quality and uncomfortable, esp the beds and dining chairs. There was a great deal of trash under the king bed. There was trash on the floor near the trash can in the kitchen to include cigarettes. There is a sign not to smoke and we do not smoke, but the house smelled like cigarettes and cats. In fact, there was a cat at the back patio constantly scratching, and making noise, and climbing on the screens. The hand soap was running out in the bathrooms. There were small bars of soap provided, but the towels were very small and thin. The bathrooms were extremely dingy and dirty with hair and grime on all surfaces and dirty rugs."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"super cute and homey feeling to this home. All the kids had a great time with the huge backyard and the games in the cabinet. Neighborhood is quiet.

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 stayed there for 4 days. It was a comfortable stay. Just wish we would of known we didn't have the whole house. Their were guests also staying in the basement. The laundry area was a shared space, which wasn't a huge deal. Like I sadi, just wish it would of been disclosed to us"

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary's Place is in a great location with most restaurants, grocery stores, visitor's center, etc. nearby. Quiet neighborhood and the home is a good size for 4-6 people. We stayed there to watch the Sandhill Crane migration and it was perfect."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall, the stay was good. There are also guests that stay in the lower level of the house but we never heard anyone. The house was decently clean. My suggestion would be to fold linens neater. It sounds nitpicky, but presentation means a lot. All the linens were just kind of thrown in the cabinets. There was also someone’s contact lens in the kitchen sink. A baby bottle top was left in the master bedroom. The bed slept well. No real issues."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Large house. Lots of sitting room. Beautiful fixtures!

2022-04-01,2.0,Group trip,"Our children stayed in the Airbnb and they have always had good ratings and stayed in other Airbnb’s in the past. They said it was spacious and modern and the beds were OK. The only problem was it had not been clean very well. There were crumbs on top of the stove ,open containers in the refrigerator, pubic hair on the shower ,poop stains on the toilet and sticky spotty marks on the floor."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice place to stay. I would definitely recommend it.
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Breakfast is not included. Location was good, as there’s not much between Denver and Lincoln Nebraska. Short notice, was no problem. I did specifically ask about breakfast, and although the listing says it’s included, it’s not"
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,great relaxing place
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, comfortable accommodations."
2022-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, a little stressful to be on the top level with young kids, we worried about disturbing the guests below as the floors creaked and kids are kids. Cleanliness was decent, not outstanding. Also, didn’t have carbon monoxide detector, at least that we could find. Would consider staying again but didn’t blow us away."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Large, comfortable home! The hot water was plentiful. Mary has a later checkout than most places, so this is a great stop if you need some extra rest on a long road trip."
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family liked it here, cozy house and cozy quiet neighborhood but also just a short drive to the main area of town. Great value and definitely better than a hotel!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quick replies, and nice place."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy access and nice home. I would stay here again.
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Mary’s place for one night traveling as a family. The house was nice and had everything we needed for our short stay. Basically everything was in order but we had to vacuum the couch because there were chip crumbs all over it and the kitchen/dining room floor was not swept or mopped.
We also were not aware that it was a shared unit with people staying in the downstairs below. Overall they were quiet, but when they accessed their unit, we could hear them talking quite clearly through the shared laundry room."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the perfect home away from home for me and my family. Mary's Place accommodated my father, my brother, sister in law, and their 3 children. Dad was able to have a private room and bathroom just like at home. It was great to discover a pack and play crib for my lil nephew, which came in handy for taking downstairs to Homey Place where the rest of our family stayed."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Clean, perfect for 4 guys who were just passing through on a golf trip."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was spacious and had room for our family, so that was great! Our first night was a bit of scare as we were not use to tornado like weather and winds getting up to 80 miles an hour and electricity going out. it would be nice to have an emergency plan available. But overall after the first night the rest of our stay was great and comfortable as we were in and out of the house."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Pros- spacious, beautiful back yard to relax and kids were able to run around in it was clean, nice lawn that had great maintenance which made us comfortable having the kids running around. Mary was quick with responses and flexible on check in and check out times. Loved that she had satellite tv to watch, it’s rare to see this and appreciate it. Nice shower in the master. Great quiet neighborhood.
Cons- bedding did smell of smoke and towels are old and hard. In need of new items. No soaps or shampoos for showers. Thankfully no one was staying in the basement during our stay but did not like that I was not aware that it was a shared place when booking.
We travel a lot, Of all the air bnbs we have stayed at it was on the top of our list and would stay again if we ever came through the area again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay very comfortable and room for everyone.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! Very clean and great location.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Clean home. Quiet subdivision.
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Rental is Not entire house, it is upper and lower floor rentals with a shared washer and dryer. Also, main sectional couch upstairs has been around heavy smoking and smells awful from it. Otherwise decent rental."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This was my first time renting an Airbnb. Lots of space for two families. Nice location. I was under the impression that we got the whole house so was surprised to see a sign that said the basement was rented also. I never did see or hear anyone but it made me a little uneasy when I got there the first night with just myself and my two daughters because there was a door to the basement right in the front room. Unfortunately, the sectional smelled like smoke and my allergies flared up. The one room also smelled a little funky. Beds were ok. Overall it was a great price point and a lot of room. Just a few little fixes and it would be even better!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Large space. Clean. Easy check-in. Good communication. Great location.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When a Person comes to a place like North Platte for the weekend they are looking for a place to stay that resembles the comfor of their own home. Mary’s home was just that.
The master shower with the rain down shower head was a real treat. For a second as I washed my hair I thought I was outside in the rainforests of Indonesia. Not to mention that infinity shower drain. Decccent shower pan!!! I Respect the craftsmanship kid.
Now I will say I did show up to the house a little intoxicated for my stay. And as I stumbled to the couch I saw a book of genius book of world records on the end table. Absolutely amazing!! I got lost in that for 45 mins.
The stay was amazing. A 5 out of 5, the pie, the whip cream, and the cherry!! I’ll be back to north platte and I’ll be back to Mary’s place."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary’s home was beautiful, and she and her husband were so kind and helpful to our family. If it weren’t for social distancing we probably would have seen and talked to them more. 😉

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Todd's place was great, it was nicely maintained and you could tell they had put a lot of effort to make the place comfortable with all the amenities you need. The location gives you quick access to a lot of dining and shopping options within walking distance.
Beds were comfy, living room was perfect and the kitchen was well stocked with what we needed to cook with. The only negative is a pretty small bathroom, but I'm guessing it's an older house.
I'd recommend staying here."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Todd's house was a very good value for a 4-bedroom home. It's located right off the main street so easy to get to. The home is an older home, with a fairly steep staircase to the upstairs two bedrooms, but there are two bedroom on the main floor if you're traveling with elderly guests. The living room furniture was comfortable and accommodating. The kitchen had new appliances, a coffee bar and some cracker snacks. It was fairly well stocked with dishware, glasses, pots/pans. There was a washer/dryer on main level, but no laundry soap. There is a Walgreens in walking distance which was handy to pick up laundry soap and snacks. There are several nice touches such as extra lap blankets, first aid kit, bathroom products etc. Overall a very good value."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kari was wonderful!! It was such a homey space. She went above and beyond for our family. We were traveling with our 1 year old and she asked if we’d need a pack and play or a highchair, ensuring we were comfortable!
All of the linen was clean, the house was spotless, the beds were comfortable (as comfortable as they can be sleeping with children), she provided snacks and candies (which the kiddos loved), the shower pressure is AMAZING and the tub is extremely deep! It is also in such a convent spot in town. Walgreens, and the shopping mall are all within walking distance of 2 blocks. Walmart is a 5 minute drive. And there are so many eating establishments within 5-8 minutes driving!
We will be back this summer. Thanks again, Kari!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"After working in the area for over a month, I found Kari’s place my last week of our stay. My only regret is we didn’t find this place sooner!
It was perfect for our location, had everything we needed to cook, relax and feel comfortable while away from home.
The location was perfect for going to the store, dining and entertainment!
I will be staying here again hands down when I return to North Platte!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My coworker and I stayed for a week in town. Amazing home right in the middle of everything. Incredible renovation of the all rooms inside, the kitchen was my favorite. Amazing host, would recommend to anyone looking for an air bnb in north platte!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! This house was perfect for us and our two kids- and central location. Cute decor and comfy couches to lounge and relax. We have a family in north Platte and it was nice to have a space for ourselves while we visited- Kari was very responsive to questions too.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place. It’s like a bungalow. It is beautifully decorated. I have three requirements that I like for AirBnb. 1) The bed was comfortable. 2) There was a good shower. 3) The environment was comfortable and safe. This place met all that.
There are two good-sized bedrooms. One had a king sized bed and the other had the queen sized bed. I stayed in the queen bedroom. Also, the rooms had ceilings fans. The living room had a flat screen tv with Roku. The kitchen was stocked with enough pots and pans to make simple dishes. The bathroom had nice fluffy towels.
I would like to come back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a nice clean place.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a comfortable and cozy place to stay. Kari is a great host and has thought of everything to make us feel at home. No complaints at all! The previous reviews are accurate.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was my 1st time to use an app such as AirBnB, so I had lots of dumb questions, which Kari always responded to quickly and politely.
I stayed at Kari's place for almost 3 weeks for work and it was great to come ""home"" after working all day as opposed to a sterile hotel room, really helped me to relax.
Kari's place was clean and fresh, the cold water bottles and snacks on the table were a nice touch as I had just made a 10 hr drive to get there.
The neighborhood was quiet, which I appreciated as I always had computer work to do after I completed my work on site. There are several restaurants in the area and some you can walk to if you desire.
If I have the opportunity to work in North Platte again then I will certainly try to stay here again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time staying at Kari's place. The home is well maintained, clean, comfortable and has everything you would typically need for an extended stay.
Check-in was easy. Kari provided water in the refrigerator and a few snacks. She also recommended some local restaurants and coffee shops ... a few we checked out and they were good. Dave's Place for pizza and beer during a Nebraska football game was fun. :)
We needed a week in North Platte to take care of some family business and Kari's place worked our well again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Solid location, and felt totally at home, especially with Albert (Einstein) on the wall and other city 🏙️ accouterments! When you stay, be careful with the curtains as none of them liked us very much. Wonderful part of town for being picked up, going places, and just generally being able to live comfortably without a rental car - likely even better during Nebraskaland DAYS!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was our second stay at Kari’s place. We enjoyed it and look forward to her hospitality again in the future.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were only there for a couple of nights, but the accommodations we were looking for fit our needs.

Other hosts should take notes from Kari! One do the best experiences i have had ! The basket throw blanket holder, I wanted to throw in my trunk 😂.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My son and I stayed a week at Kari’s location in North Platte. It was very comfortable and cute.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kari has a real nice place. It is clean, well maintained and it is apparent that she has worked to make it comfortable and welcoming to guests. Kari’s was always available when I reached out to her with a few questions.
Her home has everything you need for a short or long stay. When we arrived in January it had recently snowed and it was very nice to see the driveway had been shoveled, the steps had been cleared, the front door light was on, and the home was warm and welcoming.
Thank you, Kari, for a very nice stay. I expect to make trips to North Platte occasionally and I certainly hope I can stay at you place again. 😊"

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very interesting old home a convenient walk to downtown. Only one major deficiency. This 19th century house was, like most, not built with closets. What it really needs is hooks installed in all the bedrooms so guests can hang up their clothing."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location wasn't bad. A bit industrial but walking distance to food. The house, however, was spectacular. Built in 1882 and furnished with vintage everything, it transported you in time back to a bygone era. Amazing stay and highly recommended."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was great for our small family gathering! Laurie had everything we needed and was happy to answer my many questions! We would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This large Italianate Victorian has so many all original details in fine shape that it is a wonder to simply wander around the place and look. Sort of magical. Yet there are up to date bathrooms and kitchen facilities. These updates have been incredibly creative in their execution. We had a great one night experience here. Hope to check in again in the future.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Laurie was very accommodating for our stay which was last minute. The home has everything needed and the beds are incredibly comfortable.

2022-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"This beautiful historic Home served our purpose well. The first floor is amazing. Lovely 1880’s restoration. So much room for a gathering! We had 5 people and had tons of room downstairs. The upstairs bedrooms are rather small and there’s a pretty long flight of stairs to get to the bedrooms. If you can do the stairs, the beds were high but very comfortable.
We ate at Luigi’s in town. The shrimp risotto- wow! Delicious!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is stunning. This historic property has been restored recently and is so elegantly done. As other reviewers have noted, the photos don’t do the property justice. The house is enormous, spotless, tastefully decorated, comfortable, and there was more than enough space for a party of 4 (and more if your party is larger). Beds are very comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked. The house is a 2-minute walk to the historic downtown canteen district and a great coffee shop. This house is a gem and we would stay again in a heartbeat."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful and interesting home. Not really suited for small children or people who have mobility difficulties as the bedrooms are all upstairs.

2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"We did not have a restful stay here. At bedtime we discovered that there was no top sheet on the bed - only a heavy duvet. We roasted at first, then, fortunately used a light blanket we travel with, as we could not locate a top sheet anywhere. The property needs some care: stains on the carpet, a torn lamp shade, clocks that don't work. The table chair I sat in was so loose that I feared it would collapse. The front steps are steep and shallow and a hazard - and also largely unpainted and down to bare wood. The house did appear to be clean, though the sheets were dark and patterned and not white, so we couldn't tell about the bedding"

I had mentioned that we might be on our motorcycles, and Shane left a key for access to the garage. weather was bad so we didn't have to use but will definitely stay here on our next trip when on the bikes. Great place for the price. overall I give place 4/5 stars. side note: if you are 6 foot tall and above you will love the shower."

Shane & Tina were super quick to respond and cheerfully accommodated our late arrival. We were especially pleased with the shower; my husband is 6'4"" and he often has to crouch down in rental showers. This one was sized appropriately for tall people, so if that's you definitely stay here!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute older home. Was very clean! Front stairs to get into the home might be difficult for people with mobility issues. Shane was great and even had the home ready for us early!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was charming and super clean. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. The house has everything you need. My bed was very comfortable. My friend considered hers too soft. Shane states in the listing the house has stairs you must be able to maneuver. I would underline this if you have any mobility or balance issues. the top stair/landing is shallow. Normal mobile people would not notice the difference but it was an issue for my cane toting friend.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A GREAT place to stay! We walked in and immediately said ""oh this is so cute!"". It's modern and spacious and clean and very adorable. There's a driveway that will fit 2 cars, and even a garage to use, though we didn't. The backyard is a HUGE perk! It has privacy fence on two sides and chain link on the alley side. There's a grill and a fire pit area and patio furniture. We played soccer in the yard. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. We saw many kids out playing and walking and roller skating. Not far from the high school. The house is clean and roomy. A/C worked great.
The host was SUPER accommodating. Actually, they couldn't have been more accommodating if they tried...so understanding and easy to deal with. Very communicative, and gave me all the check in info I needed before I even asked for it
We've booked this for our return trip too. A well deserved 5 star review from this happy traveler."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shane & Tina’s place was the perfect “home base” for both finding my son a place to live ahead of his new job and exploring the area. Centrally located, quiet neighborhood, room to spread out our maps and brochures, and comfortable beds to get us rested for the next day’s adventures! An excellent use of space with a kitchen ready for cooking meals or storing leftovers, and for making coffee or tea in the morning to enjoy on the back patio."

Definitely could have stayed in it longer. :)"

The beds were soft and comfortable, and the kitchen had all of the utensils/other items we needed to prep dinner and breakfast the next day. We also got to park our car in the garage instead of the driveway or on street parking like I've had to do with other similarly priced air bnbs.

There was a noise from the refrigerator that took some getting used to, but all in all, it was a nice place to rest and super clean with lots to offer."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Since we were in town for a birthday celebration and in charge of a lot of food, we needed a kitchen and refrigerator leading us to an airbnb. The kitchen had all the essential dishes, utensils, and pans. We liked the openness of the living room/dining room/kitchen area. The stairs to the front door might be of concern to some with less sure footing. There were a few other concerns that kept us from giving a five-star review, but we feel confident that Shane will correct these things once brought to his attention as they are easy fixes that will make his place even more comfortable."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We arrived late. The coded door entry was easy and the directions sent regarding where our rooms were located was understandable. King-size bed was comfortable/softer, the room with the queen and full had stiffer beds. Clean linens and bath towels were readily available and there were even bottles of water available in our rooms. Appreciated access to Disney+ and there were a few other streaming platforms. We enjoyed talking with Mark in the morning and petting their dog."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Mark and Muriel were wonderfully warm and welcoming and saw to our every comfort. Such nice people, we would have loved to have time to get to know them better!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was an immaculately clean and comfortable home for an overnight while driving cross country. The owners were very helpful and friendly. As a bonus I got to soak in a claw foot tub after a long day of driving! Heartily recommend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect pit-stop for a night while driving across the country. Just what I needed.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stop on my cross country trip, truly the “Outback” sans the kangaroo!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had the chance to stay at this place twice, and both times were truly enjoyable. It's worth noting that this is a shared residence, and Mark and Muriel, the hosts, are incredibly welcoming and experienced. They really know how to make guests feel at home. During our second stay, the atmosphere was so warm and inviting that it felt like we were staying with close family. The space was perfect for my kids, and the room itself was cozy and comfortable. The beds were particularly comfortable, and the room had blackout curtains that made sleeping in a breeze. One of our favorite features was the large clawfoot bathtub, which I used to give my daughter a bath. To top it off, I even got to enjoy watching Sunday night football with Mark while drinking some whiskey I brought along, which was a nice surprise."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great host, nice and friendly. Nice clean house, in the country.
Thank you"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Checkin was a breeze with the coded door. The whole place was extremely clean and spotless. The bed and pillows were comfy.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Muriel's house was absolutely fantastic. Checking in was a breeze, and there was plenty of room for my family. What really impressed us was the attention to detail. If the room felt a bit chilly, there was a convenient space heater at hand. Plus, they had power strips right next to the bed for charging devices – a small but thoughtful touch.
Muriel was incredibly responsive, and she quickly addressed all our messages. The property itself is just beautiful, with its lush green lawns, towering trees, and a peaceful, quiet atmosphere that's perfect for relaxation.
The beds were not only large but also incredibly comfortable. After a long day of driving, I slept really well. I can already say with certainty that the next time I visit my family in Nebraska, I'll be booking a stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home in a lovely location that suited our needs perfectly. Would absolutely stay again if I returned to Nebraska!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,perfect place for just passing through!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I'm an Airbnb regular, and this was a real treat!! It's a beautiful home, comfortable rooms and beds, very clean, thoughtful amenities. I hope to return! Highly recommend"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Muriel was very responsive & I was very grateful since her place appeared booked up from when I first communicated with her... However she made some accomodations that permitted me to book it & I was so grateful! (As I know I could not have made it any further that night toward Colorado, on my trip to the West Coast).
A truly lovely home with every detail thought of. I especially love the welcome greeting she had in the bedroom which was very beautiful and touching about travelers' journeys through life.
The front porch was great to sit on and listen to the train whistle and watch the sunset... And walking my dogs in the evening, listening to the Friday night high school football announcer ""Touchdown Sutherland Sailors!""...what a lovely, small town America experience.
**I recommend this Airbnb**
Muriel even told me about an amazing fenced, luscious dog park nearby that I was able to take my furry girls to, prior to checking in!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"They are so great! If I ever go back to that state, we will definitively stay with them. They went above and beyond to accommodate us as we didn’t arrive on time to the day we booked. They were so kind to still allow us to stay with them. They were so welcoming and we slept for 10hrs straight. So grateful for them and their hospitality. Again, thank you so so much! Praying many blessings upon your household!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay in Sutherland. Muriel and Mark were very hospitable, welcoming, and friendly. Also had great chats with Mark. Would definitely stay again if we pass through the area. Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean and comfortable place to land 1/2 way home. We needed a place to rest and get sone sleep. Beds were great and accommodations were exactly what we needed."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay for the price. Comfortable and hosts were really nice.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Muriel's place was a very convenient and relaxing spot for the night about a mile off of I-80. Much better than stopping at a motel. We even got to watch the Monday night football game with Mark!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kind and thoughtful people, will make it my goto place traveling through I-80."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place! We loved everything and the brewery was amazing. Host was responsive and accommodating. House was well stocked, clean and comfy."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our preferred place to stay when driving across Nebraska. A short walk to the excellent Pal's brewery which is a great place for refreshments after a long day on the road.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The ""cabin"" is beautiful inside and directions provided by Mendy were spot on. A busy street is next to it through the overgrown trees, so traffic noise gets pretty loud, but that is no fault of Mendy. It's comfortable and relatively private."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay very clean almost everything was brand new! Highly recommend and Pals Brewing was so good staff was on point the owner was a great host and pineapple ale was favorite
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our overnight stop at Wendy’s place! We thought it made for a much better stop than any hotel ever could!!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to rest for the night while on a road trip. Can't beat walking to Pal's for pizza and a great selection of beer.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was our first stay at an Airbnb and it surpassed our expectations. We will definitely be doing it again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in North Platte. Everyone was very friendly and it felt like we were at home. The Pals house was nice and cozy. Plenty of open space. The black out shades were nice so we could sleep in. It was just outside of town but close to everything. The meal voucher and wooden nickels for drinks to Pal's was great to have so we could check it out. The pizza was awesome and the staff was very attentive like they know us for years. I would recommend staying here to anyone who wanted to visit North Platte.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a great stay, and we loved the atmosphere at Pals! Good beer! Good food! Good service! And we loved being able to walk there. It was a beautiful walk!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mendy’s place was exactly what we needed!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was perfect for our one night stay when we were passing through North Platte on our way to Wyoming. We usually visit Pal’s Brewery on our trips and it was nice to be within walking distance!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My mom and I came to North Platte to see Prairie Chickens. My mom was very nervous about what to expect from an Air BnB as she has never stayed in one. We arrived late and it was cold and windy, we were tired. The little house was just perfect, we felt right at home and it was cozy. We had a good night's sleep and got up early to see the prairie chickens, which was amazing. We talked about how we wished we were staying longer so we could enjoy the cabin longer! Pal's was also wonderful. We plan on coming back next year to see the cranes and maybe stay a little longer."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Mattress needs to be replaced. Two people cannot sleep on that bed unless they like being on top of each other in the middle. I had to move to the daybed.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another great stay at the McNeil house!
Dinner and brews at Pals was great as well. We stocked up on some crowlers for the rest of our trip.
Thanks Mendy!!!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place. Cute, quiet - perfect little get away!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay here. I loved it so much I had to go back. I can’t imagine staying anywhere else while in North Platte. The cottage is so cute, comfortable and cozy. I loved the wooded setting so much. It’s truly hard to leave. Even though it’s on a lot with another house and on a busy road, it feels so private and the traffic dies down to practically nothing at night.The food voucher and beer tokens for Pals brewing is such a nice perk. The food and the beer is so good, but the standout is the staff. So kind, so efficient. I loved talking with them! I can’t wait to come back. Such a great little place."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our third stay at Mendy’s place, and it did not disappoint. It is the perfect overnight stop on the way to our family ski vacations with plenty of room for us to spread out after a day of driving. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The only thing was it snowed while there and a shovel would be nice to get to or vehicle. Other than that it was a wonderful place to stay and would highly recommend to anyone
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a find! I love to visit Nebraska, and wanted to find an alternate place to stay, besides a hotel. This was the first listing that showed up in my Air B and B search and I knew it would be perfect. And it was. Spotlessly clean, well appointed, a secluded feeling location and the most comfortable bed! I loved my stay, and hope to return very soon as the weather didn’t exactly cooperate with my plans this time. Oh and the proximity to Pals Brewing (with tokens for beer and a voucher for food) was the icing on the cake. Great beer and pizza and wonderful people. There truly is no place like Nebraska."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mendy's place was the perfect getaway for a quick working weekend. She was flexible with check-in and the house was clean and just as advertised. We will definitely be staying again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at the McNeil house. Once again super pleased & happy with our stay and everything associated with it. House was clean, neat & tidy. Mendy is a very kind and responsive host. Our plans had changed, she allowed us to check in a few hours before check-in time, which worked great for our schedule. Love the place & will totally recommend the Bed & Brew to anyone looking for a quiet, comfy, just like home place to stay while visiting North Platte. The food voucher & drink tokens to Pals, adds icing to the already great deal. We will definitely be staying at the McNeil house again"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little hidden gem. the brewery down the road was very convenient. Definitely will rent again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, felt very private. We walked to Pals Brewery and were treated to Trivia Night where we placed 4th!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One bedroom, spacious living/eating area. We stopped into Pal's and food and beers were great! Easy to find even though it was very dark."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay at Mendy's place, and as usual, it was perfect."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great relaxing stay for a quick weekend getaway. Great friends met us for a great time at Pals.
Thanks"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My group and I love this listing! We stayed here a couple years back and loved it, so of course, when we found ourselves back in the area, we knew we had to stay here again. Definitely be sure to check out Pal’s Brewery as well, right nearby and plenty of delicious brews on tap!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice private setting, easy to find and get in, has everything we needed, host is accommodating and responsive. Will return!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was our second stay at this Airbnb. We were just as pleased as the first stay. It is a very comfortable & private place. We’d come again … and again!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome as usual!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love this AirBNB and brewery. Great experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great little cabin. It was perfect for my husband and me as a one-night layover on our was home for Colorado. In fact, we're inspired to go back to the area in the fall for a Know West Nebraska tour.
It's owned by the people who run a micro brewery that is only .2 miles away. While that's close enough to walk to, the brewery wasn't so close that you noticed traffic or noise while at the cabin. The cabin even had some discounts for the brewery.
The host was helpful with directions and instructions. We didn't need to have further contact with her. What contact we did have was great.
The cabin was clean and had great amenities. It was decorated in a very cute fashion. We'll probably ask to stay there again if we go back in the fall."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was clean, honey and very close to the brewery, although too cold to walk. Mendy was great and for a small family of 2-4, this place works great! 1 bathroom attached to only bedroom is why we say 1 small family, which was perfect for myself and my husband. The only thing I would say is that for the price, we shouldn’t have had to clean anything. But this is a general issue with Air BNB that there is a ‘cleaning fee’ as a part of the cost, but you still have to do a lot of the general cleaning yourself."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stop-over at Mendy’s place. It’s super easy to find, extremely clean and comfortable and Mendy was on point with all of the helpful information, both within the app as well as having published guides inside for additional reference. Loved it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved staying here and we'll definitely be back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mendy was going to be out of the country during our visit and went above and beyond to communicate how to contact her if we needed anything. McNeil House Bed and Brew is sparkling clean, right on a walking trail and just a couple blocks from Pal's Brewery. The $20 voucher for food and the free craft beer wooden nickels really offset the cost and make it a great value."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have been back several times. Wonderful place!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The listing made it sound like it was right next to the Pals Brewery. It was down the road a bit. At night and after a recent snowstorm, we didn't see the sidewalk across the road from the brewery or we'd have walked. Still, the place was fantastic, especially when compared with staying in a motel. The brews, pizza and service at the conveniently close brewery are excellent! I highly recommend this place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If it's available, THIS is where I stay when I go back to NP. Period! There's nothing better than having a morning coffee on the patio, inhaling the fresh air and watching nature do its thing. It is a mental and physical recharge cubed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"perfect spot to have for a few days, very clean and has everything you need, excellent location as well"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved the place. Great communication, super clean and would stay here again."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to find, private, and had everything we needed!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Pal's food voucher and wooden nickels for drinks was much appreciated. Firewood is not provided for the fire ring as is depicted in the photos. Only suggestion for improvement would be to soften at least one mattress with a foam topper as both beds are very firm. Great location for outdoor seclusion, but still very conveniently located to local attractions."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house was just right! Cute and clean and so well equipped! Comfy for the two of us, and we liked eating at Pals brewery! Thanks for hosting us, Mendy!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love the place and loved pals!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I've stay there several times and am looking forward to go back already. Relaxing place with great pizza and beer next door at Pal's! Looking forward to my next trip!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful little house. The house was nicely decorated and the area was quiet and peaceful.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was fun to be near the Pals brewery, and we also enjoyed many activities in town, with the cabin as a great home base. It was roomy, nicely decorated, well-equipped, and very private."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great! Mendy was very responsive and helpful answering all my questions before our stay. The house was very clean and cozy.

This cabin is clean, well maintained and comfortable. Expectations and instructions were clear not requiring any phone calls. Thank you for a great stay! Until next time…."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a very enjoyable stay here! It was a quick overnight and the home was perfectly located along our route. Entry was very easy and it was stocked with all of the basic necessities. The bed was comfortable and the shower had very good water pressure! We truly loved being so close to Pal’s Brewery, which is where we enjoyed a yummy pizza for dinner and tried several different brews! The owners of this AirBnB went above and beyond by providing us with a $20 meal voucher and 4 drink tokens to Pal’s! Super nice!! Whether you’re visiting North Platte, NE or just passing through and need a cozy cabin to stay, I highly recommend this place!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our weekend stay at Pals Bed and Brew. The open concept made it feel spacious. The tasteful decorating made it feel comfortable and homey. It’s like a cabin in the woods with modern amenities! We really appreciated how clean it was. The day bed/trundle would be perfect for a couple grandkids. And although we didn’t use the washer/dryer, it was nice to know it was there! It’d be a great stopover for travelers on their way to another destination. North Platte itself has fun shopping and restaurants.
The short walk to Pals Brewing Company was a bonus!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Having stayed at SO many homes that were in wooded areas this is the ONLY place we’ve stayed in; a beautiful area such as this, surrounded by trees that has been completely immaculate! Every corner in the home is absolutely spotless! We were so impressed and pleased with our stay!
We felt right at home and definitely enjoyed the PALS pizza and homemade brew! Delicious!😋
Wish we could’ve stayed longer! We hope to be back soon!
Highly, highly recommend!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in North Platte. we wish we would have found this sooner as we have had to make several trips to this area in the last three years. Bonus is Pals Brewery walking distance! Best service ever! Great beer and food. A great find!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The little cabin was so cute! We sat on the front porch that evening and enjoyed a rain shower. Very cute and cozy. It was our first time using a rental like that. The swing on the property wasn’t accessible due to overgrowth. But we enjoyed the porch. Would definitely stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mendy really put it together nice with this airbnb. She’s communicative, helpful, and makes you feel right at home. Not to mention the level of effort that went into the house. It’s fully loaded with no detail spared!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, quiet and private little place. The brewery is what grabbed my attention from the website and glad it did, because the food and beers were just what we needed after a day on the road. Thanks for allowing us to stay!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mendy’s place was the perfect stop on our road trip. It was super clean and comfortable. We loved how it felt tucked away in a wooded oasis. The walking path to Pals was great and gave us a chance to stretch our legs. The food and drink vouchers for Pals made the stop even better! We will recommend this spot to anyone we know passing through or wanting a great little getaway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. We love PAL’s Brewery!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I were on our way to Colorado and were looking for a place to stay. Less than an hour from North Platte, I contacted Mendy through the ap requesting to reserve the cabin. In less time than it took to stop at a rest stop, Mendy responded to us and we had a place to stay. We were very pleased how clean the cabin was. It was very comfortable and we felt right at home. We took advantage of the voucher and wooden nickels for the Pals Brewing Company and enjoyed the pizza and craft beer. Overall, the stay was far more satisfying than any of the local hotels (which we have stayed at in the past) could have been. Thank you"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy, clean space, short walk to a fabulous brew pub - sunshine, happy people, little kids laughing, excellent beer, a sunset and a 5 minute walk home. What's not to love?"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house great brewery. Vegetation was a little overgrown making it a little messy loading and unloading the car. Also little disappointed in the coffee option largely because the food and drink at PALs is top notch and the coffee wasn’t. Everything else was lovely. Thanks for the rental.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was very clean and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house to stay in. Very clean. Easy to get to and find. Right down the road from a Pals Brewery which is a local brewery with good beer and food!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot for overnight stay as we made our way West. Space was perfectly laid out and felt spacious even for its smaller size. The best part of our stay though was Pal’s Brewing Company. Food was great and the beer selection and taste was top-notch! So glad we found this place.
The only con I have was the mattress in the bedroom could’ve been better. Woke up with a sore back but it wouldn’t keep me from staying there again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Thank you!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would absolutely stay again!!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely LOVED our stay! The house accommodations were perfect for our young family, and we especially enjoyed our evening over at Pals Brewing. Our 2YO ran around and made friends, we enjoyed the food and beers and even left with a growler of our favorite! Perfect landing spot for a night on our road trip home to MN. We would make a special trip back to North Platte for this spot."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect!! We were traveling to Colorado from the Chicago suburbs and this made for a perfect stopping point/overnight for us! It was exactly as explained and the brewery was wonderful. We would definitely recommend this over the local hotels- much better bang for your buck!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Quiet and cozy, loved the brewery with great atmosphere, food and drink! Will be staying here again!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little wooded setting in the middle of the crops.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place & location!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very clean, comfortable and enjoyable stay. Property is as described and well stocked with all the necessary amenities. Pre-arrival check-in instructions were clear and expectations for the use and care of the property were laid out in detail. No issues with check-in or the property so we had no reason for direct communication with Mendy but have no doubt it would have been responsive if needed. Food and drink vouchers provided for their brewery were welcome. Due to a scheduled event, brewery was packed the evening of our arrival so we elected to utilize the vouchers for lunch after our check-out. Brewery staff was friendly and very accommodating."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a cute little place that felt like you were secluded. It was very clean and had lots of things we used. I would recommend this place.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the second time we have stayed at this location. It is great distance to Pals Brewery. It is a cute little cottage! Highly recommend!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting North Platt for a few days and I was happy to find a place that gave us more room than a local hotel.
Mendy was a great host. We had no problems finding the place and checking in and out process was simple and well communicated.
I wanted to take advantage of the fire pit but was unable to but hopefully next time we can.
There is a coffee maker with someK cups, along with sugar and creamer.
Kitchen are was stocked and available if we wanted to use it.
Pals Brewery was a short drive and served pub like food. Salad and pizza were great. Customer service was excellent. Event Admission is free with stay ( check the event calendar on Pal’s page)
The room darkening blinds and separate bedroom entrance was two things that stood out for me. Once I finally woke up i was able to go for a walk without disturbing my daughter asleep in the front room.
I will definitely book this property for our next visit to North Platt/Maxwell area."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Love this place! This is where I stay when I visit North Platte. See you next time!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So handy to stay here and walk to Pal’s!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For those who love breweries and traveling and Air BnB’s…this place is heavenly! Midway between Iowa and Denver so perfect for cross country travelers. House was fabulous, roomy, comfy. Brewery was fantastic and walking distance. Mendy was responsive and flexible. Could not ask for more!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love this place.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place! Extremely clean! Had everything we needed.

We had a hard time getting in with the given code, but Mendy answered our call and walked us through the issue."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay. The place was spacious and very clean. We were just passing through on our way back from Colorado, but wished we could have stayed longer. Also Pals Brewpub was awesome. Get the baked cheese curds.
Yumm!!"

Quiet and relaxing.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pal's Bed and Brew was exactly as pictured and met our expectations! We enjoyed our beer tokens and bought a crowler to take home.
A nice little resting spot to stay when venturing to North Platte to see the sandhill crane migration."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Booked this as part of a road trip as it was half way on our journey. Perfect size for myself and my wife. A short walk to Pals for dinner and a drink. Then a good nights rest in a quiet comfortable home. We’ll definitely come back when we road-trip this way again. And may even make a long weekend just to come here and make full use of the amenities it offers!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a cute little place! I hope to get back there in the summer so I can use the fire pit and spend a little more time there. I wanted to go to Pal's Brewery (just out the back door and across the street), but they had an hour wait, and I was very hungry, so I went somewhere else, but that is also on my list of things to do for next time. Thanks, Mendy, for such a nice place to stay while I was there to see the Sandhill Cranes and Prairie Chickens. :)"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Responsive host. Clean, private, and peaceful accommodations."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean little house in a nice wooded lot. Very quiet, has everything you need. The standout amenity is the nearby brewery and the food and beer tokens. The pickle beer was my favorite!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Mendy’s place on the way to a family ski trip. It worked so well the first time, we decided to do it again! Everything was just as we remembered (and as advertised).
We stopped into Pal’s for dinner (thanks for the voucher and wooden nickels). Everyone enjoyed their food—my husband and I shared a smoked pork shoulder and sauerkraut pizza, which was amazing!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was great being a bit rural, but within walking distance of the brewery and the discounts there were a nice bonus . It was nice to have a carport to park under. The cabin was very clean and comfortable. We had a only a short stay so didn’t really need to use the well-appointed kitchen. It was helpful to leave our car lights on so we could see to work the lock box to get in."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice cozy place! also very clean.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great - right across the street from Pal's Brewery. It is very clean, and decorated, and has a feeling of privacy although you are near another house. It is woodsy and comfy! The bed was not as firm as we prefer but it was definitely sleepable. Guests have a washer/dryer and a full kitchen. a cute front porch. Much better than staying in a hotel! My mother-in-law who lives in assisted living in North Platte really enjoyed it as well - and the bonus of certificates to the brewery. I recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and a nice private getaway with great brewery beer and pizza across the road. Perfect!

Easy access to town and highways and sights in North Platte. We felt at home here and would stay again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You have to stay at this place!!! Excellent accommodations! After driving 9 hours from Utah, the McNeil House was such a great place to end the day. We had an excellent dinner at Pals Brewery which is just a short walk from the property. The service was awesome and we had quite a good meal. Try the Pals Chicken Chorizo Nachos and the Twisted Buffalo Pizza. Both are super delicious!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a lovely place to stay! The addition of access to Pals really drives home this experience. It’s a perfect quiet get away.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mendy's AirBnB was clean & well appointed. Our stay was a quick one so we didn't really have the opportunity to enjoy all the amenities. Would recommend this to others; food & drink at the brew house was certainly welcomed after a long day on the road!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mendy's little house was just perfect!! It's bigger in person than in the photos, but still just a cozy and quaint place to stay. Loved the perk of getting beer and food vouchers to Pal's just down and across the way. Everything was clean and orderly. The guestbook was a cute touch. Self check-in was a breeze. We can't wait to stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a perfect stay! The perfect lodging that supports local people and business. The bnb had every amenity and the private porch on a rainy morning swaddled in thick blankets was perfect, not to mention being a walking distance from Pal’s and the yummy beer and company that awaited there (and yay for the free drinks and voucher!). As a newcomer to North Platte, this was the right way to do it."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at the McNeil house. The interior was fresh, clean, and had everything we could have needed. We love the close proximity to Pals were we enjoyed our beer and food tokens. The meal and service was great!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed at BnBs before but this was our first Airbnb experience so wasn't sure what to expect especially since it was a last minute find.
Instuctions were On-Point and no difficulty with directions or key retrieval upon arrival.
We were smitten at first glance at the cabin and surrounding area.
Upon opening the door, this adorable & cozy cabin becomes a personal oasis that is stocked to fill most needs, full kitchen, the shower is amazing with thick towels, and when morning comes, you will Not want to leave the luxury of the queen bed!
Wooden Nickels and a food voucher for Pals await as a welcome touch of unique hospitality.
We certainly felt very spoiled with a 5-Star first Airbnb experience.
Don't forget to sign the Guest Book so you can add your applause and coudos for this endearing little cabin in the woods.
McNeil House Bed n Brew will certainly be on our itinery for future trips!"

We used our nickels and voucher for Pal's. What a neat place! Definitely stop by there if you're in North Platte.
Thanks so much! Hope to go back again one day!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I truly do love this home - the layout, furnishings and location are all perfect for us. This was our second stay at this rental and our third year in a row visiting North Platte. The rental is very close to Golden Spike Tower and it is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with great sidewalks for walking. This time I did encounter some cleanliness issues but spoke with the host and she assured me the issues will be addressed. If the housekeepers are doing a good job I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend renting this home."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great back yard for the dogs to run in and a safe clean spot for us to cozy up for the night on our long road trip! Definitely recommend this place!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing place! We are not ones who travel through NE often, we’re currently traveling on military orders and had to come through the area. This place was extremely affordable for our budget and went over and beyond what we imagined. With 3 rooms, my toddler got her own room where I sat up her pack n play, my 10 year old had her own room to video with her friends and my husband and I got to stay up later and plan the rest of our trip. We’re both big morning coffee people and Deb had plenty of k cups with a variety of little creams and sugars. The towels were displayed so nicely in each room. Very clean home, but still comfortable to relax in. Big back yard for kids or dogs to stretch and run. Safe neighborhood and not far from restaurants and stores. 10/10 loved. Kind of hope we have a reason to come back!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very great stay here, even though it was only 12 hours. We were passing through on a loooong road trip and it was excellent to get off the highway and be in a home vs hotel. The place was quiet, clean and comfy for humans and pets. The fenced yard is quite amazing for dogs, which we feel so thankful that this place allowed. If you don’t have pets with you I think you’d still find this home to be spotless. Deb is a great host, not too much or too little communication. Would absolutely stay again if staying in North Platte."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,So clean and SO SO easy to work with! Will forsure use her again!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Deb's house is as lovely as it appears in the photos. The kitchen had everything we needed. The fenced-in backyard is even bigger and better than expected- our dog LOVED it! My husband and I are finishing a cross-country trip and only stayed for 1 night. Although we didn't explore the area, the house is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood. We loved being able to pull into a large garage for the night. It was pouring rain the next morning- the garage made it so easy to pack our car! We would be happy to stay at Deb's again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Deb was wonderful! We appreciated the great communication when we had questions. Felt very comfortable with our children. We would definitely recommend!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Deb's place. Very nice quiet area and felt so homey. Deb was very welcoming and checked in with you to make sure everything went well. Would definetely stay here again!

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were three couples in North Platte to see the Sandhill crane migration. Deb’s place was perfect for our stay. The clean and spacious house is fairly new with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. We cooked our evening meals and found everything we needed in the well-equipped kitchen. Every time we reached out to Deb with a question , her response was practically immediate. She was so accommodating and helpful. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was huge, and for the price, is a great place to stay if there are a few of you. There were 3 bedrooms, and all of them had legit (no pullout) beds. The kitchen and living room were extremely spacious and there were board games for guests to enjoy. The bed and the sheets were very comfortable. The check in was easy and the garage is a great amenity to have and can fit 2 full sized cars. It is a great place to layover if you are thinking of stopping over in Nebraska."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay at Deb's place. The house is located on a cut-de-sac. Felt very safe. Coming in through the garage to unload was very helpful. House was very clean.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Stayed a few weeks for work and everything about this house made it feel like home. Pictures don’t give it justice definitely recommend for anyone to stay here. If I’m ever in town again this is where I’ll be staying.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Deb’s place was a solid 5 stars. It was homey and cozy. The pictures do it no justice. The master bedroom is beautiful and the bed is amazing. The garage is perfect for loading and unloading. We are very happy with our stay and will be staying there again when we are in town. Deb is a wonderful host!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debs place is so comfortable. It feels like home to our family of four when we come to North Platte. We have had extended family over for dinner and we felt like the open concept living room/kitchen allowed for a nice atmosphere. My kids, aged 11 and 13, enjoy having their own bedroom and feel very relaxed here."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, quiet neighborhood!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice home but a bit over the price I was hoping to pay for one night.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Deb was very accommodating and helpful before and during our stay! Next time we’re in town we’d definitely stay here again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary is an excellent host to work with and exceeded expectations. Her house is a convenient and cozy stay in North Platte.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay at, would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very clean, quiet and easy to access. Mary was very helpful with all inquiries"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,it's a quiet place I'd visit again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place was very nice (much better than it shows in the pics). All of the instructions were very clear and we really enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for the coffee.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"very good place , we will definitely be back"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Spacious and convenient! Host was responsive and welcoming.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Mary was very nice and helped us get inside because we didn't understand exactly. Turns out that even though its a basement rental, you enter on the main floor in the back. And the 2nd locked door is inside.
The inside was roomy and clean, though not necessarily pristine. It was nice to have a full size refrigerator so no issues with needing more space. No ice maker, but plenty of ice trays. A working dehumidifier. A small but working tv.
Microwave. We didn't use the oven or stove.
There's a table with chairs for 4.
A full size bed in one bedroom, which has a door to the bathroom, and a queen and a full size in the other bedroom. The bathroom has 2 doors so is accessible to all areas. Everything was clean to our satisfaction and had a homey feel... not hotel like. We like that. Wall heaters in each area for desired comfort. Beds were comfortable enough. The place had one extra ""fire""- escape - an egress window. And no bugs!
All in all, we do recommend the place."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This place was a quick stop for us. The hosts were very communicative and it was easy to find. The only thing I would say is that the beds are uncomfortable.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Nice host but the airbnb wasn’t clean to my expectations
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for 5 days and enjoyed our stay. This house had all the essentials for life. The hosts were responsive and provided with everything they needed
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Mary’s was a great place she was fantastic and the house was amazing. Would definitely recommend.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very roomy, perfect for our extended stay. Nice quiet location. Would stay again."
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"The place definitely needs a good deep clean. The host was nice and responded quickly to any messages. If someone is staying in the house above, you can hear them moving about constantly, unfortunately that did not work well for my work schedule. The stairs to get to the basement apartment are steep and there is a shared washer and dryer; other tenants would leave their clothes in for days. And there was a bug problem, mainly ants and spiders, ants being the worst. The apartment is large and spacious, but you can hear random noises (bangs and pops) from the pipes at all different times of the day."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was our 2nd time staying here and this time we stayed in the basement. It was big enough for our family. It was equipped with basic necessities. Although we did see ants in the bathroom and the rooms. We were gone majority of the day and evening, basically just there to sleep. But heard running around early on in the morning. Overall it was good and had no trouble getting in or communicating with Mary."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Mary is a fantastic host, the location was clean and very comfortable. Felt like a home away from home."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good property for the price. We stayed 2 nights and worked perfect for us. Only suggestion would be to have a quick clean before the check in.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just as described, great place to stay"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, great location. Wonderful host!"
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"This listing had potential, but in the end we only stayed one of the two nights we planned. The house is easy to find, plenty of parking, the lawn is nice, and entry was easy. However, as soon as we walked in there was a washer and dryer (listed for use) covered with laundry and no detergent available. Then when we got to the basement it looked like no one had been down there in months. There were tons of dead (and some living) bugs all over the floors. The table was dirty, and the bathroom sink had hair all over it, even the night stand had layers of dust on it. Thankfully the refrigerator, toilet, shower and sheets seemed clean, which were the only reasons we stayed the first night (that and the fact we came in very sleep deprived and put the baby right to sleep.) However, with a crawling baby, we weren’t willing to stay the second night as we didn’t want him anywhere near those floors. Mary’s communication was poor. It took her at least 3 hours to respond any time I reached out. And then she said she would approve a refund for the second night and did not. There are even more issues that he I’m not listing, but ultimately, I do not recommend this listing at all."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is as advertised. Very roomy and the location is convenient to anything in North Platte. If you are looking for luxury, this is not the place for you, but It does provide all necessities.
Convenient parking space, well lit, right at entrance. It is a basement apartment, so you do have steep stairs to navigate. However, the stairs are large, easy to see, and very sturdy, as is the handrail.
Wi-Fi works great, and communicating with the host is easy.
I was here for 45 days. It was perfect for what I needed. I would definitely stay again!"
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Worked good for our situation.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,nothing
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Everything as advertised.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary’s place was clean and spacious. We enjoyed staying there!
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Very close to the exit off of route 81. It was a convenient place to stay, also close to Walmart and a gas station."
2021-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place to stay in a quiet but convenient area. Mary’s communication was great and the check-in/check-out process was flexible and easy.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely place- note: has steep stairs to access. Very spacious. Sweet walk around the neighborhood.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A very nice place to stay. very cool in the heat of the summer and plenty of space.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"A comfortable, clean place to stay on our way west to the National Parks."
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, this is a cute place and makes a nice stop if you’re traveling a long distance. It wasn’t clear that this was a basement apartment so we had a bit of a challenge finding the right door. Otherwise, it will suit your needs."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Homey Place provided all the comforts of home for me and my family of four. We stayed here while six additional family members stayed upstairs at Mary's place. There was plenty of space for everyone to spread out and relax. Both locations are a great value for the space provided.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Did just what we needed it to do!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location was great for our family while traveling through. Check-in was easy and quick. Mary was very helpful and allowed us a late checkout.
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here twice within the same week, a few days apart. The first time we stayed, the place was okay. It was cool, there is a dehumidifier running next to the kitchen sink, and no one was upstairs, so it was nice and quiet. The queen bed is as hard as a rock, so we had to move to the sofa. The posting claims that there is a sofa bed in the second bedroom, but there is not. The second time we stayed, the shower curtain smelled like pee and there were dirty and wet linens and towels in the washer when we arrived, so I had to remove those before starting the washing machine. I don't expect that the beds are given fresh comforters or blankets or that the spare blankets are washed after each guest. There is no cleaning fee charged, so I imagine that's why the price is better. I had to go knock on the door upstairs at 10:30 because my family was awakened by the kids staying upstairs. This wasn't the owner's fault by any means, but just know that you can hear all of the movement from upstairs. Overall, the place was good enough for a quick night's rest for my family of 6 after a few days of driving, but the cleaning is not thorough. Again, there is no cleaning fee involved so the value for the price was accurate. Mary was quick in responding and very willing to be available for assistance."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good location for travelers! We arrived late and left early. Rested well! Thank you for everything!
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Warm place, adorable decorations, very comfortable, quiet neighborhood, close to supermarket, gas stations, restaurants and I-80."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Mary’s space is just as described! Check-in process was very easy. Great option on our trip from CO to WI.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to lay our heads on our cross country trip. An hour or so from Lake Mac and in a town with a LOT of cool history (don’t miss Buffalo Bill’s Ranch or the Golden Spike!), Mary’s is indeed a homey and spacious gem. Easy check in, which was extra nice since we booked super last minute, safe neighborhood, quick drive to get coffee in the morning."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary's place was affordable and a great stop on our way to SD. The space was large and fit my family well enough. I would suggest a few folding chairs for eating around the table as there were only 4. I would also suggest a side table in the room with one bed as I needed a handy place for my glasses/phone. my kids loved this place as it was a ""maze"" and fun to ""explore"". Mary had excellent recommendations for food in the area as well."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Place is very nice and in a great location. Mary is a great host and responded to my questions quickly. Unfortunately previous guest had a dog so the place was covered in dog hair. Normally it wouldn't bother us but our youngest daughter is allergic. After extra cleaning we were able to enjoy our month long stay.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We stayed here for 3 month as a travel nurse for the local hospital. Mary’s place was great! We had a great time and even got to visit their place at the lake! So fun! The places has everything you’d need as a travel professional.
Will stay again in the future if we come back to NP"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary’s place was great. If you are coming to town to whitetail hunt, this place is spacious and clean. Super homey and comfortable."
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,There was 5 adults staying here. Great living room to gatherings. Plenty of room altogether. Will do it again
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic experience, quick, easy, and comfortable."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place for our family of 8. Soacious,clean & stylish"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great spacious area for our family. We were able to spread out and be comfortable. Also, a great area (neighborhood). Mary was very helpful and available when we had a question or needed something."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Stayed for 30 days. Perfect
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary was an excellent, responsive host. Her place was spacious enough to fit our extended family (6 adults, 3 kids/infant). It was perfect for an overnight stop during our road trip."
2019-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Nice place with plenty of room to relax as a family of six.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very nice house
In every way."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was perfect for my family of five. There was room for each of us to have space. The home is beautiful and perfectly clean. The check-in instructions were simple. We will be staying here again!
2019-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Best deal in town. We stayed a week and it had everything we needed and so much more than a typical hotel.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You will love Mary's place. She keeps it clean and tidy and is available to speak with and responds quickly. She cares about your stay and wants it to be a home away from home and that's how we felt. We loved it and our children loved it. Definitely will be staying here again. Thank you Mary!
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space for the price. Some nice, stylish upgrades and decorations. Not quite as clean or professional as a good hotel, but cleaner than my house! And much more space than you’d get for the same price at a hotel. Previous reviews mentioned linen issues. Everything looked clean to me, maybe just not folded or beds made as neatly as could be. We arrived very late but check in/out is completely flexible and self-serve so that was no problem. Quiet neighborhood. Good, quick, welcoming, gracious communication."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Accommodating hosts and a nice location. I wouldn't even consider a hotel if this home is available, for the price it's an 11/10."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice house in a nice neighborhood
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for a small group of people. It was a nice quiet neighborhood. Would recommend to other people!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay
2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a quick two day stay at Mary's place. Mary communicates very well, and has written instructions about amenities and features well placed. The home is easy to find with great parking. Kitchen is excellent and well stocked, coffee maker, toaster, large fridge, regular size oven. Great to have coffee and creamer ready for arrival. The basement apartment is very spacious, with lots of room to spread out if you have more than one or two. Furniture is comfortable, and as photos. Two beds in one bedroom and one bed in the second bedroom. There is a lovely two person swing to enjoy in the evenings. If you are traveling or on a road trip, particularly if you have kids, this is a great place to stop over."
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place, much nicer than the photos show. Lacking a few service touches (air wasn't on when we arrived so it was quite hot at first), but overall a great place for a large family to stay."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed overnight on a cross-country drive, and Mary’s house was a perfect place for our family of six to spend the night."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space! Plenty of room, great amenities and terrific value."
2018-12-01,4.0,Group trip,We met Mary and she where to go. we had a good time.
2018-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2018-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,My wife and I stayed in Mary's apartment for 2 months while I worked as a traveling nurse at Great Plains Health. Location was safe. Apartment was spacious. Wifi was good. I would not call it sparkling clean but OK. TV reception wasn't great if that is important. No ESPN. Only national news was CNN. Neighbors in apartment above could be noisy.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good place to stop for a quiet nights rest. Easy to find and good parking
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"great place, nice owner"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place our family of 7 to make a pit stop on our way out west. We got to make a quick visit out to Cody park, grab a bite at Qdoba then were all able to get a good nights sleep before hitting the road again bright and early. We would definitely stay there again... our only disappointment was not having more time to explore North Platte and the Cody Trafing Post... maybe next time!"
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This comfortable basement living space is lovely. The sleeping spaces are comfortable and very accommodating. And there is a very large living/dining/kitchen area. The décor is very inviting. We only had about ten hours to spend here on our way to Grand Teton, but it was a very welcome stay."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was very nice and clean and our host was very friendly and helpful!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary is an outstanding host and provides excellent accommodations. The house is nicely decorated with a great kitchen and living space, with lots of clean towels and extra blankets and pillows. She is quick to communicate with and responds to questions or need for assistance promptly. Will definitely be staying here again!"
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a nice spot with lots of room. It is kid friendly with games and comfy spots to hang out. Communication was good and I thought the neighborhood was really nice.
2018-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,had the essentials.
2018-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I did not feel safe here. There were no windows in the main bedroom. There were not any egress windows at all and they were very high. There was some sort of electrical cords plugged into the outlet in the main bedroom that ran underneath the carpet. I don't know what it went to, but it seemed very unsafe. There was a dirty wadded up towel in the linen closet and a used bar of soap in the shower. I don't think the bathroom was cleaned. The pillow in the main bedroom was missing a pillow case and the linen felt unwashed. It was the worst experience we've had on BnB and a disappointing way to end our vacation. We would have stayed at a hotel if we hadn't of gotten in so late. I wish I would have read through all of the reviews, because others had made comments about this. Some of the other reviews talk about a lake house. I don't think all of those reviews pertain to the house we stayed in. However, I do have to say that the host was responsive with communication via the app. We didn't meet the hosts when we got there. I am sure they are very nice people, but I wouldn't stay here or recommend it."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and her husband are exceptionally nice people and will take care of you and yours. If you need a place to stay in N. Platte call on them and you won’t be disappointed!!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and great location. Easy to walk around in a nice place.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot. Conveniently located. Very spacious. Recommended!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay! Just what we were looking for!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little basement with 2 bedrooms and 1 bath. The living room was perfect to hangout with friends and relax. If you have any questions there was no trouble with asking, Mary was super nice!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay!!!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Worked great!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Don’t miss this AWESOME Airbnb!!
2018-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"I really hate to write this, as you can tell they have put a lot of work into the place and did many things to make the place inviting (like a North Platte information binder), but I would not recommend staying here, primarily for safety reasons. We had some tidiness issues (not folded towels and linens, old, misshapen pillows, dirty coffee cups) but those could have been one-off oversights or us being too picky. The main issue is the fire safety. Most critically, there is no window in the main bedroom. The other windows in this basement suite are all above your head (we didn't measure but I'd guess the sill is about 6 feet off the ground). I looked up Nebraska code and each sleeping area should have a window that is no more than 44"" off the ground and has at least 5sqft of opening for above grade openings. With the window opened they might have that 5sqft but definitely not the 44 inches above the floor. We stayed there with my elderly in-laws. I don't know if I could have heaved myself up to those windows if the need had arisen, let alone my in-laws."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great people great house
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place, wonderful hosts! Reccomended 100%!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was super clean, great access to everything."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Where to start about Mary's place. First off the communication was easy & quick. We were greeted with a smile and a tour, which the place was new, clean & beautiful! Mary had a book full of Things To Do & Places to Eat which was very helpful. I would recommend Mary's Place to anyone staying in the area and we will be staying there again!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was clean and welcoming. It was easy to access, and communication with the host was clear and easy. Mary was very kind and thoughtful to our family. It was very appreciated after a long drive on the road. We'd happily stay again, and would easily recommend it."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot to stay if you’re making the trek out to Denver. Really private and lots of space!
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great style and spacious.
Not too far off the main strip.
Would stay there again.
Definitely enough room for 6."

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying here was amazing! The place was stylish, welcoming, and comfortable. Hoping to stay here again soon!"
2018-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"Mary has done a great job of refinishing and decorating this basement space and the price is right in a town with high hotel rates! The listing says that breakfast is provided at this writing, but Mary has discontinued that service. There is a grocery store close by. There are tenants in the upstairs of the house who were quiet overall, but you could hear their footsteps and their use of water/plumbing. There is an available washer/dryer in the entry way to the basement steps. We did discover the washer/dryer in use by another party during our stay. The friendly owners live next door."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house is very cozy and pretty. Host is very nice and very reachable. Fast at replying messages.
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An amazing place, only stayed for a night but I was blown away by their hospitality and home. They went the extra mile, in every aspect."
2018-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. Great host.
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay! Everything was perfect for our family of 2 adults and 4 children! There was more than enough room and the space was very homey! Mary was very hospitable and accommodating! We will definitely be in contact for our next visit!
2017-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our over all stay was great! Mary was very helpful, we had a 2 year old and didn’t know there wasn’t a bath tub to bathe her and Mary let us use the upstairs bathroom that had a tub! Never got internet/ WiFi but that was the only issue! Would definitely visit Marys home again to visiting our family!"
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute basement, very spacious, more than enough room for the 4 of us. This was a perfect venue for our gals weekend between Denver and Omaha! We'll be back!"

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mary's place was perfect for what we needed--a clean, comfortable, quiet place to sleep on our drive to Colorado. She communicated with us very well, and even offered us a free night to stay on our way back through since we got in so late on our way out and really only had a few hours to sleep there. Great host and cute place!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great experience. Very flexible with arrival and departure times.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place for family or a group. Space is in the basement of a house and is large and private. Two bedrooms - one queen bed in one, two queen beds in the other. Host was flexible with check-in and check-out."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute space, roomy. Check-in was easy and we had a great stay."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was as stated in the listing, and Mary's communication with us through the process was excellent. The place was well-stocked and had a full kitchen, which was a definite plus."
2017-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Mary's place was exactly what I expected from the pictures and descriptions. It was very relaxing and had everything we needed. We were a party of three arriving late the day before the eclipse. Mary had everything set up and ready for us. The basement apartment was spacious and well fixed up. I slept like a rock on the perfect bed. Had a great time at the eclipse. Very nice experience. Thanks Mary.
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and spacious. Mary was great at communication even though we ended up arriving much later than planned.
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house is so inviting! We were comfortable in every way. If we ever get back to that part of the country we will deffinately stay again!
2017-07-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"This basement apartment lies below a house being remodeled and we were not aware of this when we arrived. A bit confused by how to enter, where to park etc. Because we were not comfortable with bed linens (did not appear to be fresh linens) we ended up staying at the local Howard Johnson motel. Had we known what to expect we could have felt more comfortable."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb was a great choice for our family of 6, very comfortable, clean, kitchen was well stocked with pans, dishes, etc. for making meals and 3 full or queen size beds. Only negative for some guests would be if they can't go up or down stairs. You need to go down and up about 15 stairs to get to the apartment size Airbnb."
2017-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had some confusion with our booking and ended up at a different property that Mary owns. The original booking in town was at least as nice as the listing indicates and I would recommend it to anyone staying in North Platte and looking for a quiet residential neighborhood. The space featured a very nice, open living room and would be epecially good for families or groups.
Mary was apologetic about the double booking but offered us her cabin on the lake five miles south of town. Though it was small for our group (6 people) the location is great, right on the lake in a quiet community. Would highly recommend this cabin for small families or anyone looking for a peaceful get away."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were clean, roomy, and convenient to shopping and restaurants. Mary was a wonderful host."
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, well done basement apartment. Full kitchen, with all necessary equipment. Loved the way it was furnished and decorated. Mary was available and helpful. Went an extra mile by buying iron and ironing board when she knew we were there for a family wedding. Shared the space with my sister and brother-in-law, and had plenty of room. Washer and dryer upstairs was a huge bonus! Very clean and neat, tons of space! We really appreciated it!

,,,"BEWARE: This was by far the worst Airbnb experience I have ever had and I've traveled and stayed at Airbnbs all over the US including Hawaii, several times.
We arrived at the house and it was 79° inside, we learned later on that not all of the vents work and at 9 pm it was still 75° in the house , we were in a heat advisory also. We were under the impression that this was a single unit, buy quickly learned otherwise when a stranger came to the door and started to try to get in. The only thing separating the upstairs from the downstairs is a laundry room door and there are vents from the kitchen to the laundry open that are open and we can see through them and hear everything. We messaged the host to ask if there was another unit that other people were staying in and said they said yes. When we told them that the listing didn't state that it was two units, they told us we could leave.
Over the next hour or so we found that the Airbnb was dirty. There was a fake eyelash stuck to the couch, dirty dishes put back in the cupboards, the bathroom towels and rugs were crunchy and dirty, and there were used bars of soap in the bathrooms. Once bathroom toilet had been sprayed with blue bathroom cleaner but never wiped down so there were just dried up blue streaks all over the toilet. There was literally trash left behind up other people that no one bothered to clean up.
We started looking at other reviews that were more recent since we booked this 3 months in advance and learned that other people had not so pleasant stays, and not so pleasant interactions with the host. Given that our first interaction with the host wasn't great, we decided not to message them again.
The next day, we were at the parade in town and we received a text that they were kicking us out and we needed to come get our stuff. We arrived shortly after and found that the hosts had gone through our stuff and threw a bunch of it in a pile on the floor and then wouldn't let us collect the rest of our belongings. They literally trapped one of us on the porch blocking the door way and we ended up having to call the police for assistance. They kept saying that we did nothing but complain the entire night before and that no one can afford to travel anymore and everyone is just looking for a free place to stay, but at least they got paid for one nights stay. After leaving and going to a hotel for the night, we learned that not only had they gone through our stuff, but they threw the trash that someone else left behind inside one of the suitcases and stole a bottle of perfume.
Video and photo documentation was sent to Airbnb support, and the support team was amazing to work with, but this place and these people are not worth it!!"
,,,"We had good contact with the host on when we could check in. When we got there it wasn't clean. Bathrooms were dirty and had hair and dirt in the showers. There were food crumbs on kitchen counters, couch, and floors. Stovetop was dirty. Hosts husband started to clean but when i asked if the beds were clean (considering nothing else was), he said ""he wasn't going to deal with this and we could go find somewhere else to stay."" He said he would call his wife and refund my money because we weren't staying there. I was Not very happy!! Now 5 people had to find other accommodations at a motel for 2 nights."
,,,"Unfortunately, the initial contact went well however things went awry towards the end. Through a number of emails I expressly let the host know that I needed a specific checkout date and could I get that. She assured me that everything was good however after arriving and staying two days we were literally kicked out on Sunday because the host allowed an overbooking for Sunday night. My things were moved to the garage while we were out at a family function. There were 6 of us already in the house that were suppose to have been there Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There were only two people coming for one night and we were obviously overbooked. So instead of accommodating and not displacing a group of six (already settled in for one more night), they chose to kick us out to accommodate a couple staying for one night. We had discussed with the host and her husband how we might fix this and while the husband did say that they would work something out, they opted to simply put ALL of our stuff in a pile in the garage. My whole family were extremely upset and forced to get a hotel for our last night in town. Seems the confusion was on the side of the host but we got the raw end of the deal."
