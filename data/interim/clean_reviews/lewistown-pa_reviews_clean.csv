2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I booked Judith’s place for 2 months. I was new to the area for work, and needed something to get me through the winter months. Judith’s place was fantastic!! It is exactly how I decorate my own spaces. It was cozy and comfortable. She was always responsive with any questions or concerns I had. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judith place was awesome and beautiful. I love the home I love the bathtub everything was clean and just what me and my family needed to create memories for this holiday.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We had a very brief stay, between a Friday evening PSU volleyball match and a Saturday noon PSU football game, but the house met all our family’s needs. We wish it were a little closer than the 45 minute drive to campus, but we felt the price fairly reflected the distance. We appreciated the cleanliness and all the special touches…a lovely home away from home!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith’s house was perfect! Very clean, all amenities provided including bottled water in the frig, beds comfortable. The house is about 40 minutes from Penn State. Would definite stay there again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith’s cozy cottage is hands down the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. It didn’t just look clean - it was CLEAN. The bathroom downstairs has a shower to help start your day, while the upstairs soaking tub is the perfect way to relax in the evening. Beautiful decor, bedding, and overall cozy atmosphere."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Judith's house was perfect! We were there for three nights for a family wedding (me and my husband, and our three adult children). The house is welcoming with a terrific open layout which provided both togetherness & privacy. Kitchen had all we needed - we even cooked a family meal . The beds were comfortable and cozy with high end linens...and fluffy towels. There is plenty of natural light throughout the house which added to its homey feeling.
The house was so clean, from floor to ceiling and corner to corner. Topnotch appliances - including full size washer & dryer, in a laundry room ! From the second we unlocked the doo, our stay was easy, and it was ""home"". There is a Walmart - which has everything, including a huge grocery section - about a three minute drive from the house.
Lastly, Judith IS a SUPER Host! She was quick to respond with questions and suggestions . Do not hesitate to reserve this house, whether for a Penn State game, family occasion, or just a getaway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is great and we spent good time their with a cozy sofa！
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was absolutely beautiful. It was so clean and so peaceful. Judith was so helpful and so responsive. There was absolutely no problems and I enjoyed every second in this home. The house was super easy to find and it was in a perfect secluded area. This house was perfect for a little weekend getaway. We felt right at home. I would 100% stay here again :))
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting our Freshman daughter at Penn State for Parent’s Weekend and this was the perfect place to stay. It is about 30 minutes to State College. As soon as we opened the front door we were impressed with a spotless, welcoming, very well decorated, comfortable home! I thought it was even more spacious than pictured. I enjoyed a bath in the large soaker tub. The beds were very comfortable. Judith was a great host and her place is well stocked with towels, toiletries, even waters in the frig which was a great touch! Judith was very quick to respond when I overlooked where the Wi-Fi password was. I would highly recommend and will book again when visiting State College."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Judith's cozy cottage in Lewistown! The location was incredibly convenient, with everything you might need in case of an emergency, like Dunkin' and Walmart nearby. Plus, there are some fantastic restaurants and bars in the local area, which added to the charm of our stay.
The quick and easy drive to State College was a bonus for us, making it a great home base for our trip.
The cottage itself was a true gem. It was impeccably clean and beautifully decorated – every corner was a delight to explore. The beds were super comfy, and there was plenty of space for all of us.
Judith had thoughtfully stocked the house with everything we could possibly need, which made our stay even more enjoyable. We can't wait to return and experience this wonderful place again. Thanks, Judith, for providing such a delightful getaway!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean, lovely home. It had everything we needed for our stay while attending a Penn State football game. Loved it!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very cute, clean and well done AirBnB that made my family feel right at home. We appreciated having one of the rooms downstairs for my 81 year old mom (no stairs for her.!.). It had everything we needed, and would definitely recommend staying at Judith’s place again (and she was also very responsive). If you are staying in Lewistown, this is a great location near everything (although everything in a small town like this is near everything ;)."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We loved our stay! Everything was perfectly clean.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judith’s place was awesome! She was very accommodating with a last minute check in and went above and beyond for me. Her place is clean and cozy! Perfect location that’s private but not too secluded. The beds were so comfy and same for the couch. The couch was free of stains and overall I just felt very comfortable there. I would recommend her place 100!!!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We got there Judith emailed the code before hand so we could get in right away the house was very clean and we found the house exactly what you advertised thanks!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Everything you need on site. Super clean. Judith responds immediately to questions. Highly recommended. Thanks.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Judith hosted us at her cute little cabin. Everything was clean and as advertised. We spent all day at Hershey and it was the perfect stop for us to rest before the drive home. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was very convenient to the HWY and Walmart. We were in Lewistown to visit our daughter, son-in-law and the new grand baby. We didn’t want to crowd them so wanted to rent a place to stay. After traveling 13 hrs we were so excited to arrive at a very updated and VERY clean house. This house was exactly what we needed for our stay."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a lovely spacious house with comfy beds, located a little outside of town for a pleasant, peaceful setting. The house was clean and well equipped, and communication with the host Judith was clear and easy. Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Judith’s place is beautiful and everything was as advertised. She is great host with prompt communication. Would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway.

2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Convenient location, and nicely decorated and comfortable. Cozy little house!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Judith's house is a great place to stay. There were almost everything I needed, including dishes, coffee machine, water bottles, salt&peppers, pots, etc. The house was very new and extremely clean. Having coffee in the morning at the backyard was an amazing experience."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kelly was wonderful to work with! Her townhouse is beautifully decorated and perfect for our visit. Wish we could have stayed longer! Definitely would like to stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Nicely decorated and was very quiet- only downside was the plug in air freshener was so over powering- way too strong. Very clean. We really didn't do anything but sleep there. Totally recommend the Shy Bear Brewery (great food and merch) about 10 min away, or the HR Distillery (no food)."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay for our weekend in Lewistown, even though the weather was cool and rainy. The house was clean with comfortable beds. Kelly was easy to communicate with. We were in town for a sports meet, so we didn’t get to experience much, but we had a nice lunch at the Shy Bear brewery and enjoyed our breakfast at the East End cafe."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicely decorated and clean. Walking distance from town with plenty to do nearby.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall it was a great stay and we were pleased with almost everything. It was slightly confusing to find at first because the home is apart of a 4-plex and parking was in the back. The home was very clean and was very close to the church and reception venue we were visiting. (In town for a wedding) We couldn’t figure out why our fridge wasn’t working but it was because it wasn’t turned on due to our own mistake but I kinda wish it was already running for us so make sure to check for that if you stay here. Also the bathroom door doesn’t latch. There was a stool we placed behind it to keep it shut if someone was occupying it. Other than that the stay was great and the host was helpful with instructions and we never had to reach out for further information.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cute place . . . Penn State football weekend and will stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Good location about 40 minutes from PSU. Kelly’s place was clean and nicely decorated. Master bedroom was close to the road and traffic noise was noticeable particularly since we had the windows open. Not an issue for us, but you had to pass through one bedroom to get to the bathroom. Kelly had drinks and snacks available which was a nice touch."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very nice and nice place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kelly is very sweet and communicated very well!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kelly was very kind and worked with me through a mistake I made. She communicated well and was very pleasant and kind. Definitely going back as needed!!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was as Stacey described it. the stairway going upstairs was narrow and a little steep. very nice decor, smelled clean."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best views at any Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Truly amazing!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home and area. Home does have a grill and WiFi, (the amenities listed didn’t show that so pleasant surprise)
Game room is pretty cool."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,This is a very nice location. Love that wood is provided for a campfire. The “jacuzzi “ was a bit misleading because we first thought there was a hot tub. We did not realize that there was no TV until we arrived. Thankfully family was coming later so they brought one. I am not a TV watcher but it was college basketball weekend and what the family wanted to do. It worked out to bring our own. Overall we had a great get away .
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean & the host was very quick to respond. The master suite is HUGE with beautiful natural light and a big bathroom. Some things to be aware of- 3 of the bedrooms are in the unfinished basement, the internet is slow, & there is no dishwasher or TV."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,If you’re looking for a relaxing private getaway look no more. I’ts so peaceful and beautiful. We also enjoyed so nights in the game room honestly I can’t wait to come back
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time staying at the house. Very beautiful place surrounded by the river and a peaceful atmosphere.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Highly recommend I instantly booked again. The place is absolutely beautiful and it’s so peaceful and relaxing.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rated lower on the price as I think the fees are way too high. Otherwise a good nightly rate or the place.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing place, comfortable, impecable, really nice stay."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"House was in Imaculate condition
Very warm and welcoming
Felt like home . Extremely spacious."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This place was absolutely gorgeous. My family and I had an amazing time and everything was as described. The game room was such a good time! We played a lot of pool lol. We used the kitchen and we were able to make breakfast and dinner! The swings were everything. We were able to sit and relax and enjoy the ambiance, the river, and the birds. You won’t regret booking this place at all."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Completely happy everting was accurate like the descriptions and photos very peaceful place
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was exactly as the pictures, the house was clean in great condition. I absolutely recommend it. We had a great time with my family there. The best part of the house is the game room. They Always were in touch with us to know if we were comfortable or had questions which I really appreciated it."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great stay
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Lazy Bass Lodge! There is so much space for your crew to spread out (especially the fabulous game room and giant primary bedroom), including outdoor seating areas that make us want to come back in warmer weather! The three individual thermostats ensured toastiness all throughout the house, and it’s a short drive to poke around the shops of Lewistown and an easy trip to State College. The kitchen is well stocked, but note there is not a dishwasher.
Highly recommend for a getaway!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at INNteRest was awesome. All our guests enjoyed the location, the views. We were a group of 8 (5 adults and three kids) that were out for a Penn State football game. Far enough to get out of the craziness of State College on game day, but not too far to go back and forth on game day either. Plenty of basic kitchen amenities allowed us to cook a breakfast and dinner during our stay. Kids loved the game room as their little own sanctuary away from the adults. Would seriously consider another stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place not to far from happy valley
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great for our group. Nice clean place, great setting. Only downfall was the heat in the basement. It was cool where the bedrooms were, and downright frigid in the playroom. Kids couldn’t spend much time down there without hats and coats. Perhaps insulate the garage doors off and put the basement on a different heating zone. Thanks!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house with a beautiful view and nice surrounding area
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Our group (5 couples) had a great weekend at Lazy Bass lodge. We were in town for a Penn State Football game. The home had everything we needed with plenty of room for our group. We loved the game room and the wrap around porch overlooking the river. Only 30 minutes to State College and lots of restaurants etc. nearby!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The owners have done a fabulous job of providing a relaxing place to stay. They were very responsive to questions and very friendly. This home was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The kitchen was very well stocked in case you wanted to cook or bake. Candy dish on table and snacks on the counter made it feel like home. The bathrooms were very clean and lots of toiletry items provided. Bedrooms were beautiful and provided a great nights rest. We enjoyed relaxing in the beautifully decorated living room. Dining room is a nice size and had a coffee bar. We did not get to enjoy the enclosed porch but it would be a wonderful place to sit in the summer. We felt so comfortable in this home and wished we could have stayed longer. Its located on a quiet back street in a charming little town. We ate at a local restaurant- Michele's Oip and had great food and live entertainment. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruth and David's place was absolutely perfect. I can honestly say that I've never stayed at a nicer AirBnB. She proctively communicated about the check-in. Her entire AirBnB seemed to perfectly anticipate any need we might have. It was well organized and was warm/inviting. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were abundant. The fresh foods upon arrival were just the icing on the cake! We would stay her again in an instant.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another wonderful visit was enjoyed at the Peaceful Waters guest home. Ruth and Dave always are warm and welcoming and go above any expectations to provide a relaxing and restful stay. The home is immaculate and beautiful, and we are spoiled by Ruth's special touches and treats. We remain very grateful that they share the Lord's blessings with us each time when we arrive."

The rooms were all very well maintained and very clean. Beds were comfortable! Ruth was very responsive when we had any questions. We had a wonderful stay and would absolutely reccomend this place to others.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"A great place to slow down your pace of life. Beds were comfortable, kitchen & bathrooms clean; Ruth left some homemade bread, grape juice, granola, milk & a cinnamon roll for us to enjoy the next morning. So nice when arrival is late the evening before. And even better, after we began talking we found out we are distance relatives by marriage!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ruth was a great hostess. She communicated with us and provided homemade cinnamon rolls which were absolutely amazing. Her guesthouse was very clean, well-maintained, beautifully decorated, and tidy. We felt right at home. We had such a relaxing family time playing games, reading, putting a puzzle together, and feeding the deer. Her kitchen is well-stocked which worked great as we made most of our meals at the guesthouse. The guesthouse is situated in the beautiful Big Valley. It's true to it's name--peaceful. We wouldn't hesitate to come back again--in fact, our children are begging to go again soon. Thanks for allowing us to stay and enjoy your space!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning views, cozy and peaceful. Ruth was so easy to communicate with. The home was spotless. Ruth provided anything we might need for breakfast. This place is a little challenging to find but SO worth it. Loved the deer pen as well. I would love to go back."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Peaceful Waters, hosted by Ruth and Dave.
The house was beautiful, with many special touches. I loved the fresh flowers on the counter, and the homemade cinnamon buns. So many wonderful things for breakfast from fresh bread to homemade jam.
Ruth was an excellent communicator, and the property was just as described. We will certainly come back again to Peaceful Waters!"

Peaceful water is truly a peaceful place to visit. There home in immaculate, super clean, very tastefully decorated. We had all of the convenience of home. Ruth provided home made sweet rolls, bread, jelly, granola, fresh eggs, cream, and milk.
We got to feed the deer on their property too.
We will definitely be back to visit again.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at this beautiful home was beyond perfect. The hostess went above and beyond to be sure that our experience was comfortable. Notice was taken to the smallest of details. Peaceful was the perfect word!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough wonderful things about this place. It was everything we were looking for and more. We’ll def be back!

David and Ruth are always warm and welcoming and staying at the guesthouse is like stopping by to visit family."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for us to stay. It was relaxing and the house was decorated
very nicely. Feeding the deer and able to pet them was an awesome experience. Would love to come back if we ever get a chance!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great cozy home. Very beautiful and loved feeding the deer in the morning.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ruth's place was perfectly peaceful. The kitchen had everything we needed as well as a few homemade sweet treats. The house was spotless and well cared for. It was very clear that she spends time making it feel like home for her guests. One of the best Air BnB's we have stayed at.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I am beyond thankful for Ruth & her beautiful bed and breakfast. We had a special situation where we had to stay somewhere else during the day because of getting a bathroom remodeled. My husband & I work from home with our 7 month old. She couldn’t be around the construction & we landed on staying at Ruth’s with our nanny to give our baby a silent place during the day. To say Ruth was accommodating is an understatement. We walked in to delicious breakfast items & a spotless place. I had such a peace of mind that my little one was safe playing & navigating because it was so clean & well kept. It was so helpful to have some food as we traveled back & forth from our home (to sleep at night) to the Airbnb (to word during the day). Wifi allowed me to have multiple meetings throughout the day easily and I even worked on the porch while watching the deer. If you want to stay somewhere that just feels like home - this is it. Thank you Ruth! I’m forever grateful for your place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Ruth was an amazing host! The house was beautiful and so comfortable and peaceful! It was so much more than we expected! The homemade bread, the homemade cinnamon buns...so many extras!

Thank you Ruth and family for a great experience in Reedsville, PA. 😊"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. Spacious, clean, tucked away on-the-farm house with easy access to Route 322 and nearby attractions. Ruth was very responsive and welcomed us with fresh milk, homemade sticky buns and plenty of snacks and other amenities. Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't say enough about our wonderful stay at Peaceful Waters! From the spectacular clean space, to the super comfortable king size bed and the delicious cinnamon rolls and grape nuts - it was all just perfect! Feeding the deer was the highlight for the children as well as the toys and books. Thank you for sharing your beautiful space with us - we had the most wonderful weekend! 🖤"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn't have asked for a nicer location or host! The guesthouse is exactly as described, and the host also included so many little touches to make it spectacular!! We were thrilled with everything!! We were in the area to visit Penn's Cave and Gita Nagari farm, and the guesthouse was very conveniently located. It's actually very close to ""city life"", but you would never know it once you're there - it seems so secluded. My kids loved playing in the little playhouse and provided toys, sleeping in the loft, having campfires, and feeding the deer. I never imagined feeding deer by hand just steps away from the door. The kitchen is well stocked, including most staples you'll need when traveling. On the drive home, we were planning our next trip already, because we can't wait to return! Ruth and David are the BEST!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family couldn’t say enough good things about this home. The peacefulness, cleanliness, deer and cinnamon rolls top the list!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"By far my favorite Bed and Breakfast! This B&B is set in a peaceful serene setting, if your looking to experience farming culture, a strong touch of faith and enjoy peace and quiet this place is great. My kids loved the playhouse and feeding the reindeer daily. The baked goods in this area are fresh and tasty! The house is private, so no running into strangers and sharing a bathroom like most B&Bs. Upon arrival there are fresh baked goods, cream, milk, jam and breakfast goodies. The beds are comfortable and house is super clean. Hospitality is top notch!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous rental in a magnificent, bucolic setting! Has all the perfect amenities for a family getaway. The beds are comfortable, the plumbing and appliances are top-notch, the furniture is beautiful and comfortable, the beds & mattresses are excellent, and on and on. The hosts are very responsive and go out of their way to make the stay perfect. As other reviewers have noted, there are deer right outside the cabin and can be fed with host-provided animal treats."

Place was very clean, beds very comfortable and Ruth makes you feel at home with all the little touches. The sweet rolls where amazing, strawberry jam and homemade bread was to die for. My 7 month old love the deer that you can feed. Highly recommend to anyone. We look to stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said about this place. As soon as you arrive, you will see sitting on the counter the most delicious homemade sweet rolls and in the fridge a bottle of local Creamline milk - our favorite milk. My husband and I enjoyed sitting on the porch and listening to the sounds of nature, feeding the deer treats, and saying hi to the cows. The house is spacious, very comfortable, and an incredibly tranquil place to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming, immaculately-appointed guest house on a farm. Super-comfortable beds, furniture, everything you need to cook full meals in the kitchen, and entertainment right out the front door! A big, beautiful table for family meals. Wonderful touches like local honey, milk, pastries, etc. Just a thoroughly enjoyable stay and far more than we hoped for. We stayed there for Penn State graduation weekend - it's a bit of a drive (35 minutes), but well worth it. Will look to return!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! And very clean!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m sure others have said this in their reviews, but the listing does not begin to do justice to this peaceful, lovely home! We were in the area for a week for a family funeral and it was wonderful to have this clean, thoughtfully appointed house as our home base during this time. The beds are amazingly comfortable, the living area has plenty of relaxing seating, and the kitchen is well-appointed. Ruth is an exceptional hostess and we were grateful for all of the thoughtful touches!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All of the reviews we read before our stay were very complimentary and after having stayed here at Peaceful Waters, we just can't say enough about the farmhouse and the hosts Ruth and David. Wonderful and spectacular don't say enough about this experience. From the homemade cinnamon rolls to the firepit on a moonlit night, our entire stay was over the top. We look forward to coming back as soon as we can."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean and very comfortable! We enjoyed our stay so much!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so perfect, I began to relax the moment I entered the driveway. Peaceful waters describes it perfectly. Sunsets on the porch, babbling brook, deer nuzzling for their treats, cinnamon bun treats for us. As remodelers ourselves, we appreciated the attention to the little details that told me they to chose only the best for us. If you get a chance, ask them about the wood that was used to build this treasure. Stories are appreciated. I'm planning my return visit. I'm sure you will want to as well."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ruth’s space was the best airBnB we have ever stayed at! Spent a wonderful weekend traveling to PSU for a football game. Well equipped, we could have easily prepared meals there. Appreciated the added touch of personal sized toiletries for easily forgotten items. Extremely clean and spacious. We will be staying here again hopefully soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house and location. Very well kept and has all the things you would need. Very hospitable and will definitely stay again next time in the area!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic. Wonderful, clean and nicely finished guest house. We had four family members from four different states meet here to ride the Mid Atlantic Back County Discovery Motorcycle route and the dual sport trails at Bald Eagle State forest. I can’t say enough about how friendly and accommodating the owners were while maintaining a peaceful and private setting. I would love to stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a great place to stay...... pictures don't do it justice....the scenery is beautiful and feeding the deer was such a treat.... will definitely stay there again..... also the breakfasttreats are very tasty......
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect for a peaceful getaway. We were greeted with flowers and lots of homemade and local goods for breakfast. We loved everything about Peaceful Waters. The place is beautiful and well-stocked. And you get to watch the deer and even give them treats. Perfect area and B&B to explore the beauty of nature and rest and relax. My 15 year old son didn’t want to leave!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So much more than you expect. Great space, great host, great location, our stay was such a perfect respite from the crush of daily life!!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Airbnb stay and peaceful waters exceeded our expectations! The photos and descriptions do not do it justice. It was lovely, cozy, well maintained and updated. We are a family of five with three kids under 6, and they were content for hours roasting marshmallows, feeding the deer, playing in the playhouse and reading all the books Ruth offered. The owners were so kind and accommodating-fresh welcome flowers, delivering firewood, stocking the fridge with fresh and homemade goodies, and even offering their personal bikes to us when my husband mentioned an interest in passing. If you are looking for rest, to gather as a family, or a place to look at the stars, you will not be disappointed. My girls were sad to leave but they are happily planning another visit soon!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb I’ve ever been to!Good valuewhen graduation time comes around for Penn State grads. To note there’s no TV but being able to feed deer makes up for it! :)

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was an absolutely wonderful experience. From an amazingly clean and well stocked cabin to feeding the deer to the extremely friendly family-it was all first class. There were awesome homemade items for breakfast and plenty of coffee/tea and snacks and the kitchen was very well set up to cook if you wanted. The location is so picturesque that a couple days we just stayed close by and enjoyed the beauty. I would come back without question.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very private setup
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t think twice - just book! This was a private getaway that I took for some R&R. The surrounding landscape is so beautiful, the air is fresher and the people are so kind! The house itself was beautifully kept - you can tell a lot of love went into those walls. The house is adjacent to a deer pin, which Ruth has so thoughtfully provided deer treats to feed them! Inside, the details are so fantastic. The bathroom has a heater so you’re never cold when you come out of the shower. The fridge came stocked with fresh bread, milk, creamer, and strawberry jelly. You’ll also find homemade cinnamon buns! If you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle, this is it."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This sweet little tiny house is definitely one to check out! We loved how secluded it was and how peaceful. It was like camping but in a much nicer accommodation. There is just something about cooking over an open fire that can’t be beat.

This tiny cabin was cute and was a perfect size for my son, my two friends, and I. I appreciated her parents who live right across from the cabin helping us find the stream and allowing us to feed the fish on her property she even gave my little guy food to feed the fish. Had a lovely time lounging around in the cabin the futon is so comfortable."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice area. However, there’s a mountain behind the cabin that is not visible from the site. Personally, if you take out a couple trees. It’s right there. Other than that. The cabin and host were awesome."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really loved the tiny cabin. It was very quiet and clean. Kristen was very quick to respond. Wifi worked great but service in the area is spotty ( and I have a 5G phone ). Put in places you are going your maps before you leave the property. Also the shower/tub is very tall. I am short and had a hard time getting in and out of it. Otherwise it was very nice. The Locals are very nice and friendly. I will be back to try the camper on the same property. Thank you Kristen for a nice experience.

We had a peaceful and therapeutic stay at the cabin, and you get a bit of everything from the nature: the creek, the woods, the birds chirping, the lovely fire pit and more. We now know where to return:)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cottage was the exact thing my soul needed! The layout was perfect and cozy without being cluttered. The rain started right as I got settled in, and hearing it patter on the metal roof with a cup of hot tea was already worth the whole stay for me. Lots of adventures possible with a short drive, and the Tuscarora mountains were stunning. This little place in the world will always have a piece of my heart."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A true gem of a cabin, just far enough off the beaten path to give a true deep nature space while still providing all of the modern comforts and convenience of a much fancier resort stay at a fraction of the cost. Will definitely recommend to any friends who might be looking for a good place to get away from the city without having to wander too far.
The host was always in touch and had everything ready to go prior to arrival. Truly top tier service!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect as always!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin experience and the hosting experience are both way beyond expectations. Begin with the place: it’s so clean, very thing that is needed is there, the cabin itself has a very smart design - while you feel there’s ample space, every little thing you may or may not need can be found in it. Many windows and many light sources, feels really comfy day and night, whenever you want to just kick back and rest. The mattress is surprisingly comfortable and we both slept really well. First time using compost toilet but it’s really easy and clean, no problem at all. Outside the cabin there’s bbq grill and fire pit, literally everything a cabin needs. A little stream is right there in front of the cabin, and the sound of water can be heard all night (if window is opened), it feels really nice.
Apart front the amazing stay, Kristen’s parents who co-hosted us went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Our car got stuck in the mud and they came back all the way from town to help us drag the car out. Seeing me walking in the mud in my sneakers, they offered me a pair of boots to keep my food dry. They even invited us and helped us to use their hose to wash off the mud, and helped wiping the car clean, and showed us around their property. Really nice people and beautiful little cabin. That’s why I immediately booked my next trip there, even before I got time to write the review."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Nice and relaxing with all the basics covered. Would recommend walking along the nearby river.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy weekend get away for a couple or small family! Has everything you need, host are very responsive and helpful."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great time, the little cabin was wonderful. Farther than we would have liked to stay from State College but that's the price you pay for waiting to look for something and not knowing it's football season. Haha."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a fun little place. The shower is small, I’m a bigger fella and it was alittle uncomfortable. The toilet is composting, so if that’s something your not into this might not be the place for you. I would definitely stay here again."

2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,The little cabin was well equipped and we had a very relaxing stay. The kids especially enjoyed the fire pit outside the cabin. I enjoyed the sound of the nature and the little creek running next to the cabin. The composting toilet was a first for my family and took a bit to get used to. Kristin and Melissa were quick to respond to questions and also provided recommendations for a quick visit in the surrounding area.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for a relaxing weekend away! 10 out of 10 recommendation!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the Cabin in the Cove! It was lovelier than we could've hoped for! As soon as we arrived, it felt like coming home. Everthing you could possibly need for your stay was provided, and the cabin was spotlessly clean. Booking with our host Melissa was quick and easy, and check in was a breeze. Our co hosts Dan and Melissa were so very kind and helpful as well, and were always readily available to answer our questions. The location is just perfect, surrounded by woods on three sides, and down the driveway, an open meadow where we enjoyed seeing a flock of wild turkeys and several deer. The meadow was also perfect for some wonderful stargazing, just a few steps down the driveway. We loved the firepit and grill too. Such a peaceful, quiet setting, but only a quick 10-15 minute drive to town for groceries, shops and restaurants. We only wish we could have stayed longer, and we can't wait to return next year!
Cheryl"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,AMAZING 10/10 would recommend.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay! There are hot plates provided for cooking inside or the grill but we enjoyed just cooking out at the fire for our meals.

It’s such a beautiful and quiet area and was a perfect getaway that our whole family enjoyed"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This tiny house is awesome! We were shocked how many amenities there were for such a small space. You could easily spend a week here without having to run out for anything other than food and drinks. We felt like we were glamping for sure!

You will not regret renting this home!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is just wonderful. Nestled away from the road and in the path of wandering wild turkeys, the house offers respite from the busy world and has just the right amount of (carefully designed) space to ensure you have everything you need. I had a lovely time at the cabin and exploring the woods and waterholes near(ish)by. The composting toilet is amazing, and the hosts made everything super easy. I hope to return for an annual self-retreat in the future!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice stay, thoughtfully appointed little house"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to stay in a perfectly secluded, restorative, beautiful place hosted by the most gracious, warm people, this is it! Cabin in the Cove is simple and rustic, cozy and efficient and a super comfortable place. We absolutely loved it here and will most likely be back. Melissa (mom) and Kristen, the hosts are amazing at communication. We had several questions on how to operate the grill and details about the composting toilet. Melissa not only answered our questions immediately but stopped by to show us how to use the grill and Dan, the dad, even offered to help us build a fire in the fire pit. We built our own bonfires every night and cooked our meals in them which was fantastic.
You don't need to have contact with the hosts if you don't want. Everything is there for you to have a comfortable stay."

My husband and I finally got some days off work and decided to treat ourselves to a mini vacation and I am so SO happy I found this listing! It was everything we were looking for. Picturesque rustic outdoor setting combined with a comfortable and relaxing cabin. What more could you ask for? Will return again! Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing. We hosted a small bachelor party for a groom who would rather be in the woods than a club. He loved it! Location was perfect, close enough to shops for last minute necessities but still private enough to feel connected to nature and away from the hustle and bustle. The hosts were amazing. Helped with everything, even when we left behind a speaker after checkout!!! I will absolutely be returning and exploring this host’s other properties for other getaways!!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this was our first time with Airbnb, we were looking for anything anywhere and found this Gem on a 4th of July weekend. We were extremely happy cause we needed to get away for a couple of day.
the Price was excellent, the place was super clean and as described, actually we found it to be more than what we expected. away from the hustle and bustle but not too far in. Ice cream was just about 10 min away, etc. Kristen and her mom is always there via text and phone if you have any question or concerns and the creek is so much fun for the kids. This tiny house had every thing under the sun almost. lots of space, we were 4 of us and still had an extra bed to spare. TV has like 1200 channels and Wifi was great. Fire place was easy to get started. We really loved this tiny house and my bosslady was so happy we decided to rent it.
we adjusted quickly to the new concept of compose toilet. great idea btw. we would love to go back and cozy up again."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a sweet little house. The hosts were excellent communicators & gave me all the space I needed for a quiet stay. As other reviewers pointed out, neighbors and host house are visible from the cabin, but I scarcely saw a soul. The house is packed with everything you could possibly need for your stay - it's obvious that the hosts really care about their guests. Tuscarora State Forest is just a few miles down the road & has some nice challenging hikes, if that's your thing. 5 stars for the tiny house!"

The kitchenette is well stocked with the essentials and there are also utensils to cook in the gas grill outside. When I got there the fire pit was ready to go with kindle and logs and that was a wonderful thoughtful touch. The creek by the fire pit and picnic table makes the outdoor very relaxing. I think it is important to know that the road is fairly close (not very busy but you can hear it and see it) and the main house is also fairly close so its not super private but I never saw or heard folks. Thanks so much Kristen for answering all my questions and for the hospitality.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is perfect. Walking in, it was very clean and the windows provided great airflow. At night when it was cooler, the heaters worked perfectly. The indoor space was very comfortable for our family of three. The outdoor area was stocked with pre-cut firewood for the fire pit and the grill was easy to use with a side burner to use as needed. As it says in the description, the WiFi is spotty, but we went away to unplug a bit. I highly recommend the Cabin in the Cove."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for peace and mindfulness. 🧘🏽‍♀️ Host has everything imaginable in this space for convenience. Great tiny place!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed this trip a lot. Easy and fun spot.

Super cozy and clean. The co-hosts were very attentive and had quick and clear communication. Kristen responded very quickly! Great stay. Might stay again in the future... :)
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The cabin is excellent. The property is private and secluded enough to feel like a real getaway but not far from town for supplies and shopping. The property had all the amenities one could need and more. Would highly recommend!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the sweetest little cabin. It’s perfect if you want to unplug and get away from the world for a while. Melissa and Kristen have thought of everything for you. There are extra supplies and things in case you forgot. My husband and I loved celebrating our second wedding anniversary here and we hope to visit again.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was the best Airbnb i have ever booked. nice stocked kitchen. incredible private hiking trail. easy check in. It is 5 star on all the usual metrics used to evaluate an Airbnb stay. However its the kindness and authenticity of the hosts that really makes this Airbnb unforgettable. I arrived a few days before Thanksgiving and decided to take some downtime from work so i didnt check my emails, but the day after Thanksgiving I saw that the host had messaged me inviting me to join their family Thanksgiving dinner. Wow! thats an incredibly generous kind act of highest type right there. i belatedly responded thanking host. Next, its a knock on the door same day. Surprise! one of Hosts adorable children hands me best consolation prize ever its a tin foil wrapped plate of gourmet homemade holiday cookies. Then Host lends me her charming super cool trail running husband for unforgettable hiking tour. A day before i leave, a knock at door, a cherub hands me Christmas card f/Host! WOW!!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family stayed here (4 adults) during the blue and white Penn State game. My daughter wanted to celebrate her birthday at her alma mater therefore I wanted to choose a place halfway from the airport and Beaver Stadium. This was a great location and an ideal place for my family to hang out Saturday evening after the game to continue to enjoy my daughter's birthday and Sunday before needing to go back to Harrisburg for the return flight.

It was a very convenient location, just a few miles away. Rebekah was very attentive, she always responded quickly to any of my questions.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location and very beautiful old stone house. I recommend this place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you like old houses, this one is wonderful. The kitchen and bathroom have been modernized, simply and tastefully, and closets have been added to the bedrooms, but the old character remains. I cooked a meal from scratch in the kitchen and found it usable—no problems. Beds are comfortable. Lauren is very responsive. I wish I could live in a house like this!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The house and surroundings were beautiful. Easy access to the highway for going to State College. The accommodations were perfect for us. But last minute we invited my 88 year old mother along on our trip, she grew up in an old farmhouse and this house had many of the same characteristics and that brought back many memories for her and it was wonderful to hear those memories. The concern with having an older person with us in this house was steep steps leading to the bathroom and bedrooms. Keep this in mind if you are inviting someone who has a greater risk of falling."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place, beautifully appointed and maintained. Bravo to Lauren and Chris for preserving this fascinating piece of history."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This was a beautiful house in an even more beautiful location! Our stay was wonderful. Lauren answered any questions and concerns almost immediately and was incredibly welcoming. We would definitely stay here again!!

Beautiful on the outside, while a down home feeling on the inside!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren's place was wonderful. We were in town for PSU Homecoming and it was the perfect distance from the stadium for a nice peaceful stay. it is a typical farmhouse with quirks but that's why we liked it! The mattresses were not the best for those with back issues, but otherwise the place was absolutely perfect for what we needed. roomy, homey, comfortable. would definitely stay again! definitely worth the money and glad we chose to stay here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse is exactly what you would expect. An old 1800s farmhouse right next to a corn field. It has charm, character, and crooked floors. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and everything was clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom was fully remodeled, and the kitchen has modern fixtures. The decor was very appropriate for an old farm house. The view of the morning mist rising over the corn field was serene. It is close to the highway (which was very convenient, but you could hear cars when sitting on the screen porch -- which was probably the only negative). We slept quite well while we were there. We had some things to discuss with Lauren, the owner, and she was extremely responsive and just lovely to deal with. We were here for Penn State's family weekend, and the 1/2-hour drive to campus was easy. Highly recommended for a visit to the State College area. Priced very reasonably. A lovely stay. Thanks Lauren!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great farmhouse, has many updates, yet maintains its rustic charm. Spacious throughout and the kitchen has everything you might need. Great location, close to PSU and Lewistown."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed out stay at this beautiful farm house. The surroundings were beautiful and the house was warm and inviting. We were in town for a PSU football game. The travel time to PSU was not bad at all. Would definitely do it again.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I loved our stay in this lovely home. The surrounding outside was so peaceful and the views were amazing. It was such a calm place to be at. We brought our own BBQ and enjoyed all the space available. I would definitely come back!

Very clean, clear instructions for entry, and stocked with a few local treats to greet us. Will stay again!"

Brooke is incredibly responsive, helpful and so kind. She remembers me every year and left a lovely card and flowers welcoming me back. The location, heading into the mountain is one of my favorite views. When you sit on the porch you can hear the creek. I book every year with Brooke and it's always an amazing stay. The location is so peaceful, even with some houses around. And if you see anyone they are all polite and wave and offer a smile. As long as Brooke will have me, I'll be there every year it's my favorite place to stay. 10/10 recommend. The cottage is wonderful!"

2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve travelled quite a bit in Canada and used Airbnb. This is the first Airbnb house that we booked in America. Either Canadians have a higher standard or this was a low quality Airbnb house. The bathroom was recently renovated and was nice, but the rest of the house could use a complete overhaul. It was a peaceful and quiet place which we enjoyed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful little place! My family had to make an emergency trip to the area and needed a place last minute. Brooke not only helped us out quickly, but was kind through the process.

We didn’t have any problem getting out after the snowfall, and the view of the snowy mountains was beautiful. We were very cozy and had a wonderful weekend getaway!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a place to stay for our class at the state fire academy. It was a nice place to stay. Everything was clean and it ended up being cheaper than the hotel we were looking at.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the cleanest Airbnbs I've ever booked. Everything was neat and easy to find and the place was very cozy. We slept really well and enjoyed the snacks and well-stocked coffee and tea bar. This host goes above and beyond most other hosts I've experienced. Felt very private despite nearby homes. Super great value for the money. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
Also recommend OIP restaurant nearby for pizza and sandwiches which was just a short drive away. We picked up from there twice and the food was awesome."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,All I can really say is that this was one of the best air bnb host I’ve ever had
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place and would definitely stay there again to attend the fire academy!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was fantastic. Brooke’s cottage felt like home. She left a binder full of places to see and things to do that was super helpful to get to know the area. The cottage was very clean and comfortable and the coffee bar was a great bonus! Brooke went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed, including linens. The check in and out process was also very easy. The bridge to get to the home was a little intimidating at first and it can be easy to miss the initial turn into the neighborhood but after the first time, it was no big deal. This was a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a spectacular time, a very cozy place, everything clean and immaculate, we definitely come back with more time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,accommodation very good. Good value for money
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely cottage. Brooke made everything feel warm and inviting. We appreciated the extra care in providing some of the amenities that make travel easy, like coffee, shampoo, and cooking supplies. We look forward to staying again."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"It is close to the creek but you can’t see it from the front porch. This is a great place if you want to go fishing. Inside very cute. Lots of games and basket of toys for kids.
We saw 3 turkeys on the way to town for supper. Danny’s bbq in town was great."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was good for a quick stay with my kids for some racing. It’s in the country. Brooke was really responsive, she even left some lights on for us as we got into the place late the first night."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pleasant,very clean & cozy. Loved the cottage decor"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Coffee is bad
The toaster cord is short have to move items —poor electrical layout in the kitchen"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful location. Felt like we were hours away but just minutes from town. Getting there could be tricky but host provides very good directions and it was worth it. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you for providing such a beautiful place for our family to stay together!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brooke is a exceptional host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brooke is a top notch host that I’ve booked stays with several times. A+
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very remote. Very clean and modern. Perfect size for the 4 of us. Would be kind of small if there were more people. Not that easy to find in the dark. We missed the turn twice. The host was very responsive and friendly. I loved the fully stocked coffee bar and my kids enjoyed the smart tv. Nice place. Would stay there again.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Clean and problem free!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place.
Clean.
Affordable.
Creek is a stones throw away."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Had a great stay, about 35 minute drive from state college"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and cute!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place, everything we needed."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We were here overnight and enjoyed our stay. It was a small place that suited us in the short term but for a family of six, it was a bit cramped. The toilet fills very slowly so we could only flush once every few minutes unless we manually refilled the tank, which wasn’t ideal for a large family. Overall, it’s a lovely place that would suit a smaller group well."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brooke’s house was everything as described in her listing. The place was clean, cosy in a beautiful location."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brooke’s cottage was clean and cozy as advertised. Cute decor that fit the woodsy vibe.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My 2 teens and I stayed here for one night. It's a truly serene setting and a cute little cabin/house that is very nicely renovated, clean and comfortable. I spent the entire evening sitting in a rocking chair on the front porch, listening to the frogs croak and looking at the stars. The only minor drawback was the gravel road getting in off the main road. The approach was kind of steep and we had a fully packed, very heavy minivan. Other than that everything was great. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The place is not family friendly and there is not much to do. I saw the previous reviews which were not accurate at all for what it was described about the atmosphere
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Brooke’s place is quite clean. The furniture and decor is all put together nicely. The house is definitely a little older, but they have done well with the space. As some other reviews have stated, the house is not really private and is centered in a group of 4 or 5 other different residences. Our biggest disappointment though, was that we thought the listing implied that we would be able to see the creek from the porch. We could not. You do cross the creek as you get close to the house on the small bridge others have mentioned, and it is likely visible from some of the neighboring houses. The creek does not run in front of the house but we could not see it from the porch. All that being said, we were grateful for a clean space that could accommodate 6 of us, and our kids enjoyed learning about the fly fishing decor."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Brooke was a great host. She was very prompt to communicate with me. The cottage appears to have been recently remodeled and was very clean. The bathroom was spotless which is always important to me. It was a good home base for our activities. The houses surrounding the cottage were a little closer than I thought they would be - it was hard to tell from the pictures on airbnb but I was thinking it would be a bit more private but besides that it was a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brooke, Was very helpful she answered all my questions. This was perfect for what we needed. very happy with host will be back"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Not being city folk, we really enjoyed the quiet country surroundings at Brooke's place. It was lovely watching the fireflies rising up from the grass in the early evening.
The house is just as it looks in the photos. Very clean and comfortable, with all you need. The beds are comfy and the living area a good size for a small group or family.
We wished we had a little more time to enjoy the house and explore the area, but only had one night."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,This was a nice cabin to get away and rest.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a nice place - watched a thunderstorm roll in on the porch rocking chairs while drinking coffee. After camping for most of the week, it was a real treat to spend the night at this cozy sweet cabin."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you are looking for a back country get away this is it. Such a cute porch to drink coffee and soak in the nature around you. The house was clean and cozy. I stayed over the summer and the AC kept it incredibly cool and comfortable during a very humid time. The internet was great for getting some work done while I was there. Brooke was very responsive and accommodating.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a perfect little cottage for a peaceful get away! It was simply perfect inside! And outside! My friend and I were on a girl's adventure and it was so restful! At night we sat on the front porch in the rocking chairs and listened to the sounds of nature and watched the fire flys. We could hear the sound of the creek nearby. The cottage is all redone inside and everything is pristine. We loved it and would absolutely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hey, that was nice place, mountains and nature around are magnificent. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was great! The house was a perfect size and in a quiet location. It was close to a venue that we attended a wedding at and was 10 minutes away from stores and restaurants. Brooke was very responsive with any and all questions that we had and the house was very clean and organized!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is very relaxing, immaculate, and feels just like home with all the amenities provided. Brooke was very clear on directions to the cottage. We thoroughly enjoyed the front porch during the summer rains during our stay. The cottage is not as private as expected since there are other homes close by on the right and left that are not pictured. However, the little area of homes is quiet overall, particularly as it’s nestled past the creek crossing, and did not detract from the peacefulness of our stay. So, it’s a peaceful spot but definitely not secluded. It is within 10 minutes of the amenities of town but had the feel of being “out” and away. Host provided a binder of local recommendations of activities and restaurants etc which was helpful. We really enjoyed eating at JP Edwards Bar and Grill, twice! (Good food/good prices). The cottage was the perfect size for us two college besties to stay although it can sleep up to 6. The kitchen seating is a tight fit for more than 2."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Brooke’s place was exactly as listed. Loved our stay. Kinda hard to find but Brooke was very helpful in getting us in. We ended up coming in late after dark, which makes it a bit tougher, but she got us there. Very cozy. Slept well. Thanks. Would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay! The cute house was very clean and well equipped. There was also a nice porch to sit on.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Cute place! Comfortably stay for me, my husband, and my parents when we were in town to visit family."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Brooke's place was a perfect stopover for us on a family trip. Cottage is charming and fit our needs perfectly. Highly recommend this stay for anyone looking for a quiet getaway in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ended up being the perfect place to stay with three young children for a long weekend. The cottage had everything we needed, including a pack and play! We were able to cookout and play in the backyard all evening! The cottage was exceptionally clean and had all of the amenities described in the listing. My only constructive feedback is that I wish I had known how close the other houses were in the area. Even that didn’t detract from my experience since it was peaceful and quiet! Also, we really loved hanging out on the front porch!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brooke's place was ideal for our stay. We were only there for one night, but it had everything we needed and more."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a cute place, and perfect for what we needed!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication from the host. Brooke provided very clear directions and instructions for check-in. The cottage was clean and well stocked with linens. Fishermen will love the location and theme of the cottage.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this stay as we wanted to be away from the hubbub. Driving through the farm countryside is peaceful. At this time of year the baby farm animals were out in multitudes.
At our stay, so quiet, we got to observe small birds competing for mates and nesting areas.
The stay had everything we needed. The bed comfortable and the shower water ample and hot."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brooke was amazing! She responded quickly to every question I had. The house was clean and smelled great. She also provided a pack n play, which was amazing because I didn’t have to stuff ours in the car for the 12 hour ride! She even checked in to make sure we didn’t need anything extra for our stay. We enjoyed the yard and the rocking chairs with our little ones! 10/10 would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed the cottage. Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful place, chill owner and a very nice stay overall."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice quiet location. Just a few miles off Rt 322. Very clean and neat. Brooke was a great host - always a prompt reply and very helpful.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable location
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The surrounding area was beautiful! Great stay!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,this place was awesome! Brooke was great to deal with and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! thank you so much!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We weren’t there long, but Brooke was very nice and responsive. It was very quiet and matched the listing. Would definitely stay there again if we’re in the area!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Very clean and nice decor. It wasn’t as private as we expected from reading the other reviews as there are other houses close by but very quiet and peaceful as described. We enjoyed sitting on the porch which is fairly private and has a nice view. Bring a corkscrew if you plan on trying a bottle of local wine which we very much enjoyed after we improvised to get it open.😉
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second trip to Brooke’s place and she was more than accommodating. This trip we were traveling with our twin 11 month olds and she arrange to have a second pack and play at the house. Not only was it there, but the pack and plays were both already set up and had sheets on them which was amazing! The location is five minutes to downtown Lewistown which was perfect for us in town visiting family!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay after the Bruce Springsteen concert. The last 100 yards to the house were a little scary in the dark, but the driving directions were detailed and clear."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay and just like the first time, it was amazing. I drove up that mountain, and as soon as I pulled my car in, I felt like I was home again. This little cottage is incredibly important to me. as always, it was clean, comfortable, quiet, peaceful, and felt like home. All of the amenities provided allow you the ability to not even have to leave if you don't want, or need to Brooke is incredibly communicative, always responds quickly, and is incredibly kind. If you are lucky enough to stay in the cottage, on the side road, heading up to the cabin, stop if you can and take in the absolute beauty of the mountain you're driving up to. My only wish is that I had been able to stay another night. As long as I'm able, I'll be back, every March, to that little cabin, on the side of a beautiful mountain."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love the whole cabin, especially the fully prepped coffee bar 😉 (great for heavy coffee drinker, early morning in the mountain..). Very clean and warm in the Winter. Def will come again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Brookes place was so clean and so nice. Beautiful surroundings and a great place to unwind. Internet was pretty great also! Highly recommend staying here.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cottage in the hills. Very homey, with lots of personal touches - Brooke clearly wants guests to feel at home and taken care of.
The heat works great, so it's toasty warm in the cold weather. Wifi has strong signal, beds very comfy. Kitchen has everything you need.
Very peaceful, quiet area. Close to downtown Lewiston, which is cute and has a great little coffee shop - East End Coffee.
Brooke was very responsive to my requests for info about the area/restaurants & grocery stores, etc.
Highly recommend."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay overall. The beds were extremely cozy and warm, the house had everything we needed, and was very clean. The one thing I would mention is that upon entry, the house had a pretty strong smell of what seemed like maybe a previous smoker. We were able to open the windows and air it out a little, and it probably wouldn't bother many people, but both my friend who stayed with me and I have asthma, and are sensitive to that smell, so it's just something to consider if that bothers you. The house was spotless, warm, cozy, and had everything we needed otherwise. Brooke was very nice and helpful, and the stay was great."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our holiday weekend getaway! The cottage was clean and cozy, bed was comfortable and Brooke was always helpful when we had questions. I highly recommend others to go here for a getaway of some kind!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little spot, exactly what we need it."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice cabin close to a creek. Spacious, quiet, comfortable."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great little spot in the countryside.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was clean, comfortable and just as described. Brooke is a great host and extremely easy to work with."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place to stay close to everything! If you like hanging out with the neighborhood cats, they will be more than happy to join you on the porch for morning coffee."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place is fantastic!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brookes place is exactly as described. Located in a quaint town, it's nestled in a quite and beautiful location. Located not far from Beaver stadium (approx 40 min), this place was a perfect place to stay when visiting for a football game."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it. Loved the little kitten who greeted us outside. Spotless and clean cottage.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is exactly as pictured and very clean
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute clean and comfortable cottage. Communication with Brooke was excellent. We needed to extend our stay and Brooke took care of everything. We really appreciate all the extras in the house (water, coffee, tea, species) as they were very handy.
Definitely a recommended place close to Penn State."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"As Advertised!! clean, comfortable, and quiet. I would absolutely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and comfortable stay. Good value. Thank you Brooke!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. As advertised. Thank you Brooke!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay. Great host Affordable. Five stars.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage is a great little space. I loved the fly fishing theme. The bed was comfortable and everything was neat and clean. Thanks for a restful night. We picked up our puppy the next morning and headed home.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exactly as described, this is our third family trip to the Lewistown area and we definitely stay here again. Good value, clean and we enjoyed our 7 day stay at the cottage. We recommend Hostetler Country Market near Belleville and Woody's BBQ in Huntingdon for any travelers not familiar to the area. Looking forward to staying again on our next trip to PA. Thank you for being a great host, Brooke."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cottage, a lovely stay! Tip top shape - full kitchen, clean bathroom, 2 separate bedrooms with comfortable beds, nice living room and great front porch. AC units weren't too powerful but good enough. Quiet location in middle of field with other homes around perimeter. Bridge is fine, don't worry! Quick drive to town. Host was responsive and sweet. Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at what my 4 year old refers to as our “holiday house” she has no concept that is in fact not ours at all, and I think that’s because it feels comfortable and familiar for us. A great place to stay for our little family and we hope to visit the holiday house again soon haha."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an wonderful experience and enjoyed the Lewistown area very much. The accommodations were excellent and the cabin had everything we needed to make our stay feel like home.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my best friend loved the area of this cottage! The creek was beautiful, and we loved the drive through up to the cottage!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"For context, we don’t normally stay at super fancy or luxurious air bnbs but my husband said this is the nicest place we ever stayed. Our kids are already asking when we can go back. They absolutely loved the creek. It was perfect for our family and Brooke was a very attentive host. We will definitely be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"First, the cottage and amenities were great… clean and comfortable with everything we needed to make our stay quite nice!
Second, the only problem we encountered (a minor technical glitch in the TV) was corrected to our complete satisfaction within a very short time on the day of our arrival.
Third, we had a most relaxing week in a cottage that feels remote but is relatively close to so much!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Working away from home and needed to find a place to stay. Perfect little cottage! Very clean and Brooke was an amazing host. Would’ve loved to stay longer.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is cozy. Definitely off of the beaten path and you have to drive a one lane gravel road to get to it. The bridge wasn’t any concern as others have posted, but the inability to move out of someone’s way on most of the path can be iffy. Everything that we needed was provided as far as towels, dishes, paper towels, etc. We appreciate Brooke being responsive and it helped to make our stay a good one."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our son got married at Hungry Run Distillery, so we booked the Cottage for the weekend. It was close to the Venue, as Brooke had told us. The Cottage location was peaceful and a nice place to unwind, after such a beautiful day!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend this cottage, it is very well maintained and there is noticeable care put in to make it a nice place to stay. The bridge to get to the cottage was a little intimidating for us at first but didn’t take long to get acclimated. Comfy and clean!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful area and lovely checking in and out process.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely tidy cottage, perfect for a weekend stay!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great private location! Brooke’s cabin was the perfect 4 day stay for my little family. It was cozy, had everything we needed, and we felt right at home. Brooke is a great, responsive, and very helpful host!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Brooke's while taking a class at the State Fire Academy for four days. The place was cute, clean, and convenient. It was so nice to be able to cook some meals in preventing the need to eat out every night. The bridge wasn't as bad as some say and the area seemed very safe! I would definitely stay again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brooke was wonderful to book with! Prompt in responding, kind, and accommodating. The cottage was very cute, very clean, and exactly what we needed for our weekend getaway!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great little spot! Perfect for a quiet stay. Brooke was a great host. Thanks so much!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Easy to get to town. Nice place with everything you need
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I took this weekend solo for some self care and the cottage did not disappoint. I had a really great time. It was quiet, and no distractions. the cottage is lovely and comfortable. Brooke was incredibly easy to reach for any questions or concerns. I of course picked a weekend that we got a snow storm, but she was very gracious in allowing me extra time to stay past checkout if needed. Thankfully I did not and was able to leave on time. I would absolutely come back for another solo, hideaway, weekend of quiet self care again. Which I'm hoping will be sooner rather than later. Also, the bridge can be daunting, but it is easily doable. If I can do it with some snow and ice... you can absolutely do it too. Just take it slow and you will be fine. Thank you again for a great weekend."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay in a cozy cottage!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Brooke is a great hostess.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Brooke is a wonderful host. it's was a very comfortable stay
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place tucked away. Has all of the amenities you need for a low-key getaway.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend. The nighttime temperatures were 12 and 7 degrees and the cottage stayed warm and cozy. We found a great brewery “The Shy Bear” nearby and spent an afternoon there listening to live music. Brooke is a great host, always responded very promptly. I left my jacket behind and she offered to mail it back to me."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect find for our trip. My family and I wanted a safe, quiet place to stay. This was the perfect spot. The cottage is comfortable and CLEAN and we loved the country, small town feel.
When we stayed it was a cold weekend. However, the house heated up perfectly! The Roku TV and WiFi were both easy to figure out and made the perfect way to unwind after a long day. Plus, the host also left some snacks when we arrived; the perfect way to welcome us.
The host is also what makes this AirBnB a great place to stay. She will be happy to answer questions and communicates quickly. She even went above and beyond. The morning of our checkout was accompanied by terrible weather (freezing rain). However, Brooke was proactive and on top of it. She reached out to us in a timely manner the morning of checkout and communicated we could shelter there until conditions approved. Part of this was just luck no reservations were made for later that day. HOWEVER, the care for the safety of their guests and the quality service to the AirBnB is what shown through.
We recommend and would definitely stay again!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,A cute fishing cabin! Clean and as described!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet and cozy NYE weekend with my little family. The cottage was very clean and had everything we needed. Nice-and peaceful location. It was mostly raining and Ioved the sound of the rain on the tin porch ❣️
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this is a great place to stay if your trying to have peace and quiet it is extremely private the bridge to drive over it is very old and scary so proceed with caution and try not to travel after 5pm as the area gets pitch black the town is very quiet and deserted. the 2 movie theatres and most stores look like they are out of business so make sure you stock up on food, there is a supermarket called giants which has food and items for great prices! there is a forest 30 minutes that was a nice place"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"had an amazing stay. quick responses from host, very cozy, personal and Brooke is awesome"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was an amazing stay and Brooke provided great communication.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,very clean and hospitable
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great cozy cottage getaway. Was perfect for staying over to attend a Penn State football game. Had the ability to cook food at the house, but got some takeout from town."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Would definitely stay again. Extremely clean.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect find for our trip out into Western PA. The cottage is quite simple but very comfortable, and exactly what we were looking for in a place to stay. At the time of our booking, it was also the only full home rental we could find in the area - most other options we came across were single rooms or going to a full blown hotel (both not really for us!).
A few things that really helped enhance our stay: great heating/cooling in the house that is easy to control, nice board game selection, the Roku TV was easy to use, and the host also left some local treats and waters for us - a sweet little addition.
We will definitely be revisiting in the future if we have to travel to this area again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Brooke was wonderful to deal with. She was very communicative and highly responsive to every single message and question that I sent to her. Check in was simple and Brooke was flexible with me on arrival time.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Brooke's cottage! It was better than expected. We appreciate how clean and nice the space was.

Lisa allowed us to use anything in the house we needed and even offered up using the fire pit to make make s’mores. Who doesn’t love S’mores?! Also the the welcome sign was very sweet. Coming from Lancaster, she had a platter of whoopie pies for us. I thought it made for a nice personal touch to welcoming us into her home!"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying at the Old Park Estate. It has a welcoming atmosphere as soon as you open the front door. It is a beautiful home with a lot of space. The game room was one of our favorites. The bedrooms are larger and the beds are very comfortable. The kitchen is fully stocked. The house is in the country but minutes from shopping and restaurants.
When we had any questions, Lisa quickly responded.
Overall it was one of our favorite places to do a weekend stay."

Also brought our bikes along to hit the Rothrock trails. Lisa was welcoming and very responsive. She thought of a lot of details to make your stay stress free. Bathroom supplies you may have forgotten, a well stocked coffee bar and a very cute game room for downtime or a rainy day. Beds were comfortable for a good nights sleep. We will definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay Lisa"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding, and this cozy residence made for a perfect place for our family to spend time together, while celebrating a wonderful occasion!

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had 6 adults stay two nights, for my daughter's wedding, just down the road. We were greeted with homemade blueberry dessert, sodas, water. We had a little issue with chilly first night and heat didn't work. We did find a space heater that helped. She dropped off a 2nd space heater for the second night. Phone signals were hit or miss (no WIFI). A really beautiful facility and is very homey and spacious."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with plenty of room. Nice peaceful setting with a huge yard. Great place for entertaining and family get togethers. The house was and old farm house, very unique and clean. Plenty of games and information for the area for food and exploration. Would definitely stay again.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect stay for our son's PSU graduation. Quiet street, great accomodations, even though all we were really there for was to sleep. Bed was heavenly & entire home was pristine. Would 10/10 recommend, and we'd even like to stay again and explore more of Lewistown."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a fabulous stay at John’s place. The house is very charming and squeaky clean. It felt like home. I highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was perfect. It's an older house that is clearly well loved and maintained both inside and outside. Instructions on how to use everything were very clear and local recommendations were really helpful.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were so happy with our stay at John’s place. It was right down the street from my in-laws so my son loved being able to walk over to see them in the morning. The house was very clean and organized. The cabinets were labeled which was really nice when trying to find things. The backyard was an added bonus! We accidentally left my son’s binky/stuffy and John was fast to respond and accommodate our need to get it back. We will definitely stay here everytime we go back to visit family if it is a available. I would recommend John’s place to anyone looking for a place to stay in lewistown!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,John's place was full of amenities I don't typically see at other Airbnb homes. He also included a gift basket with local products to try. The house was clean and cozy. I was there for work and John was flexible with my schedule and easy to get in touch with. The location is close to restaurants and shops. I would definitely go back and recommend his place to others.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely be staying again. very clean, homey, lots of amenities, and very private. Highly recommend the stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John was amazing! His response time was immediate. He was very helpful. If you’re looking for a nice place to stay, this is it!

Thanks for a great weekend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience. This is a wonderful home with great amenities. You will feel right at home from the time you walk in, clean and comfortable. John is a great host, and I highly recommend this property, especially with value and proximity to PSU."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My family and I were in the area for a Penn State football game. John’s immaculate home was just what we needed after a long day of tailgating and football in the rain. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"John was an awesome host with a very peaceful property. Inside was spacious, clean, and it felt homey. The fenced in backyard provided privacy to relax by the fire and enjoy the weather. The house was stocked with anything you may have forgotten to pack, which was great. John even gave us a gift upon our departure. I would definitely stay again if I come back to the area!"
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house was amazing and was somewhat like the photos. The reason I say somewhat is because there are 3 rooms in the home that has “owner access only”, which is fine it’s your house however one of those “owners access only” is in one of the bedrooms and the other is in the hallway of the bedrooms, the third is the basement I assume. Also there was a shed or possibly a guest house. Again the house was great it was just a little creepy with knowing there are doors locked and one in a room that you would be sleeping. It made my family and I feel very uncomfortable to the point we all slept in the living room floor. I just think that if there are rooms that guest does not have access to that information should disclosed. Also none of the photos posted does not show “owner access only”."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the century house was great! We booked for the Penn State game, which is conveniently only 30 minutes away . The place has a very nice charm, was clean and the surrounding neighborhood was peaceful. The house is very spacious for four people and the backyard area is perfect for an evening hangout. We were able to visit the local favorite brewery and coffee shop , all within 10 minutes of the house. We will definitely book again and recommend to others!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John was a great host! He is very responsive, flexible and great. His home was very nice, looked just like the pictures and felt like home. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great hosts and a beautiful home. Definitely a deal. Wouldnt hesitate to stay again! Thank you!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Your home was extremely beautiful and immaculately clean. We felt as if we were in our home while away from our home. This has been the best place we have ever stayed. Even the Ritz, Hershey Hotel, Fairmont, and many other 5 star properties we have stayed could not compare to the amenities made available and the comfort afforded us. We will definitely stay at any properties owned by you. It couldn’t have been any more perfect! Thank you kindly and all of our best!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was more than I expected and the backyard garden was great. There were fresh picked strawberries and roses on the table from the backyard garden when we arrived. Hope to visit again.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I booked this listing for a weekend trip to visit Williams Grove Speedway & Port Royal Speedway. We got in late Friday night after the race & were so greatful to have booked somewhere that was easy to find, parking onsite & easy access into the home. Once inside we were so amazed with the thought and details put into this home. It was very clean and homey with a welcome note & cookies from the host. The bed was very comfortable with fresh linens. Plenty of towels in the bathroom with shampoo, conditioner & body wash in the shower like the hotels have now in containers. They had makeup remover wipes which I thought was really nice to make sure the towels and sheets look their best for future guests. There was also a hair dryer available. We didn't cook there but appreciated the full size fridge to keep items we purchased to take home & the Keurig to make coffee on the morning. There were coffee mugs, silverware, dish soap, dish rags & towels in the kitchen."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect spot to stay if you're headed to Port Royal. Only 10 minutes from the track and 10000x better than any hotel in that area.
The place is super clean, easy to get into, and honestly way more space than we needed for our one night stay. Will look to stay here again for future races."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay, very clean and everything was ready for our check in. The host was super responsive to our questions even later at night. Would definitely stay here again and recommend their accommodations!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I visited Logan & Larisa’s while traveling for a competition with my dog. They have a fabulous unit with amenities that make it feel like you’re right at home (like fresh cookies!). The place has old house charm, with many modern updates and a fully equipped kitchen. The loft was clean and cozy, linens were soft, and the bed was comfortable. The apartment itself is beautiful and my dog and I felt comfortable and welcome.
A few things to note, that are not negative, but good reminders: this is an upstairs unit, so there is a steep set of steps upon entering the front door (not a big deal, but good to know if you’re traveling with heavy items or have physical limitations). There is also no TV in the unit, but the wifi is just fine for streaming on a laptop!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy getaway near major hubs like State College and Harrisburg! Lovely home and very clean.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Logan and Larisa’s place was absolutely beautiful and so very clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows/linens were super cozy.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night but we wish we had stayed longer! Timeless townhouse was absolutely beautiful, very clean and cozy.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great first experience with airbnb. In town for college graduation and hotels were insane. This was a great value and much more comfortable. Ellen made the space very homey and enjoyable. The only thing we didn't know was that there was no tv. If in the description we missed it. Not a problem for us as the wifi was good. Just an observation. This experience definitely gave us reason to start using airbnb in yhe future. Thanks Ellen and God bless.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience with an Air BNB- the apartment was very clean, comfortable and quiet. We were attending an event near Penn State and access to the highway system was fast. It was very nice to spend the night in a quiet apartment with plenty of room for the two of us after a hectic day. Ellen is a gracious host and provided several nice additional touches including a welcome basket with snacks and a fridge with sodas and juice. The bathroom had a basket with toiletries available if we forgot anything!

We had an issue with the hot water which was resolved in minutes. The kitchen is adequate to store and cook food, the living area big enough and the bedroom is comfortable.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Would recomend this place to anyone! Ellen was quick to respond to any questions. I needed a utensil to make tacos and they brought one over in just a few moments. Everything was clean and place was just as described. I worked night shift and was able to sleep during the day without any issue. I had to extend my booking and she was quick to respond and confirm. Incredibly kind couple who went above and beyond.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay for the weekend. We enjoyed the area as it was very peaceful and relaxing. The host was very generous with supplying us with snacks and hygienic products. It was cozy, clean, and warm. We felt at home and were so comfortable, we even extended our stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend. Attention to every detail. The accommodations were perfect. Beautifully decorated, comfortable, zoned heating, excellent shower, snacks and fresh fruit provided. And absolutely quiet!!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was peaceful and quiet! Very comfortable and felt like home!! Michelle was very responsive and checked it to make sure everything was fine!! Awesome place and will stay again if I’m back in that area!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great experience first time staying in air b and b. Will definitely use them again.

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Michelle was very responsive and helpful- and I greatly appreciated that! The place is near several grocery stores and other ammendaties. I was visiting friends in the area, so was in good proximity to them. Really greatful for a place to stay right near Lewistown/ Reedsville area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Michelle was awesome to deal with and the place was fantastic!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Was Just Exactly what I was looking for:)
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michelle's place was perfect for the night. It was convenient for my weekend visit to Penn State and far less expensive than hotel rates for a football weekend. Although I only used the coffee maker and microwave, the kitchen is one of the largest AirBNB kitchens I have seen for an apartment. So if you like to cook this would be a great choice for you. There are several large supermarkets nearby as well. The hosts were super accommodating as well and allowed me to check in early since the apartment was ready."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Michelle's place over a weekend to attend a Penn State football game. Everything was just as pictured and Michelle has really done a good job of providing everything you need and more, which was much appreciated. We had no problems checking in, and parking right outside the door is always nice. We were very comfortable, slept well, and the location worked out great for getting to the game. I think Michelle says it well with ""keep it simple"" as this isn't a trendy or fancily decorated space, but having an entire apartment with a full kitchen (and washer and dryer if you need it) made this place an amazing value. Several nearby restaurants were an added bonus. We would definitely stay again. Thanks for a very comfortable visit, Michelle!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I like Michelle's place and she was very helpful when I had trouble entering. I stayed for four nights and every night I slept well. She keeps everything stocked that you would expect and has a water cooler, which is a plus! The place is neat and organized but maybe a little more attention could be given to cleaning. Some areas are dusty and there is animal hair on the couch cover. Nevertheless, overall, a nice place. I would stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay w Michelle was perfect. Super easy check in/out. Very convenient spot to the adorable little town here. Michelle was super friendly and flexible and made it feel like a home away from home. Was able to work from her residence during the day and had many options to go out to eat or stay in and door dash. Will gladly stay again if I am ever in the area! Thanks Michelle!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay. Cute and nice for the short time we were there.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Rebecca’s home was extremely clean and very comfortable to stay in!! She was very responsive when we were communicating prior to our stay and everything was very nice and organized. I would definitely stay at Rebeccas home again if I’m back in the area!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Needed a place to stay after attending a concert at Penn State. It was an easy 30-40 minute drive from the campus. Slept great. The neighborhood was quiet and the beds were very comfortable. Did not really use the kitchen as we got delicious breakfast sandwiches at A Taste of the Valley which was just up the road, but kitchen looked fully stocked with dishes etc. Rebecca even had a few snacks out and tea and coffee. Would recommend."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Rebecca is wonderfully accommodating and friendly. Everything was terrific.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,This apartment exceeded my expectations. The online pictures do not do justice to the beautiful design and care that Rebecca arranged in every room and corner. She is wonderful and immediately responds to questions.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca was a very responsive, helpful and kind host. Her place was lovely—very neat and tidy with lots of amenities. It’s definitely a bit of a drive from State College but driving through the mountains was a cool experience."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Rebecca was very communicative and accommodating.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Rebecca's place was just fantastic, I would give it 5 stars except that in the description it listed State College as being near the university. When I read near, I thought under 20 minutes, when it's actually closer to 40 minutes.
40 minutes back and forth is not convenient and I'm not sure we would have booked had we known this.
Location aside, her place truly is comfortable and so nicely decorated. It's up the road from a wonderful bakery that should not be missed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place in a quiet setting. Just what we were looking for.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time staying at Rebecca's place when we visited Belleville for a wedding at the Brookmere Winery (which was only four minutes away!). The kitchen had all of the cookingware we needed to cook real food during our stay, and the conveniently located Sharp Shopper Grocery Outlet surprised us with its excellent vegan options! We also enjoyed visiting Greenwood Furnace State Park only ten minutes away up in mountains. Even without the excuse of a wedding, it makes for a cozy and charming getaway."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things, wonderful host, amazing are and great food."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot rave enough about how wonderful this place is. Rebecca is very responsive to questions and all of our needs were anticipated. The space was beautiful and photos do not do it justice. Very cozy, clean and comfortable. We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca's place is wonderful. She has thought of everything from k-cups in the kitchen to extra blankets in the bedroom. We could clearly see the love and thoughtfulness she put into building and maintaining her place.
We run into some car troubles on the way up and Rebecca was very generous and helpful in dealing with those issues.
Thank you! I'd recommend Rebecca's place to anyone traveling through."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very spacious, comfortable and quiet."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was super cute and comfy. The host had left us a little basket of snacks which was greatly appreciated. And she had let us even check in an hour early when we realized we’d be arriving earlier than expected before the check in time.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Please publish what I put in the area for Rebecca. I want everyone to know how terrific it was to be at her Airbnb.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the nicest AirBnb you will stay in. Spotlessly clean and Rebecca has so many excellent little touches around the apartment. Communication is also excellent. 6-Star
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rebecca the host thinks of everything! She left snacks and some delicious wine from the local Brookmere Winery there upon our arrival. She is such a thoughtful host and this is our second time staying here and would definitely stay here again. Great location in a small town atmosphere!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca hosted my son and his girlfriend for the weekend, and it was a short but very nice stay. They reported it was clean and comfortable, and easy to find. Rebecca was a fantastic host. The first evening my son turned the oven on to make a pizza without checking the inside first, and wound up melting a plastic cutting board all over the oven. Rebecca was nothing if not gracious and concerned more for him not being able to use the oven again than for her future job of getting the plastic off the racks and heating element. Communication was excellent, and I would definitely recommend this property and host."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Very clean and comfortable.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,We enjoyed the extra goodies that Rebecca provided for us. It was a quiet neighborhood to stay in.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Best stay in Central Pennsylvania. Just book it. There is not enough space to write all the wonderful things about Rebecca and the whole floor that you get. Super safe.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay in the Belleville, PA
area, I suggest you check out Tranquil Trella. It's a homey and welcoming apartment in the lower part of a beautiful brick house. It has its own entrance with parking right in front of the walkway to the apartment. The kitchen is fully equipped and there is ample living space.
I would recommend it to anyone as it is such a quiet and peaceful area. The apartment is super clean and has everything you will need. Much better than a hotel room!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had an enjoyable stay. Great hospitality and place to stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was too short to enjoy Rebecca's lovely airbnb. I definitely recommend staying here and would do so again if I have a chance. It is very spacious and Rebecca's decorated it for comfort. The books and games were really a fun idea.
Rebecca has stocked the kitchen with pots, pans and necessary utensils to make meals. In the cupboards we found easy to make meals, coffee, creamers, and several other delicious looking treats. Having a full size refrigerator and oven was very helpful. I was able to have breakfast made with ease with how well the kitchen was shocked.
There is a spacious laundry room available.
The beds are comfortable much nicer than staying at a hotel. The cost was much less than staying a weekend at a hotel.
Belleville is a beautiful little town I especially enjoyed hearing and seeing the Amish buggies travel throughout the countryside. Staying four days was not enough time to see all sights.
We were there to attend my grandson's wedding and were so busy helping make his and his bride's day special. If you get a chance to stay at Rebecca's airbnb take a couple extra days so you have time to go sightseeing.
Thank you again Rebecca for making our stay welcoming and comfortable."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a perfect place to stay in an amazing small and quiet town! Rebecca thought of everything and even had a few special surprises waiting for us while celebrating our wedding anniversary ♥️
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Tranquil Trella was wonderful. The accommodations were clean, spacious and very comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped and the beds offered a wonderful night's sleep. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friends & I had a wonderful stay at Rebecca’s unit. The rental was clean, quiet, spacious, very comfortable (the beds were especially nice), & had so many fantastic amenities (town guides, a basket of snacks, coffee, creamer, tea, soaps). We highly recommend Rebecca’s place to anyone looking to visit the area!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed over a week,"I was here for a month, and if you ever wanted to experience the Amish, Belleville is the place to be. Along the main drag, even the surrounding neighborhood, you'll see men, women, and children steering their horses and buggies around town. The 'clip-clop' is synonymous with slow moving moving traffic. Beware when attempting to bypass them. At night, look for the red flashing lights. You'll soon realize it's very easy to sneak up on them. The neighborhood itself is quiet. You're not far from a Sheetz, or Dollar General. There's a coffee shop that serves breakfast called, ""Taste of the Valley."" Another that serves Penn State ice cream called, ""Hostetlers."" The place itself is clean. It's in the basement. I'm a night nurse and having gotten enough sleep during my stay says a lot. There's a television with roku. The beds are comfy. They remind me of the ones at Best Western. Laundry is easily accessible. And both the refrigerator and stove are in good working order. Rebecca was a wonderful host. She was there to accomodate all of my needs. She's very responsive and thoughtful. She dropped off some goodies during Easter as if there weren't enough already. It was nice to find snacks and a bottle of wine waiting my first night there."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was perfect- so cozy, clean, quiet. Highly recommend!"

as advertised"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful basement apartment was absolutely perfect in every way ! I actually could not find one thing that was lacking … you walk in and I felt at ease and at home .. and that was just from the way it has been decorated .. a warm cozy country farmhouse feel. But once you actually lay in the beds it takes you to a whole other level of cozy and comfort … bedding was beautiful and comfortable bed was soft and warm and relaxing … I honestly had the best sleep of my life on the mattress … then we sat on the sofas and again they are as comfortable as any sofa could be ! Big closet space and the nice clean bathroom was perfect , loved the shower spray ! Rebecca also has supplied the entire space with pretty much anything one would need we didn’t have to ask for anything at all The refrigerator even had some breakfast items and a bottle
Of wine .. ! Floors were warm and the fireplace ambience was the best !! It’s a real fireplace with warm brick ( not a working fireplace ) but it had a realistic log flames insert that emitted heat and it was just as pretty as a real fire. My Best Friend and I came here for some rest, relaxation, renewal … we were hopeful that we would have zero frustrations that normally accompany life in general … and that is absolutely what we got !!! Peaceful Tranquil and Comfort !! It doesn’t hurt either the incredible area .. a gorgeous Valley surrounded by beautiful farms and mountains that seem to hug you as you travel around town. Great places to eat very nearby as well !
You will not be disappointed here at Tranquil Trella … it’s impossible !
I will be back here for sure."

2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming place! We chose it for its proximity to State College, we were staying in the area for parents weekend. It was a pleasant drive from Belleville to State College. Very quiet neighborhood and adorable home, inside and out.
We would rent again, loved having a house vs a hotel. Thanks Rebecca and Andy for being excellent host."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Rebecca's home was the perfect place to rest after working long days in the Belleville area. Her home is spacious and inviting. Rebecca was responsive and very helpful when I had questions.
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely enjoyable, very quiet and relaxing. Already planning on returning next year for penn state games.
Very clean home. Back yard is very well maintained and a nice area to set and relax"
2016-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was just as we expected from the description and it was indeed a very quiet neighborhood. It was comfortable for all 5 of us. They were very responsive to our needs and even came a distance at 9pm on Saturday night to let us in when we came back and couldn't find our key. If we get to the area again we would stay here especially in nicer weather to enjoy the back porch and yard. We were there on a cold, rainy weekend. Thanks Rebecca and Adam."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,From the moment we booked the house Rebecca made us feel welcome. The house was really superb and my only regret was not having enough time to enjoy it all. The bed was beyond comfy and the whole home was cozy. My child and I loved all the board games that Rebecca supplied. The neighborhood is so quaint and quiet. We got to see lots of Amish horse and carriages go down the street. It was an easy half hour drive to Huntingdon where we went for parents weekend. I'd definitely return to Tranquil Trella!
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rebecca's home was wonderful! It was just as expected from the posting-clean, quiet, relaxing. We stayed 4 nights while visiting family and it was a great deal, games- indoor and outdoor provided, as well as a nice kitchen. We will definitely stay here again if possible!"
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay for a Penn State football weekend. Only 40 minutes away from campus. House was very clean and spacious!
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved everything about my stay. Rebecca communicated personally before my stay to ensure I had everything I needed, checked in with me to make sure I arrived OK, made sure I could easily reach someone if I encountered any problems, and checked in one more time before I left."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is immaculate and very well built. The back patio is especially inviting. Great Amish farming community; Belleville is not some burned out mill-town, but rather, it has a thriving and verdant atmosphere. Completely quaint with no kitsch."
2016-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a very relaxing and enjoyable time staying. Even though it was one night, it was nice to have a comfortable place to say while visiting family. Thanks Rebecca!"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was lovely....clean, comfortable, spacious....I arrived after a long drive from Kentucky and it was the place to rest overnight. Rebecca was really great to communicate with and easy to reach. The rooms are stocked with little trinkets and games (it's a perfect house for a family with children to stay in), and the house itself is on a beautiful, quiet, safe street.
I had a fabulous meal at Richies OIP (recommended by Rebecca in her welcome booklet). Belleville is such a lovely farm town.....definitely worth stopping in if you are driving through central PA"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rebecca's house is beautiful. I was in State College for business and like staying in Belleville - fun drive, nice little town away from everything. I showed up later than I intended, but Rebecca was great about it. Excellent communication all around. Wish I could have stayed longer and had time to hang out in the sun parlor."
