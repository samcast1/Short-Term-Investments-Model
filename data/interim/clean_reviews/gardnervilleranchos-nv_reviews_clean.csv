2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tiame’s place was just as described. The neighborhood and surrounding area felt very safe. Much more low-key than Reno which is what we wanted, but was close enough (30 min) to be able to go check out the downtown Reno area. Tiame and Anthony were so friendly and went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. They offered us breakfast and even offered for us to make a lunch before we left so we didn’t have to stop on the road. They gave local dining and recreational recommendations. Talking with them and the other guests was so enjoyable. Sharing the space was not a problem as they go out of their way to be accommodating for their guests. Would definitely return!"

They also had a mini fridge with water, cool drinks, chocolates, etc. Lots of extra towels and kitchen had lots of tea options, coffee, bread, fruits, etc. as mentioned by other reviewers. Room was clean and quiet.. Bathroom was really spacious and clean. On top of all, I really felt safe as a female solo traveler. Highly recommend this place and would stay here again for my next visit."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was so great to meet Tiame & her husband Anthony! The first part of my stay I had some business to take care of and I felt respected in having my own time and space. The last day of my trip I was free! I chatted with them for a bit and they made a great recommendation for me to have brunch at as well as a great recommendation for a hiking trail. Super friendly people & a lovely house in a safe neighborhood.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My second time visiting this place. This is a great place to stay with everything I needed. Highly recommend and I'll also visit here again :)
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great house, clean rooms and nice location and best of all awesome hosts
I truly felt like home when I stayed at Tiame’s. Everything including my late check in accommodation, assistance with my car charging situation and all the way to accepting my late check out to be able to take my work calls before heading out, was just amazing.
One thing to keep in mind for EV owners is that might be hard to find Supercharger near Carson city area. There are few EV chargers but you would need to leave the car overnight or at least 10-11 hrs for full charge.
The host was nice enough to even give me a ride to a station close by to leave the car for the day and the same for car pickup. This worked out well for me but if you are in a hurry, I highly recommend to charge your on the way or check out the closes supercharge stations"

Hygiene: The common area and bedroom are very nice, strong in the house where I stayed

Very nice hosts that I recommend !

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is great, clean, and most importantly the hosts are very l friendly. I will stay here any time I come through. I see posts complaining about the “close your door quietly policy” if you are respectful to them they will treat you the same. They just don’t want you waking them or other guests up by slamming doors which to me just makes sense. They are reasonable and if you accidentally shut your door to hard they aren’t going to freak out. Just be respectful."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay close to Lake Tahoe!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great value for money. Tiame and her husband were very friendly and also offered us breakfast right away. Great!

Very close to downtown Carson City for all your dining needs.
We liked a local joint called TeeJay’s!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I went to Carson City on business, alone. It was nice to go to a safe, clean and friendly environment, when I was off. I am hoping to stay there every time I'm in that area."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it's a very quiet and comfortable place, plus breakfast, snacks and a fridge full of drinks in your room included, is fully recommended!"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I had to think about how I was going to word this review.
Pros: Tiame thought about the small details which are important and really matter such as providing snacks, refreshments, a first aid kit, all shower necessities, plenty of extra towels and linens, and laundry facilities in case you need to do laundry yourself.
Cons: the rules being explained in what felt to be an unnecessary way. Like for every door slam it's a $10 fee. There was a note on the back of room door that said if you can hear the door shut than that counts as a slam. So basically my girlfriend and I moved around the house as little as possible to try to make as little noise as possible. We did not feel comfortable at all and was extremely happy we were only there for like 10 Hrs. The comforter had a couple stains on it and the bathroom wasn't horrible but not great. All 3 rooms were rented the night we stayed and sharing a bathroom with the other guests was slightly inconvenient like a race. lol Would not return."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super nice, I felt like home. Breakfast included, fridge open for making brekkie!!!! Refreshments available in your room, all inklusive!
Don’t hesitate to use this place!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had two wonderful, super warm and pleasant nights!

The kitchen is equipped with everything you can imagine. We were allowed to serve everything and always enjoyed a great breakfast.
The bed was also very comfortable and even in the bedroom there was a small fridge with cold drinks as well as other water bottles in the closet. We lacked nothing and we would have liked to have stayed a few days longer. Really great!

I had cut my finger on my fingers shortly before arrival and tiame was so kind and put something for wound care in the room! The room includes a fridge with lots of drinks and even wine and the breakfast selection is unique! The room is clean and lovingly furnished and lacked nothing. We were also able to do our laundry. Man is quickly at Lake Tahoe in 20 minutes and also quite central in a nice neighborhood.

It is so nice to feel comfortable when staying in someone's home, especially when the host also lives there and I felt the love. Plus, it was easy to find, park, enter and exit; the room and bathroom were great and the mini fridge was stocked with plenty of free beverages!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tiame and Anthony were fabulous hosts. When they say their home is your home they mean it! My only regret is not being able to stay longer to share some wine!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and very quiet. I hardly noticed other guests were around.

Thanks for sharing your beautiful house."

Highly recommend!!!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable place to stay! I especially liked how they left ample candies and snacks for guests.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend Tiame's place for both short or long term (depending on the availability). Her place is an ideal location in Carson City. All the stores and restaurants are close by (driving distance) and the view is magnificent! The house itself is relatively new and clean! Both hosts (the wife and husband) are very nice and warm. Upon meeting new people, I always feel awkwardness because of my disability as a Deaf individual and oftentimes the awkwardness does not go away till the next following day or so, but for these people the awkwardness quickly diminished within few minutes as if they were familiar faces. You will love them, their house, and the location. The price is very reasonable. They provide high end (good brand name) beverages, snacks, candies, and personal hygiene's such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. Communication is at best with them. You will not be disappointed! I highly recommend you to choose Tiame's place. Like the old saying, ""there is nothing like home"" - this is exactly what Tiame's home does make me feel like when I stayed with them."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed staying at Tiame's. The place is clean and the area is safe. Appreciate the hospitality (drinks in the fridge and snacks in the kitchen etc.)
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was more than perfect!!. I want to thank the host for spending the sweetest night during my trip to Lake Tahoe.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb is a great value for the price! The home is new and beautiful, the mini fridge was stocked full of lots of different drink options and Tiame also left snacks in the room and allowed me to use eggs to make breakfast in the morning! 30 minute drive to Reno or Lake Tahoe."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great house, spacious, ultra well equipped. There is everything you need to be well and relax (very well-equipped kitchen with lunch, air conditioning, massage chair, barbecue with small garden, huge washing machine and dryer...). Bedroom with nice bed and small room in addition to the dressing room to store your clothes (very convenient for saving space). I did not see the host, I was able to enter and leave completely independently in the house where other tenants were also present. Close to Lake Tahoe by car (about 30 minutes away). Supermarkets less than 5 minutes by car. Great!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tiame and Anthony are very generous and thoughtful hosts. Their home is in a new subdivision and is a 35 minute drive to South Lake Tahoe. We stayed there for the Celebrity Golf Tournament and stayed 6 nights. The room and bed is comfy. The bedroom includes a mini fridge stocked with water, soda, and flavored water, which we could restock from the supply in the garage. They also had a bottle of wine and bowl of chocolates in the bedroom. The bath is shared, but it has double sinks and we didn't have much of an issue bumping into the other guests. They gave us access to breakfast items in the kitchen, which included Keurig coffee pods, fruit, a variety of cereal, and various mini pastries. The home was very quiet and we only saw the hosts twice during our stay. Carson City also has many good restaurants downtown. Highly recommended place!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tiame and her husband are very welcoming and have created a comfortable, clean environment for their guests. The neighborhood is brand new and is conveniently located near stores, restaurants, and downtown Carson City. The rooms are very nice and have a stocked mini-fridge. Guests have access to the kitchen and a full spread of breakfast items along with coffee and tea. The bathroom is shared amongst the 3 guestrooms. The common areas were all kept clean during our stay."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is gorgeous, up on the hill inside a private property next to a National Forest and with amazing views. A creek runs next to the unit. It is very well appointed, extremely clean and comfortable. Absolutely quiet with just a wonderful faint creek water rumor and the eventual little visiting birds :-). Cindy was a pleasure to meet and deal with. Couldn’t have asked for more and definitely hope to return."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy and Billy are excellent hosts. They are quick to reply to any questions and offer a fantastic property with amazing views of Carson Valley and the surrounding mountains. The rental home was in perfect condition with modern furniture and appliances. The property is conveniently located to Reno, Genoa and points of interest in Carson valley and also very close to Lake Tahoe, South Shore, hotels, casinos, etc. It's in a private, gated neighborhood and feels very safe and secure. I highly recommend this property and look forward to returning."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time at Cindy's place. The house was in a very private location with a beautiful views and scenery. All amenities were accurate and easily accessible for us. Overall, a great experience and was totally worth the 20 minute drive from Tahoe."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here last year when we were visiting and if we come back to this area we would stay again. Cindy always has a loaf of fresh banana bread for her guests which is yummy. Can’t beat the location and the view!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Cindy is the best host I have interacted with on Airbnb. She was very accommodating in my schedule and very gracious. I can't say enough about her.
The property was immaculate... spotless, yet so cozy and comfortable. It had all the right details to make the stay special.
The location is incredibly peaceful at the foothills of the Sierras surrounded by beautiful pines and a smoothing spring fed stream out the back door. Im not making this up. Its perfect.
There are so many beautiful hikes nearby and many cycle opportunities as well.
If you want to be in a peaceful and comfy house in the woods in a beautiful location with many outdoor activities surrounding you, then this is the place!
I've stayed in many airbnb's looking for the perfect peaceful property in the woods and I have found it at Cindy's listing. I won!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in Gardnerville. The location was great, very scenic with views out every window. The kitchen was very well equipped. The wood burning stove came in handy on the chilly nights. Cindy was a wonderful host, flexible with check in and had banana bread waiting for us."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wow! We can’t say enough how beautiful Cindy and Bill’s home was! We truly felt right at home! You’re secluded enough without being completely alone as the main home is located out front. The fire place was our go to every afternoon after our activities at Lake Tahoe! You’re literally 20 mins from all there is to do in Tahoe but you far enough to enjoy the breathtaking views the home has to offer! We arrived to a desert like landscape and left in winter wonderland! All the amenities you need you will find here and Cindy was excellent when it came to communicating ! We look forward to our next stay!!!

Convenient place to stay for Heavenly Valley skiers as it is away from the hub-bub of South Lake Tahoe yet close the the Nevada side of Heavenly Valley and the South shore Heavenly gondola bus stops very close by! The sounds of the creek were an amazing bonus! Loved our stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cindy was thorough and thoughtful and the place was exactly what we wanted. It was warm and inviting, clean, and organized. We arrived at night and as such, couldn't see much of the outside; The next morning on our way out, we were very pleasantly surprised by a beautiful home and view paired with the calming sounds of a nearby river. This was a wonderful experience. Thanks so much for letting us rent your home for a couple days. It was lovely."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Literally, the best place to stay in that area. Everything about the views was beautiful! The house was adorable as well. And the hosts were super friendly.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Very peaceful and close to South Lake Tahoe and the valley. Cindy is a great host.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and beautiful scenery .
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this place for access to Lake Tahoe, and were a little concerned that it may be too far away. We should not have worried as it is only a short drive over the mountain road to South Tahoe Boulevard. Had we booked nearer the lake we would have missed out on the delights that Nevada had to offer! Totally different but equally beautiful scenery, friendly people and the most interesting places, Virginia City and Genoa were great places to visit and learn all about the history of the Gold rush. We particularly loved the peaceful and relaxed feel at Genoa. The accommodation is immaculate and the most comfortable beds , we slept so well! The views are spectacular and we loved watching the different animals and birds from the kitchen window which has a spectacular vista. We would thoroughly recommend this place. Thank you Cindy and Billy for a great stay"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location with stunning sunsets! Very relaxing but also close to south lake tahoe
Great hosts in Cindy and Billy who were helpful all the way!
Immaculate accommodation with everything you would need and felt cozy and like home. Everything worked and all instructions were clear.
Would recommend to friends and family!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place to stay at a pretty reasonable price in the tahoe area. Seemed quite a bit nicer than other places closer to the lake. It is on the back side of the mountain range so takes 20 mins or so to drive through the pass to get close to the lake, but i still think it was worth the extra driving especially if you wanted something a little nicer and quieter. The only issue was we couldnt figure out how to hold the desired temp on the nest thermostat so when we got back to the house it was really hot and took all night to cool off, would have been nice to hold at a comfortable temp. I didn't reach out to Cindy during the stay since it wasn't a huge deal, but might be nice to figure that out to make it a little easier for guests."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really Beautiful location, very spacious and private. We cannot wait to go back! Host was very quick to respond and helpful. Property is amazing."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,The place of Cindy is perfect for our stay cause it’s just 18 mins drive to the place we need to go. Cindy is very friendly and communicate very well.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So, my wife and I have travelled cross country on motorcycle four different times now, not to mention tons of other rides in the western United States, and while doing that we have rented about 40 different vacation rentals all over. Some of them you are kind of glad to get back on the road and move on, some........... like Cindy & Billy's place, you are actually a little sad to leave, and wish you had planned your trip to be able to stay longer!! The views, the creek, the bed, the shower, all of it, was just great!! We truly LOVED being there and will try to arrange one of our future rides to include this house again!!"

Had a check-in problem with receiving the welcome msg with gate code, but Cindy was right there to get us in. If you want peace and quiet, this is your spot."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a fabulous time at “A little bit of heaven”! We took our in-laws with us to babysit our kiddos while we attended a wedding. The main bedroom had plenty of space for a pack-n-play and a blowup toddler mattress additional to the bed that was already in there. We messaged Cindy a few times in regards to things during our stay and she was always prompt at responding. 10/10 would recommend and I hope we can stay here again in the future!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cindy's place was the perfect escape for a couple of nights in early June. What a gorgeous place! Our cousin who was with us visiting from the UK was blown away by the views! Host was welcoming and kind. We loved the banana bread! Best wishes, the Harrisons"

We appreciated the comfortable beds, the airy master bedroom and living room, which have windows all around, and the well-stocked kitchen, also with a stunning view from the window over the sink.
It was a pretty drive over the mountain to Lake Tahoe, and this Airbnb gave us a serene sanctuary to return to after our days of hiking and kayaking on the lake.
My husband and I agree that it's the nicest Airbnb we have stayed at. We were very happy throughout our stay, and Cindy was super responsive about a few minor things that came up. She also surprised us with truly delicious home-baked banana bread.
We will definitely try to get another reservation when we return to the area!"

The luxury guest house is equipped with everything you will need. Great communication with Cindy with very fast response time.

Husband chose this location for his birthday trip to do astro-photography and it did not disappoint. We were able to capture so many stars because of how dark the sky was.
Easy check in thanks to detailed instructions from our host. Very clean place. My favorite parts include: full kitchen with a gorgeous panoramic view of the valley, comfy futon, listening to the creek and crickets at night, and best of all, central AC! It was definitely needed on hot days.
I would love to see the beauty of this area during snow season."

Secluded yet close to all amenities (less than 10 mins to town). Amazing 360 degree views. Cindy and Billy were friendly and welcoming. Check in/out were smooth and easy.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, great views and location. Communication and check in process were both effortless. Would stay again. It was very warm during our stay and sometimes the AC lagged but otherwise our visit was great."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful and the location just perfect for our trip. It was our first Air B&B rental and we couldn’t be more pleased. The home was so clean and the accommodations fit our family perfectly! Although we were in the guest house behind their main house, we had complete privacy. We would highly recommend this place. Thanks to the thoughtful hosts."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is absolutely amazing. The view from the house is breathtaking. Everything we needed is conveniently available. We even found two fully grown California mule deer right in front of the house on the first day. Cindy was informative and check in/out was very easy. Will book again when my parents visit us next time.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A Little bit of Heaven is exactly what Cindy's house is. A beautiful house right next to a nice little creek, that is very clean and spacious for the family. The house is about 20 to 25 minutes from the Lake and about 15 minutes from Gardnerville NV which was very convenient to buy anything you need at a regular price. This house is so perfect that even washing the dishes is a good experience while enjoying the view thru the nice big window in front of you.
The best part of this house is Cindy, she takes good care of you and makes sure that you enjoy your stay. She got in contact with us about a week prior to our visit to make sure that we were aware of the fire conditions and offered to refund our money in case we decided to cancel (fortunately was not the case) and since then she was always available for us and responded to our text ASAP.
If you are planning a trip to Lake Tahoe do not hesitate to book this house, you will not regret it."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed at Cindy’s place during our trip to Lake Tahoe. The house was super clean and very spacious! It accommodated my family of four perfectly! The house is located about 20 minutes from Lake Tahoe, but we did not mind the drive because the scenery was beautiful. The house is secluded and has beautiful views from all around the house! We loved having Mother Nature as our backyard…having coffee on the patio while listening to the stream running and birds chirping was my favorite part of the house! Cindy was very considerate and attentive when it came down to any questions I had! She was very helpful and made it a point to make our stay very pleasant! My family and I cannot wait to stay here again! Thank you Cindy"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We booked Cindy and Bill’s house because our friends were all signed up to do the Death Ride in Markleeville. We arrived Thursday evening and when I couldn’t locate the code to the private community, I was able to contact Cindy and she responded immediately. The next morning as we were getting ready to head into Turtle Rock Park to pick up our bibs for the ride, we met Cindy and Bill. We quickly chatted and learned that Cindy and her daughter also completed the Death Ride together many years ago. Unbeknownst to everyone, a wild fire started in Markleeville and unfortunately, the Death Ride was cancelled. Our group made the decision to head home a day early since the ride was cancelled. After we cleaned up the house and left, I messaged Cindy to let her know that we’ve checked out. She quickly responded and suggested that we contact Airbnb to see if they’d refund our one night stay because of the extenuating circumstances from the fire. Before I had a chance to contact Airbnb, Cindy already took care of everything and said they would be reaching out to me to finalize the credit. Thank you Cindy for your hospitality and going above and beyond your hostess duties to make sure our stay was memorable. I would highly recommend Cindy and Bill’s place and would come back again with my family."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home surpassed our expectations! The pictures and the description don’t do it justice since the breathtaking views, the coziness of the home and the location are beyond what you can capture in pictures! The home was very clean which made us feel extra comfortable. You can hear the creek passing right next to the house. Our drive to South Lake Tahoe (camp Richardson area) was about 28 mins. The hosts respected our space and also made themselves available should we need them. We will definitely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our family’s first time doing an Airbnb, and I have to say Cindy’s place was wonderful. Very, very clean and organized! We loved the house and the area. Communication was quick.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I were very pleased with the location and cleanliness of this house.

2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"About 20-25 minutes from Lake Tahoe on the east side of the summit so it was a little more drive to the lake than we had anticipated, however, it was a wonderful, quite relief to get away from the hectic traffic right around Tahoe. The area is beautiful and the home is lovely."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"True to its name, Cindy and Billy's place really feels a little bit like heaven to us! As many reviewers have commented, the house has amazing views from every window! i told Cindy that the view from the kitchen window probably can inspire people who never cook to get started cooking! The house is very nice and clean with the kitchen well-equipped. The location is also excellent- nestled into the side of the mountains offers spectacular views and peace and quiet, while also only a ~20 min drive into the heart of South Lake Tahoe. We were so happy that we found this house which made our first post-pandemic vacation so refreshing and memorable. We highly recommend this place and look forward to coming back to this little bit of heaven!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely stunning.
The views in all directions are absolutely gorgeous, and the photos cannot fully capture how great they are. The nearby River made an extremely relaxing atmosphere. It was just a short drive away from key things in town, but is extremely private / isolated.
They also have INCREDIBLE water (it sounds crazy but it was actually a highlight of the place)."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing...this house is very private, extremely clean and organized. It is very conveniently located to South Lake Tahoe, but also easy to get to anywhere in Gardnerville, Minden, or Carson City fairly quickly.

I highly recommend this beautiful house if you are in the area."

Billy and Cindy thought of everything and even provided us with some chocolates and water for our stay. The view outside is simply breathtaking with beautiful hikes directly from the backyard. The property is located just a short drive away from Heavenly and South Lake Tahoe. Cindy and Billy were prompt with answering any questions we had before and during our trip. We personally met Billy during the trip and he was so kind and offered great suggestions. We would love to stay here again."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Five stars across the board! Cindy’s place is the perfect spot if you’re looking to stay close to south lake/heavenly, but prefer peace and quiet. The property borders public land and looks directly up at the eastern front of the Sierra, just incredible! Tons of nature and amazing sunrises and sunsets. The house was immaculate, communication excellent, location/scenery amazing, and we would certainly stay again. I personally met Cindy during our stay and she was very kind and approachable."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,a must place Cindy is not only sweet and kind and thoughtful she has one of the cutest laid out spots ever look forward to coming back soon
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cindy's place is really great for small family. The views of snow mountains and sound of creek really makes you feel closer to nature. It's 20 min drive from Tahoe downtown and snow play area for kids. We enjoyed our stay.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying here! The house is lovely and the kitchen well stocked with supplies to stay in and cook. The views outside were beautiful as well with easy parking. The house is over a pass and about a 20 minute drive from heavenly village. Luckily the Nevada side stayed a bit warmer so even when 50/89 required chains we didn’t have any issues getting in and out from the Airbnb to the resort. We would definitely stay here again.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Highly recommend! The views are beautiful and the location is great if you want to go skiing in Tahoe. The home was very clean, peaceful, and we had a wonderful stay. Cindy and Billy were very helpful, responsive, and kind!"

2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cindy was super helpful both during booking, check in, and after we checked out. The property is about 15 minutes outside of Tahoe with beautiful mountain and valley views which we loved waking up to! It had plenty of space for six adults and made for nice quiet evenings after snowboarding all day. She had waters and chocolates and a couple snacks in a welcome basket, a duraflame log for the wood stove, and make up removing wipes in the bathrooms provided. There was so much attention to detail, I would stay here again in a heartbeat! After we checked out one of our friends let me know that he had left an unusual item at the property. Cindy was quick to respond, found the item, and was willing to quickly ship it to us, which was above and beyond and very much appreciated!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Little bit of heaven is a great place to get away from it all, it is a 20 minute drive to Lake Tahoe and the ski resorts. The house is located in a gated community and we were comfortable not locking our doors while out in town. The house is ""immaculate"" with the most beautiful views. You will be sure to enjoy the house and scenery. Bill and Cindy have done a fantastic job providing you with more than essentials. They have thought of everything that you need. Highly recommended!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A bit out of the way from Tahoe, but that's just what we needed. The house was warm, large and homey. Kitchen was complete for cooking Christmas dinner. Very peaceful."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! Perfect for a family of four! The house was very cozy, clean, and perfect location to South Lake Tahoe. We also enjoyed the local town with great recommendations from Cindy. The property is beautiful and secluded."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Well stocked kitchen. Beautiful hikes right from the backyard. And lovely views. Really enjoyed our stay.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly clean, comfortable & cozy venue with spectacular view. All amenities as stated and much more. Convenient location, super hospitable host. Highly recommend it!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cindy has a beautiful home! And was very helpful with things to do. She was also responsive! She had great accommodations! I would definitely recommend! 10/10 no doubt!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is one of the best places we’ve stayed at. The views are amazing and feels just like home. Definitely recommend it!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has such a beautiful view! There’s a sound of a peaceful little stream right near the house that is so soothing to listen to. Even though we were in the guest house, we had all the privacy. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cindy’s place was perfect for a weekend getaway - Great location and beautiful views!

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything in the house was very clean and tidy. View was very nice. Property owner was commutative at the right times and accommodating. Would recommend.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Cindy’s was great. We absolutely loved the amazing view! The size of the house is perfect for a single family. The amenities were great as well. Cindy made sure to provide extra towels, extra blankets and pillows. The kitchen was well stocked. There is no need for you to bring anything from home, the house has it all! This place is truly home away from home."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy's place is lovely. The house is spacious and has everything you need to make yourself comfortable. It's the last house up the hill, so you have the desert mountains as your backyard. :-) There's also a stream of water running close to the house, making a very relaxing sound.
From the house, you have to drive around 15m to get to the lake. Given how good and comfortable Cindy's place is, the drive is worth it."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I planned a surprise birthday weekend for my fiancé and surprised him with his best buddy coming with his wife! The Airbnb was sparkling clean, the host was amazing- super responsive and helpful- even warned us of the bad air quality the week before. The place was in perfect condition- very nice amenities. It’s super clean, I didn’t even worry due to the pandemic. The location is great also- short distance to the casinos and to nice restaurants. Very quiet at night, beautiful views from the Airbnb, beds were very comfortable. We will definitely be back to stay here again!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy and Billy place is wonderful. Everything was as pictured and SUPER CLEAN. Large enough for a family of five. Modern features, FABULOUS views and beautiful decorations. Great location, close to grocery stores etc. Quiet and beautiful estates. Very relaxing place. This was just as described. The location is very convenient and there were very clear check-in and check-out instructions. I would highly recommend and book again. Thank you for the hospitality during our visit. We enjoyed everything about our stay at your home. From the moment of our arrival to our last minute at your place, we were treated like royalty. Thanks again for your time and generosity."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"No Thanks!!
Plus I did not like the fact we were right next door to her house. I felt like we were watched every move."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at Cindy’s place! The house was perfect for what we needed and super clean. It truly felt like home and all the thoughtful touches were the cherry on top. We would definitely stay here again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you want to stay in a peaceful, beautiful home in the perfect location, you have found it. A Little Bit of Heaven is just that. The home is in a great location. We visited Downtown Reno, Kings Canyon Waterfalls, & Nevada State Beach all while we were there in September. Cindy & Billy are impressively quick at responding to any concerns. I highly recommend staying in their perfect little home."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy, was a Amazing host and was just as pleasant in person. The scenery was perfect the surrounding area was just as beautiful. The name that she chose for this Airbnb is a perfect match. It was a little bit of heaven."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You will NOT regret staying here. Cindy & Billy did an amazing job hosting my wife & I. We will definitely be coming back.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Cindy's place for 2 nights and it was perfect! Cindy's communication before and during my arrival was great! A week before my arrival Cindy was kind enough to message me and inform me that the Northern CA wildfires had made a smokey appearance, then 2 days before my arrival she sent me a picture of an update reflecting clearer skies. The house was spotless clean. Just as envision in the pictures. Location is very tranquil and i loved walking out to hear the sound of water streaming close by. It is a short 20min drive to the casinos/state line. Would def recommend anyone to stay here who wants to be close to casinos but also enjoy natures peacefulness away from the crowds."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy’s Place was great !! Everything we expected and more. They really did think of everything you can possibly need while your stay. The place has AC and heater. Definitely came in handy for these hot summer days. Was nice hearing the river from the house made it feel very relaxing. Lake Tahoe was just on the other side of the mountain which is about a 30-45 min drive depending on what beach you are going to. All restaurants and coffe shops are about 7-10min away from the property. Definitely a great place to stay and recommend to anyone looking to say in the Lake Tahoe , Gardnerville area. Worth every penny , thank you Cindy for allowing us to book and look forward to a future reservation !"
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful scenery. I loved it. Nice and quiet. I still cant get over the moutain views.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is seated in a gorgeous location with an incredible backyard that is waiting to be hiked! You’re close to Lake Tahoe, Carson City and within driving distance of Yosemite! The house will provide everything you will need to enjoy a lovely stay in Nevada."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cindy was so very kind to our family. Many thanks for sharing your lovely home with us. We will be visiting again soon😊
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cindy was a great host and quickly responded to any question I had. The house was very clean. The location it self is about 20min away from state line, and had a great view of the mountains and valley. I highly recommend this location!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much. It’s a very comfortable place in a great quiet location. Cindy was so quick at responding and left some goodies and bottled water which we appreciated. The house was very clean and would recommend this “little bit of heaven “ place because it truly is great.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As described! We were looking for a nice quiet place close to the lake, but not close to people. House was clean and it was nice to be able to hear the creek nearby at bedtime. Would love to come back in the winter!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time at A little bit of Heaven place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and although it’s a lively neighborhood the house is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I definitely recommend this great place with super hosts! Communication was excellent and timely, and their knowledge of local places was spot on. Don't overlook this place if you want to stay in the area."
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This gorgeous home was a perfect getaway into exploring nature all around. The area Gardnerville has so many beautiful views and lakes that you can explore with the people closest to you. The hosts did an amazing job checking in and even having the home extremely clean! I really enjoyed my stay here.
Thank you!!!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a special place. The location, the VIEWS, the privacy, the space, the cleanliness, EVERYTHING. This is by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. We will absolutely be coming back. The pictures don't do it justice. Sitting out back and listening to the water and looking up at the mountain was so special. I would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area."
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is breathing. The area is perfect for day fun out and about then come to serenity and rest. Loved the area!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved our stay at Cindy’s place for the 4th of July weekend! The location of the property is great, it is about a 20 min. drive to Lake Tahoe. It’s perfect distance from all the fun but also enough distance to enjoy a relaxing weekend.
With the times we are living in right now it felt great having a place to stay away from the large crowds around the Casino area.
The house included all the amenities you would find in your own household and Cindy was always one message away if we needed anything."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely one of the best guest houses my family has ever stayed in. The views from the property were amazing. Although we visited in summer, I can only imagine how magical winter looks with the mountains right in the backyard. The guest house was very clean at arrival, and found no issues during our stay. Highly recommend if visiting Lake Tahoe, Carson, or Reno!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Beautiful clean home that was in a nice quiet area. The outside view was amazing, and it was a short drive to stores and the main Lake Tahoe area. Definitely recommend booking! Cindy and Bill were great hosts as well and easy to communicate with."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVED our stay at Cindy and Billy’s Home! This was by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in! If your looking for a peaceful getaway this is the place! Amazing Views, especially the sunrise/sunset! This home was Spotless Clean and so inviting to my family! Thank you so much Cindy and Billy, you Both are amazing hosts!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent place close to south lake and heavenly stagecoach entrance.. beautiful place to relax and amazing host!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This an absolutely perfect cottage - nicely decorated and very clean & comfortable. It had all the conveniences we needed and is in a setting that is awesome - majestic mountain and valley views and a running stream adjacent to the cottage. Definitely a keeper!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Cindy and Billy’s home. It was a beautiful location, nestled against the mountain and the stream sounded lovely. Our daughter loved the rocks to play with outside and the scenery. Their place is super clean, well stocked with all you would need. Comfortable beds and a great place for a small family. We have 2 kids under 2 and it was perfect. Sweet of them to have some toys to play with too!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed a weekend at Cindy and Billy's home. It was such a perfect little spot for our little family. The house was spotless and so inviting. They even had a welcome bucket in the fridge with waters and goodies for us to snack on. My kids were so happy to see that there were toys they could play with and games we could all play as a family. Cindy and Billy had everything we needed. The kitchen was fully stocked with seasons, oil, butter and everything we needed to cook a meal. The showers had shampoo, conditioner and body wash. They even had bathrobes for us to use. We had such a wonderful time staying here. The scenery was absolutely beautiful and the sound of the creek was so peaceful. My kids loved that they had a backyard of mountains to explore. Thank you so much Cindy and Billy for letting us stay in your home, it was truly an amazing getaway and definitely felt like a little piece of heaven. We will definitely be booking with you again in the future."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay at a beautiful property! Hosts were very accommodating and the communication was great! I would definitely love to stay there again! Beautiful land and the creek running next to the property was very serene!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy was an amazing host! Checking in was a breeze. She was even kind enough to message us and ask if we need anything during our stay.
The place was great! It was VERY clean! It’s also secluded which was perfect because it was nice and quiet with amazing views to wake up to every morning.
It literally has everything you need. For dinner one night, we were able to stop by the grocery store to pick up ingredients to make pasta and cook some steaks and everything else you needed to prep and cook was there. Even down to the butter and seasoning!
Overall it was an awesome experience and I would definitely stay here again. Thank you again so much for everything! My family had a great experience"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy and Billy’s home is amazing. Just as described, a little bit of heaven. It is a perfect place to get away and enjoy some peace. Very beautiful views from the home, and drive up the mountains. Not only was the home outstanding, but so are the hosts!! Cindy and Billy are quick to help you get around and feel right at home! Everything was amazing, definitely recommend staying here for a few days!!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cindy was a great host and the guest house was perfect. You won't regret it!
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A Little Bit of Heaven is exactly that. The location of the property is far enough away from the crowds, but yet minutes away from both South Lake Tahoe, Heavenly ski resort and Carson City. The home is in a beautiful location towards the top of a hill with amazing views of both the valley below, the National Forest and the back of Heavenly ski resort. The soothing sound of the creek on the property, and the amazing stars above make for a peaceful environment. The home itself has warm and beautiful decorations. The kitchen is very well stocked with plenty of dishes, pots and pans and accessories. The master bedroom sleeps two very comfortably with a full bath attached and nice size closet. The second bedroom also sleeps two with a rack to hang clothes, and a full bath across the hall. There is a futon couch that will sleep two in the dining/common room with a fireplace and back patio with table and chairs. The family room has a sectional couch with an oversized comfortable chair. Cindy and Billy’s home felt like a home away from home to us. They have lots of family games to play, and even some toys for the little ones. They also have two full drawers of brochures for the surrounding areas and some magazines with information of the area."
2020-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing host with a great location. Cindy and Bill and truly good people.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice located home with an amazing view. Bill and Cindy were very nice. Great trip overall
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really like Cindy and Billy's place! The house is just like the pictures. Stylish and very cozy. Everything worked. I went with my eight month old baby and the kitchen was very equipped with everything I needed.
Unfortunately, on the last day we found 6 spiders around the house. We couldn't identify if they were poisonous. I took photos to review, but they were all over the house. That made me nervous because my baby is crawling and I lost the confidence to let him play, and I'm glad it was the last day. We believe they were in the fireplace, after lighting they spread around the house. Even with that, I would stay again. I hope they resolve this issue!"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful and the views are incredible . Very comfy beds and the shower is very comforting. Thank you ! The only thing is that they ask you to leave the garbage on the other side of the bridge to take out the sheets and towels. We weren't bothered by that but the cleaning service was being paid for by Airbnb so we didn't extend because we had to do that . We would also go again!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy is an outstanding host. The personal touches as well as her open and accommodating personality made our family feel welcome and embraced over the Xmas holidays. Her property is appropriately called, a little piece of heaven, and truly it is. Every room has a spectacular view and the property has a way of embracing you and making you feel as if you are nestling in the arms of the mountains. I can’t wait to return and hope to call this my little home away from home from now on."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy was a fantastic host. She was so warm and welcoming when we arrived. She was super communicative and responsive leading up to and throughout our stay. She left little notes around the house, welcoming us and guiding us. She was even gracious enough to let us check in early to avoid traveling during a storm. And the views from her place were really stunning, especially at sunrise. Would definitely recommend to a friend and stay again. Thanks Billy and Cindy!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Mike was super helpful and we will be back.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I enjoyed our stay and hope to return again in the future. To location is beautiful and the cottage was cozy, clean, and well appointed. A perfect place for our annual winter getaway weekend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was great. It was nice to have more space. The gas fireplace heated the whole cottage and then some. It was convenient to downtown Markleeville where we ate dinner both nights. It had a kitchenette which was fine for breakfast food. The only negative was not close to a grocery store. So best to do your grocery shopping at home and bring supplies with you. We skied at Kirkwood 1 day snd the commute to resort was easy.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We come back to Mike’s cottage for the second time this winter. It has quickly become a favorite for our family. The cottage is tasteful, cozy and has everything you could ask for! Our kids loved sleeping in the loft and playing with all the games, and we loved to comfy bed and great shower after a long day in the slopes. We will be back again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far the best AirBnB I have ever experienced. The cottage has a great layout and attention to detail. Clearly a lot of thought went into amenities for the comfort of guests. The Carson River runs right along the back yard, with a patio for dinner beneath the cottonwoods. It may feel rugged and remote but is actually a short drive to Markleeville, the county seat. A half hour takes you into South Lake Tahoe or the spectacular Mokelumne Wilderness."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host! Super communicative. Property was great, location was beautiful! Lots of board games, awesome gas fireplace, bathroom with heated floors, toaster oven, microwave. No stove, but everything we needed for our short stay. Only downside is that if it's wet or muddy, the long driveway might be an issue, but our Prius V managed on it anyway. It is in a woodsy location, so best to arrive during daylight if possible. 25 minute drive to Kirkwood via Carson pass, if there's a possibility of a snow storm, you definitely need to make sure you have chains and know how to use them."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect get-away, situated close to Hope Valley, Tahoe, and the Carson Valley while still being private and secluded. The cottage was beautifully appointed and had everything you could need. Comfortable beds and lots of room in the upstairs loft. Mike was responsive and helpful. Can't wait to come back and see it in all the other seasons of the year!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin in a beautiful location. Warm and cozy during a winter storm, great selection of board games, and larger than the pictures show. Quick drive to Kirkwood or Tahoe."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the cottage exceed our expectations. We felt safe, welcomed, and comfortable. Everything was clean and ready for us to feel right at home. The surrounding area is breathtaking. We will absolutely be returning, ready to make more memories!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay (Dad with two teenage kids). Beautiful location with a very cozy cottage. Lots of games at the house. Couches and beds were really comfy. The kitchenette had enough supplies to make some basic meals. The cottage is in a beautiful canyon and we went on many walks through the snow, and the kids gad fun building snow forts. We also went skiing at Kirkwood, which was about a 25 minute drive away. Overall a beautiful, cozy place to spend New Years!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay. Mike is a thoughtful host and very responsive. The location is great. There are beautiful aspen trees and a couple of nice creeks on the property. The cottage had everything we needed and it was very clean. The bed was comfortable. The heater/ fireplace worked well. We will definitely be back. Thank you!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful area, gorgeous cottage. Spacious feel, very clean, comfortable beds, thoughtful touches. Communicative host. Kitchen best for light cooking which leaves more time for exploring the area anyway. We could hear the highway a bit but that’s the nature of the canyon landscape here. It did not take away from the feeling of tranquility. We loved it!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place! I highly recommend staying here!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the cottage -- clean, comfortable, and in a beautiful location. Hoping we can go again sometime in a different season. Crazy about the aspen all around!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place, we had an amazing relaxing weekend. Everything is a described, and even better than described."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike’s cottage is situated on the banks of the Carson River next to Woodfords and just north of downtown Markleeville. It is well appointed and in excellent condition. It is very cozy and adequate for 2-4 people. Mike is very responsive and got back to us on requests/questions promptly.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"a gorgeous spot, very private and comfortable. great mattress, good shower; what else could you want?
There is limited kitchen space and spotty wi-fi, not crucial to us but may be to others."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Property is wonderful. Mike is a very accommodating host. You will not be disappointed.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great place, exactly as pictured. We had a very nice stay and would love to come back again."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! A get-away from it all, yet so close to kirkwood for a day a skiing."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,What a great property. I stayed for the month of February and feel sad leaving. The property is very well equipped and was very clean.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage: Super cozy, nicer and more spacious and comfy than it looks in the listing pictures. The view all around is so pretty too!
The Location: Just 25 minutes from Kirkwood and South Lake Tahoe. Markleeville is about ten minutes away and has a brewery (Cutthroat IPA is delicious) and little eateries.
The Host: Mike is super quick with his responses, very kind and considerate and just all-round such a pleasure to book with.
We LOVED our stay and will definitely be back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike was a generous host!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mike's place is absolutely charming. The house is in a lovely setting, surrounded by trees and next to a little river. We had a blast building snowmen and sledding on a little hill just next to. It's 25min drive from Kirkwood where we skied.
The house itself is very well equipped, comfortable and simply beautiful inside.
The kitchen is rather small but we managed to cook our simple dinners without problems. Beds are really comfy.
We had to leave one day before because of the snowstorm coming and we had problems getting out of the little driveway - our 2 wheel drive Mazda with chains got sucked in the snow. But Mike was very quick to react and the plow came almost immediately to clear the way. If you have winter tires or a 4x4 you won't have any problems.
The communication with Mike was very pleasant and very quick. We wish we could have stayed longer in this beautiful place."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was a perfect for our family weekend getaway. Beautiful location next to the creek and a comfortable, well thought out cabin with everything we needed. We hope to be back soon."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful. very secluded, which is what I like. I was able to drive and see lake tahoe, Truckee, Virginia city and Gardnerville in a day and make it back by 5pm after spending hours touring."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hope Valley is a delightful home base for your trip to Tahoe! This tasteful cabin and peaceful setting are simply lovely. Thank you, Mike!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a fantastic home. It's a large cottage with a lovely loft plus big bedroom. It has everything you need. Every detail has been thought through. The location is private and gorgeous. You can hear the river from the house. Highly recommend staying here.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property is simply amazing!! Very spacious and comfortable with a location that was perfect for our fishing trip.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful private getaway with all the amenities and comfy (huge) bed. Clean, conveniently located, private, and secluded. Being so (conveniently) close to the road, we did hear cars over the babbling brook, but we imagine that varies depending on the season. All in all, we highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute little stay on the river. Perfect for our family of five. Location was outstanding and cottage was very clean. Mike was a friendly host and responded to my questions promptly. We would definitely stay here again.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Pros: The cottage was easy to find, check in was easy and the river was in the backyard as described. It is close enough to Minden/Gardnerviile for groceries and lunch (go to Francisco's) and Blue Lake Rd where all our favorite painting spots are located. There was some noise from Hwy 88 although it was hard to distinguish it from the sound of the river rushing by. Otherwise it was very quiet at the end of a dirt road. There wasn't anyone occupying the house next door the entire week.
The cottage itself was very clean with many nice amenities and decor. The beds were comfortable too. Communication with Mike was great. He readily answered questions and even provided a DVD player at our request.
Cons: We found the one lightbulb in the kitchen insufficient for cooking with ease, the microwave making strange noises (so we were afraid to use it) and there was not enough light in the living room to read at night.

We had a pleasant and restful week."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and relaxing cottage. Beautiful location.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place, very clean (which is appreciated during COVID) and he has everything you may need, like plates, utensils, appliances (coffee and toaster oven, etc). Overall wonderful experience!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent, spacious cottage near Kirkwood. We loved the loft for the kids and the master bedroom was luxurious. The bed was so comfortable. The view of the mountains was spectacular. I highly recommend this rental!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our second time here! We love this cute cottage. It’s sparkling clean, has great amenities and the location is breathtaking! Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was sparkling clean, very comfortable, bigger than we expected, and had everything we needed. The gas fireplace works really well and made the place very cozy for our winter visit. They've put a lot of effort into making sure everything necessary is in place, with instructions, and even labels on light switches. Very nice."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A hidden gem! You have to stay here! The location is beautiful and made for an excellent couple getaway trip for my fiancé and I! We celebrated our 5 year anniversary at Mike’s place and it couldn’t have been anymore amazing! I thought it might be weird staying in someone’s guest house. But not at all! So much privacy! We will definitely be coming back!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very well situated cabin. Right in the center on valley under the blanket of fresh snow. The location is absolutely beautiful. It is little away from central crowded South Lake Tahoe which is a plus.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem of a place! Came for a quick weekend trip to ski at Kirkwood. We loved how cozy and clean the place was. Plenty of room for the two of us to spread out. Loved having the full fridge and hot plates! Lots of thoughtful touches, cozy blankets, the Bose Bluetooth player, all the kitchen items, fire and nice big bed! Thanks for a great stay! Hope we can come back soon!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect Sierra cabin retreat, cozy comfortable well appointed. Upstairs sleeping loft is wonderful for kids lots of games , game table and couch. Very relaxing place."
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious and well equipped cottage in a super nice remote spot near a small creek! Enjoyed a lot with family of 4, two adults and 2 kids"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in the quiet Tahoe wilderness...exactly as described, clean, cozy and all amenities needed for our ski trip! Highly recommend."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's place is tucked away from civilization. Huge, spacious, and very peaceful. It's close to major attractions. The main house is located next door but you still have your own backyard and privacy. We loved and enjoyed our stay. Definitely in our revisit list."
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Mike. We had such a great time. We loved the mnt views, playing by the river, the coziness of the cabin, and the proximity to great skiing and sledding. Looking forward to coming back."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location- quiet and close to lots of nice outdoor activities. Description of the property is spot on. It was appreciated that the house is stocked: hairdryer; spices; coffee; and shampoo etc. It is a kitchenette. You can not roast a turkey but you we cooked great meals with the appliances on hand. The items in the kitchen are thoughtfully curated. Owner was very friendly and communicated well.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was very comfortable, and the setting amongst the aspens and close to the river was lovely. Great location with very convenient access to both wilderness and nearby towns."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is a gem! It is conveniently located off highway 88 with lots of hiking trails within 10 minutes drive. The cottage is on a big land with beautiful landscapes, mountain in the background, aspen trees, and apple trees. There is a creek only a few steps from the backyard door. There is a house next to the cottage but you still have plenty of space and privacy for the cottage itself. Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable and kitchenette is fully stocked. There is no washer dryer in the cottage though. At night the stars and Milky Way above are AMAZING! If you open the window a bit you could sleep hearing the sound of the river.
Mike is a great host with quick responses to questions.
We are a family of four with preschoolers. My kids had so much fun playing by the river, exploring the space, playing a family game upstairs and gazing at the stars. We will definitely be back!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's place is awesome. The site is not only a perfect location for our traditional Fall drive exploration, the cottage was immaculate, felt like (better than) home, was peaceful, had beautiful design touches, had everything we needed in order to cook, sleep, read, relax. Mike was lovely, easy to communicate with."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little cabin in the mountains, with beautiful view and nearby river."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very comfortable cottage with loft.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fun, clean and quiet place:)"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This spot is a gem! We really enjoyed our stay.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home in a beautiful location. Mike was a great host and we wanted for nothing.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Comfortable cabin on the West Fork of the Carson River. Loved sitting outside next to the river morning and evening. The cabin itself was great for my family of 3. Our daughter loved the loft and skylights for looking at stars. Great stay.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was a great place to stay! It was very clean and comfortable, and had much of what you need. My kids loved the loft. We would definitely come back here again!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mike's cottage is a perfect place for a ski weekend at Kirkwood. The drive is about 20 minutes and is beautiful and easy. The place is very comfortable and bigger than it looks online.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a lovely getaway weekend here. The river is right out the back door and you can hear it when you open the windows. All the instructions where very clear which was super helpful because there is no cell service on your way in. Once there it was easy to connect to wi-fi so we could still be connected if we needed to. The cottage is very cozy and comfortable and just a pleasure to hang out in.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Better than what you'd expect. Perfect getaway cottage. I highly recommend it!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We just got back from 4 nights at Mike’s place. We loved how close it is to Kirkwood. We were happily surprised at the size of the cabin. From the outside it looks smaller than it is - my husband and I had our own room and there is a loft space with two beds.The heat from the fireplace heated the living room and loft space. Mike provided many board games in the loft space which we enjoyed playing. The living room has a very comfortable couch with blankets available for those cold nights. There is no stove/oven but there is a toaster oven, microwave and 2 electric plug in heating. Everything was well labeled. Clear instructions for check out. Complimentary shampoo, conditioner, soap, lots of towels, and coffee. Highly recommend for a family with 1 or 2 kids."
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Communication was quick and efficient. The cottage was pretty and amenities were as described in the listing.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's beautiful property is tucked away, providing a lot of privacy. The best parts: The West Fork Carson River runs THROUGH their property (!!) and the stars we saw each nights was better than any planetarium.
Mike was very responsive in our correspondences and provided a lot of information about the house and how to get there in advance.
Highly recommended!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the most adorable cottage in the perfect setting. Just the perfect place to get away and disconnect from the hustle and bustle of day to day life.
Cottage and super clean and has all the necessities (even more) for a getaway. Mike was a great and very responsive host. We will definitely return."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, nice views from deck, well appointed with many kitchen amenities, spacious rooms. Host was responsive and easy to communicate with."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location!
We truly enjoyed ourselves, it is very cozy. Great bedding, comfortable stay. Be aware that this is a cabin - Small shower, no table to eat at, hand wash dishes. It is also positioned next to a house- so there may be other guests about."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mike's place is great for a family trip away from ""city"" distractions! We played board games (many are provided in the cottage) and had adventures by the river in the backyard! Great place to connect as a family. It's location is great in regards to pools, hot springs, and hiking!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike's house is much better than expected. It's even much better than what's in the photo (since we went during summer time). Everything was great and we couldn't ask more for our weekend stay in Tahoe
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place to stay, tucked away 30-40 minutes from south lake depending on conditions. Very clean and host is very nice."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home exceeded our expectations- it was well stocked with pots, pans, and hot plates (3 burners!). Beds were comfy, fire place was terrific, and proximity to the creek was terrific. Could hear the river from the bedroom! Mike’s communication and supporting check-in info (in the book) was terrific. Really pleased with the value too. We plan to return!!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for a mountain escape!
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the cottage, it really was comfortable. Nice amenities, great to have the towels, soap, toilet paper, etc. The beds were warm with flannel sheets and very comfortable. We stayed with our two adult children and there was plenty of room. The kitchen was fine without the oven, we cooked on the stove top. It wasn't hard to find the place once you had the directions. It is about 20 minutes away from Kirkwood."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You will fall in love with this cottage! It is in a magnificently beautiful setting and the accommodations are so comfortable and cozy! We snuggled down Thanksgiving morning when we awake to new fallen snow. You will love your stay here! Thanks Mike!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great host. Nice house. Close to some of the incredible beauty of the Sierras.
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mike was one of the most responsive and accommodating Airbnb hosts ever. The place was right on the rushing Carson river and the views were incredible. Be sure to have dinner at Stonefly in Markleeville!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This listing perfect for people skiing at Kirkwood. It's about 30 mins drive. The check-in instructions from Mike was clear and helpful. Do read it before you lose your cellular signal. Otherwise it might be hard for you to find the listing. One thing to call out is the restrooms - it is very good and newly remodeled.
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at the cottage. It was very scenic, surrounded by mountains and you can hear the river from inside the house.
We drove to Kirkwood for snowboarding. It's about a 30 min drive (and I imagine it would be longer when there's actually snow on the ground), but staying at the spacious and cozy cottage after a fun day was lovely.
We loved eating at nearby Stonefly. There isn't a proper stovetop in the kitchen, so guests should be prepared to eat out."
2018-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Very scenic right by the river. Easy to get to, just wished we stayed longer!"
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's cottage is perfect for a couple, or a family (adults and kids). It actually felt larger than it looked from the pictures. The kitchen was well equipped and we cooked a lot even with just the two burner cooktop. The bathroom was nice with heated floor (wonderful on a cold winter morning). Beds wer comfortable with lovely linens.
Lots of board games and a wonderfully soft rug in the sitting area. We think it would be amazing to come back in the fall when the aspen turn color.
Restaurant recommendation: Stonefly in Markleeville. Amazing food and ambiance.
We will definitely remember this place."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this charming cottage. The inside was nicely decorated and very clean, make us feel like home away from home the minutes we walked in. The setting is perfect... back to the river and the mountain. We will be thrilled to come back again!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome, well set up cottage a few miles out of Markleeville. Incredible views from the home and property and was perfect for a weekend up there. The house is very well set up with all the basics you'll require for your stay. Thanks, Mike, for the such a great AirBnB experience!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really lovely cabin that is very well maintained and taken care of. We really enjoyed our weekend stay here and we had a blast. We walked around the property and went for a small picnic nearby and saw the sunset and sunrise. We felt comfortable and had everything we needed! We ate dinner at Sorensens Resort one night which was only a few miles down the road. Kirkwood is about 30 mins and Cross country about 10 mins drive. We really loved spending time here and would love to come back again!
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin! We were looking for a quiet, scenic place to spend the weekend, and this did not disappoint. Very clean and comfortable, and though it is in a secluded area that is off the beaten path it was perfect for what we wanted. The river and mountains on either side of the cabin are incredible, and the cabin itself is located in a perfect spot for skiing at Kirkwood or just hiking around that area. Didn't get much chance to explore the immediate area, but bet in the summer it will be fantastic."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An ideal location to get away! Cozy and comfortable. We were there during bad weather and were delighted to hang in front of the fire. Don't plan for elaborate cooking as the kitchen is tight and does not have an oven. But there are charming places nearby for dining.
And the bed is VERY comfy!
Thanks Mike!"
2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mike's cottage is in a georgeous secluded location. The architecture and interior design are clean and modern. The bedding and linens were top notch and I felt as if much care was taken to create a great experience for guests. Everything was new and sparkling clean. The kitchen was well appointed. Families should know that there is a shower not a tub, the stove is a two burner portable stove that sits on the counter top, and there is only seating for two at a bar for eating. We are a family of four and we were perfectly happy cooking, eating, and playing Mike's extensive collection of board games in this charming space. The decor is modern cabin chic with beautiful textures, neutral colors, and a cohesive design. You can't imagine how soft the area rug and throw blankets are in the living room. The fireplace is the main source of heat and is very cozy. Behind the cottage is a creek that you can see from the house. The host was easy to work with, highly responsive, and kind. I highly recommend this property."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Me and my friends had a great and comfortable stay at Burt’s property.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute place. love the front yard so much. Right in town but feels very private. Hot tub was so nice on the chilly nights to soothe the muscles after hiking around the hot springs just down the road. If you want an amazing dinner, the restaurant two doors down will not disappoint. The Stone Fly was the name. The general store next door has a good variety albeit small grocery selection.
The cabin is very nicely insulated from the outside noise. Great kitchen appliances with most everything you need to cook meals. The space is really efficiently used. Loved the place and highly recommend it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay. Within walking distance to some very great restaurants, especially the Stonefly. We enjoyed the hot tub and our dogs enjoyed the yard. We would definitely stay there again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Burt's place was fantastic! It's right next to a wonderful little grocery store and two great restaurants, and just down the road from the Grover Hot Springs. The hot tub was wonderful to relax in and the kitchen is very nice. We had a great time and are looking forward to coming back soon!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place in the heart of downtown. Tons of character. Hot Tub and beautiful kitchen appliances were highlights. Yard area was fenced off and super private. Short walk to some great dining options.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great location in Merkleeville; right on the main road with easy walking to restaurants and not far from Kirkwood and other South Lake Tahoe locations.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Good location. Responsive host. Would stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place, and our amicable host Burt are true CA GEMS.
We stayed here for quick access to Kirkwood and the surrounding area and our expectations were completely blown away.
The house is cozy as hell, surrounded by a beautiful, dog friendly yard and the hot tub was just pitch perfect.
The place couldn’t be better situated in the quaint town of Markleeville, literally right between a delicious restaurant called Stone Fly and a well-stocked general store. Beyond retreat."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Burt’s cabin for 4 nights and it was absolutely wonderful. The cabin was easy to find, spotless, well-stocked, and super cozy. The kitchen was the best stocked Airbnb kitchen I’ve ever seen! Tons of pots and pans, everything we needed to cook dinner each night. Also just a note that older reviews mention there only being one bathroom, but there is a half bath downstairs. The hot tub was fabulous and the yard was private and great for the kids to play. Burt was incredibly helpful and responsive leading up to our trip. The neighborhood is super cute. We loved taking walks, popping into the general store, and having beers at the brewery across the street. Thanks Burt! We will be back."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing stay here . Great location and always feels like home.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Second time at Burt’s place . I am glad to say we made a second trip back loved it so much such a cozy stay , I LOVE the bed sheets so much I was looking forward to they stay in the bed , thank you hurt for the stay , can’t wait to be back again such a perfect little home away from home 🏠 definitely one off the cleanest places I’ve stayed at"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fab little house. Perfect for our weekend. We were skiing in Kirkwood and it was infinitely better than staying at Kirkwood itself. Love Markleyville.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was very cozy and warm. The jacuzzi was very comfortable and the surroundings were beautiful. We enjoyed our evenings in the jacuzzi. The only complaint we had was the house was a bit rustic and outdated. Opening the doors was rough at night because they were very loud and would wake everyone up. There was not much space in bedrooms to store our items because the drawers were filled with towels and linens. The overall experience was pleasant, however we would have appreciated if the check out was a little later. 10am seems too early when other homes and hotels allow for a later checkout. We tried to contact the host but did not get a response."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Burt's place is comfortable and cozy for up to 4 people, has a great fenced yard for dogs, hot tub, and great location in Markleeville. House was very clean. Parking convenient in front of the house. Wonderful place and area to stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really sweet house in a great location. Very comfortable for my family. We loved the hot tub. And great little library in Markleeville! They gave me a temporary library card so we were able to borrow books.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Burt’s place was beyond beautiful! The house was so nice , felt right at home ! I’m glad we went when we did the weather was beautiful, woke up to a blanket of snow everywhere outside the town was cute , the bed was comfortable, probably my favorite thing in the house lol. I can’t wait to come back again it was such a delightful stay, the stay was perfect."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Secluded while feeling safe and comfortable. The scenery was stunning and the cabin was spotless. The cherry on top was the jacuzzi and backyard beneath the trees and stars.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I loved this little cabin. It was so welcoming walking into the outside lights along the fence on a cold night. The inside was very clean along with all the kitchen appliances and cookware. Very organized home and we would love to come again. The only thing we found different from other airbnbs is that there were no board games, we usually bring our own but we had to work the day of arrival and were in a rush. With that being said, many of our games we've purchased are due to other airbnbs. But the stay was still amazing, there is wifi and streaming apps and the jacuzzi was so relaxing . Our German shepherd also had a great time!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay for a couple nights to hike! The kitchen had everything you could ask for, and the TV was set for any streaming service which was perfect for a movie night.
Everything was squeaky clean, and the setting was super cozy between the wood stove, big bedroom, and roomy living room.
Can’t recommend enough!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location. Right next door to the best restaurant, Stonefly. Make sure to make reservations for dinner. Great kitchen. Could make a thanksgiving feast there. Charming and cozy. Great yard for our dogs."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have been to Burt's Place numerous times. It is the only place we will stay in Markleeville .We loveBurt's because it is well stocked, clean, and very relaxing. Burtis also a very responsive host. We love Burt because he always takes good care of us. We'll be back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great relaxing place! And so close to fishing!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great cabin close to restaurants and a market, easy location for hiking and exploring. Lovely fenced in backyard. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay right in downtown Markleeville! You can walk through town to various attractions such as the historic museum and school, Cutthroat tavern, Stonefly restaurant, and if you prefer to cook but didn’t plan to bring food with you, is right next door to the Markleeville General Store. The cabin is perfectly set up with everything you need, and yet is minimal and clean. The beds are fantastic and cozy and you will sleep well. The outdoor space is charming and relaxing, although tucked right in amongst the busy downtown area it has the feel of being more remote and is surprisingly quiet. We really enjoyed our stay as a family, and we’re able to make our annual visit to my great grandfather’s high Sierra cowboy camp just up Ebbetts pass and hike the PCT. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay, we will most definitely be back again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Hi everyone,
This place was really amazing, felt home. It was super clean and we really enjoyed the jacuzzi… The house was peaceful and serene and we would love to visit again. Highly recommend this place.
Thank you Burt for everything."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a gem! Has everything you could possibly desire. The pictures do not lie!
We travel often with our two dogs. Usually, we have to pick and choose what amenities are more important to us, because very rarely does a house have everything on our checklist. But this house, has everything!
Fully equipped kitchen with HIGH QUALITY appliances. Anyone who gets down in the kitchen can truly appreciate what it has to offer.
Comfy, plush beds and couch.
Good sized backyard for pets and/or kids, which includes a beautiful full size spa.
40 mins outside of South Lake Tahoe. For us, it’s perfectly located. The town is slow, quiet, and serene. Close enough for a day trip to Tahoe, (which includes a beautiful drive, with views you wouldn’t believe).
The host was extremely responsive and friendly.
Only thing I’d recommend is making sure you grab some groceries before you get there! The town closes up early on weekdays.
Don’t be like us. Plan ahead! :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place in a wonderful place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to take my son fishing, we would love to stay at Burt’s again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spic and span! Every detail thought of… Super comfy beds with soft white linens, fluffy pillows and duvet.
Plenty of everything - towels and extra sheets (to snooze on the plush couch).
Quiet, peaceful - we loved relaxing on the patio, looking at the stars, listening to the creek and forest, and enjoying a good glass of wine. The garden is charming… with a lilac that reminded me of my mom’s garden in Tahoe.
We made great meals thanks to the fully-appointed (chef quality) kitchen - full size fridge and 6-burner stove. (New appliances.) The dishwasher, washer and dryer made it extra nice. My husband appreciated that the knives were good and sharp.
It’s literally in the middle of (the tiny) historic downtown, near the general store (ice cream sandwiches!) and good dining options in every price range.
Beware that the bathtub has a high side which took some maneuvering, and brighter folks will figure out the remote controls faster than I.
We loved it and would love to come back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Loads of gratitude to the hosts.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another wonderful annual vacation thanks to Burt and his awesome place.
From the wonderful upgrade of the hot tub and various additions to the inside of the cabin since we last visited, to the tranquil private deck and the kindness Burt always shows us, we had another wonderful stay. Also, can’t beat being that close to our favorite restaurant of all time: StoneFly. And the close vicinity to the stunning jewels Ebbetts Pass and the surrounding Sierra’s has to offer is beyond worth it. Looking forward to next year. Thanks again so much, Burt!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. No A/C but lots of fans that helped keep it cool. Really cute town and the yard was nice and private.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Burt's home in the center of Markleeville's is private, comfortable and very relaxing. We particularly enjoyed the well-appointed kitchen and lovely outdoor deck. It was such a plus that we could bring our dog on this trip!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I have been here many times. We love Burt's Place. Every time we visit, Burt has made some kind of improvement. This visit we found that he had added a half bath downstairs (a huge plus) , a brand new and larger hot tub, and a new wifi that allowed me to make calls and texts on my cell. We love that we get to bring our dogs along. Burt is a superhost and very responsive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the cutest cabin! Everything was perfect and the hot tub in the desk with a full moon was perfect!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This cute little cottage was the perfect place to spend my wife’s birthday with our 3 kids. It’s a great home base for surrounding activities and it’s tastefully decorated, has all the necessities plus a jacuzzi hot tub, and boasts a cozy loft-like upper bedroom with a cabin feel that we all ended up fighting over. Burt was very communicative and it’s obvious he takes pride in this rental. However, we were caught off guard by the not-so-clean bedding. There were several hairs (maybe animal?) in the sheets and after pulling down the top sheet to possibly sleep on top of it, we found even more hair which forced us to take off the bedding completely. Luckily, there were several more sets of extra sheets and we had brought our own blankets anyway. My wife is a stickler for cleanliness so she was not impressed but we were able to make it work. Overall, we had a great trip."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the cabin. Located right next to a general store and a brewery, it’s in a great location.
The kitchen had every tool you could need, and the fridge had some essentials like mayo and ketchup. Brand new oven and dishwasher.
The hot tub was wonderful! There were tons of towels which came in handy. The beds were super comfortable.
Our only negative was that the gas company had forgotten to replenish the propane, so we had no heat, no hot water, and a non working oven and stove which wasn’t great, especially on Thanksgiving day. However, the owner was super responsive and got the gas company to come in two hours."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Burt's cabin. The hot tub is phenomenal on a cold winter day. Markleeville is beautiful, and the pub across the street Cutthroat is really fun. Lovely stargazing as well. Everything we wanted to get away and relax for a weekend"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy cabin in excellent location- not too far from Hope Valley and Grover hot springs. The beds were super comfortable, there’s lots of space in the kitchen with new appliances, a lovely outdoor hot tub, and we really appreciated the laundry facilities too!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is a great place to stay and was as described in the posting. The kitchen has great appliances and everything was very clean.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Burt's Place in a jewel! This is our 6 or 7th stay. Obviously we love this place. Burt has been making some really nice upgrades since our last stay in May. Always love our visit to this house. Especially love that our furbabies get to join us.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"great house and location, easy communication and access"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location in our favorite town of Markleeville. Loved the outdoor deck with hot tub and cozy living room and kitchen. The high-end appliances were a huge plus! We’ll be back!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay and clean.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If Markleeville is where you want to be, this is a great spot. Its a cute small town and this place is right between the general store and the best restaurant in town and directly across the street from the nice tavern restaurant in town. There is a fully functional kitchen with all the items you need to be self-sufficient if you want that and washer and dryer to do laundry if needed. The giant TV in the upstairs bedroom is a theater experience. Note there is not AC in the place so depending time of year, it can get a little warm. There are lots of fans and since it cools off at night and the house is shaded by big trees, even in the hottest days of summer, closing windows in the morning keeps the place quite cool all day. Nice patio to hang out on with hot tub. And if you do have any issue, the host is super responsive. Rent this place with confidence."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This well-appointed house in an amazing location was perfect for our cycling trip to Markleeville. The beds and linens were super comfy, and we enjoyed the hot tub after a long bike ride. We even got to enjoy a nice dinner out at the restaurant two doors down. I would definitely stay here again and hopefully for longer next time."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location! High quality utensils, excellent hot tub and B-B-Que. Burt was very responsive to questions we had. The only caveat is if you have trouble with stairs, that's the only way to the bathroom. Otherwise, top-notch!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the place to stay while in Alpine County! As others have mentioned, fantastic location, super comfy beds and bedding, very clean and a host that is the perfect balance of being relaxed and welcoming, while attentive to anything you should need. The deck and hot tub were top notch - we throughly enjoyed the peace and quiet under the stars. We’ll be back for all of the above, plus the fishing, great food, and proximity to the Carson City hot springs, which was a lot of fun. Book and enjoy!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Burt's place is lovely. This was our 5th stay. Comfy beds, wonderful spacious deck with hot tub, and great fenced yard for our dogs. There are several delicious restaurants just a few doors away. Burt is VERY GOOD about responding to you quickly."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space for a family. Super comfy living room area. Beds are warm and comfortable. Loved how we were able to walk across the street to Cutthroat's for some yummy beer and food. Easy drive to Kirkwood. Lots of great hikes nearby. Sad to see so much destruction from the fires, but glad to see this tiny town made it through!"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great spot for a getaway for two. Cozy retreat for peace and quiet. Winter hours for the restaurants were limited. Plan ahead. Summer time is probably better. I would go back for another visit in the future.
2022-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is perfect for two people.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time in Markleeville during winter season. Great places to eat!! The General store next door opens in April 2022, as it has been under repair from the fires. It was a cute little house and great to have the hot tub. The heater was perfectly fine and warmed the house. We do pay $100 per guest to cover a cleaner, so I was surprised the stove was greasy, and the bathroom floor and rug were not clean. Everything else was fine. It’s a great location with 30 min to Kirkwood, skiing, and 45 min to Carson city Hot springs. Recommend to stay here."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy little place in a great little town!! Definitely coming back!!!!

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent three nice in the Cozy Cabin in Markleeville in winter.
It’s well equipped and the hot tub did wonders after two days’ skiing in nearby Kirkwood and Heavenly. The two king beds let us wake rested for the next day’s adventure.
Would consider staying here again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It is a small house but it has everything we need!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks to record-breaking snow storms, all the roads were closed to get to Burt’s place during the time of our reservation. Burt was super accommodating and refunded us the amount we had paid. We hope we can get there someday!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location, great place. Burt is very good in communication. Loved using the hot tub in winter. Carry body wash/soap and shampoo with you. I recommend this place to everyone looking to ski near lake tahoe."

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, cozy cabin in a super convienient location - everything else in Markleeville was just a few steps away! The jacuzzi was everything we'd hoped for, and the surrounding roads & trails were absolutely gorgeous. Never been to Markleeville before, but now I definitely want tk go back. Thanks to Burt for the nice place & being a helpful host!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy comfortable place! Love the atmosphere and energy! The Cutthroat has amazing food with great outdoor seating area. Definitely will do it again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in the area for a wedding. Great location in the middle of a sweet, peaceful, lazy little town. The bar and restaurant are just steps away. The general store is right next door but happened to be closed while we were there. The deck, outside seating, jacuzzi, and fenced in yard are really nice. The house was clean, spacious, and very comfortable for the 5 of us. Sharing an upstairs bathroom may be challenging for some but we're used to that. Beds and couch were big and very comfy. Communicating with Burt and check in was really easy."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall a good experience. I would note the only bathroom is on the second floor off of the second bedroom.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place right in the middle of Markleeville, which is a cool little town. Short walk to everything and good Basecamp for exploring the area."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our second year in a row and this little gem in high Sierra country has officially become a yearly ritual!
30-second walk from one of the best restaurants in California in my foodie opinion, Stonefly, Burt’s is the perfect pairing of privacy, convience and relaxation in the pristine nature of the Sierra’s.
This year, unfortunately, the hot tub was being repaired during our stay so we didn’t get our nightly soak under the stars. Burt did a good job of handling it though & even refund one of our nights for the unexpected disappointment.
We still enjoyed having our own private deck for yoga & star gazing and loved the down town store, live music over the weekend and of courses the proximity to the wilderness and forests of the Pass.
We look forward to our trip up again next summer!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect getaway town close to Tahoe. Old house with lots of character, and new amenities. Town is very small and extremely quiet. Can’t wait to come back to this location."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was great! The kitchen was stocked with all the needed cooking utensils. The beds were comfortable and the hot tub was great for star gazing! They are not exaggerating when they say it is in the center of town! We would love to come back again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, great location! So close to Tahoe, Carson City and Reno! Not to mention the the local stuff to do, like Grover Springs! The town is small and the people are very friendly! The store owners next door have everything you need and are great to talk to! This place has everything you need for a comfortable stay!"
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute dog friendly home! The hot tub was perfect and our pup was a big fan of the backyard
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, location and value for money. House is right behind a wooden bench. Really cool neighborhood, with a cozy feel! The restaurant/ pub across the street ( cutthroat) had friendly hosts and great food and drinks! We picked food both nights and loved it! Highly Recommend this for a couple or a small family!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a close spot to the local hot springs but ended up really enjoying the town of Markleeville as well. Despite being on the main strip, this quiet town made us feel like we had plenty of privacy. All of the beds and furniture were super comfortable and there were plenty of extra towels if needed. It was clean, welcoming, and as it states, very cozy. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Markleeville! Perfect spot for me & my girlfriend to meet up & spend a few fun days snowboarding. Loved the fact that I could bring along my dogs. The hot tub was an added bonus after full days on the mountain it was perfect! Cant wait to book it again!
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Burt was very kind and responsive.
House:
Pros- very comfy furniture, both beds and the couch are very comfy.
House was very clean and the linens were very fresh, smelled like a hotel!
Cons- if you check in after the general store closes, make sure to have the basics for meals (cooking oil, foil, dish soap, and paper towels had to be bought the next day)
Location:
Pros- a very quick drive to south tahoe and to the hot springs
Cons- was hoping to try the local brewery, but there were 20 people inside and not a single mask was seen. Not a covid friendly town"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place in a really fun little town.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place to stay in Markleeville. We stayed here with an other couple and really enjoyed this place! The hot tub and the Market next door is a real +
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was great - only downside is the steep stairs to get to the only bathroom on the second floor. Otherwise the house has everything you need for a nice stay in the mountains!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is great! Sharpest knives I've ever used at an Airbnb. It wasn't as issue for us but the only bathroom is attached to the upstairs bedroom.
2021-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay, clean, great hot tub for a family, however if you have two couples you have to share a bathroom which is inside of the upstairs bedroom."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed the jacuzzi and our dogs loved running around in the fenced yard! The nearby brewery had awesome food and the general store was nicely stocked. We loved the small town feel and being able to walk to everything. Quick drive to Tahoe.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was very cozy, the beds were super comfortable! The snow was melting so it was a little muddy but my fault for not checking the weather. The hot tub was amazing! It was already on and we didn’t have to worry about it (: there are plates and cups and pans and oven and dishwasher work! There are some spices and nothing in the kitchen so make sure you bring the groceries you need! There was extra blanket and even a room separator for the dogs, my dogs loved it! Thank you!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, right next to a grocery store and gas station and about 30 mins drive from Kirkwood resort. The place is really clean and cozy, would definitely come back again!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at Burts place. Had everything we needed (just 2 of us!) and lots of room to spread out. Cutthroat Brewery right across the street had delicious food but we also cooked in the kitchen. Kitchen was well stocked with everything you need (always a blessing!). Thanks again!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 2 nights to adventure to Tahoe! It was the perfect place for my fiancé and I and our pup! The hot tub was a nice relaxing touch to a very cold weekend! We were very grateful the house was well stocked with all types of dishes and openers we needed for a successful weekend!
Side note* I would not recommend this place to anyone needing handicap accommodations because it was not shoveled with the snow and the only bathroom is on the second floor requiring walking up stairs.
Will definitely consider again in the future!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Burt’s place was such an amazing spot to get snowed into. We had access to all three ski mountains, plenty of larger markets, but most importantly the town of Markleeville had everything we needed. From the night we arrived until the day we left, J Marklee Toll Station was our saving grace. Once the blizzard hit we appreciated the hot tub more than ever, cozy loft lighting, and the delicious feast awaiting us across the way every night. Lots of love for the hot tub, dishwasher, big beds, and the great shower. Thank you so much Burt!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place was very nice and spacious. Will be coming back!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend, my two dogs, and I had a great time staying at Burt's place! The cabin was clean and cozy, with a fenced in back/front yard, a Jacuzzi, and working WiFi!
We did not have any issues, besides the town of Markleeville being barren, and Burt was always very quick to respond to any questions we had. Check-in / Check-out process was very smooth.
5 Stars all-around would recommend this place to travelers with dogs looking for somewhere to stay in the area!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in a Burt’s house for two days for New Years celebration. It was sparkling clean, comfortable, it also was bigger than we expected, which is great!

Literally the house had everything we needed and more, there was a lovely trail behind the sheriff station that we took, the scenery was great, the people were very friendly and it was so quiet and that’s what my family and I needed. It was right next door to a General store which had everything we needed. We only have one hiccup...well to be honest, I had a hiccup, the beds mattresses are memory foam mattresses and I can’t sleep on those even though I tried, I have a hard time sleeping other then that it was excellent!!! Pass my expectations. Thank you Mr. Burt"

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location and character of this cute spot can't be beat! Perfect for our fall colors getaway in a sleepy historical town. The only downside is the sole bathroom which is in the upstairs loft, however this is clearly communicated in the listing."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cozy cabin was the perfect escape for families and dog owners alike. Markleeville is the cutest little place and the recreation nearby is awesome! Burt was responsive and kind, we were very high strung trying to find a place where we could self-evacuate from the nearby fires at our home. The weekend was exactly what my family needed, an idyllic escape, and the cabin made us feel at home. We cannot recommend it enough, although we kind of want to keep it a secret! But it’s too good not to share! Thank you, Burt!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"10/10 would recommend. The place was clean and well equipped for a nice vacation into the Mountains. If you’re looking for a place that is closer to the hiking off Route 4 than South Lake Tahoe, this is a great spot."

I highly recommend a weekend at Burt’s house ."
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a great spot as a basecamp for exploring the Mokelumne Wilderness and Alpine County areas, conveniently located off Hwy 89 next door to the general store.
Simple and easy check in. Burt was a nice host, friendly and available for any questions.
Bed was clean and comfy, perfect for a good night’s rest after hiking in the mountains. Two bedrooms, both tidy and cosy with ample pillows and bedding.
Bathroom was clean and the downstairs bedroom cabinet was stocked with clean towels. Shower tub wall was high but simple for us to navigate in/out.
Kitchen was great for preparing our dinner with ample kitchen wares for cooking. There are a few cooking staples in the unit, but make sure to bring your favorite prep ingredients and seasonings. Hot tub was available to us, but we did not have the time to use it.
We wish we had more time to explore this area; we would highly recommend this listing and would book here again."

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If you're headed to Markleeville - and you probably should - there's no place better than Burt's. Great town, great host, great space. Thanks"
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Burt’s place is a cozy gem in Markleeville. The amenities are awesome and the place is super clean! If in Markleeville I would highly recommend!
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was amazing ! It had everything we needed, it’s a cute little town, the home itself was very comfortable, and it felt very homey. Bert was very attentive and quick to respond when needed. The jacuzzi was a nice touch, our family really enjoyed it. We will definitely be coming back. If i could give more then 5 stars, I would. Can’t wait to come back!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent vacation spot with quick drive to Grover Hot Springs. We will be back again.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay in 3 months. WE LOVE Burt's cabin!! It is clean and comfy. The kitchen is well equipped. The beds are very comfortable with lovely linens. The hot tub is a big plus. We especially appreciated that we could bring our dogs with us. They really enjoyed the yard. Burt is great and very quick to respond to messages.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean. Great location. Burt responds quickly to questions. Great bar with live music on Friday night a block away.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful house in a wonderful town. Will definitely be back. The hot tub was especially nice on the chilly nights
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. Center of Markleeville and in walking distance of a great bar and restaurant and then the general store right next door. Secluded but still super close to everything. The vibe of the whole spot is just perfect for a small weekend getaway!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An oasis in an oasis! Burt's place is a perfect home base for enjoying all serenity that Markleeville and Alpine County have to offer. Check in and out was a breeze. The place was well appointed with comfortable beds, clean linens, well equipped kitchen, BBQ, and a nice hot jacuzzi for enjoying a cool night looking at the stars. Burt's place felt like staying at a friend's house for the weekend. If you're reading this, look no further and book right away!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The yard is amazing with lots of shade
The deck with BBQ and hot tub are perfect for relaxing
The white sheets and towels were super amazingly white and bright
The whole house was very clean
The general store is super helpful
The fishing access was great
I will definitely stay again"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Burt's place was really a great home for our visit. The outside space and hot tub are great, and the location for Markleeville is perfect. Super, super clean and comfortable with a well equipped kitchen. I recommend Burt's place for any group from 2 to 4 and we hope to return for another stay soon."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really wish I could give this cabin a 1 Star rating just so no one else will find it in their search but I certainly can’t do that. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. It was the most perfect location for our needs... a weekend of biking, fishing, and just chilling. The location is perfect. We never had to move our car because all the perfect rides started from the front door. And if we ran out of beer? Just walk next door to the general store! The cabin is clean, super comfy bed and has all the amenities of home. Burt was always accessible by messaging with quick responses. I’ll definitely come back next summer for more altitude training!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful little house. It is tastefully decorated. The kitchen is well equipped. The beds are very comfortable with very nice linens. It couldn't be better located in Markleeville. The hot tub was a definite plus and so relaxing . We thoroughly enjoyed eating our meals on the deck and just sitting and relaxing on the chaises. The dogs loved the yard. This was a great place to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday. We will definitely be back.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place to stay! Centrally located in Markleeville, right next to the general store. The deck in front is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy meals. The beds are so comfortable. The kitchen is spacious and well equipped. This may become our new summer vacation spot!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location right next to the general store, yet tucked away and feels very private. Can’t wait to come back."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great host. Was very a available.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great house, great host, great town... loved getting away from it all in this sleepy town and the house had everything you could want. Need advice on what to do? Ask the ladies who run the general store next door. They were amazing and have about everything you could want. Hungry? Check out the restaurants, all great! Will be returning to this great spot!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and the hot tub is icing on the cake. The host, Burt, response almost instantly day before and during the stay should you have any questions. All the amenities you could ever need, great location next to a general store that also has just about anything you’d need. Fun small town and only bummer was the Cutthroat bar isn’t open for business."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage that had lots of amenities! Much better than other rentals, it's a home away from home. You don't need to bring anything but clothes and food if your going to cook. Kitchen is well stocked with everything you will need and then some. We had a great stay!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place in markleeville. convenient/easy.
2019-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, everything you need is there, only annoying part is the single bathroom upstairs, but wasn't too bad"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great peaceful out-of-the-way place to stay! Lots of outdoor things to do nearby—skiing, hiking, fishing, & hot springs. Bar, restaurant, store, and post office are all within walking distance. And if you want more “civilization”, South Lake Tahoe is about 40 minutes away. The cabin was clean and comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped. While we didn’t wind up using it, it was nice to have a washer & dryer on the premises. Our dogs enjoyed the fully fenced yard (as did I—such a treat not to have to walk them first thing in the morning and last thing at night!) and lying in the sun on the deck. Burt was very responsive to our questions, and even let me know ahead of time that the fence might be damaged due to snow (it had been fixed prior to our arrival.) We’ll definitely be back!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a sweet place, we went there to spend a weekend skiing with friends. The house has a hot tub and it was nice to return home to it in the evening"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house in a small town, A go to if your looking to relax!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Location right in markleeville was super convenient, right next to a great cafe, restaurant, general store. Very comfortable space, perfect for our stay!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Burt was an incredibly responsive host and our stay was magnificent. We went to a nearby hot springs (8 min drive) and sledded on a local hill (5 min walk). Downtown Markleeville is a pretty fun place, with a nice cafe down the street and a very convenient general store next door.
As for the accommodations, we were very pleased by the comfort of the beds, and the home entertainment system (he has Netflix ^_^). The only downside for us was that we went in a group of 4 so the couple that stayed downstairs had to walk up the stairs through the other bedroom to use the bathroom. Not a huge deal, but something to consider if you are going in a larger group."
2019-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin in a great location, close to Tahoe but removed enough to be away from any hustle and bustle. Wish the bathroom was downstairs."
2018-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Burt and his home were great! The house was clean, warm and welcoming. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook. The beds and linens were very comfortable and the TV's and Wifi were exceptional. The house and yard are dog friendly. The town is quiet and beautiful, perfect to walk around and explore nature. We had a wonderful time at this home!"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Burt is a fantastic host! The cabin is as advertised, in a cute little town not far from Kirkwood Resort and Grover Hot Springs, and Burt's house has everything you could need. My wife and our 2 pups had a wonderful time at Burt's home. We had a little issue with the hot tub, but Burt was super communicative and resolved it quickly. Definitely would consider Burt's house again if we are in the area."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Burts place was such a nice surprise. The hot tub was amazing. The place was cozy (once we gave the heaters a chance to heat things up which took a little long to do upon arrival, but after that, smooth sailing!) The place is WELL equipped. It's obvious the hosts use this place themselves, all the essentials were very covered. The kids loved the place too, and so did our dog! We would TOTALLY come back and stay here again. Make sure to take the waterfall/hot springs hike a few miles away from Burt's place. It was so much fun!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described in the posting. Our dog loved the yard.
2018-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great experience here! Lovely space for a cozy retreat. Hot tub is divine, and the beds are very comfortable. Would love to visit again."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Burt and family are wonderful hosts and we had a wonderful time in their sweet mountain home. Their Markleeville house is a great location, right in town, easy drive to Grover Hot Springs and fly fishing on the Carson River. Everything was well stocked and ready for guests. We loved just hanging out in the cozy house, cooking and bbqing, and the hot tub was a special treat. We can't wait to visit again."
2018-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Communication with Burt was great from the beginning all the way through our stay. The hot tub is amazing! We were in it everyday. It was great sitting in the hot tub enjoying the fresh mountain air. The beds were very comfortable and the huge tv upstairs was great to snuggle in for movie night! The place is pet friendly, as noted, so there was a bit of ""dog smell,"" but for those that travel with their furry friends this would be a great place."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Located right in town within walking distance to a wonderful restaurant. Lovely privacy in the back yard to enjoy the hot tub!
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house to spend some quite time!
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Bring your iron and hair dyer.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely the most perfect place for us to stay on our Memorial Day weekend getaway! Very close to all that South Lake Tahoe has to offer while still being quiet and tucked away. The room was extremely clean and private. We had everything we needed and the hosts checked in regularly to make sure all of our needs were met. If we ever need a place to stay in South Lake Tahoe again, we will try to book here first!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I had a great time staying at Jennifer and Daniel’s studio, there is a small wooded area down the street which was perfect for me to take my dog out in the mornings!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place and nice hosts! 5 stars!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was as described and worked well for my stay. Hosts were friendly & communication was good. Easy to find and comfortable.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot in South Lake Tahoe that is close to Sierra at Tahoe, restaurants and bars near the lake, and hiking / walking paths, especially dog friendly! Jennifer and Daniel were great hosts with lots of local recommendations and made our stay with our dog so enjoyable! We would definitely be back again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an unexpected change of plans and Jennifer and Daniel were very friendly and accommodating to our requests. Their place is clean and cozy and the check-in and checkout process was very straightforward and convenient.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Daniel's stay was the perfect resting spot we needed between two full days of snowboarding. They were super communicative about how to get there and we found the place without any problems. The room is super cozy, quaint, and had everything we could ever need! Kitchenware, appliances, coffee, heaters, extra blankets and towels, TV, etc. We settled in quickly and had an incredibly relaxing night! The street it's on is also beautiful and peaceful - we were greeted with fresh snow in the morning and were in awe with the view. Will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most professional, super helpful, kind, and amazing overall satisfying experiences. I would highly recommend staying here every time you go to Tahoe."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer & Daniel made for a delightful stay at their well-provisioned place. The kitchen nook is stocked with a coffee maker, microwave, and cutting board, which made breakfast an easy task. The location was great, and I felt right at home getting settled in."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it was so pretty with the fresh snow. the location was a ten minute drive to the main hub of south lake Tahoe. if you are going in the winter, be sure to have a 4x4 or AWD vehicle, as it may be will be very helpful in incliment snowy weather. the hosts left us 2 pairs of snow shoes which were very necessary for the Cascade Falls trail as there was 2-3ft deep of snow to pass through, but it was so beautiful and unique from the hikes im used to doing (sans snow). the kitchenette was perfectly equipped to make a easy breakfast, and fresh coffee grounds were provided for us. neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. unfortunately the weather predictions made us have to leave a day early, but the hosts did notify us of the storm warnings and offered us a very discounted rate if we needed to stay an extra night for our safety. they were easy to communicate with too. wish we could have stayed longer!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a Gem in Tahoe. So pleased the room, the neighborhood and Jennifer’s attention to detail. She was so welcoming to not only myself but my pups too. The fact there was creamer for coffee and beers in the fridge. She deserves 10/10. My dog and I cant wait to come back."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location and the place were really good. The micro kitchen was very well stocked with toaster, kettle, coffee machine and everything. Our only gripe was the lack of heating. There was only a small personal heater that took 3 to 4 hours to heat the space. Everytime we came back to the room, it was freezing cold until the personal heater could heat up the space.
We asked the hosts to turn on the central heating which the instructions mention they dont because it makes noise (get it fixed then). We told them we dont mind the noise because it was cold the entire night. The hosts did not see the message until 1hr before check out and asked if we still needed the heating."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"could not have asked for a better experience. The 3 of us (myself, wife, and 120lb malamute) were very comfortable. Served as a great launch pad for activities, but we also enjoyed simply relaxing and watching movies. Very comfy with everything we needed. The neighborhood was very nice (and flat) and great for walking our dog. We made this booking last minute as we wanted to get our pup up to the snow for his 7th birthday. Jennifer was extremely accommodating and even left a gift for Ranger. We'll surely be looking to come back!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts! Cleaned driveway for us during the snowstorm. Will book again
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect flat, great location convenient to South Lake Tahoe/Heavenly, and wonderful generous hosts that go above & beyond! Will definitely be looking to rebook!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jennifer & Daniel’s place is so sweet!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer & Daniel were great hosts and made my stay as easy as possible. Nice, peaceful neighborhood, perfectly located just outside of South Lake Tahoe proper. The place itself was clean and cozy. Might be a little cramped for two people (though totally doable), but perfect if you're traveling solo. Highly recommend, and would definitely stay here again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Like some reviews I've read on behalf of this Airbnb, I also booked this place last minute. When I first arrived to the Airbnb, I was greeted by Jennifer and Daniel. Their place is located at the suburbs of South Lake Tahoe which is pretty close to a lot of restaurants and stores. What I do admire about this Airbnb is the guides and tips that Jennifer and Daniel give out of Lake Tahoe, which I found to be very convenient. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and don't mind staying here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little place - perfect for two people. Very clean and had everything we could possibly need for a two night stay - a few pots and pans, plates, cups, a small refrigerator, toaster oven, microwave, coffee maker and coffee!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great time at Jennifer, Daniel's place. The studio was clean and had good amenities.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s the little things that make a good Airbnb great, and that was the case here. Even though we didn’t use it, the mini kitchen has everything two people would need: hot plate, pots and pans, silverware and dishes, basic spices and oil. Even a mini blender and coffee maker. We loved the other thoughtful inclusions like a flashlight, space heater, and air purifier. It was such a cozy space, well located, and amazing value.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer and Daniel were super nice and helpful in our trip planning.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are a couple or traveling solo to the South Lake Tahoe region I’d strongly advise you to stay in this studio. The unit is private, a very short drive to all the skiing action and Jennifer and Daniel are great hosts! Jennifer and Daniel do a great job communicating with you and provide easy to follow instructions for check in and check out. The studio is well thought out and very comfortable. We are looking forward to staying there again!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a weekend ski trip! Jennifer and Daniel are flexible and very communicative. We especially appreciated how easy everything was despite a winter storm. Driveway was always plowed and all the necessities plus more were provided

Overall, we recommend staying at Jennifer&Daniel’s studio and we’ll come back if we can."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly what we needed on our spontaneous weekend trip skiing at Lake Tahoe. Jennifer and Daniel were SO kind and helpful. The bed was super comfy and the room is very cozy and inviting. 10/10!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The studio was well-appointed and comfortable for our short stay. Communication was excellent. The location was convenient, though a bit difficult to get to when snowing."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jennifer was a super helpful host and made us feel very welcome 🙏🏽 We got stuck in terrible traffic reaching her place, but she was always keeping in touch w us, and was there to welcome us when we reached. Cute cottage. Would recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay if visiting South Lake Tahoe. Cleanliness, location, communication, etc. are all 5 stars."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful clean place! Love it!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Daniels's place was perfect for our 2 night stay. The studio was very comfortable and well-appointed. They had everything we needed, plus some extras ( Loved the lotion in the bathroom.) Communication was excellent and the location was in a lovely quiet neighborhood within a short drive to all South Lake Tahoe destinations."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer & Daniel's little studio was exactly the R&R space we needed. We were hauling a small trailer and arrived late and Jennifer was so accommodating. The space was exactly as described, with a nice little kitchenette and private bath - both things we sincerely appreciated after our other exhausting adventures. We borrowed one of the towels for a lovely day at the beach and had a quiet night's rest before moving on with our summer roadtrip. Would absolutely stay in this spot again, should we find ourselves in Tahoe!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Nice and quiet and easy access to all the great spots in South Lake Tahoe. Jennifer & Daniel are gracious hosts and they were very flexible with our stay and allowing us a late check out. Would highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I stayed here one night. Check in and all communication with the hosts was excellent. The place itself was very clean and cozy with a lovely outdoor private seating area. The bed was also very comfy. The lack of a bathroom door wasn't an issue for us as it was in the back of the unit. It is near Pioneer Trail so there's traffic noise but it goes away when you shut the door/window. All in all an excellent place to stay. We will be back!
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit posting is quite accurate terms of location and facilities and was pretty comfortable. A couple of nearby hikes were pleasant and easy to navigate. The host provided all the essentials for the kitchen and bathroom which was appreciated.
Minor issues:
-""oven"" is a toaster oven"" and did not generate the 400F temperature shown to cook a ""pre-cooked small pizza (might be OK to warm up bagels).
- NB light sleepers - TV LED light on 24/7 prevents a dark room for a good sleep. The bed headboard creaks quite loudly when one moves. One needs the fan to cool the room at night but it is not a quiet one
- privacy
- in this converted garage the main path to the owner's house goes directly past the only window in the unit. Early morning traffic requires one to keep the curtains closed or one risks others peering in.
- the outdoor sitting area looks directly into the neighbors property which is quite close (fortunately not in residence during our stay)
Communication - we inadvertently did not close the window one time before we went out. A gentle reminder would have sufficed rather than a brusque text message. A sign directly on the door to ""close window & lock door when leaving the cabin"" would be a helpful reminder and avoid guests feeling reprimanded.
Value:
This is a small studio. The $150 cleaning fee felt excessive. Larger cabins listed on Airbnb charge this amount so one would expect a studio unit could be very thoroughly cleaned in 3 hours for less than $50/hr."

Their beautiful place is located within a very pretty and quiet neighborhood that is also located within a few minutes of downtown South Lake Tahoe. They had all the amenities you could need and were quick to respond to any messages or questions we had. We'd recommend their place to anyone!

Nice sitting area right outside the unit door. Fans and windows in unit were great, did not get too hot.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in South Lake Tahoe. You can visit nearby famous points and lakes with an short commute. Jennifer and Daniel are awesome hosts.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t say enough great things regarding our stay at this little slice of heaven in Tahoe. Jennifer & Daniel were amazing hosts. They gave us such a warm welcome. The property was everything we expected and more. They thought of every little detail. You will have everything you need. It’s situated in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. It’s the perfect distance from all the hustle and bustle/crowds downtown but close enough to drive to heavenly village and any activities in Tahoe. It’s a great location. We drove back and forth sometimes on multiple occasions.
If you are looking for a few adventures, we highly recommend ATV riding at www.fullaccess.com (no guided tour, you can ride to some breathtaking points/peaks and stop and go at your own leisure. Also, we highly recommended a once in a lifetime adventure - hang gliding over south & north shore Tahoe. It’s spectacular seeing Tahoe from an aerial view - like no other, soaring at 10,000 ft! It’s a beautiful 50 minute drive but let us say, it is worth every minute and more!!! You can go online at www.hangglidingtahoe.com to see for yourself! Read the reviews!
Additionally, we recommend taking a boat around the various parts of the lake. Some beautiful points to stop at, swim and just enjoy. Horseback riding at Zephyr Cove Stables was a great experience and we recommend the hour and half ride through the mountains and up to the lake view. The horses were gentle and guide was very knowledgeable of the area.
Food: We recommend Driftwood Cafe in Heavenly Village for breakfast. For a great dining experience, Hell’s Kitchen at the top of Harvey’s Casino. Definitely recommend trying Gordon Ramsay’s signature dish - the Beef Wellington! I’d say almost everyone in the restaurant ordered the Beef Wellington too. All of the food from the salad to the main course, dessert and wine pairing was incredibly delicious. Two places that we will return to upon our next visit to Tahoe.
Hope this review is helpful!"

It was nice, homey, quaint and sparking clean - perfect after a long day of hikes/walks and adventuring with our dog. Jennifer and Daniel were very communicative and responded quickly to my questions. They were also very straightforward about the check-in directions and very hospitable! I let them know beforehand that my boyfriend and I were bringing our dog. It was such a nice touch that they included (and let us know via private message) that they provided dog bowls, pee pads, a tennis ball, flashlight, poop bags, extra blanket, some treats and a flashlight for our dog - very thoughtful of them! I couldn't stop raving about the place! Jennifer also left us a hand-written note which was nice. Amenities-wise, they provided almost everything you could think of and need! Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair dryer, extra towels and blankets, tea, coffee, some snacks, dishes, first aid kit, extra blankets (especially for the COLD night temperatures), compass, map, wifi, DVD's, books, boardgames, pages of restaurant and activity recommendations, beach chairs and a doggie gate!

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer & Daniel's place was very cozy and clean. Everything is just perfect from the amenities to the place's location.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to crash after an exciting day exploring Lake Tahoe. Couldn't have asked for a better place or better host.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Daniel's place was perfectly comfortable, easy to get to, and was a really enjoyable place to relax. We came down for a running race and were stressed out by the logistics of kid care race prep and logistics. Thankfully, Jennifer and Daniel's place was one thing we didn't have to think about. Once booked, they communicated well and we just showed up and slept and then showed up and slept again.
Of special note, the power went out in most of South Lake Tahoe. Jennifer left a thermos of hot water and offered to cook us breakfast on her camp stove... So thoughtful and hospitable! Thanks for an easy trip away!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved my stay. Jennifer and Daniel were very responsive and accommodating. I booked this place in the evening and had a long late night drive from Yosemite.

I ended up forgetting a couple of my things the next morning but Jennifer and Daniel were super quick to notice and notify me so I was able to turn around to grab them and be on my way to my next destination. For me, the location of the place was great. The neighborhood made it feel like home and it is located not too far from some great places to eat and check out. I recommend checking out Bert’s Cafe for breakfast the next morning. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks again Jennifer and Daniel!"

Close to lake and shopping but not too close that you get stuck in all the tourist traffic.

We recommend this location anytime you want to stay in South Lake."

They even provided extra supplies for them (food bowls, dog towels, and a play pen). The room had specific recommendations for nearby restaurants and activities which was extremely helpful. We will definitely be staying with them again the next time we are in town!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Daniel were excellent hosts!
They communicated well, and even anticipated our communication needs.
They answered inquiries about activities, restaurants, etc., and even offered to let us borrow their bikes for a ride.
The tap water is amazingly delicious - all fresh snow melt.
They had some rec equipment that was available if needed.
The neighborhood was extremely quiet and pleasant.
When the city said that they might have to turn off the water for a while during our stay, Jennifer and Daniel even offered to compensate us if it was an inconvenience, which it wasn't.
On the day we were to check out, they even offered to let us stay late since no one was checking in until later that evening.
We highly recommend a stay with these wonderful hosts!
Byron and Sherry"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I visited South Lake Tahoe to celebrate my birthday around the 4th of July holiday. We met with Jennifer soon after checking in to the Airbnb, which was very simple with a code provided to unlock the studio. She left a very nice note welcoming us to the space and even inviting us over to her yard for drinks and snacks before the fireworks. The space provided a very comfortable bed with memory foam toppers that my boyfriend could not stop raving about (has a bad back and really appreciates a nice bed) with a small kitchenette area that was perfect for whipping up coffee in the morning and storing our foods we planned to take on our hikes. The shower was nice and hot and the bathroom provided many essentials like shampoo, conditioner and the works. We loved that the studio was located about 15-20 minutes outside of the Downtown area, so the area was very nice and quiet. My boyfriend and I enjoyed sipping coffee in the outdoor seating area in the mornings before we began our day. We definitely will be looking to stay here again on our next trip to Tahoe."

I will definitely be looking them up for my next trip to that area!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I came here for our 4th wedding anniversary. We needed a base point for some hiking and biking adventures. This was the perfect location for good eats, trails, etc. only about 30 min on a trafficy day to D.L. Bliss and to south lake it only took us 5-10 min. Super close to everything and it was a great value. It’s smaller and a basic place to stay, but perfect for us to come back to after a day of adventuring or to freshen up before dinner. I liked the little outside table and the chairs and beach towels provided. There was also tea and some snacks for us there which was nice. Very clean place. Super friendly and helpful hosts. They replied really fast and they gave me a bunch of ideas for activities during my stay. Would recommend this place."

The location was perfect for me and the size of the room is great for either a single visitor or couple of adventurers. Thanks for hosting me, I hope to stay here again when I’m back around Lake Tahoe!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little place in a quiet neighborhood not far from a gorgeous bay and sandy beaches. Hosts are friendly and helpful.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Daniel's place was perfect for me, my husband, and fur baby! The place was easy to find, spotless, private, and well stocked with everything we needed (coffee maker, condiments, utensils, etc). As other reviewers have mentioned, there's no door for the bathroom (curtain). We didn't mind but something to be aware of. We look forward to staying here again for future Tahoe trips!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was so easy, there were no problems. The place was perfect and was really close to where we were skiing. They had a good selection of teas that we drank in the evening, and the bed was very comfy. Would stay again!"

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio was perfect for my weekend of snowshoeing. Exceptionally comfortable bed with plenty of good pillows. The small kitchenette with microwave, toaster, and refrigerator were adequate for my modest food prep needs.
Jennifer and Daniel loaned me snowshoes which saved me $35 rental each day.
Great experience, good people, comfortable place to sleep."

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, cozy little studio! First off, they were great hosts. Very very polite and friendly in all communications and more than helpful when we had questions.
The place itself is a cozy little studio in a quiet area. It's just as described in the photos, nothing extravagant but it was homely and nice. It's just a few minutes away from the main areas near South Tahoe, but not too far. We enjoyed it because we were able to get to the lakeshore in south Tahoe as well as out to Echo Mountain equally. There were some great amenities for activities like the snowshoes, sleds and maps while inside there was coffee, fruit and some other pleasant surprises.
Overall a great little spot! Nice people and as an added bonus, it was a great value."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay here! Very cozy space and the bed is super comfy! Would stay here again for sure!
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer and Daniel went out of there way during this heavy snowfall to make sure my oversized vehicle would fit in the drive. I appreciated Jennifer being there to greet me upon my arrival. Very peraonable touch.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There was a lovely hand written sign that said welcome Jacqueline-Anne at the door, and a hand written note on the counter welcoming me. Jennifer has impeccable communication, sending me photos explaining where to park and which door we would enter. Overall a fantastic location and a cute, comfortable space!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer & Daniel's studio was amazing! My wife & I were wiped out after a nightmarish drive into Tahoe, with all the ridiculuous traffic and extreme snowy conditions. But they kept in constant touch with us throughout our journey, and even ensured there were no more obstacles in our way by clearing out their driveway for us. After a 12 hour drive, the last thing we needed was to shovel more snow out of the way! Thanks guys :)
The warm & cozy bed in their studio was exactly what we needed! Jennifer & Dan were thoughtful, hospitable, and made sure we had a comfortable stay with difficult weather conditions all around us. I highly recommend their place if you're coming up for a weekend. I know for sure that my wife & I will return. Thank you!!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was amazing.. very clean. complete amenities. we couldn't ask for anything more cause all your needs is already there. you are packed with so many things to do in the room and informations about the great place, where to go where to eat, is already been given to you by the host. all you gotta do is enjoy the stay.

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you can ask for in a studio. Jennifer and Daniel's home had everything available. They even had bagels which came in handy after a long drive to Tahoe. Access to the studio was easy and we never felt like we were intruding. We will be back. Great hosts.

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was apprehensive staying in a studio for the weekend, however, Jennifer and Daniel exceeded my expectations.

The owners live in their house next to the studio but felt like we had our privacy. We will definitely come back whenever we visit Tahoe for the weekend."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for our quick stop in Lake Tahoe, we really appreciated the morning snacks as we had to leave early!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The backyard is really enjoyable. Just sitting outside having coffee and reading. Wi-fi works well. Recommend you take sandals/flip flops for inside in cooler months because the floors can be pretty cold. Jennifer is good about sending you directions and information. Got to chat with Don for a bit and he's very friendly. The location is close to some nice restaurants (several great breakfast options) in Meyers (just a 5 minute car ride) and a bit longer ride back into S. Tahoe.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place for a Tahoe getaway!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at Don and Jennifers house for a couple of nights and I was pleased with the overall experience. Jennifer communicated very well and made sure I had all that I needed for a pleasant stay. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets/pillows were very clean and very comfortable. This place is perfect for a couple looking to explore the Lake Tahoe Area. The back yard is fenced in and there is a little sitting deck right out of the front door. I will definitely recommend Don and Jennifers place to friends and family. I have no complaints at all and was very pleased with the whole experience.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely place in a very lovely area!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice spot, off the beaten track and away from the noisy and touristy areas of Tahoe. Backing onto woods, nice walk down the Upper Truckee Trail just a minute or two away. Don and Jennifer were welcoming, available if needed, but not intrusive."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I stayed at Don and Jennifer's place for a small vacation during the summer. Don and Jennifer were very friendly and great at responding throughout the weekend. Super happy with our visit!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Don and Jennifer‘s place is very handy for getting to many of South Lake Tahoe‘s attractions. Jennifer has an excellent knowledge of the area and many good suggestions. It is important to realize that this truly is a tiny property. The shower is adequate but very small. I am 5‘10“, weigh 155 pounds, and could barely turn around in the shower. There is no sitting area to speak of. The kitchen has a minimum of utensils, and it would be difficult to prepare meals. It is quiet. My wife and I did not find the bed comfortable. The price, location, cleanliness and Jennifer’s excellent responsiveness made for a good stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while visiting Lake Tahoe. Exactly what we’re looking for.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I didn’t want to leave! This rental was comfortably spacious and well-lit. I enjoyed seeing pines from the windows as I prepared for my local day trips. This rental is a short drive away from Desolation Wilderness’ Horsetail Falls, as well as Emerald Bay State Park (featuring Rubicon Trail and Vikingsholm). Really came in handy for my early morning hikes and beating the crowds to Tahoe’s limited parking! The friendly and likable hosts go above and beyond to address any concerns/questions I had. As a light sleeper, I was worried about staying on the bottom floor of this building, but the noise/vibration levels were low (thanks for being considerate!). All in all, Tahoe is gorgeous and I want to return… when I do, I’ll be staying here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, hobbit hole feel"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time up to Lake Tahoe, and I couldn’t have asked for a nicer place to stay for the price! The back yard is absolutely beautiful, with plenty of sitting as well as lights in the yard at night it had all the right vibes!! Just 10 mins from the lake and town.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Don and Jennifer were awesome hosts and gave use great suggestions on how to maximize our time in Tahoe. The unit was very clean and had everything we needed. This is a downstairs unit directly beneath the main home so it can get a little loud with foot traffic if you’re a light sleeper (we took a nap during the day and went to bed around 10:30pm). Overall, a perfect stay for a very fun trip!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is so cute! It is in the mother-in-law suite below the main house. The place was very clean and cozy and the owners helped us get settled in our first night there teaching us how to work everything. The owners gave us several local recommendations that turned out to be fantastic! This place has a great location to South Lake Tahoe and is near Pope Beach and some trails as well. I will definitely be staying here again if I am ever in the area!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time here! Very cute and just the right size and space for a couple. We loved sitting out on the back porch and eating our breakfast every morning.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Jennifer were amazing. Classy place with classy folks. Loved the location and the privacy. No complaints from me, I would stay again."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Owner has rules written all throughout property. Found it very hard to just relax without reading another rule. The shower is very small. The area is quaint but a little outdated. The pictures are a little off from what you get. The pillows are very uncomfortable. I was happy there was a washer/dryer/mini kitchen and relaxing areas. It was still worth the price. Don and Jennifer are nice hosts all in all tho. Review is for S. Lake Tahoe.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A nice and cozy stay in the pine scented splendor of Tahoe natural majesty, perfectly close to all South Shore has to offer. Hot tub is the icing on the cake."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect place to stay if you want to enjoy Tahoe. Its tucked away in the evergreen trees in a very peaceful quiet area. You have a cozy place to yourself with everything you need for a getaway. There is beautiful porch to sit on and enjoy the nature, a hot tub when it gets cold, and our son loved their fenced backyard area to play in. The hosts are so friendly and available for anything we needed. We loved our stay here and hope to come again in the future."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the woods to get away from everything for awhile but still close enough to town to get what you need.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest, perfect place for two people looking to get away. The room was clean and cozy. It has the essentials and it amazes me how the room was kept warm when it was freezing outside. Definitely recommend this place."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don and Jennifer's place was excellent. Jennifer warmed the spa for us when requested and she had good suggestions for us when we arrived. Highly recommended!
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was cozy and located as reflected in listing however I do not believe this host worthy of super host status. The home was not cleaned up to par in the current pandemic and when decor is moved clear rings of dust are visible. On our last evening while we were out at dinner the host suddenly accused me of smoking threatening us with a $25 fee. I did not smoke once while in Tahoe and certainly not at the home. All my reviews as a guest reflect positively on me, and I’ve never been accused of something in that manner in all my experiences staying with anyone. She then asked us to go into our rooms when we returned from dinner citing fire hazards (anyone whose home was in jeopardy of burning would have just gone in, there was clearly no emergency). It was a total invasion of privacy and very upsetting. Other notes, there is a strict cleaning policy, we were expected to strip bed of all linens, fold all blankets used, take out trash to dumpsters in front etc and still charged a cleaning fee in addition. Also, all items provided are dollar tree quality, plates chipped, only 3 forks provided so they needed to be washed many times if staying more than a few days etc. Padlocks are on all except 1 cabinet, also on a door by the bed which is a bit unsettling, and the shower is very small. However, if you contact the host with any needs they do get back promptly, usually within a half hour at latest so that was a positive. Overall, mixed reviews, but if you are like me and do not appreciate being accused of things you’ve not done I would not recommend it."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and beautiful. Amazing host with great local tips.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Jennifer's place is clean, comfortable, quiet, decorative, and reasonably priced, and we really enjoyed our stay. Don and Jennifer were friendly, helpful, and accommodating. We would gladly stay there again if/when we visit Lake Tahoe."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful space not far from town and the lake. The space was clean, and the hosts were quick to respond to questions and requests."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First time in Tahoe and didn’t want a big place to stay with extra things. I was just looking for a warm place to sleep and shower. This did the job and more! Netflix being available was nice, water always ready and hot, and the fridge kept our beverages really cold! Hosts are friendly people, ask them for tips on what to do in Tahoe!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Don and Jennifer’s downstairs suite while they were home. We met Don briefly at check-in, he gave great local recommendations that we used several times during our 5 night visit. Location was excellent, 10-15 minute drive to everywhere you could want to visit in South Tahoe. Nice little back patio for when the nice September weather, we also loved using the hot tub. Place could use some updating but overall it was great for the price. Only thing to note is that if you’re tall, the shower was pretty snug (I’m 5’8” and my husband is 6’3”)."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is run by a very nice and hospitable couple. And the place is very quiet and a nice getaway from the noise that there can be in South Lake.

Highly recommend!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I felt like I was staying with friends rather than renting a place. They were awesome. I will strongly consider staying with them for our next trip to Tahoe!

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, a quiet escape in the woods while being an easy drive to South Lake Tahoe. Jennifer was very welcoming and communicative. The kitchen had everything you would need for 2 people, though reminder there is no stove top (as the listing states). We were able to grill in the backyard which was a treat. Great value and location for a weekend away."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent four nights here on our honeymoon. Don and Jennifer’s place was very conveniently located.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome place. Clean, spacious, cute and private. 1st Airbnb experience in the time of covid and I was totally taken care of by my hosts and felt safe. Loved sitting in the backyard morning for breakfast and coffee and then in evenings under the stars with the beautiful trees lit up with tiny lights. The deck is great and they even have a gravity lounger. Place is as cute as the photos and nice and clean. Bed comfy and there’s even laundry if ya need. Jennifer and Don certainly live up to their super host status. Jennifer went out of her to way to communicate with Airbnb about getting my coupon back after I had initially booked. And they were so sweet when I arrived, making sure I had everything I needed and offering some suggestions for in town dining and shopping. Can’t wait to come back for another Tahoe solo getaway."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Location...friendly and attentive hosts.....simple,, yet very clean, cozy, affordable space....extra helpful to have washer and dryer given how active we stayed enjoying the beauty of Lake Tahoe and the surrounding area!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent choice as a home base while exploring South Lake Tahoe. The location is great - we were 5-10 minutes from everything we needed. Also, the unit was sparkling clean, and their rental is inherently socially distant, as there is a lockbox for the key to enter. We also appreciated the laundry - great to have after outdoor activities."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, awesome hospitality.
They welcomed us with a great orientation to the local area with tips and advice. You couldn’t ask for a better location so close to the trails and main roads if necessary. We even saw a bear one morning in the yard! Highly recommend this stay.
We will be back :)"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don and Jennifer’s place was cute and private. It was about a 15 minute drive from the shopping area and 25 minutes from the hiking trails. For me, I’m use to driving this far to getting to places so it wasn’t an issue for me. The only downfall was having to push the 30 minute timer to run the space heater to warm up the place, but they do have central air and give you a blast of warm air in the morning and night. However, I’m always cold. My fiancé and I would stay here again."

She checked us in, showed us around our place and gave us great advice on places to visit and suggested places to eat in outdoor venues with live music and restaurants on the lake.
The day we requested to use the Hot Tub, they were very happy to get the heat started while we were out playing. When we were done hiking, we had a HOT hot tub waiting to punch our backs with managing jets.
Not directly related to being an AirBNB but directly related to being a SUPER host, my wife ran into a roadblock while working remotely. Don & Jennifer stepped right up to help her out and off we went to start our day's journey.
Don & Jennifer are truly ""Super Hosts""!!!"

He was very friendly and helpful, and gave us some suggestions on what to see in the area. Because of its location it doesn’t have very good cellphone reception (for at&t at least), but we didn’t mind so much because they do provide Wi-Fi. We wished we could’ve stayed longer because it was such a nice place to stay!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent 5 nights at Don and Jennifer's place and it felt like our home away from home. The cottage has everything we need in vacation and the bed is very comfortable. I love the electric fireplace in the bedroom, so nice and very efficient too !"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very great hospitality & approach
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer was a friendly, helpful host. We enjoyed our say overall.
This rental is well-suited to one or two people. The owners live on site, upstairs, and rental is on the first floor. There is a single parking spot right off the street, which has stairs down one level, and you travel to the back of the home. The backyard is spacious. We did not use the jacuzzi.
There is a heater in the bedroom with a set 30 minute timer. The bed was comfortable overall and there is a ceiling fan. Kitchen had two place settings for utensils. Coffee, hot chocolate, popcorn, and oatmeal was a nice amenity. Be sure and bring your own laundry detergent if you plan to use the washer and dryer.
Jennifer was an excellent resource for sightseeing and other local information. One of us got sick with a bad cold and Jennifer provided some excellent homemade chicken soup, which was greatly appreciated."

2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very nice location. Don and Jennifer are great hosts and the place was very clean. I think it's a great place for someone on a budget just looking for a place to crash while seeing the sites. The unit is a partial finished basement with a bright kitchenette. The dishware is limited so light breakfast or coffee in the mornings are perfect. Otherwise plan on dining out. It's not far from South Lake Tahoe, and don't leave the area without having breakfast at least once at Bert's."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect air bnb!!
Jennifer’s place was perfectly clean and had everything we needed. She made sure we were comfortable and gave great recommendations for the area.

Everything was perfect and I would come back and recommend staying at Jennifer’s"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We would like to thank Don and Jennifer for letting us stay in their beautiful home this past weekend. My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary and we decided that we wanted to spend our time away from the city and be in the forest and that’s exactly what we got.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed staying at Susie's upstairs spacious studio apartment near South Lake. The studio is bigger than it seems in the pictures; it is immaculate with a good sized fridge, a microwave, toaster oven and hot plate. The fire place/heater is a nice touch. After a full day of skiing, I was happy to hang out in a very quiet place just a little away from it all. Slept great. And in the morning, it was an easy a 10-minute drive to Heavenly's California Lodge. I'd recommend Susie's place for anyone visiting South Lake Tahoe."

The kitchen is really well equipped -- sharp knives and everything we needed to make a few great meals. We loved it and felt right at home!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pictures don't do this place justice! We stayed here for a night to go skiing but it was tempting to just stay in. It would also be perfect for a staycation! The kitchen is fully stocked and the induction hot plate, to my pleasant surprise, worked as well as an actual stove. The deep soaking bathtub is perfect after a long, cold day. The location can't be beat - close to the lake, town and both Heavenly and Kirkwood. Susie was a great host and accommodated early check in so we could make it before a big winter storm. This will be my go to place to stay in South Lake Tahoe!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night at Susie's rental unit for a weekend getaway to Tahoe. The place was excellent and perfect for both short and longer stays. The unit was spacious, with a fully-equipped kitchenette. The electric fireplace warmed up the place nicely and we slept really well on the comfortable mattress. There was even a large lazy armchair in the corner that you could fall asleep on. Ultimately, the best part of the stay for us was the gigantic bathtub in the bathroom that would be perfect after a long day hiking/skiing. We would definitely love to book this unit again the next time we come up to Tahoe"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"As described, except the heating wasn’t very good. We were cold."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife & I stayed for a weekend, a quick getaway without any kids & an opportunity to reconnect in a peaceful/beautiful/private spot in the SLT area. It's a 15-min drive to South-Lake, & I enjoyed being out of that specific area personally. It's a beautiful neighborhood, & I really enjoyed taking a long walk thru it one morning. The stay was just perfect...really clean, great instructions, & absolutely zero interaction, which for me is a must. My lovely wife is the people person. I loved that the tv was ready to go with plenty of streaming services...I don't care what anyone says, Daddy needs some tv on vacation. The bed was really comfortable, & yes, as everyone says, the bathtub is freaking magnificent. It fit both of us very easily for a bubble-bath...loved it. I even used a bidet for the first time in my 48-years. It was the best weekend I've had in a very long time, so if you're considering this place, do it."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and place…
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Susie's place was perfect. Great little spot above her main house with a private entrance so we felt like we had our own little cottage. Beautiful Aspen trees outside the windows made a lovely sound in the breeze. And the house next door had a hummingbird feeder with a constant flurry of guests! So cool to watch them from the front porch. Easy to find, easy to access. All the modern amenities you need in the kitchen, a cozy bedroom/living area, huge bathroom with a tub for two, and nice sheets and linens. So close to Lake Tahoe and all the areas we wanted to hike/visit. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat."

We would easily stay here again for our next visit to Tahoe."

Her proactivity and professionalism made all the difference. Also, beautifully serene surroundings. Thank you!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Susie’s place was wonderful. It was located just outside south tahoe in a quiet neighborhood. Easy check in and feels very private even though it is a unit attached to a main home. Entrance to unit is through stairs on the outside. Would definitely stay again!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable room with great kitchen that we didn't take full advantage of (next time). We liked that it was away from the dense S. Lake Tahoe area but close enough to drive there in a short time.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The ideal airbnb - clean, spacious, friendly, private, and with all the right amenities. It's been a long time since I booked a place that I was this pleasantly surprised by. We cooked a few meals here, took a hot bath, and got plenty of rest after our day out at Lake Tahoe. It's only about a 15-20 minute drive out from the town and parking/check-in/check-out was a breeze."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Susie’s place was a fantastic reprieve for this weary traveler after spending 3 weeks in a camper van on the road traveling to CA’s national parks. The space was clean and comfortable with all the basic amenities and then some. The bed was comfortable, the WiFi ample for catching up on work, and that bath tub was so inviting! Spacious off street parking for said camper van. Would 100% stay here again if passing through."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susie’s place is comfortable for a short stay if you’re looking for a place in between South Lake Tahoe and the Kirkwood ski resort. The space is larger than the photos make it appear. The kitchen is well stocked for some light cooking. I’m obsessed with the plush recliner. The bathroom is massive and the tub rivals any hot tub and was perfect for an après ski soak. I would definitely stay again.

Such a great location away from the bustle of S. Lake Tahoe & closer to Kirkwood! Susie got right back to me when I had a question, too."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was ideal for skiing Kirkwood Ski Area and Heavenly ski areas. Our visit was just after a huge snowstorm that dumped 48 inches in 48 hours, so the neighborhood was a winter wonderland. There was a power outage for a few hours during our first evening. Susie and Anton promptly shared lanterns, candles and extra blankets. The spa bathtub was fabulous after a day of skiing. We plan to stay again the next time we visit the South Lake Tahoe area."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place! Worth the money you paid for. Susie is a very nice & proactive host. She’s very responsive. The place is clean, no clutter.
The set up is very minimal, which I don’t mind because I only stayed a night. With that in mind, the kitchen. Very clean & nice, but again, minimal. So if you plan on staying longer & plan on cooking, think about how you’d cook.
Bathroom was beautiful! Beautiful outside as well! Amazing scenery!
ONLY thing I didn’t like, which just might be me, was the entrance door. It has a window on it that’s at my eye level (I’m 5’8.) So standing at that door, you can perfectly see inside & out. That kind of made me feel uncomfortable, especially if someone could see inside while I’m sleeping. So I just solved the issue by hanging a towel in front of it.
-BUT THATS IT, issue easily solved! Remember host is very nice & scenery is very beautiful!
Worth every dollar."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful and clean; the bathroom was great - super spacious. The room stayed warm with the heater and the TV had Netflix and Hulu, so we also watched some movies!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had lots of wonderful times here at Susie’ s place during our vacation in South Lake Tahoe.

It's not too far from the main South Lake Tahoe ""downtown"", but was still in a nice, quiet area. The place was clean and easy to access.

It was only about a 10 minute drive into South Lake Tahoe and I appreciated being able to get out of the hustle and bustle of town. If you're ever in the area, I couldn't recommend Susie's enough."

Clean quiet area and comfy bed. Easy check in and out. Bathroom is very large and spacious. Kitchen space as a part of the bedroom is very well thought out. Little touches like a super quiet kettle and having cutlery in a small jar rather then banging drawers made it one of the better air bnb places we have stayed.

Susie & Anton we’re very inviting & the check-in/out process was a breeze. The entire unit is much larger than pictured, especially the bathroom. Giant soaker tub, perfect after a long day of hiking/snowboarding.

You won’t regret it."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location for going to both Kirkwood and Heavenly in one weekend, about half an hour from each. Super cozy room with hot plate, toaster oven, kettle, etc that was very useful for cooking a meal before and after snowboarding. The bathroom was way bigger than expected, and even had a tub big enough for two! The electric fireplace kept us nice and toasty, and there were plenty of hook and rack for hanging up our gear. Overall great stay, glad I found this place!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Susie’s Airbnb. It’s perfect for a couple! The bath tub is huge and very unique. Unfortunately we didn’t have the time to use it, maybe next time. We only stayed one night but it was perfectly located for our short trip and plans to go tubing, which was only 5 mins away. Also good restaurants within that timeframe as well. Parking was easy because she had a dedicated spot for us. I would recommend this to others that are looking for a clean and simple, yet nice airbnb that is just outside the south lake tahoe area."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A comfortable and well thought out guest suite. It's a little out of the way but perfect if you'd like to head to Kirkwood. Bonus points for the giant lounger, great to curl up with a book in."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this Airbnb. Susie was an awesome host and was very responsive to questions and excellent with her communication. She gave me the code to enter my room right at check-in time and was super clear with the directions the house.

The location of the room is about 15 mins from South Lake Tahoe which I liked since it's away from all of the traffic and about 30 mins away from Kirkwood. The room size was very large and it was clean. I loved the electric fireplace and was exactly what I was looking for after being in the cold ice. It was also super unexpected the size of the bathtub which is basically a jacuzzi. I didn't have time to use it though but I wanted to! The roads around the drive way and the neighborhood are a bit icy but I didn't have any problems driving on it with my prius (without chains).
Overall, loved this airbnb and definitely will book again in the future."
2022-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was not very helpful and made us feel unwelcomed.
We were running 20 minutes late to clean everything and checkout - we communicated this an hour early with no response from the host.
Although we shouldn't have exceeded the checkout time, we were met with an unwarranted condescending/mocking attitude upon leaving. There are plenty of more welcoming hosts to support!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! Room was really perfect, just as advertised. Check in was easy, location was awesome.
But, as if that wasn’t enough, Susie and Anton were so helpful when a snowstorm appeared overnight, threatening to trap us in the mountains. Anton helped me figure out how I was going to get tire chains so we could make it out, and even topped up my windshield wiper fluid. Nice people.
Would stay again!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great place for my Thanksgiving trip. The host was friendly and helped us to check in when we had troubles in unlock the door.

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home in the woods. This place is ideal for groups of 4-6 people. Living room / common area is cozy for 4-6 people to chill and relax.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We just spent a week in Tahoe at Ally's place and it was amazing. Went there for a remote work trip and the place was as promised and then some. The place was welcoming, the wifi was fast which was great, and it was beautiful. Ally was incredibly responsive and proactive, ensuring that everything was smooth, and made us feel right at home. Would highly recommend staying here. If I could give this 6 stars I would. We would definitely come back again, and hope to in the future. Thanks Ally!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"EGGcellent - Grade A+ Stay
From the Airbnb photos, we knew the ranch would be lovely, beautiful views of the mountains, provide privacy and solitude. Unexpected finds included the beauty of the star-lit evenings!!, the lucky 13 coffee mugs, fresh farm eggs, the cool sounds of the chickens, horses, birds - Debbie's friendly smile and service and how relaxed we would become!! Our objective was to find a unique airbnb close to our niece's wedding venue in Garnerville, while also visiting other friends & other family in the Carson Valley....perfect location!! The kitchen was well equipped, comfortable bed and great living space to relax. We know the Carson Valley pretty well and that it would be easy to find different restaurants, antique stores and other interests, during our stay. However, we did explore a new area!! Genoa, Nevada's oldest settlement-Super Cool, close to the ranch, with its restaurants, antique shops & museum.
Truly loved our visit!! EGG-plus rating !!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if you want a perfect quiet weekend, this is the place you need to stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is in the most beautiful rural setting. The magnificent Sierras close and beautiful pastures. Tha apartment above the barn was very cozy and nicely appointed. They left us farm fresh eggs from their hens and monogrammed mugs! We saw a family of geese with a dozen goslings next to the barn.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place, excellent people, a very very good stay!!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely place to stay beautiful views will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It felt like John and Debbie shared their home with us and always made us feel welcome.
The mountain views are stunning and the ranch setting is something our family enjoyed especially the interaction with the horses!
We found hot springs and lots of recreational snow related activities within half hour of John and Debbie’s ranch without any of the crowds.
After our busy day in the snow, we found this to be a very comfortable place to retire to with modern appliances and full kitchen and of course always hot water for the shower. The mini split system kept the space at whatever temperature we wanted but the wood stove was my daughter’s favorite.
Everyone’s favorite were the views of the mountains and the windmill. We found ourselves taking pictures out of each of the windows.
Would recommend this unique place to any of my friends and family."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a birthday gift to my son for the weekend - John and Debbie were so kind and helpful coordinating the logistics so that I could make it surprise - even down to a recommendation for a great local bakery for a cake. Here's what my son's exact words were about the experience: ""It was beautiful and so well kept, but my favorite thing was the gorgeous views out every window and the animals just downstairs."" Thanks for sharing what sounds like a slice of farm heaven."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed our stay at the ranch. The bed was very comfortable, the shower pressure was great, and the kitchen well-stocked. During a snowy day, the woodburner was cozy and kept us toasty. Our only suggestion would be a deeper clean of the shower and kitchen areas. The location is perfect for skiing at heavenly and kirkwood with each mountain about a 30 minute drive."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting on high plains surrounded by Eastern Sierra but the windows were oddly high up and small so hard to really relax and enjoy the views from inside.
And no outdoor space for lounging.
Though nice to walk around and see the horses."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place to stay. John and Debbie were very responsive on the app and answered all of our questions. The space was clean and peaceful.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"By far one of the most unique and beautifully situated places we have ever stayed. From the breathtaking views in every direction, to a couple of beautiful and friendly horses downstairs in the barn! Check-in was easy and the unit was clean and well stocked. We cannot wait to come back for our next stay! Thank you John & Debbie, 5 stars!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely experience with our toddler :)

Great hospitality and a fantastic experience and very beautiful and clean.
Thank you."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John &Debbie’s property is absolutely stunning. Great views of the mountains, close to Tahoe and local hiking. Loved visiting with Pepper and Bodie the resident horses, the cattle and Scooch the dog. Debbie was the perfect hostess, leaving snacks in the refrigerator and was very thoughtful to include Prosecco upon our arrival to celebrate us “Newlyweds!” We didn’t have a chance to try local restaurants, as we brought our own food, but the barn was complete with a list of local eateries. The pictures don’t do it justice and we plan on a return trip, hopefully next year. We had the best stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay here was amazing. John and debbies home was very welcoming and we could not have asked for a better review. We were able to go downstairs and pet the horses while debbie was feeding them and the kids really enjoyed that. I really hope i make another trip to nevada soon just so we can stay here.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed our time here very much, probably the best airbnb we’ve stayed at! We were visiting Lake Tahoe and the ranch is 30 mins away from both South Lake Tahoe and Zephyr Cove. It is very easy to find and absolutely beautiful especially with the mountain view. The airbnb is well kept, had everything we needed, spacious and comfortable. Even though it is on the second floor of the barn, there was no smell whatsoever. The hosts are generous, friendly, and quick at responding to all our messages. We also got to play with their chickens and got to say hello to the other lovely animals. We want to definitely come back and stay here again whenever we are in the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we drove down the beautiful tree-lined drive to the barn/apartment, this location exceeded our expectations. Easy to find and drive up to and unload, along with absolutely stunning views of ranches, mountains and valleys out of of each window. The apartment has everything you need to be very comfortable. There’s easy drives to all types of fun; hiking, biking, casinos, fishing, Lake Tahoe, etc.
The ranch is pristine and seeing horses around the barn and pastures adds to the beauty of this property. I’m so glad we stayed here. My husband and I spent four days exploring Carson Valley and could not have found a better location to use as our home base. Thank you for all the attention to detail… we will never forget this memorable stay.
Mona"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this unique ranch stay. The description doesn’t do it justice. Very homey, well-appointed, and functional. Absolutely no sounds or smells from barn below the apartment. Gorgeous surroundings. Clear instructions and easy to find. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot say enough good things about our stay at the Lucky 13 Ranch! The apartment was meticulously thought out and had every amenity you could possibly need and then some! From an extremely well stocked kitchen (including some welcome treats upon our arrival ☺️) to comfortable furnishings, bed and linens.
Most of all the views from this apartment were absolutely stunning!! And getting to meet their resident horses, Bodie and Pepper was a thrill in itself!
Easy drive to South Lake Tahoe and also Carson City which offered every restaurant and retail store you could ask for! Highly recommend a stay at this lovely home away from home and Debbie and John are the absolute consummate hosts ❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t think of anything that would have made our stay better. What fantastic hospitality! The location was wonderful. The peaceful valley surrounded by mountains provided a solitude would be hard to duplicate, and the drive to Tahoe was only about 30 minutes. Debbie’s gifts of hospitality are outstanding! She really did think of everything, including emergency instructions, frosted mugs, treats in the fridge, and more. The special gift was a thoughtful gesture. The home is the perfect amount of space for two people. The ranch atmosphere is an added bonus. It was such a treat to greet the horses and meet the ranch dog. Communication was great, with fast response times. The stay at John and Debbie’s ranch was really a highlight of our trip. Thank you for exceeding expectations!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic property! Great for families with small children. A great value as well!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazingly beautiful views of snow capped mountains and green pasture with grazing cattle. This barn was a peaceful and restful vacation spot. The barn is cozy and has every amenity you could ask for with little touches to make you feel right at home. Very comfortable bed with super soft linens. Bathroom well stocked with everything you need. Easy check-in with plenty of parking and you might get greeted by the ranch dog and horses. Easy drive to dining, stores, Lake Tahoe, and Genoa. The host was very flexible with check-in for us when our plans changed at the last minute."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely stunning and the apartment had everything we needed. Scootch was the best welcoming committee and the water pressure was immaculate! It was so wonderful to come back here after a long day at Lake Tahoe
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really special location and a beautiful home! Debbie was quick to respond to all our questions, great hosts"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our favorite AirBnB stay to date! Debbie was a great host and the space had lots of wonderful touches. We loved the horses and cows. The barn was spotless and perfect for our family of 4.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful living space above a working barn has insane views of the gorgeous mountains and Carson Valley. The apartment is super convenient, meant for two but can sleep up to four, has a simple functional kitchen and effective heating or cooling. If you’re looking for everything you need, not much you don’t, amazing views and the sounds of horses and chickens in the morning, this place is amazing."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for letting us stay in your beautiful ranch. It was perfect and one of the best air b and bs that we have stayed in, it was easy to find and communication was great!!
Highly recommended!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the Lucky 13 Ranch with my mom, as we were in Gardnerville for a family wedding. We absolutely loved our stay at this Airbnb. John & Debbie’s place had everything we needed: comfortable beds, fully stocked kitchen, large bathroom, very comfortable living area etc. The scenery around the home is breathtaking. There are wonderful walking trails within a couple miles of their home. Mostly, we enjoyed walking around the property, visiting the horses & cows, and being greeted by Scootch (the dog) each time we came outside. We have stayed in many Airbnb’s over the years, and this will go down as one of our favorites."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool place with cows, horses and a friendly dog. All the grounds were meticulously manicures, and everything was extremely clean, absolutely beautiful surroundings and peaceful to sit in the morning and enjoy the mountains."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, terrific location."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is a lovely ranch property surrounded by the majestic Carson Range. It’s a bonus to see the horses and chickens on the ranch. The place worked well for me as I was attending a 2 day event in Carson City and prefer a lodging unique rather than a chain hotel room. Make sure and check out the night sky / multitude of stars - can’t see that in the city!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Grateful for a very picturesque, romantic, and honest stay. Not to mention for all the help we got when we had a little car trouble. Highly recommended!! :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this place. This has been the best Airbnb. Debbie is amazing makes you feel right at home. They had everything thought of and the animals was such a bonus.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely incredible. Debbie is so kind and a great host. The place is absolutely adorable and so cozy. The location is close to Stateline and great ski resorts while simultaneously being the perfect location for a peaceful and beautiful getaway. The view is breathtaking surrounded by 360 degrees of snow capped mountains. Our weekend was more magical than we could’ve ever imagined. I cannot recommend this place enough.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First Class. No reason to say anything else. First Class. Treat you right, help when you need it leave you alone the rest of the time. First Class! Will book again Thank you Tim and Fam."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Debbie’s listing was perfect for our weekend stay! We came in the middle of a storm but made the best of it. Everything was well prepared for us. The host was very responsive and answered all questions that we had. The ranch was very beautiful, and we loved waking up to the Mountain View. I would recommend everyone to stay here if you’re looking for a peaceful getaway, close proximity to everything."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place !! This has been so far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. The view of the snow covered mountains is stunning, which you get from literally all of the windows 😃. Amazing sunrise views, and a great place for stargazing at night! Proximity to South Lake Tahoe is great! And the best of all, the hosts are wonderful! We would definitely love to visit again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at the Lucky 13. Every place we travelled in the surrounding area was no more than 15 minutes away. We also enjoyed interacting with the horses. It's a very pretty place..
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay! John and Debbie were super responsive and helpful any time we had questions!

Thank you! John & Debbie."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with a cozy fireplace and stunning views. Wonderful hosts. They were easy to communicate with and left us little treats in the well-stocked kitchen. Short drive to great skiing. Overall it was a wonderful stay. My only note would be bring earplugs if you're planning to sleep on the fold-out couch. The wind in the valley is no joke and it makes the living room whistle like a tea kettle when it really gets going.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was so nice and peaceful. The view is beautiful! My kids were so excited to see the horses, chickens and cows. Definitely recommend! Had trouble with the tv and the host responded within seconds. My plan was to watch the stars outside but I looked out the door and it was so dark out there I changed my mind lol. Definitely will be returning next winter."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Debbie and John’s barn house. It was everything we expected and more. The place is clean, classic, exuding warmth and love. We lived above the barn, with two handsome horses downstairs, it was almost too good to be true."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures simply cannot capture the beautiful surroundings. Our apartment had everything that we needed and more. It was spotless, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. Our hosts were friendly and yet they gave us our privacy. We wished that we had reserved the space for a few days longer. Thank you for a memorable stay!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host and place was very nice. If we can try to go back to stay these is the place beautiful peaceful nobody bothers you very quiet come and go as you want. anytime early leave or late or come in late no problem
The mountains are beautiful looking out from the bedroom. over all the best place I have stayed in a long time will hope we can do it again"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The nicest Airbnb experience we’ve had. From booking to communication about arriving to the stay - Debbie made everything so easy for us. The Airbnb is clean, cozy, and has everything you need. The views out the windows are spectacular, as are the animal neighbors. We had farm fresh eggs for breakfast our first morning! Don’t miss this magical escape."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time getting away to this quiet place. We live only about 30 minutes away and love the area. Sitting outside watching the horses and cows with the snow covered Jobs peak in the background was amazing.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can’t wait to be in your beautiful surroundings. Thanks again for all of your quick & thorough coordination and communications.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at the ranch and it certainly will not be our last. This place is so peaceful.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, daughter and I had a wonderful time at John and Debbie's ranch. The place is clean and cozy with some thoughtful touches. Debbie was a great host, she's very kind, organized and made sure that we settle in nicely and feel comfortable during our stay. We particularly love the view of mountains during the day, bright stars during the night and the wonderful company of the horses, chickens, cattle, and pup Scootch. Our daughter loves it there so much that she didn't want to leave. We will definitely visit again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city. As soon as we arrived we knew we found the perfect place to unwind and recharge. Debbie and John's ranch is breathtaking - you will enjoy the views of the valley and the company of the horses, chickens, cattle, hawks, and of course her pup Scootch. The home itself if impeccably clean and comfortable. Great wifi if you are coming to work remotely. The only thing wrong with it is you won't get to do all the things you came to do because you won't want to leave this ranch!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Very comfortable
Great vistas and everything you need"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic location, apartment snd hosts. We keep coming back and love the place. Highly recommended!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space was just perfect for my family. Such a beautiful, quiet property. Owners were so friendly and helpful. We loved staying here and so happy we found this gem! We are thankful for the welcoming personal touches that they were sweet enough to leave for us. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a getaway!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful, peaceful spot to sleep during a work trip to Gardnerville - I will absolutely book again the next time I’m in town. There were some very thoughtful touches and the space is cozy and comfortable. My biggest issue was that the bed was so comfy I didn’t want to get up for work! Light sleepers may want to pack earplugs, as cows are surprisingly chatty at night! Truly lovely stay."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment provided a peaceful place for us to stay for a grandson's wedding at a nearby venue.
We could take a quiet break between getting together with a rambunctious group!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing views, cozy and comfy living space, sweet ranch animals. We absolutely loved it. Situated at the base of a beautiful mountain range. Located in a quiet town not far from Tahoe. We will definitely be coming back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely gorgeous.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"13 is a lucky number if you choose to stay at the Lucky 13 Ranch. Easy to find, parking right in front of your door, very spacious floor plan, wonderful extras provided by your Airbnb award winning Super Host. What more can I say, I want to relocate and move in permanently.
Thank you so much John and Debbie for creating such an outstanding Airbnb experience."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Debbie have a gorgeous property and they did an excellent job communicating and providing a clean private apartment. The apartment sets above the barn which is really cool. Although there are many windows overlooking these beautiful grounds, you can’t see out most of the windows because of the position of the roof on the barn. There was also no welcoming area to set outside to enjoy the beautiful views. It was noted that there were lawn chairs in the garage to bring out, so maybe our bad. This was our first time at an airbnb, but we do travel often. Thank you John and Debbie."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place ""A slice of heaven"", exceptionally clean and well organized. Equipped with everything needed, the fresh eggs were a great breakfast during our short stay. A short drive to South Lake Tahoe with numerous places to shop and eat. Horses were so beautiful to see in the morning and friendly. Definitely want to spend sometime outside after dark, the stars are unbelievable! Communication prior to our arrival was fantastic and info left in booklet was very helpful. Will definitely return for a longer stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Welcome to Relaxation on a real working ranch! This is a gem of a find out in the country, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's worth the extra 30 minute drive from Tahoe to have your own slice of heaven on a cattle ranch, with horses, chickens, (no rooster to wake you up), and a friendly dog on site. The space is nicely-themed in ranch decor; there is plenty of room in the living room; there is a well-stocked kitchen; spacious bathroom; and a bedroom with a nice A/C for hot summers. Summers can be hot, so the space outside of the bedroom can be a little warm during the day time, but cools nicely in the evenings. There were even a couple of nice surprises that we were appreciative of that I won't spoil. Thanks Debbie & John, we hope we can stay again on ""The Ranch"" in the future!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The coolest location with the mountain in the background! It got a little hot during the day (rented in July), but the room air conditioner and opening the windows at night helped a lot! Awesome rental!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed everything! Debbie and John have a beautiful place and made our stay very welcoming. There were several extra touches that made us feel special. It felt like home. We also very much loved the tree lined driveway.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Lucky 13 Ranch in July and could not have enjoyed it more. Ideal accommodation in every way - we spent time hiking, cycling, visiting State Line and Carson City. Everything close yet location is peaceful and so beautiful. And the barn apartment is homey and comfortable, having everything we for our stay. And a few thoughtful items from the hosts as well.
We plan to return next July, and will add on another night, we enjoyed it so much.
Fantastic hosts; communication was outstanding from start to end!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give it more than 5 stars - I would. Beautiful place, quiet, clean, easy check-in, good location - close enough to get to grocery stores, restaurants, hiking, fishing, etc. John and Debbie have thought of everything to make the place comfortable and enjoyable. We have stayed at many AirBnBs and this was one of the best. We will be back."

Definitely will be coming back."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very unique, and I’m glad for choosing it, it made our Tahoe trip even more joyful. It’s surrounded by scenic views, large areas of green grass. Downstairs are three friendly horses. There are farm animals near by. This is a very lovely place, highly recommended."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, clean Airbnb apartment in a beautiful ranch. Our hosts were excellent in communicating and ensuring we were comfortable, even providing nice welcome gifts and supplies for breakfast. They really made us feel welcomed! The kids enjoyed the spacious ranch and watching the horses and cows on the property. Overall great spot and hosts!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Debbie’s AirBnB was in a great location to visit Lake Tahoe. We really enjoyed the property because it had amazing views of the mountains and farm animals. The AirBnB was spacious and high quality, stored with everything you would need!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We just spent our Mother daughter annual retreat at this beautiful ranch!! So peaceful with the horses, cows and chicken. Immaculately clean and fresh. Staying above the barn gave us beautiful views. No smell whatsoever with how meticulous they are with this lovely setting!! So close to restaurants and amazing hikes! Can’t wait to go back!!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,John & Debbie's ranch is amazing! We enjoyed nearby hiking trails. We also visited antique shops and shopping at the local farmers market. The apartment was very clean and filled with all the amenities we needed to make our stay very comfortable.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place. Our kids loved the farm. We had a very good time.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lucky 13 Ranch is absolutely gorgeous! My bridesmaids and I enjoyed the space to spread out while getting ready for my wedding that was at a venue just down the road.
The spot was private and comfortable. We loved being able to see the horses and watch the cows out in the fields."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pile on the superlatives. My husband and I have stayed at a fair number of Airbnbs, and hands down, the Lucky 13 Ranch was the best yet. The Carson Valley setting is spectacular—the sky, the Sierras, the pastures and livestock, and proximity to Lake Tahoe and Carson City—if a bit windy (be prepared). This is a place to unwind and spend some quiet time with the horses or to use as a base for exploring the area. I could see staying for an extended period.
Debbie could not have been more welcoming, stocking several breakfast items in the fridge, including fresh eggs from her chickens! The apartment was clean, comfortable, and well-designed. The king bed was super-comfortable, and there was plenty of extra bedding if needed. If you like to travel with more tech and entertainment options than a smart TV and DVD player, bring along an HDMI cable and an adapter to plug into your iPad or computer. We spent just two nights there and left wishing for more. I'd go back in a heartbeat."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing Airbnb! Loved the 'barn-dominium' setup! We are horse people and loved having horses living in the stable below us. The unit was very comfortable, clean and well appointed with everything you would need. Nice touches by the hosts such as some OJ, milk, farm fresh eggs, water and apples in the refrigerator when we arrived. The ranch was absolutely beautiful! Green pastures, snow covered mountains and panoramic views of the valley. Horses, chickens, geese, cattle and native birds provided natural entertainment for any animal lover to observe. Our hosts were friendly, communicative and helpful with any questions and concerns we had! We have family in Gardnerville and, when we return, would definitely stay here again...as long is it was available! LOL! Thank you again for a pleasant and wonderful stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands-down our stay at the Lucky 13 Ranch was the nicest stay of our entire vacation. Very easy to access and such a lovely place. The photos don't even do it justice! Book this place if you can, you won't regret it ☺"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gorgeous Place and terrific hosts. We were there for our anniversary and it could not have been more perfect!
Loved everything about this place. one of the best Airbnb stays. Kids loved seeing the animals. Will definitely come back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was incredible! We LOVED our stay. It was very rural & extremely peaceful but not too far of a drive to the small town or even over to Carson City. Would absolutely recommend this place!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at the Lucky 13 Ranch over Easter Weekend deciding we would like to have an adventure as well as being close to family in Reno for a holiday celebration. The apartment was so comfortable and a perfect place to return home to. There was even the capability of making dinner in a well equipped kitchen. Waking up to the mountain views and having a cozy wood stove when the weather took a turn were so appreciated. My husband and I found the location near Genoa to enable a fun side trip. Hopefully we will have the opportunity to return soon.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and terrific hosts. Would definitely stay again.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a gorgeous place! The ranch apartment is impeccably clean, comfortable, and welcoming. We enjoyed our stay and hope to return again when we have more time to soak in the beauty. Many thanks to our hosts for such a wonderful stay!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at John's and Debbie's ranch as a base for our ski trip to Lake Tahoe (Heavenly) while visiting our son who lives in the Bay Area. It was a great choice, since the ranch is only 20 min of the closest ski lift (about 40 min from the furthest) and the drive back-and-forth was very enjoyable with fantastic views of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Valley. We suppose it would take much longer in bad weather during the winter. The apartment is above the horse stable with incredible 360 degrees views of the valley and snow capped mountains (through many small windows). Everything was very clean and modern. The place is wonderful to relax after a day in the slopes or hiking. We really recommend the Fay-Luther trail is you want to exercise while learning about nature in the Sierra foothills on the Nevada side, and the history of the valley. Waking around the ranch, while watching the horses, cows and other farm animals is a very special addition. If you do not ski, the Carson Valley is a beautiful destination in itself. John and Debbie are excellent hosts, communicative, friendly, efficient. We recommend their place wholeheartedly either as a base for Heavenly or to visit Carson Valley."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent my wife’s birthday weekend here and it could not have been more perfect! The space was clean, cozy and well equipped.

We will definitely be back."

Hosts are exceedingly attentive and sweet! Highly recommend if you’re looking for a stay near South Lake Tahoe!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is one of the best stays we've had through Airbnb! John and Debbie are great hosts, their property is beautifully maintained, and the area offers easy access to every winter activity you might have in mind, especially if you are traveling with children. We lost Internet access for a few hours, but the issue was resolved the next day. Thank you, Debbie and Jonh!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 3 had a great stay at John and Debbie’s Lucky 13 Ranch. The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures - super clean and very cost. Although Debbie is always busy around the ranch she went out of her way to make sure we have everything we need. The fridge is stocked with fruits and eggs, she even prepared gifts to make our stay even memorable. In addition to Debbie’s hospitality, we also thoroughly enjoyed all the animals on the ranch, especially my toddler. If you are looking for a change of scenery from the city life and a great host look no further!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the lucky 13 ranch. Debbie was extremely easy to communicate with, the property was stunning with views of snow covered mountains and we were happily greeted by two of their dogs Katie and scootch. The unit was cozy, very clean and felt instantly like home. Perfect for those that would like to stay in a quiet location and take the short 20min drive to nightlife of South Lake Tahoe. The unit was fully stocked with everything you would need in the kitchen, body wash shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom and blankets etc for the bedroom. We loved it and can’t wait to return!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The Lucky 13 Ranch is beautiful. We enjoyed a total of 59 nights at this piece of heaven on earth over the last 3 months.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is our second stay at the Lucky 13 ranch and we have already reserved 2 more stays. The Lucky 13 is a slice of heaven on earth. The views are spectacular, and the snow covered mountains on a full moon night glow. We love it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived, we could see that the Lucky 13 Ranch is a very special place, and that we were in for a real treat. The accommodations were spotless and super comfortable. The kitchen was amazingly well stocked and the fresh eggs from the chickens were great. The views from every window were spectacular, from the snow capped peaks to the cows and horses grazing in the pastures. The location was perfect for exploring the whole Carson Valley area. We would highly recommend Debbie & John’s delightful barn loft for a memorable getaway!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debbie’s barn loft is an absolute gem. It was the perfect location to be able to fly into Reno and hit Lake Tahoe and we even made it to Yosemite for a day. The loft is amazing. Just the right amount of space and everything else. We felt so welcomed by the hand written notes and farm fresh eggs and meeting Bodie, Pepper and Dually was such a treat. Do not pass on this beautiful stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Lucky 13 ranch is a great find. It is rustic, comfortable, scenic and quiet. Every window greets you with a view of mountains, pastures, sunrises, spectacular rainbows and sunsets.
Our hosts were helpful and friendly. Fun to watch the daily chores of ranch living, including fresh eggs, when the chickens cooperate.
It is situated just a few miles from the town centers of Gardnerville and Minden."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Probably my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed at to date! Their place is CLEAN, well equipped, and unique. I loved being able to greet the animals each morning and having fresh eggs from the farm. The apartment is spacious and well decorated to go with the western theme around the ranch. Very close to Lake Tahoe and Minden, NV. A nice escape from the hustle and bustle. DEFINITELY book!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You definitely do not want to miss the experience of the Lucky 13 Ranch. It really speaks to the beauty of the Sierras and why we need to do our best to be good caretakers of this earth. John and Debbie are prime examples of all that we should strive to become.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, they really look after things here at the Lucky 13 Ranch.
This is one GREAT PLACE for a get-a-way from the busy city life -
NO REGRETS on booking this apartment located on a working ranch -"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and wonderful setting. Great hosts! Thank you!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place! Near Lake Tahoe but with the benefit of experiencing the Ranch. Backyard views of the mountains, with quite mornings and evening stars. Quiet, peaceful and so quaint. Extremely well kept and hosts did so much to make the stay wonderful. It’s a gem."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect to come back to to relax after a long day of sightseeing! We commented to each other how well we slept in an unfamiliar place-it’s got a special vibe not to mention all the little extras they provide!!! Awesome hosts:)
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with amazing views and an awesome place. Loved to see the horses and being a short drive from Lake Tahoe.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Debbie's ranch is awesome! It's located in the meadows of Sierra mountains, 20min-50min drive to Lake Tahoe depending on which part of the lake you want to visit, and that means you could experience country living and whatever lake Tahoe offers at the same time. We really enjoyed our stay: the view is astounding, and the horses, cows, hens are so cute, each has its unique personality. We were just in time for hays harvesting so we watched the whole process and feed the horses and cows. That was lots of fun! As someone who's been in the city for a long time, it's quite an interesting and relaxing experience waking up to hear mooing and cluck. The unit is well-equipped, clean, and cozy. Beyond that, you also get the best host: Debbie is very easy to communicate with, responsive, and considerable. She left us breakfast items and fresh eggs in the refrigerator and offered us fresh eggs on a daily basis. She also gave us reminders about heat waves/strong wind/thunderstorms. From all the details, you can tell she really puts her heart into what she's doing. I would strongly recommend staying with John and Debbie on their ranch!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Debbie's guest accommodations at their spacious ranch were spotless and included everything we needed for our stay. We so appreciated finding the thoughtful welcome gift and the refrigerator stocked with farm-fresh eggs and continental breakfast items. The king bed was very comfy with the softest sheets I think I've ever slept in! We loved having a full-sized bathroom with really nice towels and good water pressure in the shower. Even though we were there during a hot spell, the space stayed at a comfortable temperature thanks to the fans and portable air conditioner and great flow-through ventilation from all the windows. It was so nice to be in close proximity to family in Carson City but away from city noise and traffic. And watching the sun go down behind the mountains in the evening was so relaxing!
For those who haven't stayed in the Carson Valley area before, be aware that it can get windy there. Also, the property is a working ranch with hay fields as well as cattle, horses, and chickens, so if you are prone to allergies you would want to make sure to pack some meds.
John and Debbie, thank you again for a lovely stay!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is incredible, perfect for a break surrounded by nature, awesome views, and fresh air! Our daughter loved playing with the horses, the cows, and the chickens, as well as having fresh eggs from breakfast! Debbie is an awesome host! Thank you so much!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy and Great place to stay! Really well equipped kitchen. Debbie is very responsive and approachable. Nice location with amazing views.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is very nicely furnished. The bed is comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom are large.
The location is wonderful. The ranch itself is beautiful, surrounded by green pastures. The location is right in the middle of the Carson Valley with great views of the mountains.
There are two many special touches to mention in the review but some include complimentary coffee, very nice Lucky 13 coffee mugs, and the opportunity to gather your own freshly laid eggs for a scrumptious breakfast of eggs and toast and coffee."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a hidden gem! Amazing location and wonderful hosts.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay! Our two girls loved the animals and my girlfriend loved the decor. The owners gave us our privacy and have the place very well kept. We recommend this place too anyone looking to spend quality time at a beautiful place.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Two people in need of a quiet country getaway found it here. Once you start down the long tree lined drive you know you’re on to something special. The loft is very spacious and comfortable. All the amenities, even an electric kettle for tea drinkers. On colder evenings we lit the log burner, very warm and cozy. The atmosphere is soothing with Mountain Views, pasture land and well cared for horses and cattle. The chickens are of special delight, as are the fresh eggs. The hosts are kind and thoughtful with very good communication. Easy drive to Tahoe as well as several rivers. Lot’s of terrific bird watching in the area as well. We feel fortunate to have stayed here."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The ranch was recommended by a friend and I certainly would be recommending it to anyone who wants a nice country experience and explore Tahoe as well. The place was amazing and the hosts were very responsive and even left us some goodies to take home.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place with nice views of sierra nevada mountains. The best part for us was the fresh eggs which tasted so much better than even organic eggs in the market ;)
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at the lucky 13 ranch. The place had a rustic barn decor and everything that one would need for their stay. Debbie left us fresh eggs from the farm which were so delicious! Also, some thoughtful souvenir mugs for us to remember our trip! It was amazing to see all the ranch animals with a beautiful mountain backdrop! Great location if you want a peaceful stay away from the hustle and bustle of South Lake Tahoe but also close enough to go by whenever you want to!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. The apartment was clean, convenient and uniquely located above the horse stables. We heard the horses a bit but they were not loud and didn’t bother us. We enjoyed going downstairs to say hello to the horses everyday. We all enjoyed the fresh eggs they left for us every morning. Our toddler loved the animals on site. We stayed here and did day trips around the area, It was only 30 mins to South Lake Tahoe."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend staying here! The space is well appointed with beautiful views and fresh eggs daily. Great communication with hosts. Already booked our next stay!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our favorite place to stay in Tahoe. Debbie is amazing, she is so kind and friendly and my children got to see a pregnant cow and then her newborn calf a few hours later! The space is clean and warm, and they tons of welcoming touches to enjoy. I love the multitude of windows lining the barn; we woke up with the sun and looked right at the snow capped mountains every morning. My only complaint is that my son now knows what fresh eggs taste like and he will forever be disappointed by grocery store eggs. Can't wait to visit again!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely space! Great communication with the owners. The space itself is wonderful, wouldn’t even know you’re in a barn! Waking up to beautiful view of mountains is fantastic. Everything you could possibly need to prepare meals, including fresh eggs from the farm chickens! We’ll be back"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"John and Debbie's space was such a great stay! Super cozy and clean, the bathroom was spotless and with plenty of amenities. We felt very well received. The fridge was shelved with a few necessities with plenty of room for your own groceries. They leave very thoughtful gifts for guests that are just a highlight. Highly recommend this stay !"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I just stayed here with our toddler as a sort of baby moon before baby #2 joins us and we were pleasantly surprised. The location really is as beautiful as the pictures! Our toddler LOVED the animals and the host was very friendly. The house was cute, clean, and had everything we needed (and actually more). We were very happy with our stay and highly recommend!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! The place was wonderful and very clean. Definitely coming back again!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything in the apartment is very new and clean. The bed in the bedroom is super confíe. John and Debbie make you really feel welcome leaving breakfast items in the fridge & sharing their eggs. Our kids loved saying hello to the horses & the farm animals. Our kids are already asking to go back. The only draw back is the sofa bed mattress, you can feel all the springs on the mattress when you lie down."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had an excellent stay.  The property is kept in immaculate condition.  We enjoyed the quiet area with no traffic.   We didn't get to do everything we wanted in the area so we will be back and will stay here again.

It was perfect for our family, we can't wait to come back"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly LOVED our stay at this charming ranch apartment. It was so magical to wake up and see the mountains, and of course, all of the amazing and happy animals. I've never seen such happy chickens and cows!
The added touches of having some breakfast basics and fresh eggs, smart tv apps (Hulu), and lots of blankets and a foam pad for the pull out couch really made our stay feel even more like we were visiting a close relative. The calming presence of the ranch and surrounding nature was unbeatable. Also this spot was a beautiful, not-too-long drive from Kirkwood and South Lake, which was perfect!
We would LOVE to come back next ski season."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Well, this place is definitely amazing. We love the beautiful ranch view, the generous host, and the lovely animals!

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were amazed at how peaceful and beautiful lucky ranch 13 was. It was the the ultimate sanctuary to return to after long days of skiing in Tahoe. The animals and fresh eggs made the trip that much better. What a way to start off 2021. Thank you to Debbie and John for being so trusting in sharing their farm with us.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow, what a fantastic stay. The apartment is cozy and has everything you might need, the animals are delightful, and the view of the Sierras is FANTASTIC. As in, really fantastic. Debbie was a wonderful host - fresh eggs and English muffins in the fridge were greatly appreciated! There's a good coffee setup, lots of extra blankets, Netflix, etc., etc. Wifi was spotty, but we didn't mind. Highly recommended."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Debbie was a phenomenal hostess. Instructions were very clear, and she was accessible for our questions, even on Christmas Day. Views are incredible and the apt is very well stocked with all necessities. We appreciate that there were lots of careful touches and details, down to having baby proofing tools. It was so much fun living above the horses for a few days!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Debbie is a wonderful host. She spent lots of time showing my girls how to be good farmers. They absolutely loved it. It is a beautiful location.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Debbie and John's ranch. The place was spotless, furnished with care, roomy, comfortable, well-stocked and quiet. The kitchen had plenty of supplies making it easy to cook. In addition, there were many extra thoughtful touches throughout that added to the charm. It was also interesting to see the hard work that goes into taking care of the ranch (and we enjoyed the fresh eggs). The setting of the ranch in the Carson Valley surrounded by mountains all around was gorgeous at every turn. The location was ideal for us as we were able to hike in the high desert/foothills forests in the valley and also take a couple of hikes around Lake Tahoe. Thank you for everything!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!!!! We just returned home this evening from our stay at John and Debbie’s place. We were in the area for our son’s wedding. I had high expectations after reading the reviews, and I was not disappointed! This cozy and adorable little place is so comfortable, we felt right at home. Debbie welcomed us with some yummy snacks and drinks in the fridge, including farm fresh eggs...and she also told us how we could get more eggs during our stay. The whole place was very clean! And how cool that it is above the barn!!! Being able to have this space to “come home” to on this very special weekend helped us to be able to relax before and after the wedding. A very special part of our stay was the fact that they let us use this gorgeous ranch for our son and daughter-in-laws “first look” and family pictures. You couldn’t ask for a better background than the mountains literally in our backyard, the well kept and beautiful property itself, and even the animals were part of our day. It was PERFECT!! Our kids were so happy too! This place will always hold a special memories for us because of that. And Debbie was on hand in case we needed anything! And when we decided that we’d like to stay an extra night because we just weren’t ready to leave, she was quick to accommodate us. Her communication was fast and instructions were easy to understand. I can’t say enough good things and wish I could give way more than 5 stars. Thank you, John and Debbie, for making an already special and unforgettable weekend so much easier for us to relax and enjoy! I can’t wait to return! I would, and have already recommended this space to others!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is beautiful and has horses, chickens, cows, and a dog. The apartment is very spacious, comfortable, and quiet. Everything we needed to be comfortable was in the apartment. There was fruit in the refrigerator, coffee, special coffee mugs and fresh eggs. We really enjoyed our stay"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! Loved every minute of it!
,,,"I have been using Airbnb for the last 4 years. This is the first time I feel so inconfortable with the host. First of all every time you look from the window, you will see her outside. At first I thought she just walking around until she texted me to put the barbecue back to the front even thou I was about to put it back anyway after using it. She listed two showers are working. However only one is working so all of us ended up using one shower but I didn’t make a big deal about it. The wifi didn’t work on my PS. Also didn’t make a big deal about it. I payed $600 for two nights. And $140 was a cleaning fee so I don't understand why This host would want me to put her dishes in washer machine and put soap and wash it . And the worst thing is that she wants me to gather all the garbage and dump it in the dumpster that is about half a mile away from the house. So she expects you to walk all the way there with the garbage. So what is the cleaning fee for!! Of course I didn't do that. I gather all my garbage, put them in bags, tie the bags and left them in front of the house. Because all of the tasks that she made me do I asked her to give me just 30 minutes extra after the checkout time so I can make sure I leave the spot in a good condition. She agreed. However After I left Cindy sent a request an $188 dollars because of the 30 minutes late checkout that she agreed on. And she said I left stain on a white towel hahaha. Therefore she couldn't rent it to the next customer. Cindy wants to charge a cleaning fee and expect you to clean everything. I am really sad that you made us feel this way about you Cindy. But honestly, you need to take some hospitality classes so you can provide a better service. Such as giving full privacy to your tenants. Also make sure they have the most pleasant time from moment they walked into your property until they leave. Because when I go to a place that I am paying a cleaning fee for. Don't expect me to clean the floor, towels, floor nor walk half a mile to put the garbage in the big dumpster.
This is what Cindy wrote in her request. ""Due to Hamdi’s group doing a last minute, late checkout and the poor condition the guest house was left in, we were unable to get the place cleaned and ready for a 4:00pm checkin and therefore I am u able to rent my listing tonight.. Also the stained towels, and duvet’s are included in this request for additional money.""""
Stained towels and duvet's!!!! Sure next time I will pay for an extra day so I can wash your towels, duvets, the floor then find you your next tenant."
,,,"This place is in a great location, but you’ll have to sacrifice cleanliness, privacy, and the hosts aren’t easy to communicate with, and I could hear them fighting in their house above the suite, which is basically the basement with a separate entrance out back."
