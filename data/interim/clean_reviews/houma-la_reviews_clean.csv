2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"BEST little secret in Houma, La. Our visit to Houma turned out to be surprisings PERFECT! Stephanie's quaint apartment and gracious southern hospitality were more than my 17yo and I expected. Easy access to all we needed and wanted to do and enough space for us to enjoy one another without feeling cramped in a confined space. And Stephanie stocked the pantry with simple breakfast items and treats to get us through if needed. Best of all, my son and I had a BLAST right there in Houma with Stephanie's suggestion help. We went to The Ball Park and had a mom and son competition at the batting cages and mini golf (great course). We went to the AMC movies, had late night donuts at Mr. Ronnie's (hands down the BEST donut shop EVER) and yes way better than Mr. Rob's. We had massages by Michael Hattler that was great, a spa day at 4 Seasons Spa and a plantation tour at Southdown Plantation. Also highly recommend visiting the African American Museum Finding Your Roots for a balanced accurate experience. And everything was located 6 minutes from the house. BEST of the best was the food experience. Wow Wow Wow. Zen, Big Al's, Mr. Ronnie's were delicious. So much food but worth the waistline disaster. Culture, food, Relaxation and great customer service everywhere we went. New Orleans and Cafe Du Monde is an hour away and so worth the drive. While enjoying our beignets we toured the Art Sculpture Gardens and the whimsical Story Book Park. All great. Definitely would book again if I ever had a reason to visit Houma."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is adorable. Stephanie has it stocked with almost anything you could possibly want or need. It was clean and comfortable.

The place itself was very nice and clean as advertised and more. They did a really great job making this place perfect. Beds were comfortable, kitchen was clean, well stocked and it seem like they thought of everything.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Terissa is very sweet and accommodating. The house wasn‚Äôt a big fancy house. It‚Äôs a small home feeling house. Very comfortable to be in. The original one we booked was a 1 bedroom and she reached out to us and offered us the 2 bedroom next door. Very large deck we would sit on at night and watch the barges go by. Very quiet and peaceful area. Guy across the canal was jamming to some music that was perfect for being on the canal. Not my taste of music, yet satisfying at the same time. My brother rented the first house we looked at. But we were happy for our decision change due to the neighborhood and the mosquitoes. Will definitely rent again 100%."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The hosts were very responsive, friendly, and generally lovely people. Was super easy to get in touch with the hosts through phone calls and subsequent texts, especially for a last minute booking. Was reassured that my mother and grandmother would be comfortable during their stay. Chose this Airbnb because it was a good fit for those with physical limitations (one level, specialized bed, parking right by the door, accessible bathing options). Grandma is almost 95, so I hoped to find something to accommodate her and was not disappointed. They stayed for a week while her house was being worked on. Thanks for the great stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ms. Wendy and Kami are extremely kind and accommodating. If I had any questions they were answered immediately. The room was comfortable with it‚Äôs own private entryway and covered parking at the door. There were toys for my grandkids to play with and Ms. Wendy brought over even more. I would stay here again and recommend this rental to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway in Houma at a great price.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"great place, close to Walmart and all the fast food places, she had a good assortment of snacks there for us, greatly appreciated, the community cats outside are wonderful if you love cats, but they won't bother you unless you want them to come up to you, we had a great time here for our stay, nice and quiet!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kami and Ms Wendy are incredibly sweet! Our family stayed here while repairs were being done to our home from Hurricane Ida. The description is very accurate. I felt like I was staying in my grandma‚Äôs studio apartment!
The back yard is large and very relaxing.
There are many cats on the property. The family‚Äôs property next door has several farm animals, including a pig, turkeys, and a tortoise.
The rental is within a 3-5 minute drive to WalMart, a laundry facility, restaurants, and basically anything else you would need.
Ms. Wendy is readily available to the renters, eager to accommodate any needs, and will go out of her way to help you out!!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really beautiful and clean place!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Don‚Äôt be deceived when you turn into the neighborhood; it appears to be an older part of town, but the photos on the site accurately represent the studio. First and foremost it was clean and we were able to park off the street in the carport. The host(s) were tremendous and I‚Äôll just say they catered to our requests. The kitchen utensils were plentiful and the snacks bountiful. In the bath area we were provided with numerous amenities, even a spare toothbrush if needed.
What was most important to us is this location is pet friendly. While we didn‚Äôt anticipate staying an hour from our event (Caesar Superdome in New Orleans) the value alone made it worthwhile.
Stay here, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a quiet little place. You won't be disappointed. Snacks, drinks, coffee, etc. all provided. Will look this place up next time we are in the area. Kami went out of her way to make everything great. Very responsive to messages."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terissa is an excellent host and is a pleasure to communicate with. The Water Front Cottage is a lovely place to stay in Houma, Louisiana. It's cozy, clean and comfortable inside and out. The waterfront location is really amazing - the views down the waterway were panoramic of the landscape and sky. The boat and barge activity was fascinating to watch as well!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great find in Houma! Wonderfully preserved old home right on the water to sit and watch the barges go by

I stayed here for a week when I was on business. Being able to have coffee in the am and unwind after work on the deck was so restorative. The kitchen had everything you need to cook easy meals. It is cute and cozy and so neat to watch the barges go buy.
I would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a dream come true! Absolutely amazing stay. I‚Äôm from Houma but haven‚Äôt been back in years and came to see my Dad and my Aunt. Just awesome stay on the bayou, watching the boats go by. So peaceful and relaxing and Terissa was the best! Responded immediately when I needed something and was gracious enough to give us a little later of a check out due to the bad thunderstorms. No other place I would want to stay. My friend that was with me had never stayed down there and was just so excited once he saw where we were staying and even more excited with the view and how peaceful it is. Wonderful stay, wonderful hosts! Can not wait to come back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the Bayou experience I didn‚Äôt know I needed! My whole family is from the area, so this is the first time I‚Äôve stayed at a rental as well as on the Bayou, and honestly, I‚Äôll never stay anywhere else! Watching the boats go by is an added bonus."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved Terissa‚Äôs place. It was clean (most important), had snacks for my kiddos, on the water, and walking distance to the farmers market (i went on saturday, but i‚Äôm not sure exactly when they are actually open).
Terissa was also very helpful and responsive. I needed to check in a day early and she was able to accommodate (the day i requested was the day i needed to check in lol)
overall, great experience. :)"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this spot!! I was born & raised in the area & always loved the water! The back deck was beautiful & peaceful to sit & watch the wildlife & the boats! I was impressed to be staying in a house 100 years old!! I look forward to staying here again in the future!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"After I arrived for the week I went out grocery shopping as I was staying for a week. Once back at the house I quickly realized that the frozen meals I purchased for the week could not be cooked because the oven did not work, only the stove top so I was forced to put those items in a cooler and bring them home at the end of my stay. Other than that the place was perfect for me, I was alone and it was just the right side for a single. Great place to stay overall."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here for our wedding weekend with some out of state family and this place was great ! They loveddd the view on the bayou! Very nice to sit out on the swing at night watching the boats pass!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as listed, a little overpriced for the area, Terissa seemed to focus on the rules more than the stay, maybe from previous bad experiences. The bed could definitely be improved but overall our stay was comfortable and as described."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay for our wedding weekend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The dreamy aspects of the bayou ‚Äî the intracoastal canal with massive barges and tugs cruising by ‚Äî it's all here. A beautiful creole (I think) cottage and gorgeous deck to take it all in. A fantastic base from which to explore southern Louisiana!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an Amazing stay, Terissa was so accommodating and went over and beyond for our stay.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great large deck by the water and nice small house but cleaning was not spotless and the bed of the couch really not comfortable - Would recommend for two people but not for 4.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Adorable historic cottage on the Intercoastal Waterway with a large dock overlooking the waterway. Loved that a Keurig and Starbucks K-Cups were provided.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Terissa is a very nice lady, and the house was very cozy and nicely decorated. The yard was neat and tidy, and very private. I felt completely safe there, as she had yard lighting and a security system in place. Check-in was a breeze, and there were dishes and cookware, as well as a bbq grill to cook on and a cute little bar in the backyard. I really enjoyed sitting out on the back porch and watching the barges and tugs go by. We had hoped to be able to fish that evening, but her dock was under construction, so that wasn't possible for us, but it will be wonderful when it's completed!
The house has beautiful wood floors, and there were some really beautiful pieces of antique furniture in the home, including an old Victrola record player that actually worked! We really got a kick out of that! All in all, it was a refreshing alternative to a boring hotel room! I would definitely recommend staying there!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little house. Loved the open feeling with all the windows looking out over the waterway. Deck over water was great for a drink at night and morning coffee. Very clean place. Quite neighborhood. Air conditioner works great.
Owner said her Dad would fix beignets for us. I figured he would cook them and bring them over. Wrong. He brought everything over and cooked them on the porch so they were fresh.
Would highly recommend this place and will stay again when back in Houma."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, excellent for relaxation by the water."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Terissa‚Äôs house is in such a lovely spot. The porch on the river is such a gorgeous place to sit. The house has all you need inside but it‚Äôs really about that view! Terissa herself was lovely to deal with and super helpful.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay while in Houma, the home is extremely peaceful especially in the evenings when coming back from a stressful day. Terissa was extremely helpful and friendly, she made sure we had everything we needed."

Will definitely stay again!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Houma. Our lodging was very clean and just as described. Being situated on the Intrastate Waterway was unique and very interesting. We enjoyed watching the shipping traffic occasionally go by. The kitchen was fully fitted with cooking utensils.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little cottage loved being on the water and watching the boats pass.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house and had 2 wonderful days in it. Decoration, cleanliness, equipment, cosyness... it was perfect. We enjoyed a drink on the terrace while watching the boats come and go, it was wonderful!
Terissa was extrememy reactive, perfect communication, and was super helpful and supportive during a severe storm (that we pleasantly passed reading nestled in the comfy sofa in front of the wide windows). I highly recommend!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay and will be looking forward to coming back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is described as a ""camp"" but really it is a very nice spot with the amenities as noted. The area is a fishing community and though we visited some of the local spots LUCON (worth the travel), Manadalay (short walk but nice) and Houma. There is not a lot of ""touristy"" options but the folks in the area are friendly and, again, the area is beautiful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Peaceful spot. Fun fishing off the dock. All the kitchen accessories we needed for cooking.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well equipped house with an exceptional terrace. There is equipment to catch blue crabs (there are a lot of them) and fishing rods. There is a charcoal grill to grill what you caught.
The house is large, clean and well equipped. Only small thing to improve for me: the bedding in 2 of the bedrooms which is not comfortable enough.
We had a great time there."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, my family really enjoyed the stay"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place,access to all my childhood fishing holes,even though I live in Texas now.We come down ever fall season/winter months to fish.The fishing was slow in surrounding areas,but when we came back to the camp we put our led lights on and the speckled trout were on fire,good times.."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"While in the area for a wedding, we stayed at Raymond‚Äôs place so the grandchildren could crab and fish. No fish, but the crabs didn‚Äôt disappoint!
We enjoyed the home because all could be together or find some privacy if needed. The views are beautiful, and the water is very enjoyable from the deck.
Highly recommend"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time. The crab traps were waiting on us. We caught enough crab for a crab boil. In the shade under the porch. Enjoying a few beers. Such a relaxing time. Thank you for letting us use your place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Raymond was very easy to reach and accommodating. House was exactly as described and zero issues. It had more than everything we needed to have a great stay.
I enjoyed fishing from the back and since it faces east and has a deck, I wasn‚Äôt baking in the sun. Good wind from the gulf so I was comfortable during August in LA.
I‚Äôd do it all over again. Thank you Raymond!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is really nice. Big enough for a big family. Full staffed kitchen and everything was really clean. The terrace to the river is a highlight and the kids loved to try to catch craps.
On top there are the little alligators.
Thanks for having us as guests"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Lots of wild life, beautiful evenings and so much more!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was as described, and the place was beautiful. Raymond was available at anytime, but the place is so well put together we wouldnt need him"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Raymond was charming and easily reachable
The house is very clean and very nice
I would have stayed longer
I would recommend this beautiful rental"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice spot in a small town that has everything you need, being on the water was nice an convenient for fishing great amenities in a good atmosphere"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a wonderful time! Perfect getaway!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent some time in New Orleans before heading down here and it was a great break from the city. It was peaceful, beautiful, and great amenities. The house is very clean and well put together. We loved staying here and would definitely recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family of six enjoyed staying here. The house was just as described and spending time on the back deck fishing and just relaxing was great. The house was stocked with lots of things such as soap, shampoo and such. If in the area to fish, I highly recommend staying here."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! We loved being right on the water. It is so peaceful here and easy to get right back to Houma where we were working. We fished off the pier at night and had coffee each morning looking over the bayou.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Fun fishing spot! Could use new pans and knives. Master bed was comfy.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our peaceful stay on the Bayou! Raymond‚Äôs place is the perfect base for our fishing trips in the area. Highly recommended!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,I look forward to staying here again on my next visit!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed at Raymond's place 4 nights. We were looking for a place out of the way, less crowded, on or near the water in order to explore more of southern Louisiana. This is one of the most comfortable, homey, well appointed b&bs we've stayed in (and we've stayed in many). Since we were there in January, it was not crowded and we were able to make day trips to Grand Isle, Houma, and just ""hang out"" and fish off the back. We caught several black drum which we released. I'd recommend the Scenic Bayou Side Home to anyone who wants to see parts of southern Louisiana, get out of the city for a while, or just sit on the back porch and fish. Thank you Raymond, for a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was excellent
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice getaway
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome spot to get away!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The camp was awesome! Very well stocked and exactly as described. The beds are hands down the best we have had in an Airbnb. Gorgeous place and owner was very quick to respond.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This camp was absolutely beautiful! Well stocked and very clean! Raymond was helpful with any questions. We really enjoyed getting to know the locals and explore all the area has to offer. I would highly recommend Raymond‚Äôs place if you are ever in the area. Wish we had more luck fishing, but the lily pads did wash out after a few days and we did fish the bayou. Overall we have zero issues and truly enjoyed our stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a very enjoyable stay. The home is very lovely, peaceful, and has all the essentials to make your stay pleasant. It was very clean and everything was as promised. Raymond always communicated promptly with any question I had."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good stay.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful and comfortable home to spend a few days in. We have no complaints what-so-ever about the house or property. My family was very comfortable sleeping and lounging around while on vacation. The kitchen is very well stocked with cooking equipment and spices if you choose to stay in. The bedrooms and bathrooms were equally well stocked and even had complementary single use soaps like you'd find in a hotel. The only things I'd have liked to know before renting were just how much traffic would be on the street in front of the house most of the day. You are right on the main road/highway in the area and will hear traffic from before sun up to late at night if you're in the front living areas. My wife and child said it didn't disturb their sleeping in the back bedroom or upstairs on the canal side, but you will hear traffic all day long out front. Secondly, if you're a fisherman like I am, know there will likely be water lilies covering most of the canal most of the day. They have a pretty purple flower, and seeing the plants very much fits the marshy feel of the area, but it almost prevents fishing in the canal out back. I had dreams of spending my free time casting for fish behind the property, and that was very much unrealistic. The water lilies float unattached to anything, so they move with the current and prevented casting all but perhaps 2 hours in the 3 days we were there. You can still drop bait straight down and fish under a bobber around the individual plants, or on bottom a few feet behind the back of the property, but you likely won't be able to cast and retrieve like almost all my fishing tackle required. We caught a few bluegill, Atlantic croaker, ladyfish, and even spanish mackerel on worms, shrimp, and crabs under bobbers out back, but I wasn't able to enjoy casting for a few hours here and there like I'd imagined. The crab traps were fun to use though and we were able to have a crab boil for supper our last evening thanks to them. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit on the back deck and watch the water. We watched several large 5-7 ft alligator gar swim by under the weeds, as well as many a shrimp and crab boat pass throughout the day. All in all I wouldn't hesitate to rent this house again or recommend it to others. The area still shows signs of the hurricane damage all over and this is one of the few very nice properties in that area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and spacious place. We had a lot of fun! Thanks for sharing your wonderful home!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at your Raymond‚Äôs place. We really love the area and love fishing Cocodrie. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and hammer the trout & reds again!! His place is very convenient and really easy to access from Houma. Hanging out on the back deck & watching the boats and gators was cool too!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place is nicer than the pictured. Beds were comfortable, and the AC worked very well. We did not use the kitchen because we were there for a family event, but it was well stocked. Raymond was a great host and quick to respond. We will stay there again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place... perhaps the best ""fishing camp"" we've ever stayed in (it's not really a camp... it's just a very nice, clean house on the water!) There are so many little things that are already stocked... soap, dishwasher detergent, coffee/filters, etc. Everything is very clean and in working order. The house is even decorated very nicely. Plenty of pots and pans as well as anything else you need.
Access to the bayou is really cool and fishing/crabbing right out the back yard is great (equipment is already there too!). Unfortunately, this place isn't ideal for fishing with your boat. I could not find a good public launch nearby and getting your boat back to the house would likely be a chore with the drawbridge just south. This community is still hurting from Ida and many services are not easily found for visitors. We ended up parking the boat next to the house (plenty of space) and launching out of Coco Marina in the morning to fish from there (15-20 minutes down the road). Really, that's probably for the best anyway since the trout are already further out in June.
Overall, this is a GREAT place and Raymond is more than helpful when you contact him. As long as you know the limitations of the area you're in, you will be very happy and comfortable staying here."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were very pleased with our stay! The house is beautiful and everyone was comfortable. It‚Äôs extremely well stocked too‚Äîno need to buy spices!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,place is awesome and we had an awesome time. definitely will book again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Raymond‚Äôs place on the bayou in Chauvin was nearly perfect. The only thing missing was a fish cleaning table. Everything else was there. I put my boat in just after we got there & didn‚Äôt take it out until we had to come home. Even though it was extremely windy we were able to find fish everyday. Look forward to going back.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home had everything my family and I could have asked for! It had so many great amenities which made our stay much more enjoyable! It had such a lovely view of the river and the inside was so beautiful! I couldn't of ask for a better vacation home!
We look forward on staying here again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Raymond was an amazing host the house was awesome fishing was awesome cought quite a few from the back of the house so nice to wake up and just go fishing. Raymond even gave us some fishing tips being from Idaho we were a little out of our element fishing on the bayou hooked a big fish that snapped my line so make sure you bring tough fishing line highly recommend
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great house thank you
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The camp is very clean and comfortable inside. Great open kitchen to cook in and fishing and bird watching in the canal out back. Directions are easy, and Raymond was very responsive for questions. It is one of the first camps from what i could tell back online after the storm in september '21.
Great host, great camp - great part of the world!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Stunning and welcoming household. I was so happy with the accommodations for my pageant trip.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre going for a fishing trip or a get away with the family I would definitely recommend this place ! It was very comfortable and plenty of room.
Great location and a beautiful view sitting on the back porch. I look forward to staying here again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,lovely place. the porch is amazing and we spent most of the week fishing off of it. couldn't have asked for a more relaxing stay.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication and easy check in process. Yes, there‚Äôs a list of things to do when you check out, but I wouldn‚Äôt say any of it was absurd or out of the norm.
He swung by one night to grab something from the garage (we didn‚Äôt mind and weren‚Äôt disturbed by it), but I appreciated his almost 2 hours heads up!
The back deck is amazing! It‚Äôs right on the water and you can just toss your fishing line over. We tried our luck at crab trapping and caught 2! The next door neighbor gave us tips and tricks on how to catch blue crabs too. Great time watching the boats go by and fish jumping out of the water.
Kitchen was WELL stocked. Probably the most well stocked kitchen I‚Äôve ever seen at an AirBnB! The bed is SUPER comfy. I almost walked into the glass shelf late at night so watch out for that ha!"
2020-12-01,3.0,Group trip,"Having a hard time understanding these fantastic reviews? Check in with a lock box was super simple and the accommodations were reasonably clean. The back deck had been torn down completely!! And no notification. Check out rules are extra extensive. Strip bed linens, wash dishes, empty all trash, but still pay a 125 cleaning fee. These days rules should be included on the listed. We texted Raymond the night before check out asking if we could stay an extra hour. No response at all and the cleaning woman showed up at 9:51. Why did we need to strip all the beds and wash the dishes if she was going to be there to heard us out????
If we were to ever come back to this area we would not even consider staying here again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was better than expected!! It 7 of us perfectly comfortable. The kids enjoyed watching the alligators (from the 2nd floor of course) swimming around. Definitely going back!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Two words.."" BOOK IT"" ... amazing everything.. my family and i loved it there we even offered to buy it lol..."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Raymond responded to all contact in a timely manner.
Inside of home was clean. Amenities were way more than ever expected. He has tons of extra to make your stay as convenient as possible.
Will definitely stay here if available on any other tripswe make to that area. Can't wait to see the updates you are planning to make on the water front!"
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The location is perfect for fishing! The back porch overlooks the bayou which was beautiful to look at both sunrise and sunset.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Raymond is a very welcoming host. Our group of 4 senior citizens were very comfortable. The house is big and clean, and visited every evening by an alligator. The kitchen was well equipped and we also grilled outside."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really nice place, will definitely return!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great proximity for doing a drive in charter fishing trip and close enough to Houma. Worked great for our family.

2020-03-01,4.0,Group trip,"Raymond‚Äôs place is beautifully decorated and has all the amenities. Located right on the water, it provides wonderful views and lots of nature. Good fishing and wonderful weather made for a nice vacation. Our host was responsive, kind and helpful."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Right on the bayou! Nice place that has been all fixed up inside. Very clean and comfortable.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I travel for business and often stay in airbnb's on longer stays. This trip I was in Houma with with son and two friends who just graduated from commercial diving school and were looking for a job. I can honestly say that Raymond's home was one of the most beautiful, immaculate and comfortable places that I've stayed! The house is fully stocked with everything that you need and Raymond is the best recommending the best places to eat. I'm pleased to say that the boys found jobs and I will definitely stay here again!"
2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and clean!
2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed the stay....would like to say the back deck was a bit rough. Wish it was updated like the front deck...could use a smart tv in living room and the towels could use a update alot of holes in it and last but not least the pans...other then that ra the place was amazing..would definatly stay again..
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Awesome rental, especially if you love fishing. The home is right on the canal, we caught 6 huge drum right out back within the first 2 days. The home is very nice, clean and many amenities, we loved sitting on the upstairs deck and watching the boats go by. The host responds immediately to any questions and suggestions. This rental is pet friendly, being able to bring our fur babies with us, allowed us to really enjoy our vacation. The home has 2 crab traps, we caught a lot of crab. Everyone was very friendly in the area, giving us suggestions for restaurants or other places to see. My husband and I both agreed it was the most relaxing vacation we had taken in a long time. Just Perfect!!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome! We stayed for a long weekend! Caught tons of crabs and some freshwater fish from the back! The balcony was great for enjoying your morning coffee. The place was super clean and very nice. Kitchen had everything we needed to cook! The bed in the master was SUPER comfy! Property was conveniently located. Close to stores, bait shops, and about 10-15min to Coco Marina (Try the fried pickles, SO GOOD!). Overall, great rental!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is just lovely. It is exactly as described. The host is very quick at responding to questions and even shared a few fishing spots. While half our group was fishing, he gave us a few spots to explore on our own. We would visit again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Looking to getting away from all the things that way you down and truely relax with no worries then this is the place to be. Sitting at the southern base of Louisiana with water that homes so many species of animals you can help to fall in love with this place. Frogs croaking at night, fish jumping, shrimp boats passing by and different birds flying in and out just to name a few. You might even get a chance to see the local alligator (don't worry though they won't bother you). It's so peaceful and the locals are friendly and helpful. This home sits right on a canal that while you sit on the upper deck or lower level you're right by the water. The home is just as beautiful as the pictures show. The beds are so comfortable you drift off to sleep in no time and awake refreshed ready for another day of relaxing. If you decide you want to go sightseeing or find something adventuring to do you're not far from that either (30 to Houma, 90 to New Orleans, and 120 to Baton Rouge with so many things to do inbetween and even closer if you don't want to go out too far) l. We look forward to returning in the future."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing! The house has all of the amenities that were needed to make us feel at home. The house slept my family comfortably, with room for more, of needed. It‚Äôs situated on a beautiful stretch of the bayou, which allowed for my sons to fish and enjoy themselves for hours on end! We are definitely making this our go-to home away from home, when we are visiting south Louisiana!"
2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you Raymond for having us!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Everything was just as described and we were centrally located to where we wanted to be. We caught some fish but unfortunately they were too small to keep but we had fun doing it. The house was very clean and there were plenty of dishes and silverware for everything we needed. We will definitely be back to do this again.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Raymonds place was clean and nicely decorated when arriving. Entering the door using the lockbox was easy and stress free. We are a large family of 6 and had plenty of room in Raymonds home. We were able to hold small get togethers where everyone was comfortable and happy being on the water fishing. If you have never been to LA I highly recommend staying here in Raymonds home, you will not be disappointed. He provides easy access to him for any contact reasons. There are quite a few good places to eat near the home As well. We personally reccommend the pizza place 4mins away! If u have any questions about our stay or need help deciding if this is the right vacationing home for you just ask!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is even more beautiful, clean, and comfortable than the pictures show. The inside is so organized and open, and the house itself sits on a quiet street. The location is lovely with trees and the lake right under the balcony. If you're like me and have never seen fish jumping out of the water you're going to love standing on the balcony watching and listening to those guys. The area is so quiet you can relax and you can get a good sleep too. We didn't use the upstairs bedrooms but both bathrooms are nice, with more than enough towels and toilet paper, as well as hand soap. The master bath is wonderful, you won't want to leave it and you might even don a swim suit and stay in there for a few hours. The master bed is so comfortable, you're going to want one like it in your home. Also, in case there are any dry spills there are brooms and a vacuum in the laundry room. The chairs and couch are comfortable too and although we didn't stay in and watch T.V. I definitely took time to lay back in the dark leather recliner. There's something about a recliner that makes you want to take a nap. Something I know my family and I think about when we stay somewhere while traveling is how clean a place is knowing someone stayed there before us. Well, at this house you couldn't tell someone had been there before you, the cleaning process is that through. So, it's beautiful, quiet, clean, and comfortable. I couldn't have asked for more in a place to stay.
The host himself is helpful and kind. If you have any questions or concerns reach out to him and I have no doubts he'll help."
2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very clean home with lots of amenities. Quick and easy check in, and Raymond was always available to answer any questions I had. The balcony was truly relaxing and the home‚Äôs location allowed us to get around the area with ease. Will definitely be back."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will be back!!! A true Gem. Since we are locals it was like traveling to another state and total vacation!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have been working in the Houma area since 2006. Never in my time in the area have I ever felt as comfortable and at home as I did at Morgan‚Äôs property. This was my first opportunity to bring my wife and son with me on a work trip and we had the absolute best time and created memories that will last a lifetime. Morgan went out of her way during the length of our stay to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. She offered up many great restaurant suggestions and just overall really made us feel right at home. Note: Make sure to eat at least once at Cajun Critters while staying here. It is within walking distance and has the best local seafood I‚Äôve eaten in Houma. Overall, Morgan‚Äôs property was simply impeccable. However, the true shining star is the host herself.
Thank you again Morgan for all you did for us during our time at your Airbnb. We will never forget your kindness and we will be back again very soon!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great stay, my dog loved the big backyard!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very family friendly and clean home. The fenced in backyard, hammock and fire pit were hug hits with our 4 kiddos. Would definitely stay here again when we come to town."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Just what we were looking for. We traveled down for Mardi Gras, as my husband and a friend ride in a parade. This was a nice place away from some of the craziness. Easy to get to restaurants and shopping.
It is very nicely decorated and comfortable."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place to stay
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was very comfortable and clean. Location was good and in a quiet neighborhood. There was an issue with the connectivity to the TV, but Morgan responded immediately and made an appt for an AT&T tech to come out. From my experiences in the past, many hosts would not respond for hours after attempting to contact them. We were so impressed and appreciated her responsiveness!
The back yard was great for our dogs. The only strange thing was that there wasn‚Äôt a door in the house that opened up directly to the backyard, so you have to exit the carport door and go through a separate utility room to get there. Just a little inconvenient for when we had to let our dogs out in middle of night because the older one has incontinence issues.
We were there four nights and highly recommend it! Cajun Critters is also our go-to for great Cajun food!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was as described and host was quick to respond and accommodate my request for early check in due to my daughter‚Äôs wedding!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Morgan was a fantastic host. She messaged us during our stay to make sure everything was going good. The home was exactly as described and more. Beautiful, fenced backyard with shade trees and a back porch. The home was squeaky clean and conveniently located in Houma. She had Pots, pans, dishes, hand towels, & kitchen accessories for cooking.

The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. We will be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our whole family felt like this was a home away from home, and the neighborhood was nice and peaceful. Morgan's home is kid friendly, as well as quiet and comfortable for adults. Morgan thought of everything we would need for our stay. This has been one of the best places we have stayed at as a family. The infant items were a life saver. Knowing she had these items helped save us from packing all that baby gear. The backyard was a great place to relax for us adults and a fun place for the kids to play! Everything was very clean and the beds were super comfortable. The kitchen setup was really nice and had plenty of space. We would love to stay here again on our next trip to Houma."

Easy to find, easy check in."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I stayed at Elise‚Äôs cottage for 3 nights.
It was a perfect place for a couple including a pool & hot tub. We did not get a chance to enjoy either because we were out exploring during the day & were tired when we got back! Only an hour away from New Orleans.
It was clean & cozy & was equipped with everything we needed.
Elise always got back with us when we had questions or asked for suggestions.
I would highly recommend this cottage if you‚Äôre ever in the area!
Thank you Elise & Doug for your generous hospitality.üòä"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was very peaceful and comfortable. It‚Äôs a pool house with a shared outside space. Although the outside space is shared, the host is very communicative, so it still felt very private when we utilized the pool/hot tub. The host is very responsive and friendly, so we felt at home.
I was impressed how everything in there was purposed, put together in Such a cool way, and even had towels labeled ‚Äúmakeup‚Äù (haha! I forgot to bring makeup wipes/remover).
The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Every time I took a walk, it seemed like I was the only my person around üòÜ.
Although feasible, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend adding a 4th person (although the host gives the option), as a 3rd person makes it feel a bit cramped in there.
I loved my stay. I‚Äôm hoping that I can stay there every time I am in Houma, LA."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was so comfortable and felt like my own place! It is private and serene with the pool and yard with birds chirping and singing....lots of cardinals.

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Airbnb EVER. I can absolutely say that this cottage was something I‚Äôll never forget! The southern hospitality that was shown by the owners were amazing. Our first morning, Elise and her husband brought us DELICIOUS donuts from this local sweets shop up the road (which by the way, they were so good that we stopped on the way there before our 10 hour trip home) then the next morning they surprised us with a Easter basket for our little girl with two muffins and a book. She made our Easter holiday special being so far away from home. The communication was fast, the cottage was ADORABLE, comforting, extremely clean... and WAY better than staying in a 5 star hotel. I honestly had the best experience and would love to stay here again while visiting friends. Thank you for everything, Elise!"

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The accommodations are beyond safe and comfortable. If cleanliness is next to Godliness, sainthood is in the making. We so appreciate the hospitality. When in Houma, we‚Äôll be sure to return."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jennifer's place was an absolute perfect match for the holidays with my family, who lives in Houma (sister, and two nieces 3 and 6)
Plenty of space and Marina Park was just the right distance for both big and little legs alike.
The kitchen (utensils and appliances) were above and beyond any Airbnb I've stayed at.
Jennifer was very responsive to all questions we had and was an excellent host."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable with a great location!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming house with plenty of space. The decor is great and beds were comfy, black out curtains a big plus! Would definitely recommend staying here üòä"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer was easy to deal with. Home is small but met our needs. The bed is extremely firm not what I like but I am sure some people enjoy that. Living room furniture is not comfortable at all. Overall though for the cost it was very much worth it.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great house to relax in after working all day. Jennifer was very proactive with anything we needed and always responsive to any questions. I would definitely recommend staying at this house.

The house is a very cute little house and convenient to many things. Her local travel guide was helpful and full of good places and things to do."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little cozy house. Kitchen had everything we needed. Beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The neighborhood, though older, is very quiet. It was a nice place to come back to after a long day. Jennifer was very helpful and responsive. Highly recommend. I would definitely stay again if in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer‚Äôs place was exactly as expected. We felt right at home. Due to our time constraints, we did not have time to venture out much. The kitchen had all the amenities needed to cook meals at home. We were very thankful of the additional fans. They were definitely used. The decor in the home made the place feel real homey. We definitely appreciated the communication with Jennifer as she responded to our needs very quickly. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great I would love to stay here again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a state contractor I go all over Louisiana and normally stay with my crew at AirBnBs. So needless to say I‚Äôve stayed at quite a few over the years. This one takes the cake for the price point! Everything you could ever need in the kitchen (except for tongs), all kinds of little appliances (microwave, toaster over, panini press, etc), big TV, work area/desk, awesome shower heads, great aesthetic! 11/10 would stay again!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family of 4 stayed here for 3 nights. The house was clean and comfortable with the usual amenities. Check in was easy. Not a great area if you want to be close to restaurants or shopping. The neighborhood is older with a few rundown houses close by but we had no issues during our stay. Covered carport was a plus during rain showers and on hot sunny days. We would stay here again if we‚Äôre in the area again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travel a lot always staying at motels, the space compared to a one room motel. We didn‚Äôt have to deal with people in hallways or breakfast bar. We prepared a couple of meals, sit back enjoy our morning coffee by ourselves. The stay was beyond our expectations, it was the first for the both of us, truly impressed! Yes, it was the first but not the last one.
Tom Bodett, can keep the light on for anybody else except us.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place!! Everything was so clean and check in was simple.
Would stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay and will coming back to Houma again to visit our son and will be absolutely staying at this home again if its available. It was perfect and very clean! Great layout and spacious. We have never been to Houma before and knew nothing about the area, so we were honestly a little skeptical. There are some what appears to be some run-down houses in the vicinity, but that is a lot of Houma. Hurricane Ida made her mark and some of the city is still not repaired. However, it was very walkable we felt completely safe. All of the locals were super friendly. The location was perfect as it was close everything we were looking to do and some great restaurants. The host was amazing on communication and very thoughtful in her comments when she knew the purpose of our trip. It was a great stay, very comfortable and nice home!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Prefect place for our quick work trip to Houma
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,the house was a nice. relaxing spot in a busy vacation. very clean and kid friendly.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Bottom Line Up Front: If you are looking for a place to live while visiting Houma and this place is available my advice to you is to get it before it‚Äôs gone! This home is situated in a quiet neighborhood with nice neighbors. It is minutes away to everything from a coffee shop to a hospital. The house was very clean, well-organized, and packed with all the amenities just like our home. My family felt secure and comfortable throughout the stay. The modern interior offered excellent Wi-Fi with television options. During our vacation an unexpected visitor came to town and he resided with us for 1 night in the amazing 1 bed, 1 bath fully furnished single apartment! Listen, you have read the listing, and now you have read this review, trust me‚Ä¶this is the one! The combination of the host and home, makes this place unlike any other in Houma!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,My family and I rented both the house and the apartment! They were perfect! So cute and exactly as described! I like to be outdoors and there was plenty of space! We will definitely stay again if we are ever back in town!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was well done but still cozy and clean. the host went above and beyond. It was great to be able to walk to the parades in downtown Houma
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We utilized both the house and the apartment for our stay. Both were well kept and met all of our expectations. The house was smartly furnished and very comfortable. The location is great for walking to Houma's downtown area for activities and food. The hosts were very gracious and made everything easy for us. Our whole family enjoyed the stay and we intend to utilize the property again in the future!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you Liberty Properties! This place was better than I imagined! Everything very neat and clean. Great remodel btw too. Felt like home away from home. All appliances were so cute and helpful. Fridge was big. Beds/pillows were firm but surprisingly comfy. Washer and dryer was so incredible to have especially for a family of 5. Big tv in every room with Roku.
I had a few requests that Liberty Properties thoughtfully granted. They were very communicative with us. They were flexible with our flight schedule and check in and out times.
I also have a little phobia of bugs and the south has, of course, cockroaches and ants etc. I did not see one bug in this house besides the mosquitos we accidentally let in from normal use. Very clean. Will be staying here again!!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We have team members working on a project in the Houma area. This was our second time to stay with this host. Our team members were so happy when we were able to rebook in the same house. Our hosts were so easy to work with, very responsive and very accommodating. 10 out of 10 recommend!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Owners were very easy to work with, responsive and helpful. They even checked in with us to see how everything was going, which was a nice personal touch. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Great experience!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is very comfortable! Perfect for my stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect location for my group! My sister & her partner had privacy in the apartment, while my husband and I stayed in the main house with our daughter & my nephew.
I greatly appreciated the provided charging adapters in the master bedroom, as I had forgotten to bring my phone charger. The whole place was super clean & comfortable. Love the open shelving in the kitchen.
The neighbors have a dog that cries/whines at night... it's not too loud (my husband never even heard it) but just a heads-up, because it did throw me a bit on the first night, I woke up discombobulated and thinking my daughter was crying in the next room.
We would absolutely stay at a Liberty Properties home again if we travel back to Houma. Such a cute place! Excellent communication with the host too."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay and the house was very clean and all the photos of the house were accurate. The house was very large and had lots of space. It was in a great location for us. The neighborhood was quiet. There is also a studio apartment behind the house that we rented also and it was just as clean and adorable as the house. I would definitely recommend booking the apartment with the house if you want additional space. The host was great to work with and keep in touch with us throughout our stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)
Our recent stay in Houma, Louisiana, at this charming Airbnb was absolutely delightful! The cozy bedroom, attention to detail, and thoughtful amenities made for a comfortable stay. The hosts were incredibly welcoming, communicative and offered fantastic local recommendations, which enhanced our experience. We highly recommend Rachelle & Brandon‚Äôs property as it exudes Southern hospitality in peaceful, and warmly appointed environment. Big gratitude to the hosts for making our trip so special, we can't wait to return!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liberty Properties Houma location was exactly what we needed and a pleasant surprise! Perfectly quaint and tastefully decorated. Lovely restoration of an older property, not over done. Every piece of decor was well thought out and perfect for the home(s). I would definitely stay there again! I wish all Airbnb‚Äôs were this easy. Thank you for giving my family a place to put up there feet during a difficult time!"
,,,It was a great and comfortable and very safe place to stay and I highly recommend the stay their . It‚Äôs great for people with kids & w/out . We where really pleased!
,,,"Worst trip ever! It is very pretty, clean and well kept. That‚Äôs where the positives end. We were told multiple times to not stand on certain bricks around the pool or touch the waterfall due to safety concerns. The dogs she has would lunge at my daughter while swimming which was very worrisome. Also, they are allowed to roam in the cottage, wet feet and all. Host tried to micromanage everything. From our arrival time to when we were leaving for dinner. Host ignored my request to turn on the hot tub for 3 hours and turned off the lights for the pool early. She acted like this booking was a burden and told me multiple times that her blood pressure was high because of us. She accused me of lying about the number of people in our party because one guest‚Äôs attendance was uncertain. I Chose this for my daughter‚Äôs birthday weekend and regret not just getting a hotel."
