2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stayed at this apartment for work and the location was perfect for me as I could walk to the office. The neighborhood is quiet but there is a pizza place and very cool coffee place right under the building. The apartment was very clean, beautiful, and spacious. Bigger than I expected from the pictures. It was well stocked with coffee, tea, shampoo, laundry detergent, a hairdryer, and cookies. I parked right on the street for free and my car was fine. I would stay here again next time I'm in town."

We would definitely stay here again if we are ever back in the area!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very good apartment for me to stay in. There is a very good pizza restaurant on the first floor with very good food and the owner and employees are great to talk with. Short walk to other great restaurants and pubs. Overnight parking was a short walk away. Antonina was very responsive and followed up very quickly to a few questions.
If you are looking for a comfortable stay while in Utica, I recommend this apartment. Very clean and comfortable and I felt I was in a safe community. Just keep in mind, the apartment is in a city, it is a walk up, there are stairs, and there are other people who live in the floor above. Normal things you will encounter when living in the city."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Could not have been happier with this place - the location , personal touches and amenities from the host, ease of check in and navigating to the free parking lot, cleanliness of the place, and responsiveness from the host. Next time in in the area, I will definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre thinking about booking this place, DO IT!! She was an absolutely amazing host she was super responsive as well even late at night! I write this place a 10/10!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is very nicely done, spacious, comfortable, and super clean. And in a great area. Antonina was very responsive‚ÄîUnfortunately she was responsive because of her absurdly loud upstairs neighbor, who decided to vacuum at 11pm, then stay up until 4am, loudly moving about. She was tremendously apologetic and even gave us a discount (that we didn‚Äôt ask for, so that was nice). So if you‚Äôre sensitive to noise or go to bed early, I‚Äôd suggest earplugs in case the neighbor is around. Otherwise the place was great."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome location and apartment, Antonia is a great host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The apartment and location were perfect for our weekend stay. We appreciated Antonina‚Äôs quick responses to our questions. The studio was very clean and modern. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome loft, loved the coffee shop downstairs. We didn't have a chance to try the pizza restaurant as we were in town for a wedding, but the next time we need a place to stay, i sure hope this loft will be available! Thank you for your hospitality and thank you for making it a great experience for my me and my husband."

The bed is super comfortable and the apartment was gorgeous, plus the washer dryer was super helpful. We had come in from a long bike ride and the pizza place just below was delicious and a coffee shop one door down was great and easy for the morning. I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place with a good restaurant, bar and coffee shop next door. The apt was clean and spacious. We‚Äôd stay there again, for sure."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time staying at Antonina‚Äôs loft while visiting Upstate New York.
The loft is as stunning as it looks in the photos, was clean, and close to a number of amenities. We would gladly stay here again if we were in the area, and highly recommend it to others."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband used to work in Utica & stayed very close to where this apartment is located, so we already knew the area well. Our host was extremely responsive & proactive. I felt catered-to, honestly.
The apartment looked just like the photos, and we truly enjoyed our stay! We had our dog with us, and she was entertained both while we were there and I suspect while we were away, thanks to the exact position of the bed next to the windows. She loved the ability to look out the window, and if the dog's happy, everyone is happy!
We had been on the road a lot the last couple of days, and Antonina's place was like an oasis for us weary travelers: Comfortable, clean, accommodating, and a very upscale feeling. No details were left out from the furniture to the bedding to the faucets and decor. I wasn't going to wash my hair until I got home, but then stepped into that shower & just had to when I saw the shampoo and conditioner!
Thank you for such a lovely stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Any time I stay in Utica, I'll check to see if this loft is available first! Beautiful open space, such a great vibe. I'll be back!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was perfect for one night stay. A beautiful and comfortable space. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Antonina's place is clean, spacious and sunny! Just as pictured. Parking was easy, as was finding the place. If you plan to stay in Utica, this place will be great."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location! Pizza and coffee shop downstairs. As others have mentioned, music from pizza place plays until 10 p.m. on weeknights, but very quiet after that!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, will definitely be returning."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely fabulous! She made this space so posh and cozy! Everything she said was exact and the accommodations were on point! I will definitely stay here again when our favorite band comes to town!! Thank you thank you!!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay at Antonina's place - best block in Utica! Great pizza and coffee shop just below! And we loved the old Italian music playing from the pizza shop...it was quite romantic! Please try a wonderful crepe place called Yummylicious (must drive to it)...OMG...best cheesecake I have ever had in my life!!! The loft was modern and super clean and the bed was VERY COMFORTABLE!!!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was perfect for my weeklong work stay. It was very clean, lots of windows and natural light, comfortable and clean furniture, well-equipped kitchen and laundry in the unit. Good location right above a farm-to-table restaurant, a pizza spot, and a great coffee shop. Fast Wi-Fi and easy parking. We were very comfortable."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Antonia‚Äôs place is in a great location - walkable to 2 great coffee shops and one of the best dinners I‚Äôve eaten ANYWHERE in a really long time (Tailor & the Cook). The pizza place also a delicious lunch spot with super friendly staff.
Perhaps because we stayed in the winter, we didn‚Äôt experience any of the loud outside house mentioned in other reviews. It was quiet at night other than regular traffic noises. And we didn‚Äôt find the music from the pizza place very loud at all (and does turn off around 10PM); perhaps the play it more loudly during the summer?
The place was super clean, beautifully decorated, and the wifi was speedy!
Comfortable bed; plenty of towels and very nice products in the bathroom!
If you are planning on doing a lot of cooking, just know that the kitchen is stocked with (nice) basics, but you might need to procure some other items.
Antonia was friendly, super responsive, and helpful! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Centrally located, very clean, and the coffee shop downstairs is very good."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a lovely stay. Antonina is friendly host, very responsive. The unit is beautiful, gorgeous furnishings. Extremely spacious, pet friendly with wonderful restaurants on the same block and a great coffee shop next door. Very quiet building. Vast amount of parking in front of the building. I look forward to staying again!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, very responsive. We stayed during a cold spell after Christmas and the apartment was warm. We were able to adjust heat ourselves. Apartment is what you would consider a quintessential Airbnb. Clean, snacks, small knickknacks, no clutter, sparse cupboards, clean efficient bathroom, spotless fridge and kitchen, large tv with all the streamers. Overall wonderful stay!
Some notes: needs warming up with rugs and/or pillows. The upstairs neighbors are very active at night (8p-4a) and they like to stomp, bang, run, talk loudly. The sound echos in the apartment because there aren‚Äôt fabrics to absorb the sound. The speaker outside the pizza place is obnoxious. It blasted music until 10:30p.
Location: The neighborhood isn‚Äôt quite there yet and feels a little unsafe. We did eat at The Tailor and the Cook (very good) and had coffee at Utica coffee (ok)."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft! Everything was smooth sailing for check-in and parking. The space was large and clean. I enjoyed my time here and I‚Äôd stay again any time. What a treat! Perfect host.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful apartment and great alternative to a hotel. Although the neighbors could be loud, the apartment was comfortable, clean, and most importantly a quick walk away from Utica Coffee. Would definitely do a repeat stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a comfortable, modern, and minimalist space in a super convenient location in walking distance to great food and coffee. The place was clean and well taken care of. Antonina was really helpful and communicated promptly. I‚Äôm always so thankful to be able to travel with my dogs so appreciated this dog friendly loft!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Antonina is an amazing host. She was readily available and very accommodating.
Antonina‚Äôs Airbnb is very luxurious. The loft is very spacious, pristine, well decorated and is close to many amenities - restaurants, cafes, arena etc - and had all the comforts of home. It was hard to close the door that last time. This will be my go to place when I‚Äôm visiting Utica! Thanks Antonina!"

2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"She‚Äôs a great host. The unit we stayed in is clean and we were comfortable. My advice to anyone else that plans to stay around that area. Watch you luggage at all times, lock your vehicle and don‚Äôt leave anything unattended. You will pay the price for any carelessness."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stop for the night. Convenient location. Some noise, but I think that's normal for any urban area. Nina's pizza & Utica coffee were great and close by. Water pressure in the shower was phenomenal!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great space! Convenient location for dinner/drinks!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A tiny hipster getaway in historic Utica one block from the train station.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft was fantastic! Great location within walking distance of restaurants and local watering holes. On-street parking is full during dinning hours (because of the eateries near by), but nothing too concerning. I would recommend Antonina‚Äôs place to all traveling to or through Utica."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is great. If you are going to Utica, don't hesitate to book it."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest loft‚Ä¶ever! The location was super convenient with us visiting Cooperstown for Hall of Fame weekend. The space was spacious, clean and so cozy. Would love to stay here again in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is really big and spacious and really well appointed! It everything we needed and more with a full kitchen. There are restaurants in walking distance and free parking on the street below where I parked my motorcycle and could see it from our window.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Super clean and really nice loft! Host was very accommodating and we really enjoyed our stay during a long road trip via i90.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay !
2022-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This studio apartment was very clean, welcoming, and well decorated! It is located very close to many things and we could walk to coffee and dinner very close by. Because of this, I would love to give the place 5 stars‚Ä¶however, it was incredibly loud outside the apartment (the windows face the street) throughout both nights we were there. We stayed there in the month of July and the weather was really nice, so maybe people were out on the street more than usual. Sadly, there were people partying until all hours of the morning on the sidewalk below. Notably, there is a gentleman‚Äôs club below the apartment (that may or may not be closed) that may have led to an increased number of folks outside.
In addition, there is a pizza place under the apartment that has a speaker facing the sidewalk. They were playing the music very loud until 10pm. Finally, there are apartments above and below this property, and you can hear people walking and dogs barking.
We‚Äôve stayed (and live) in urban areas, but this felt unusually loud. If this kind of thing doesn‚Äôt bother you, you should stay here! It is a really great apartment aside from all the noise."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment is amazingly gorgreous - open, airy, with a super comfortable bed. Really a great apartment. Things to be aware of - it is a 3rd floor walk up, and there are some neighbors with some very yippy dogs, who did ultimately settle down."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, easy parking, and very clean."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing loft in downtown to stay at! Extremely clean, close to some very delicious eateries, and Antonina is extremely responsive when you have any questions. There is a downtown type ambiance with sounds from neighbors and music from the surrounding restaurants, but for us, it was nice. It is on the third floor and not handicap accessible, but if you‚Äôre able to make a few flights of stairs, Antonina‚Äôs loft is an amazing place to spend time at."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Antonina‚Äôs place is super clean and very cool. A true loft space with lots of room, a giant TV you can watch from bed or the couch, which is fun as well as great decorating touches. It has a well-equipped kitchen and a washer and dryer. The bed is comfortable with lots of pillows and extra blankets. It is on a fun strip with a great coffee shop. There are a lot of stairs to get to the apartment and, being in the middle of the action, it isn‚Äôt very quiet. Antonina was a very responsive host and the whole experience was completely enjoyable."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was cozy, clean, and comfortable. Great location, except for the traffic noise outside. The stairs are a bit steep and there were a lot of them, so it might be hard for some people.
We enjoyed staying here!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked this studio for my wife‚Äôs birthday and she loved it. The high ceilings, modern kitchen and bathroom, and a view of downtown Utica. The space was easy for me to set up for her special day and a great place to take photos. I would book again without a doubt."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Nicely appointed with easy check-in. Steps away from Utica coffee which makes a great tropical fruit smoothie. My only issue is with the music coming from the outdoor speaker of the pizza restaurant below. Music shut off at 9:10 pm and began again at 10 am.
2022-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Antonina's loft is sparkling clean and comfortable. We also enjoyed great coffee and food within walking distance. We will definitely book again with Antonina when we are in Utica!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Antonia was an amazing host. Her home was spotless and and the location is perfect as you can find just about anything within 15 minutes or less of driving. The home was very spacious and the check-in and check-out process was very simple. I also love that this location is pet friendly!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing stay! My husband and I stayed for two nights while on a really long road trip and used it as ‚Äúhome base.‚Äù It was so cute, clean, and perfect for us! Antonina was a wonderful host, answered all my questions, and check in/out was super easy! If we ever come back out this way, we would definitely stay again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay for visiting Utica. In a quieter part of downtown. Feels pretty safe. Close to everything. Parking is free and right downstairs and always available. The apartment is beautifully decorated, and has everything needed. Antonina is very thoughtful. Even had green plants, coffee/tea bags/Keurig machine, and bowlful of snacks waiting for us. Truly home away from home.
Pros:
- extremely comfortable bed
- shower is amazing. Great water pressure
- huge TV with Netflix and Disney already installed and logged in
- downstairs are the city‚Äôs best coffee shop (Utica Roasting Co), best pizza (Johnny‚Äôs), and best fine dining (Tailor and Cooks). We are foodies, and we were in heaven.
Cons:
- not handicap accessible. Not an issue for us, but would not be a good fit for people can‚Äôt walk up stairs."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed at the Loft while visiting family in the area, and we may have just found our new go-to place to book whenever we visit! Pet friendly and when the morning sun comes through the huge windows it‚Äôs truly stunning. Impeccably clean and very responsive host."

The noise level was a little high through the night but that‚Äôs city living. We loved the Sinatra being played at the Pizza place downstairs."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever stayed at. The space is really neat: an open floor plan, tons of space, and a brand new kitchen. The bed is ultra comfy too. It is very Quiet and perfect for sleeping. And the surrounding area is really cool. We went to a really neat brewery and had breakfast at a place that was just awesome. Can‚Äôt wait to go back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. My favorite spot to stay in Utica. I keep going back
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're staying in Utica this is the perfect location. Situated one block from the train station it is walking distance from downtown and literally right above a gourmet restaurant, a great coffee shop, and little local pizza joint. A one block walk will find you at the cool Baggs Square Brewery and less than a mile walk will get you to the fun restaurants and pubs and nightlife along Varick Street.
As for the room it was impeccably clean and very well appointed with some nice amenities like plenty of local coffee and some light snacks and gourmet candies. It is secure and private and very spacious and has everything you could need for a one night stay or a full extended stay.
The only concern for some (though I kind of liked it) was the cliched Italian music wafting up from the pizza joint two stories below. It is a bit loud and could be a problem for some if you go to sleep early. But by 11 PM it was dead quiet up there.
I for sure will stay here again if I can next time I find myself in Utica."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great studio with large windows that make it seem even larger - The host was wonderful and everything perfect ! Clean as can be and highly recommend a stay !

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment is, if anything, better than the photos show! Super spacious, very comfortable, and well equipped. We really enjoyed staying here and were able to park easily just out front. We were only here for the night and didn't really explore the neighborhood much, but it's really easy to get to off the highway and there is a great coffee shop just next door."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"The loft space was great but unfortunately the upstairs neighbors were a little noisy. I‚Äôd still recommend this place, but just make sure you turn the fan on to block out the noise."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Utica to ride the Adirondack Railroad to Thendara (Old Forge) for the fall color and visit. Antonina's place is an excellent high-end apartment in Baggs Square. It's a short 5 minute walk to the train station and sits above a coffee shop, restaurant and pizzeria. Other excellent restaurants and brew pubs are nearby. The apartment has great amenities, upscale interior design and very clean. The shower has really nice water pressure! We highly recommend it!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place is super nice, comfortable and cute decorated! I loved everything about it. Good location too.
The host was wonderful, and she answered very quickly."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A stylish, clean, modern loft in an interesting and emerging neighborhood in Utica. The host communicated clearly, and noted she was just a text away if anything went wrong (ps: nothing did!) Note: it's a third-floor walkup, so not accessible to all. Loved the space!"

Area was a little desolate (especially due to Labor Day) and there is a gentleman‚Äôs club downstairs (others might care about this, but it was not disruptive to me). Also, good coffee next door."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super chic in a very hip area! Perfect stay- comfy bed, lots of space, enormous TV, and decorated so beautifully! Would highly recommend this space!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a special place to stay - I wish I‚Äôd had more time. Gorgeous apartment, massive windows and loads of light - decor was incredibly tasteful. Peace and quiet - I had a great nights sleep. Highly recommend."

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Excellent stay
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we had a good stay. The house was very clean and had a ton of space. We just felt like it was missing some basics since we were there for five nights. Things like a toaster, dish soap, dishwasher soap, laundry detergent, and measuring cups would have been helpful to have. I know it's a personal preference, but I found the pillows to be uncomfortable, my husband didn't mind them though!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Excellent

We had an awesome time, we would absolutely stay here again in the future! Thanks Laura!"

She was so responsive, went ABOVE AND BEYOND, became almost like family and her home a ""home away from home."" I absolutely adore Laura and wouldn't stay anywhere else when I'm in Utica.

The building is quiet and the space felt like home. Absolutely lovely!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I spent 2 nights here for a college visit. The space was exactly as pictured but even more cozy. After spending a long day touring the campus, I could not wait to get back to the space and enjoy the several comfy seating areas with one of the fuzzy blankets! There was nothing that was not provided, which was great for a 2 day stay, and when you don't have time to fuss with a trip to the store. Lots of nice restaurants in the area to choose from. Definitely a 5 star stay!"

The beds were so comfortable, the window light is amazing, the only place is so beautifully decorated, and the sunrise was visible upon waking up from all of the rooms. Coffee shops and restaurants were nearby and Laura left lots of little extras for our family to make us feel welcome. Parking was easy as well. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

The decor is gorgeous, the space is plenty, the views are spectacular, and she thought of everything a guest could possibly need.

Laura is the most thoughtful, gracious host. She provided me with all the information we needed and showed me around. The penthouse is just perfect! The kitchen is a modern and beautiful design that contains everything one needs, plus! The beds were comfortable. The living room furniture was cozy. Bathrooms are excellent. Location is incredible. Communication was great too.
Laura was extremely welcoming and was of great help. She went way beyond to make my weekend comfortable and memorable. I have already (highly) recommended Laura‚Äôs penthouse to friends and I am looking forward to the next time I can stay!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing loft in the heart of Utica! Magazine gorgeous with 20 foot ceilings in a rapidly developing downtown section of Utica. You'll be in awe to see the sunrise over the city and the foothills of the Adirondacks from the massive windows.
Laura is a phenomenal host. Her apartment is beautifully decorated and kitted out with any amenity you could imagine. She really pays attention to the details. She followed up after we checked in and made sure that there were fun things for our 11 year old to do. We enjoyed waking up and tasting local Utica favorites while sipping espresso.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The inside of this place was absolutely immaculate, the cleaning service didn‚Äôt just clean. They deep clean. The kitchen was extremely functionable. We were able to save money by making them majority of our meals in the home. I took my 11-year-old son with me and we got to watch my cousin play for the USA women‚Äôs national hockey team And had a really good time. I was ‚Äòthat guy‚Äô and asked a lot of questions and got extremely fast responses. The location is very close to downtown Utica about 3 minutes by car, no highways. The beds were comfortable and the linens and towels were very clean , well kept bathroom. I packed my son‚Äòs PlayStation and the seating in the family room was also very comfortable with cupholders and we enjoyed some bonding comfortably together in that room. I did have a small concern, when it was brought up, it was handled immediately and satisfied. I am a small business owner, and it was nice to see how they handled this situation ethically as I would have done. :)"

The apartment is the main floor of a two story building and thoughtfully decorated and designed. It looked just like the pictures and had everything we needed for cooking, relaxing, laundry and sleeping comfortably. I was especially impressed with how well stocked the kitchen was with necessary pots and pans, blender, cooking utensils, even a a spice rack! They were friendly, thoughtful with details before our stay (like parking arrangements) and helped promptly when a question came up. We'd stay here again!"

2024-02-01,5,Group trip,The apartment was beautiful and exactly as pictured. Check in was a little confusing as it said it was the back apartment but it was really the front apartment. No issues during our stay. Had a good time there. Not the best neighborhood but no issues for us.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent experience! Rick was very responsive and easy to work with. We just needed a place to stay overnight to break up a longer drive, but it was so nice we almost wished we were staying longer. It was clean and very comfortable."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,absolutely beautiful.i felt like I was in Manhattan...I just love this place.

The beds were cozy, the bathrooms were clean with really nice towels, and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed for cooking. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Utica."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was just as described with a very responsive host. A beautiful apartment. My only issue, as a light sleeper, was that people/dogs in other apartments could be heard. This only happened a couple of times in our 3 day stay and did not continue into the night. This is an issue with the building and not something within control of the host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent apt, thanks a lot"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was as described. My family and I enjoyed our stay, loved the location. Will definitely book again if available. Go Blackhawks!!"

There was lots of space to host dinners and DnD sessions and the yard was amazing to have picnics and light saber battles. I highly recommend this property if you are ever in Utica."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed for Utica University graduation
Convenient to campus and graduation location
Our big family (6) had fun"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Robby was excellent to work with! We had an amazing time at this place. Came into town for our grandson 1st birthday and baby dedication. It was perfect!! Thank you for excellent communication! The house was outstanding!! Overall very pleased!!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great spot! We were six women attending the Womens Worlds Hockey Championship for a week. Everyone was so impressed with the place and couldn't thank me enough for finding it. Main floor spacious, comfortable rooms; everyone had a different spot in the mornings to sit and enjoy coffee and check their scocial media. WIFI was good.
Kitchen and pantry have everything you would need. Robby even left some Utica coffee for us to try Delicious! Bed linens, towels and pillows are all high quality and beds very comfortable. Ensuites off bedrooms, all with showers and lots of hot water.
House is located in older section near downtown where several revitalization projects are going on. It is in a mixed neighbourhood but we did not feel unsafe and sat on front porch and in backyard on the nice days. It was a five minute drive to the arena and about the same for other attractions in Utica."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Robby was a welcoming and friendly host! There were several of us in town for a business event and Robby's AirBnB was a great spot for us as it was close to the venue. The house was immaculate, and Robby met me upon check-in to provide a full tour of the house and all that it had to offer. To mirror some other comments, while I've been told from some that it is not the best area in town, I never felt unsafe staying at this AirBnb and neither did any of my colleagues. This house is a gem in Utica."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,We had three families with plenty of room for everyone and the place was beautiful
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I was born in Utica and even though we haven't lived in Utica for over 40 years, have spent almost every Christmas. Now that our own children are married with children, we needed a place to be comfortable to just hang out before seeing both sides of the family...this was the perfect place. The bedrooms are sooo comfortable and luxurious that I felt like I was in a five star hotel.
I was able to cook dinner for our family of 8. The stove was so clean I almost hated to use it. The refrigerator was very spacious and we had a LOT of food to fill it. The dining room is enormous and we had a couple of meals there. TV and living rooms were really comfy to hang out in also.
There was enough hot water for all of us to shower and the bathrooms are very comfortable.
As far as the area, we never felt unsafe and my husband even found a playground two houses away for my 3 year old grandson to play in. Too many plusses to name. I could go on and on."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,The house was thoughtfully appointed. The host could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Great stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Robby was an amazing host! He was friendly and prompt with his responses, always prioritizing our needs and comfort. The house is beautifully restored and represents an art piece more than a home. The interior exerted a modern twist to its historical structure. It is cozy and spotless. I have never seen an airbnb this clean before and can tell how much effort Robby has put into the home. He was super accommodating to my request to check out later due to an event at my university. There was a lot of space in the home and allowed pets. I had booked this airbnb last minute and Robby took the time to meet me at the airbnb to give me a tour. He is very passionate about his work and always strives to improve his guests‚Äô experience. The hospitality Robby has shown cannot be compared to previous experiences. I would definitely come back the next time I am around this area!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This was an incredible find! Robby is a terrific host and reached out to offer MORE space for our nurses. The extra rooms that were available allowed me to get all of our nurses on a temporary project assignment situated together in one location! They loved the property! It is a fabulous spot for traveling nurses. They have somewhere safe where they can settle in and feel at home instead of living out of a suitcase!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Amazing house! Beautifully restored. Robby cares about the area and has gone to great lengths to make the house special. He is very accessible and accommodating. Thank you for an amazing girls weekend!! So much history here. Loved it.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Can‚Äôt say enough great things about Robby‚Äôs place! It is impeccably clean, had more than enough space for our big group to spread out, and there are plenty of common spaces for everyone to enjoy time together. The kitchen is well stocked and the location is favorable for plenty of great restaurants nearby. Robby‚Äôs communication was clear and proactive, and he is quick to respond when you have questions. He even helped us recover a set of headphones that we left behind.
Our experience was everything we could ask for and more with this Airbnb! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We cannot give Robby enough stars. Not only was the air bnb comfortable, roomy and exceptionally clean, Robby‚Äôs attention to every detail was meticulous. As a host, right was a super accessible, attentive, warm and welcoming. He takes pride in offering the highest quality of accommodations and amenities. Would stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Robby‚Äôs places exceeded expectations. The house was spacious for our family gathering and Robby was attentive and helpful when questions arose. I would not hesitate recommending Robby‚Äôs place and staying there again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Robby‚Äôs place was amazing! The pictures do not do it justice. It is a beautifully restored and decorated historic home that is bigger and better than it appears on the listing. It has gorgeous woodwork and built-ins throughout. The floors were a bit squeaky, but that‚Äôs because they are original wood floors with lovely details, so we didn‚Äôt mind it. The immediate neighborhood is not great and needs a little love and attention. However, we felt very safe the whole time we were there and found good places for food shopping and dining out just 5-10 minutes away by car. They also had a fully-stocked kitchen with everything you can think of, so we easily made some homemade meals.
Robby was very friendly, responsive and accommodating. It seems he thought of every possible detail to make our stay wonderful. It was perfect for our multigenerational family, and we look forward to booking this place again whenever we are in the area. This is one of the best AirBnB stays we‚Äôve ever had!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place was absolutely perfect for our group. Enough room to spread out, but still excellent places to get together. Robby was also a great host who was easy to communicate with and very flexible. The restoration work and details here were literally jaw dropping when walking through. It's a beautiful home that is very welcoming from when you first step inside."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is such a gem, my only sadness is that I have to relay how great it is and that will make it less available for times I want to come back! The house is impeccable, the neighborhood has some work in terms of feeling safe to walk at night. I never felt unsafe though. There's so much attention to detail, down to coffee makers, first aid kit, and soap. There is enough space for a larger party to spread out VERY comfortably. The beds were crazy comfortable. And Robby was available very easily. I think he was actually concerned that he hadn't heard from ME more, but the accommodations were so great and everything already attended to that I didn't have a need! I wouldn't hesitate on this if it is available for your dates of travel."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Spectacular renovated home just a few blocks from downtown Utica. Great for a large family visit. Huge dining room, nice TV room and many other places to gather. On a double-lot and has plenty of parking. Host Robby has done an incredible job renovating the property and definitely overdelivers as a host as well. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful property , great for family events and multi family stay in the Utica area. Dinging room is awesome and easily accommodated 12 people!
Robby is a great host and very responsive to guest‚Äôs needs. He went above and beyond to ensure we had a slow cooker for one of the meals we were planning!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"The property is gorgeous! Really cool to stay in a restored home. Felt like I was right at home in Utica. We will stay here again. We were here for a box lacrosse tournament. Tons of space. Huge dinning room, tv room, parking off the steer for 3-4 cars. Had enough room for 10-12 people to stay comfortably. 5 stars, one of the best properties in Utica. 5 minutes to the Nexus Center"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robby was a very thorough host he called me during check-in and check-out to ensure everything went smoothly. I just wanted to note the bedroom with the fireplace had an incredible mattress. All the rooms were very clean. I was very pleased. I give 5 stars for everything.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I had an amazing time at Robby‚Äôs place. It is even better than the pictures. Robby made the process so easy and was very easy to reach! Would recommend
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would. This is an immaculate home with immense character. We came in town for a family reunion and it will be our choice each year forward. We tripped a breaker, contacted Robby and he was there within 5 minutes. He couldn‚Äôt have been friendlier. He gave us local tips, shared his love for the arts in the area‚Ä¶and gifted us a bottle of wine. We felt like we were talking to an old friend. He is a great guy and a wonderful host. The house itself has comfortable beds, lots of areas to gather and the large dining room provides a great space to have a fun eclectic meal. I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Everything about this house and host was absolutely fantastic. Highly recommended!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This is a lovely, restored house. We felt comfortable and pampered. The host has thought of everything you could want or need, and more. He went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. The house is so spacious that it could accommodate even more people and still be comfortable."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were just thrilled with everything. The house was just lovely as was our host. Will happily recommend this home to anyone.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this house! This was our second stay at Robby‚Äôs for Hamilton College events and it is perfect for our multi-generational group. Beautiful and pristine, everyone was comfortable and happy. Robby is a great host‚Äîhelpful, easy communication. FIVE STARS!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Everything was absolutely perfect. The host is wonderful to work with and has a quick response. Highly recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Robby‚Äôs place was just wonderful and perfect. Very clean and spacious. Great furnitures and the beds are so comfortable. We felt at home. I would recommend this place without hesitation to anyone visiting Utica. Thank you Robby. You were the perfect host !!!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"better than advertised!
robby and his place are great. wonderful host and house. robby pays attention to details to bring this beautiful home back to life in a local way, using quality furnishings and decor. even the TP is top notch!
cannot recommend this place enough if you're in the utica area!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,We stayed at Robby‚Äôs place while attending a curling tournament nearby. The house was perfect for our larger group (9 people)- there was more than enough room for us all to hang out. The house is gorgeously renovated and well stocked with the advertised amenities. Robby greeted us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the house and was very responsive and accommodating throughout our stay. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best AirBnB experience I've had. The pictures do not do this place justice. Every room had a new charm and beautiful craftsmanship. My favorite room was the linen closet room! I never wanted to leave. The pictures all over the house show the care taken to restore the house to its former glory. My friends and I were curling in a tournament that weekend and ended up showing multiple other teams the house because we were so blown away. Each bathroom had its toiletries, each bed had multiple (fluffy) pillows, everything was clean, the coffee and tea were stocked - it was amazing. 12/10 could not do more to recommend, except that I always want to come back here and not have this house booked every day of the year. Robby was also extremely helpful and allowed us to check out late when we won our game on Sunday morning. He was quick to respond and very flexible, which made the tournament stress free for us."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Awesome updated place. Will be back next Utica hockey trip
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This house is amazing and so beautiful. Robby was a wonderful host and very easy to work with. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and spend some time there very soon
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a wonderful stay! The house is even more beautiful in person. Robby was an exceptional host with a speedy response to any questions. We made a special request during our stay and Robby was very accommodating. The linens are great quality and super cosy. The house was nice and clean. There are many excellent restaurants near by as well as a museum, ice rink, theater, and shopping. We have family in the area and plan to come back to stay at Robby‚Äôs place more in the future."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"We spent five nights at Robby's beautiful house while visiting our son for Christmas. The house offered plenty of space with lots of different rooms for everyone to spread out. The house is very tastefully decorated and well stocked with linens, dishes, glassware, platters, etc. Everything in the house worked well and was in really good condition. The house has a huge dining room table that was great for our holiday dinners. There were also lots of great books about the local area.
Robby was very responsive before and during our stay. He sent a ton of local recommendations which were very appreciated. We did not go exploring too much but we did enjoy a visit to the zoo, a private 2 hour ""learn to curl"" session at the Utica Curling Club and a nice dinner at Nola's in the town of Clinton. If you have a larger group visiting Utica I would highly recommend renting Robby's house."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous house and a wonderful host!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Another wonderful stay at the Kemble house. The house was impeccable, comfortable and cozy. We look forward to coming to stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely wonderful experience. Gold standard for an Airbnb.
The thoughtful touches (down to the contents of each medicine cabinet!) made our stay feel special and luxurious.
Beds were incredibly comfortable and linens were beautiful.
Plenty of towels and toiletries. Public Goods & Ceremony brand toiletries üíØ
Will absolutely be staying here again on future trips home."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robby is an amazing host!
We had a great time and his suggestions about what to do in the area where great."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robby‚Äôs house is 5 stars! Spacious, so beautiful, spotless, plenty of room for our party‚Äîmultigenerational group for a Hamilton College parents‚Äô weekend. Close to campus (15 mins) and also close (3 mins) to downtown Utica restaurants. Bedrooms are spacious and very comfortable, living spaces‚Äîliving room, dining room and kitchen plus more‚Äîare all so enjoyable to be in. Robby is a great host, lots of recommendations, super easy communications, check-in. Can‚Äôt recommend enough."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"I am elated to say that my family and I had a GREAT stay at Robby's beautiful home! Upon arrival, Robby was at the property to greet us, and give us a tour of the property. The home is very spacious, elegant and beautifully decorated! Robby is an excellent host; everything you need and more was in the home! This by far is my favorite Airbnb! I will definitely booked again, again and again! Trust me, you will not be disappointed! Thank you Robby for hosting us!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"The house was very clean, beautifully decorated, had everything a person needed to stay. And Robbie, the host, was easy to work with. Would definitely stay there again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous home - the details throughout the house were amazing, and Robby was such a responsive and accommodating host. 10/10. We will stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"The best! We stayed in Robby's place over a weekend in the summer and found the house to be GORGEOUS (stunning, really beautiful), and thoughtfully done. We had everything we needed and then some. It's super central in the city but somehow still so quiet. The rooms are big and comfy and full of beautiful historical details. Check in is easy and quick, and Robby is available for any questions or needs. Cannot possibly recommend this place enough, we adored it."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"THIS HOME and HOST are simply the best! The house was perfect, clean and we had the best time. This historic home has been brought back to its glory and was so much fun to explore.
Robby was wonderful and available from the moment we booked. He greeted us and helped us get to know the property. He was also reachable our entire stay.
Highly recommend this home and to enhance your vacation and make for lasting memories."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I absolutely loved staying in this beautiful home! Robby was incredibly helpful throughout the booking and our stay. He is so hospitable and kind and we are so glad we chose to stay at his gorgeous and cozy house.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Robby has done an amazing job restoring this gem of a house. We were blown away by the amount of space on the main floor for hanging out with our friend group. Bedrooms are enormous and very comfortable!
The house is a stones throw away from the art museum and many restaurants downtown. Very easy to walk to everything. Would highly recommend this place as a base for exploring Utica and the surrounding areas."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place. awesome
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this is the most beautiful and well furnished airbnb we have ever stayed. It felt like a 4 star hotel, every detail was perfect and Robby was so kind an helpful."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow‚Ä¶. If there was a model for what AirBNB hosts should be, Robby is the poster child. Accommodating doesn‚Äôt begin to explain the lengths that Robby went to to make our stay as comfortable as possible and was extremely communicative, friendly and prompt in responding to requests and questions.
This house is a great place for entertaining larger groups, people with babies or children of any age. We enjoyed the huge dining room table as well as the thoughtfully designed kitchen and multiple living areas.
The home is a small piece of Utica history and Robby is dedicated to preserving and promoting that story. You‚Äôll note the art on the walls featuring local artists, decorations that pay homage to Utica history, the various accoutrements throughout the home supporting local manufacturers and makers, and (my favorite) the fresh Utica Club and Saranac beers in the fridge upon arrival!! As a former son of Utica that has moved away, it‚Äôs refreshing and inspiring to see the pride Robby has shown my native home.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. We will see you again soon!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robby was a great host and his house was beyond amazing for Utica, NY. Everything was literally perfect for our stay‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt of asked for better. Perfect 5 star rating from us! We‚Äôll be back. Thanks Robby!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Robby was a perfect host and the house was the most gorgeous, comfortable, accommodating AirBNB in the most convenient location to all that downtown Utica has to offer. You are missing out if you don‚Äôt book this house for your visit to Utica or the surrounding areas."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I had a wonderful time staying at Robbie's house while visiting local colleges for our daughter. The house has been beautifully restored to a time from yesteryear. Robby was a very responsive and welcoming host. He has provided all the amenities a guest could need.
The Munson Proctor Museum, just across the street, holds an impressive collection for its size. We enjoyed great takeout from Pho Mekong and Pantry 284. Florentine Pastry shop is a MUST!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing time. Robby welcomed us and guided us through our short stay to local attractions and restaurants.
This is a newly renovated home very tastefully decorated. We enjoyed our stay. Everything inside the home is brand new. Huge dining table, comfortable beds, nice kitchen and entertainment rooms.
Thank you Robby for welcoming us and making our stay so comfortable"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Medina was helpful and her place was lovely! Would stay again! :)
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"I booked because the ad said ""Entire Home"" and the price was decent, but when I arrive it was clear that this is an apartment on the first floor of a two family property. I was a disappointed because I'm a light sleeper and would have preferred a 2nd floor apartment. I heard people walking around on the first evening and second day, and on the first morning, their dog's barking woke me up. I'm a light sleeper so that was not good. It would have been great to have some blackout curtains in the bedrooms and a key to the back door, or to have the main entrance as the back door since parking is in the rear. Other than the aforementioned, the apartment was clean and had literally everything I needed for my stay, and that was awesome. The location was superb, as it is right across the street from the park. I grew up in Utica so that was nostalgic, great for walking and a perfect place for my toddler to play. Overall this was a good stay and I would possibly stay there again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. No issues at all
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice clean house, plenty of towels and extra pillows, nice location next to park which was helpful for travelling with a dog, responsive host."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Medina's place was spotless, warm, cozy and inviting. She responded to any and all questions we had within min. There were an over abundance of towels and blankets. Don't have a single complaint. It was close to everything we were looking for and had a beautiful park across the street with many different trails that we could walk our dog.
Medina was so sweet and accommodating, she found my sons ear buds after we left and over night them for us. Amazing host will definitely stay here EVERY time we travel up to Utica"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, great place, and responsive"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very good place, well located ,clean and easy to find with a nice park view, we definitely come back"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Everything about our stay was great except we found out after booking that there is a tenant above on the second floor(which was overall ok), but this person must work a day shift because they were up all night with the TV on loudly over one of the bedrooms for both of the nights we stayed there. The house itself was located just across the street from the Park which was great to have for walking our dogs. The house was very clean and neat and Medina was a delight to work with. Would stay again, in hopes that the tenant had a night shift instead of a day shift so it would be quieter to sleep."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Medinas place was clean and has been well kept, i feel it is a good value"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Medina was friendly and responsive. Her property was very clean and fully equipped with everything we could possibly need for our stay. It‚Äôs on a quiet street across from a lovely park. Definitely a great find.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were here for two nights. And Medina is a wonderful host. She couldn‚Äôt have been any better, the house was so clean. Her communication is great. She wants this to be your home while you‚Äôre away from home and she truly achieves that! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èü§ûüèΩ‚≠êÔ∏è"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Medina is an excellent and responsive host. The space was neat and clean. All necessary amenities were there. The heat worked well on a very cold night. Would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely worth it ! She was very responsive if I needed anything definitely will stay again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Airbnb experience .
We had a lot of questions and Medina answered them quickly.
it's a great place with a nice park across the street."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a Utica gem.
It was clean and well-appointed. I am from the area, and my family is walking distance away. Medina had great communication and was very friendly. it was easy to find, park, and get in the apartment. We had no problems during the stay. I was sick during my visit, so I got to spend more time inside the apartment than I planned. Very cozy, electric tea kettle for hot tea, and a large front window to people watch the park across the street.
My only note is that this is an apartment and someone does live upstairs. I did not realize that. If you or someone in your group is a light sleeper, please note that. The upstairs occupant was quiet, but you can hear one another.
The kitchen has everything you need to cook a great meal. if you are looking to go out, there is a great restaurant called the Willows within walking distance. Everything they make is delicious and the service is wonderful!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We found a place to be very comfortable and clean, and our host was very responsive and supportive.
We would recommend this place to anyone looking for state in Utica."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this place. It had everything we needed from towels to extra blankets, to spices and coffee. And it was perfectly priced."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Medina was helpful and generous in communication and flexibility from start to finish. The accommodations were perfect, providing everything we would need for our short stay. I especially appreciated the excellent quality of all the essentials (towels, linens, beds, furniture.)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was incredibly clean and well kept. We had trouble getting in at first, but Medina was right there (Via Phone) to assist us in getting in even though it was late at night. No doubt, we would stay with her again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Utica, NY area! Our stay at Medina‚Äôs place was so comfortable and enjoyable. The neighborhood was peaceful and we were able to walk in the nearby park in the morning. The place was newly remodeled and clean, and had everything we needed, and we were able to do a bunch of activities in and around the area. We definitely recommend this place to anyone. A+ Airbnb value!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect downtown location. Close to everything. Place was spotless and exactly as described. A hidden gem for sure!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great experience. The loft is lovely‚Äîeven nicer in person than in the photos. It is well-appointed with everything you need for an enjoyable stay. It was super clean, modern and comfortable. Antonina is very helpful and highly responsive to questions. The only tricky part was figuring out how to access the free parking lot down the street (under the overpass) for overnight parking. Once you find it, the parking area is well-lit and just a 2-minute walk to the loft. Highly recommend the loft if you're looking to stay in the Utica area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was beautiful. The only downside is parking.. Follow her directions to park at night because we thought it was too far and parked on the street and while there were no signs we did get a ticket. She was also very attentive to our every need. Thank you so much.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had been to Utica Ny in prior years for Hockey Nationals and tournaments. Always stayed in hotels. This time we were lucky enough to find the Loft hosted by Antonia. Location was great, the Loft was beautiful, very big with lots of room to spread out. The amenities were perfect. Antonia was so easy to work with, always available and quick to respond. Never had a problem with our six day stay in Utica. Got to know the entire crew from Nina's Pizza next door. The food was great, so convenient, and the staff was awesome. Thank you Jonny, Nate and Matty for making our stay so enjoyable, while we added on a few pounds eating all that Nina's had to offer. Utica Coffee Roasting Company also next door, another great place we enjoyed. Lastly a shout out to Chesterfield's Tavolo, absolutely great Italian restaurant and bar.
If/when we go back to Utica we will definitely be booking the Loft again with Antonia. Thanks again for providing such a great stay.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home is beautiful, clean, and so spacious!! Antonina was friendly and responsive. She was a lifesaver with helping me find off-street parking and when the building entrance code wasn‚Äôt working she was immediately on it! We enjoyed grabbing a pizza from Nina‚Äôs right downstairs for dinner and starting out our days with Utica Coffee just steps away. A great location to stay at while our daughters danced at The Stanley. Thank you, Antonina!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love love love these lofts! Antonina's places are AMAZING! So clean, so comfortable! Luxury stay for sure:):):)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Antonia‚Äôs place. It was spacious for our two dogs and infant. We loved the location right near Utica coffee. We would definitely return to this Airbnb. We had a little issue with the door one day and Antonia was quick to help us.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Is gorgeous
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay at Antonia‚Äôs Loft. Great location however, parking overnight not great. Instructions for getting into loft based on Antonia‚Äôs description were accurate but the initial address we had wasn‚Äôt correct so it lead to a little confusion. Beautiful Loft! Close to Utica Coffee! Perfect for our stay this past weekend. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place in downtown utica. The loft is huge and Antonina is an amazing host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"5 stars across the board! Jon was an amazing host. The apartment was fully stocked with literally everything you could need. It was spotless and he even provided some refreshments, and access to a washer and dryer . I mentioned i was traveling with my son and he provided a coloring and bedtime story book , which was the icing on the cake for my son. Whenever i come to the Utica area i will definitely be back . Thanks again üòÉ"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, quiet, and cozy‚Äîjust like the description says. I have a hard time sleeping so finding the record player was a nice way to wind down for the night. The bed was comfortable which is always a relief, and everything was very clean. I thought the coffee station was adorable and they made everything so easy to find, no searching through cabinets.
Jon was very fast to respond to my last minute questions. I would definitely book again and will recommend to friends who are visiting the area soon."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft apartment in a great location. Great remodel of an old brick factory into a modern apartment. Many restaurants within a short walk. Loved the views from all the large windows and lots of natural light. Plenty of room for our family of four and two full bathrooms made getting ready easy. It was well stocked with almost anything we could imagine ever needing. Laura checked in with us regularly and offered to bring by anything else we might need. We look forward to staying here again when we get the chance.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pictures, although spot on, do not do justice, we didn't want to leave. Gorgeous open space, well kept, and very secure building, amazing communication by host."

Ample parking. Would definitely recommend staying here and would be very happy to work with this host again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful apartment with very comfortable furniture and even more comfortable beds. Full and conveniently arranged kitchen. Amazing views of the downtown Utica area. Building was secure as can be, and filled with very friendly tenants. And there are no words to adequately describe how welcoming, thoughtful, considerate, and obliging Laura was. Truly a remarkable host & property. We came to town for the birth of our first grandchild, and Laura made this event even more amazing by providing amazing accommodations and making us feel more welcome than we have ever felt at any hotel. Upon hearing our reason for visiting the area, she even left a bottle of Prosecco chilling in the refrigerator with a card congratulating us on becoming grandparents. My wife & I are eternally grateful, and highly recommend staying at any of her properties. This was our first Airbnb experience, and certainly the gold standard for us for future Airbnb stays."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved the place, we might have to make a trip back just to spend more time there!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura is a top level host . Communication was awesome. She did a little pre-arrival shopping for us and even purchased some board games for us. The space is very spacious, comfortable and stylish. We are looking forward to our next stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was one of my best air BNB experiences i have been in Air BNB locations in several states across the country and this was one of the most impressive not just because of the location but because of the host she was very friendly and helpful providing me tips on the best scenic attributes of the location i wil be utilizing this location a lot more in the future
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I truly enjoyed Laura‚Äòs place. It is a really cool space that is spacious and stylish. Laura was very attentive and easy to communicate with. She was always quick to respond and very helpful throughout my whole stay. If I am ever in Utica again, there is no place I‚Äôd rather stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a short weekend. The condo is perfect for short or long term. The unit has everything you need in the kitchen and bathrooms. It is a large unit and beautifully decorated. Great views from the 5th floor and location is great. Laura was an awesome host. She gave great details in how to get in and where to park. Great suggestions on places to eat and have a beer. We will stay in the future. This place is worth it.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Laura‚Äôs place over the thanksgiving holiday with four adults and a kid. The apartment was fun and spacious. It clear a lot of thought went into making the space super comfortable. If you had forgotten something, it was there.
I highly recommend Laura‚Äôs place. We will definitely return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying @ Laura‚Äôs Penthouse felt amazingly pampered relaxed üòé and oh so comfortable! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº‚úÖ
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura was an amazing host. Her penthouse apt was incredible. We loved the aesthetic and so many amenities. This was the nicest AirBnB, I‚Äôve ever stayed in and would love to stay there again. Also, we appreciated her local recommendations. Kudos to Laura!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was one of the best Air BnBs I‚Äôve stayed at. She has multiple in the building so we booked two for a work trip. Both were decorated beautifully and had everything we could possibly need. Laura was excellent and very responsive. She helped us with anything and everything. Will definitely be back!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay if you‚Äôre in the area. Exactly as described, maybe even better in person? Super clean, great views from the top floor and a fabulous host! We hope to back soon!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura is an amazing host! She was welcoming and very responsive to any need we had. The apartment is beautiful, spacious and comfortable.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay for the couple of days we were in town! Laura went above and beyond with our needs and was a pleasure to work with. Very responsive and all about helping her tenants have the best stay possible.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura may be my favorite host out of dozens of rentals. Laura's place was equally stunning and stylish and big. She had everything a guest might need, and more. Well done Laura!!! Thank you for everything."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura is probably the best hosts that I have rented from on Airbnb!! She was amazing, responsive, helpful and so thoughtful. The condo is adorable, super clean!!!! And Laura thought of little amenities that you may have forgotten like aspirin, etc.
The kitchen was full stocked with what is needed to cook, the beds are super comfortable and it was very quite. We walked to a few places for dinner at her recommendation and they were all delicious.
I can‚Äôt say enough good things! I was really impressed and the place was wonderful and so was Laura."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 10 stars for this place and for Laura, I definitely would! The apartment is situated in an old restored textiles mill in downtown Utica: very high ceilings, big windows, and old floors - very, very cool. Everything you could imagine needing on your stay is provided. Sparkling clean and very safe. Laura exceeded our expectations in terms of communications and friendliness, recommending restaurants, leaving little gifts for my teens, etc., etc. I hope we have the opportunity to stay here again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow!! Let's start with that. We have rented many AirBNBs and this by far was the BEST! We went to Utica, NY to watch my son play hockey at the Nexus Center. And when we arrived Laura was there to greet us. Very secure building and a 5 min walk from the Center. The Penthouse is as pictured on her site, big with beautiful decor. Laura walked us around, showed us everything there was to offer and then some. We stayed for week and I was able to work in a quiet atmosphere. We also used the beautiful, clean gym on the first floor. She didn't stop there. On the first night she sent a list of restaurants to try and we went to all of them! On the second night we were treated to local treats for desert. And if we did not want to go out, she had everything you needed so you could cook. We loved it so much, my wife and I took a picture in the living room before we left. I can say we have never done that before. If you are going to Utica you have to rent here. Thank You Laura!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love everything from the moment I walked in, the kitchen has everything I needed, the place is cozy, I would definitely come back again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Host was very responsive from beginning to end. We loved how clean and updated everything was and how comfortable the beds were (they even had the usb connections to charge my phone while relaxing in bed). The place was conveniently close to restaurants and walmart. Definitely had everything i look for in a rental. I hope to stay here during my next visit in town. Thank you for having us in your home, it shows how well taken care of it is."

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town for our daughter‚Äôs graduation. The location was perfect and the house was very clean. The kitchen provided us with everything we needed.
It should be noted that the stairs to go upstairs were steep so older people or small children could have an issue.
Otherwise everything was great. Thank you!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place to stay, Adrian is great!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We were in the area with my family and parents for my son's graduation from college. This Airbnb is so conveniently located to both SUNY Poly as well as Utica College and the downtown area. We needed a place not only to stay but hang out with family and this place delivered.
The living space is very comfortable and was perfect for hanging. The TV is da bomb and the dining table was a perfect spot for cards and games. The kitchen was well stocked and even had an amazing variety of spices and staples. There are some really fun features like the light on the faucet in the downstairs bathroom, the dining room lights, and the fireplaces in living room area and in an upstairs bedroom. The key feature that will have me back are the comfortable beds. If you've got the princess back that I do, you'll appreciate that every bed (mattress and bedding) felt heavenly. Overall, it was just really well done."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice little house with plenty of space for our needs. I made them aware of a couple of minor issues and they were very responsive and proactive. Nothing that messed with our stay. Overall, our stay was pleasant."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for what we needed. Very clean and comfortable. Loved the attached brewery.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Utica for an international women's hockey tournament at the Adirondack Bank Center and this location was perfect. The parking was spacious and close by the entrance. Directions for getting in were very helpful. The studio was exactly as described and pictured, and was everything was immaculate. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The kitchen was well supplied, save maybe for a teapot. There were great dining choices within the immediate area and others just a short walk away. The wifi worked perfectly and we were easily able to get the television set up for our streaming service. The pricing was quite reasonable. We enjoyed our stay. This was our first Airbnb stay and we already have another booked in CT next month."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, convenient to Amtrak, sports arena,and restaurants."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would 100% recommend this place. It felt like a home away from home. The hosts have nailed the decor, and you can tell they've put so much thought into making it cozy. Ample space, clean, easy parking ...it's got everything you need. Good location too, right across the street from the train station and surrounded by cool restaurants and stores (not loads of train activity to where it becomes a nuisance). Trust me, booking this place was the best decision I made for my trip."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. It‚Äôs easy to relax and get comfortable once settled. It‚Äôs priced competitively, making it a superior option to the nearby Double Tree, in my opinion. The parking access is a nice bonus because there‚Äôs never any trouble finding a spot in the lot and I‚Äôm able to see my car from the studio. The tenants of the building are very nice anytime we crossed paths. I have one minor complaint and it‚Äôs that the studio can get quite warm, but cracking the window(s) open creates an instant breeze. Cheers!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the perfect place for a weeklong work trip. The space had everything I needed - the snow brush in the closet came in *clutch*! - and it was low maintenance. It was convenient to my work in downtown Utica and to the thruway for when I had to make a couple of runs into Syracuse. This was better than a hotel and more affordable. This is where I‚Äôll stay on future work trips for sure. Honestly, even if the majority of my work is in Syracuse next trip, I‚Äôll probably still stay here. It was that good that I would rather stay there and have a bit of a commute than in a hotel suite in Syracuse."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I came to Utica for the Thanksgiving holiday. It is a town he had spent many years in, so he truly enjoyed staying in the historic Doyle Hardware building. The studio space is absolutely lovely- all the amenities we would need as a couple, very clean and cozy, plus the pleasant view of downtown Utica. We also had access to the basement gym which was really convenient. We look forward to coming back again on our next visit- much appreciation to our host!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,My stay was great. The building feels very safe and it was super quiet. I was very comfortable and I felt at home. The brewery below the building is also a plus! I would definitely stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in the beautiful Doyle building. The apartment was clean and neat, and met our needs for a home base for a couple of days in Utica. Close to good restaurants, and the hotel where the convention we were attending was being held."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit was in a beautiful old building in a historical area. The area was safe and easily accessible. Attached to the building was a great micro-brewery bar/restaurant.
If you‚Äôre ever in Utica this is the perfect place to stay.
Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little place. Quiet except when the upstairs neighbor walked around but that was not frequent. And most people don‚Äôt mind that as much as I do. Perfect for one person or a couple.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great location, we will definitely stay here again when we are in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time staying in a Airbnb and it was the best Airbnb experience I had ever had I felt like I was at home. The vibes of the place was nice and cozy to the point where I felt very safe, and it also has nice big space. Everything was perfect and the owner was very responsive with all of the questions I had and it was very helpful."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb has a nice location and is very clean!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Would have liked to see more of the old warehouse/lofty vibe. Clean and quiet stay.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I had never been to Utica before so all this was a first time experience. The location was an easy access driving in and it was pretty well located. It was awesome to have access to the building's parking and overall neighbors were friendly and quiet. Although the Airbnb is located near Utica's Amtrak station, train traffic wasn't too crazy. The brewery in the lower level of the building was a great place to chat with people and had some killer wings. The living space was great for me spending a long weekend for a wedding in Central New York. I think a couple would definitely have a comfortable time was well. Some amenities that are sometimes expected were not included, and they were listed as such. It didn't really impact the overall experience. I'd stay in this listing again if my travels take me back to Utica."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice and clean, we enjoyed staying there. The only thing was we didn't know how to get in until we were on our way that day and had to reach out to find out how to get in. After that, no issues."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here while in town to run the Boilermaker. It was a great place to stay‚Äîquiet at night, close enough to where I had to go to catch a ride to the start, good brewpub downstairs and a great coffeehouse an easy walk. Bed was comfy. I would stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"what a lovely studio to use as home base for a weekend away. We had 2 questions that came up, host was super responsive. Apartment was clean, bed was comfortable, there were extra linens available. We loved it and will definitely use the next time we cruise through Utica. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful apartment in a good location. Clean and comfortable. Sitting area in front of the building. I was a little concerned we would hear traffic but we didn't. Thank you letting us stay at your place. The hardest part for us was getting luggage up to the room as we are elderly but I knew this going in. Highly recommend. We had a great stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place. Easy access to all you need. Walk to Utica Coffee and Baggs Square Brewery. Convenient and easy place to stay.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and layout. Secure facility and parking.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful place! I was here for a contract for 8 weeks. Building i clean, secured, there's parking on the premises, but also walking distance to the nearest bus stop (5min), train station (directly behind building) and bus depot (10 min). Building super was awesome and always around and responsive. Would definitely stay here again. Restaurant/Bar in building but was not loud after hours. Loved it!"
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The stay was nice! A comfortable and peaceful area. A lot of stuff to explore and see around the building.

2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,4 stars but I think it needs a new mattress. The bed it higher on the sides than the middle; so it‚Äôs fine for one guest but not two guests.

Only thing I would note for anyone with COVID ‚Äî the residents in the building generally don‚Äôt wear masks outside their apartments.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Megan is a very communicative host. Had a few glitches upon arrival and dealing with the WiFi, but she responded quickly and was right on it. The space is tidy and neat. Shower was great; the bed really comfortable. Bath towns plenty and soft. Enjoyed the high ceilings and large ceiling fan. Nice to have the private parking area outside. The kitchen was clean; plenty of cooking pots and utensils. I‚Äôd suggest megan add a few full sized plates and bowls, if one wanted to cook meals or make salads during their stay. Found some soap under the bathroom cabinet. But had to purchase my own toilet paper, dishwashing liquid and garbage bags."
2020-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a very basic airbnb stay. Attentive communication, awesome gated parking, easy check-in, the building is really cool (killer windows), smart TV so we could log into netflix, and super comfy bed (with great smelling linens!). Our only disappointments were that the hot water doesn't last very long and we could hear the neighbors through the vents."

2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt it was the best spot to be in downtown Utica! A hidden gem in a quiet area. The remodeled building is spacious and functional.

I can very well imagine how it could be a nice place to stay for a couple on a trip. The building is right next to the (gorgeous) train station which makes it very convenient, and it's a 10 mins walk from the center of Genesee St. where all the restaurants are. Megan and Brendan were great communicators and very responsive. Thanks for everything!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Friendly hosts and a convenient location in a renovated historic building... this was a great place to base our short stay in Utica.
The bed was full size, so a bit snug for two adults, especially if one is very tall. But the room had other nice touches, like free Netflix already set up on the smart tv, which pivots conveniently on its mount directly in front of the bed. There were plenty of extra towels in the large closet, for anyone staying longer. Kitchen was equipped with utensils and cookware and had modern appliances.
Parking was fantastic and check-in was so quick and easy. Our trip was short so we didn‚Äôt use all the amenities, such as the gym, but it‚Äôs nice that they offer them.
Building is pet-friendly and even has a dog wash area off the main lobby. They are working on building out an on-site brewery/restaurant, but there are really good local options very nearby as well - don‚Äôt miss the local bakery down the street.
It was really nice to stay in a place with local character as opposed to a holiday inn or similar hotel, and at a great value."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean!
2024-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"The apartment itself was exactly what we needed. But the area felt unsafe. The door to the apartment didn‚Äôt lock from the inside - so we never knew if the door was locked all night.
Overall though, the apartment gave us a place to sleep and the ability to heat up food. It isn‚Äôt the owners fault that the neighborhood was a bit sketchy or that we didn‚Äôt know how to lock the front door from the inside. We just were not there longer than to sleep."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean place , great dude , had coffee , clean towels , chargers , host is very responsive and polite I will definitely be booking again! Not to mention has a laundry machine washer and dryer"

2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,G

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience! Will be staying again next time I‚Äôm in town!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great clean and private air BNB we stayed in Utica to visit family for the price you couldn‚Äôt beat it my one and only negative thing to say was the mattress itself was super clean but very uncomfortable, so we we ended up sleeping on the pull out couch. I would recommend this air BNB to any family and friends. Augustin was a great host very respectful and responsive."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Augustin was very friendly and helpful. I very much liked the unit, and would definitely stay there again."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Cozy apartment. Great for a couple. Had chargers for both iPhone and Android by the couch. Streaming services on tv logged in for you to use. The owner was more than willing to let us check-in early. He even gave a little tour of the building and the apartment. Our only complaint was how hot the apartment was. Since the apartment is on the second floor, all the heat from the building rose and with our a/c was set to 65, the temperature was still at 72. We like the cold. All together, it was a great apartment. We'd stay there again, even with the heat. Highly recommend."
2024-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,overall the home was good. I did have an issue with the front door lock of the main apartment not the front door of the building. I had to put the code in 3 times or more for the door to actually unlock. The heat was also an issue for me. The apartment never seemed to get warm enough for me. Nothing a small heater couldn't fix. The owner also came to welcolme me by knocking on the door. I did not like this because he did not reach out via the app and I normally travel alone but my husband came to check on me.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,VERY NICE APARTMENT..... IT WAS VERY CLEAN HAD ALL THE AMENITIES NEEDED AND VERY CLOSE TO MY JOB WHICH WAS PERFECT. I WOULD DEFINITELY STAY AGAIN
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was cozy and amazing! The host, Augustin, is very nice, welcoming and helpful. I like the fact that it is a short distance from the city center. It is very clean, well maintained and organized. All available amenities only make your stay smooth and enjoyable. I did enjoy after a busy day watching the TV with all the programs it had to offer! I love this place and will highly recommend it! Will be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Augustin was a lovely host, very responsive and helpful. The space is very conveniently located, beautifully decorated and thoughtfully stocked. Very nice, I would definitely stay here again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very nice place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was immaculate! Highly recommend if you need somewhere to stay in the area. Eridania was very responsive with any issue I had. While the surrounding neighborhood might raise some concern, in the driveway there are multiple cameras watching both the driveway and main entrance to the home to make sure nothing bad happened. I had a wonderful time staying there!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Eridania is very kind and caring. Our family was blessed to enjoy the comfort of the property as we cared for our loved one at the nearby Wynn Hospital. Many thanks to you Eridania for your generous and caring support during our stay. I highly recommend this place of peace for your stay in Utica.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Small but does the job. Convenient location and easy to find. Host was very friendly and very responsive to inquiries.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was exactly what I was looking for. For the price it was everything I needed. Check in was simple and it accommodated my needs.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts for this Airbnb are great. Eridania greeted us on our first day there and was very friendly. It had snowed for a couple of days that we were there. The first day they cleared the walkway to our car. The second day had heavy snow and they shoveled the driveway in the morning so we could exit easier.
The Airbnb was extremely clean and it‚Äôs a quiet area. The shower and toilet area are small.
The general area seemed to us to be in a bit of a rough area. The driveway had multiple cameras where you park your car, so that made us feel better. The parking area is deep between two houses, so your car is out of sight. There were no incidents or problems during our five day stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"They were very good at responding when we needed help!
Nice place to stay for the weekend."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little Air B&B was exactly what I was looking for. Small, very clean, and a lot of character. For the price I saved a LOT of money VS staying at a motel.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lovely place as described; well maintained and smells good. Private place where I was able to rest well. Thank you.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"When you arrive the area does not look great, homes weren‚Äôt well maintained in the area, it‚Äôs a very dead town . Luckily I only came to Utica to visit family, but I would never voluntarily choose to vacation there. The shower was extremely small but had great water pressure but be prepared to not be able to move around in the shower. You‚Äôre honestly getting what you paid for in the apartment and if you‚Äôre only staying for a few nights it‚Äôs much more cost effective than a hotel."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Angel‚Äôs place is comfortable and clean. Easy check in with responsive hosts. I would stay again!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here for work. My work had me walking through the woods in the hot and humid weather. The host was very accommodating allowing me to check out late so I could take a shower before heading home. Will definitely stay here again if my work takes me back to Utica.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved how clean and spacious the apartment was. Parking was easy and convenient. Definitely a great find!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The unit was pristine located in a nice refurbished building
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as noted and the location really met my needs. Good to have a friendly bar two doors down, too."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very clean and cozy apartment. The host was very responsive. This apartment is also in a great location, a lot of options for places to eat that are within a 5 minute walk. I‚Äôd definitely recommend staying at this apartment if taking a trip to Utica!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Fresh apartment and very central. Everything needed in the kitchen was there. The only downside was that it was responsive from the apartment above and that there were no real windows to look out of the apartment without windows with frosted glass only. But great location in the city and included parking.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless apartment in a fantastic, central location!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and communication from host.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent value in downtown Utica. Area is a little rough but we knew that beforehand. (Hopefully, the hospital spurs redevelopment in the downtown.) The apartment was quite nice - updated and clean. Check in was clear, easy and convenient. I would recommend this airbnb in Utica."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The host was amazing from start to finish. Communication was excellent, any concerns that came up was quickly addressed and fixed. The place was spotless and is equipped with everything you will need to cook including pots, pans cutlery, baking sheets etc. The pictures do not do it justice. it much nicer in person. it looks small in photos but is much bigger then it looks. Parking pass is included if you need it. The exercise room open 24/7 and is a very quiet building. you do hear little feet from ceiling since it is a condo so if this is a problem for you i would not stay here. this did not bother us. It is right downtown. there is pizza , small restaurants and pub just few steps from location. if you want a grocery store you will have to drive or take local transit. We walk everywhere so was not an issue for us. Nothing bad to say about this place. We will be book anytime i am in Utica."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was great, very clean and spacious. Access to a private garage is a nice touch."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay. I‚Äôm a travel nurse and this location is a less than 5 minute walk to the hospital. Everything was as described on the listing. I would recommend this place and would stay here again.
