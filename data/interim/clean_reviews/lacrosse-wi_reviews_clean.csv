2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The backyard space was beautiful and relaxing to look at. The kitchen was nice and in the refrigerator there was cheese, salami, crackers, and wine, along with a sweet note from the hosts. We felt right at home. The sitting area was comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was super responsive and helpful. The place was very clean. And check if was simple and convenient. They provided some special extras like wine and snacks, which was a special touch.
He went out of his way to recommend fishing spots, unfortunately the weather didn’t cooperated.
The only downside was the living room isn’t super comfortable if you decide to just hang out with guests but that wouldn’t be enough of a downside for us not to stay again.
It was perfect for us as the parents of a college student to stay and even have kids over for dinner. I think it would be awesome to stay in warmer weather to fish in the backyard.
Thank you Michael for a memorable visit!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place and area were amazing. Our host was really friendly and responded to our messages within the hour. Would definitely love to come back next year.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Lynn's place was delightfully comfortable and quiet. It was clean and well furnished, and we really appreciated the little extra touches, including coffee, wine, and cheese from the surrounding area! We had a wonderful weekend getaway exploring the beautiful LaCrosse area, and this was the perfect spot to come back to each evening. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Gorgeous place to stay. He described it as noisy, but it was one of the quietest places I have stayed. The kitchen was nice, bed comfortable and view gorgeous. Will definitely stay again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great location and well hosted place in a quiet area with lots of beautiful scenery.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I grew up in that part of Wisconsin, so I have my own haunts. This Airbnb is in a lovely location and convenient to both LaCrosse and Onalaska. Go to Red Pines for a walleye dinner, enjoy (in the summer months) Moon Tunes in LaCrosse’s Riverside Park, take a boat ride on a paddle steamer (from Riverside Park). Definitely drive up Grandad Bluff to see the view of LaCrosse, the Mississippi River and Minnesota on the other side of the river."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place and incredibly nice hosts. Very clean and they even provide some of products that the local businesses have to offer. Definitely would love to stay there again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael is great! He gave suggestions for local events, biking, kayaking and vegetarian friendly restaurants and he answered questions right away. The backyard is beautiful… lots of birds and wildlife and a great way to see the sunset. We slept like babies. There are a lot of personal touches. Will definitely go back."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great AirBnB to stay at when visiting the La Crosse area. Michael was a kind and communicative host, and the AirBnB is very clean. The WiFi is also strong - I was able to work remotely while there. We also really appreciated the coffee Michael left for us. We would stay here again when we come back to the area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a fantastic stay! Michael and Lyn were such gracious and incredible hosts and it was a pleasure to stay in their place. It has a gorgeous view of the Mississippi River backwaters and is very close to restaurants and the dock where we were fishing out of for the national high school fishing tournament. There was a great place to park our bass boat and truck and we slept great each night. The added touch of the charcuterie board and sodas was a wonderful addition and personal touch. I also really enjoyed chatting with Mike and Lyn at nights. They were very considerate and gave us our space, and we’re very engaging and fun to talk to once they realized I wanted to chat. I would definitely stay at the Red House again. Absolute 10/10! Thank you again Mike and Lyn!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was the best Airbnb I have stayed at. I was here on a work trip and was not expecting to be rushing home after my shift to relax and spend time at the redhouse. The location is right on the Mississippi and there is so much wildlife to see right from your back door. Michael and his wife were so friendly and welcoming. They made the little apartment feel like a home
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was great for our visit to La Crosse. Nice, clean, quiet, convenient. Thanks Michael. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiancé and I stayed at “The Redhouse” while we celebrated our friends wedding on French Island. Our experience staying at this AirBNB was absolutely fantastic.

I would happily stay at this AirBNB again and give it a 10/10 recommendation!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,excellent place to stay
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay! While not on the river per se, the back deck with the water view was the perfect retreat from a hard day at work or morning coffee. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed for our week. The wine and snacks were a welcome treat on our first night as were the bottles of water in the fridge. The selection of coffee was excellent. There's a closet full of cleaning supplies which made the stay much tidier. Michael also made sure we had good directions to the house due to some unexpected construction the week of our stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host! Especially appreciated a safe place to easily unload and store kayaks while we biked. The water, coffee, wine, and snacks is a welcomed surprise. Mike shared his knowledge of the area. Whether you are cycling, kayak, fishing, hiking, or touring the area, you can't go wrong with this ABB choice."

Wayne and Melissa"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a fantastic place to stay. Michael was there to welcome us as we pulled in the driveway. I wish we would have planned on staying a few more days. It wasn't a long enough stay to really enjoy the back yard.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, amazing hosts and a perfect house. Michael is so kind and helpful and the location of the house is amazing for almost anything. The morning coffee on the back porch by the water was our highlight. We will be sure to come back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We remarked again and again: The Redhouse has Peace and Serenity written all over it. Utterly gorgeous setting on the water, very romantic; secluded, but easy to find. Delightful appointments in the apartment. Michael was a gracious, thoughtful, and delightful host!!! We will definitely be coming back!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Redhouse was a perfect spot for a few days of biking and hiking in La Crosse. The full kitchen was very useful, and the whole place was comfortable (including a nice, firm bed). The host left us a bottle of wine and some local seltzer.We particularly liked the small backyard seating area, overlooking Mississippi River backwaters. The location worked for us - in a quiet area but within 15-20 minutes of everything we needed. Communication before and during our stay was speedy and helpful.
I would not hesitate to book here again."

Mike was an exceptional host with great suggestions of things to do and places to go around town. He and his wife were very welcoming and friendly. I honestly can't say enough great things about the Redhouse and its host. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and stay here! In my experience, you will be very happy with every aspect of your stay and you'll be sad to leave!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nice place, recently remodeled. Great location. Michael was a great host."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy access from I-90 and LaCrosse, such a better value than a hotel (as long as you don’t have pets or kids). Super clean and it provides everything you need!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Red House was immaculately clean and Michael made sure every detail was covered. It was a very quiet, peaceful location adjacent to the National Bird Sanctuary, but was also minutes from many great restaurants with outdoor seating and other attractions. If you love the great outdoors and you’re looking for a great place in La Crosse that is safe, clean quiet and comfy, this is it. We highly recommend the Red House and would definitely stay here again if come back to the area."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael’s apartment was easy to get to and very nice. He made us feel very welcome and even spent part of his day giving us a tour of LaCrosse on bikes. We would definitely book with him again!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t express how thankful I am that I found The Redhouse. We stayed here for a week and I can’t wait to come back. The river and view in the back of the house from the patio is amazing. Michael is on the next level as a host and went above and beyond to ensure that myself and my fishing partner had a comfortable stay. He is truly a stand up person. From the cleanliness and provided amenities to the view out the back doors and windows, this house is perfect.
The house is close enough to local attractions, yet secluded enough to give a person privacy."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was super friendly and provided personal touches to make our stay nice. When he found out we were celebrating our anniversary, he surprised us with a bottle of champagne to celebrate! A great stay - we plan on visiting again!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a spacious, comfortable apartment with everything one could need.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very comfortable and enjoyable location. Visiting the daughter and grandkids and it was a great place to sit and talk and play games. It is convenient to every thing in this charming town. Felt very safe in the neighborhood. We had a surprise snowfall and cold temps but the house was very comfortably heated. Good WiFi and kitchen and bathroom had all necessities. So great to have a pets-allowed option and there were no smells from previous fur guests 😊. I was concerned with the possibility of noise from the upstairs unit from earlier posts but never had any issues. Scott was very easy to communicate with and got back to me immediately with any requests or concerns. Would definitely stay again.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott's place was wonderful and exactly what we needed. We changed our reservation at the last minute to arrive day early to beat a snowstorm, and he easily accommodated us. The place had everything we needed, was very comfortable, and was pet friendly. We'd love to come back during another season, when we can take advantage of the nice backyard area. This place is a gem!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was really cute and perfect for our stay! Scott was great at answer our questions. Very well stocked kitchen with utensils, seasonings, dog bowls, etc. Only minor inconvenience was the refrigerator was leaking, causing us to have to change the towels underneath multiple times. Scott was great full for the assistance as he awaited repairs due to the holidays. Thanks Scott!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. We have stayed here 3 or 4 times. Will stay again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We've had three amazing stays in this wonderful home – the first two in the upstairs suite, 'the Buddha's Nest,' and our recent stay on the main floor was equally fantastic! The thoughtful design, warm atmosphere, and even a cheerful scribble from our toddler in the guest book made it truly special. Huge thanks to our fantastic hosts for consistently creating a welcoming haven. Future guests, you're in for a treat!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s place is centrally located to so many places in town. The home is spacious, nicely appointed, and well maintained. We loved his smaller place (upstairs) and love this one even more! This will be our first choice for future stays. The only drawback is the proximity to the railroad tracks. The train does NOT sound the horn, so it is quiet, but we got stuck at the crossing many times because the train was being moved back and forth multiple times per day. It was a small inconvenience, though, for a super AirBNB!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,House is perfect for our weekend stays to see our son at college. Our stay was quiet and the space was as described. Very clean with all the amenities from home. We will definately stay here in the future and Scott is an excellent host. The dog loved it as well.

THANK YOU SCOTT FOR THE LOVE AND CARE YOU SHOW!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was centrally located for restaurants, bike trials and walkability.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so appreciative of the peaceful place to come back to after busy days. It was cool, quiet, and the beds were so comfortable. Scott was extremely responsive, and we would definitely recommend this lovely home for a stay in LaCrosse."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Scott was a delight to coordinate with and he stopped by on the second day and we got to meet and get to know him a bit. Really great host and the place was just like his description and photos. We were very comfortable there; three adults and a 30 pound dog - plenty of room for all of us and all the amenities (even more) we needed. The screened front porch was where we spent most of our time, even preferring to just hang out comfortably there instead of running around a lot! Cute and diverse neighborhood, which made dog walking even more fun as we met a few folks and friendly dogs throughout throughout the local area. Seriously, we can hardly wait to come back and hope to do so sometime before the snow flies this year. This place is NOT a Hilton...it is relaxed and homey, and in our opinion, way better!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time and loved being in Lacrosse and close to the UW Lacrosse campus and downtown restaurants. The place was exactly as pictured and he explained that we might have ""guest"" neighbors upstairs. It was very easy to stay here and we appreciated that since we were busy running to other commitments for our daughter's graduation. The stay here made us so comfortable we'd like to come back to Lacrosse and explore more of what it has to offer as we feel that we could have a great day out and then return to a comfortable and welcoming home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! exactly like the pictures and description. very comfy beds and linens. perfect location for our stay as it was close to everi we need. The neighborhood isn't the greatest but the house is nice. Great back yard for the dog. I will say if people are upstairs you can hear the floor creaking and their walking around no matter how quiet they try to be. and you can hear the TV up there and then talking even if just normal, as there is an apt. upstairs too....but we would stay again for sure and recommend it as it was a very nice place and we felt right at home...."

10/10 Recommend Staying here"

The house is in an easy to find location that is close to the heart of La Crosse and UWL. There are railroad tracks 2 blocks away, but the place is well insulated with good windows, which kept the noise out. Quiet neighborhood with a convenience store and neighborhood bar within a few blocks. The beds were comfortable to sleep on as well. I recommend this place whether you have a pet or not. We will likely stay here again in the future."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet neighborhood even though it is close to the Amtrak station. House is spacious with a dog friendly fenced backyard!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved Scott's place in LaCrosse. Very clean and comfortable.

Nice features and hospitality throughout the house, including good quality bed and bath linens, and kitchen appliances and amenities. Access to house was secure but easy to navigate with the emailed instructions. Pleasant and helpful communication with the host from the time of booking through to and after checking out. I am immensely pleased to find a nice, clean, smoke-free place that would allow me to bring my dog. Staying alone in unfamiliar places is stressful without my dog's company! The wonderful fenced back yard is an added bonus for both of us. I stayed in the winter and didn't hear the trains on the tracks a few blocks away. It snowed one night but the city was prompt with clearing the streets, so no problems getting around. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting La Crosse."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here. I highly recommend.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little gem! We could tell Scott takes pride in his property and wants his guests to enjoy their stay. The kitchen was well stocked and it was the perfect place for our family of 4. We have already rebooked!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My brother and I stayed at Scott's place for four nights and were very comfortable. This place has everything you need. Would not hesitate to stay again. We had to extend the stay another night and communication with Scott was super fast. It was cold with rain and snow the days we stayed but Scott was out there early making sure the sidewalks and steps were salted/shoveled. Thanks for everything!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Exactly as described and was everything we needed for our stay
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed here twice, and expect to continue to do so every year. The unit is comfortable and clean. The beds are great, and both the bed and bath linens are newer and high quality. Great selection of premium TV channels. Perhaps best, Scott is immediately responsive when needed, otherwise you’re left alone. I clearly highly recommend this property."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a really lovely stay here over the Christmas holiday. My girlfriend, two dogs and I were moving across the country during very challenging weather. Scott’s place was the perfect place to hunker down from the snow, and extreme and bitterly cold weather to enjoy family time during the holidays. The fenced in backyard was secure for our pups to do their business. Easy access to grocery stores for the multi-day stay. Great access to a plowed multi-use pathway for morning runs and easy neighborhood walking for our dogs. Thanks again for a great stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was an excellent stay! Very cozy and comfortable. Quiet neighborhood and had all I needed close by. Host was very commutative about everything. He went above and beyond after a long day of work to tell me about a snow emergency and which side of the street to park on! Grateful for this as otherwise I may have gotten a ticket or been towed. Very nice to have the back yard with my pup too to not have to walk on the leash every morning. Look forward to staying here again in the future. Thanks for the great home away from home!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend had just recently passed away unexpectedly, and her visitations and funeral were in La Crosse as this is where she was originally from. Two of our friends and I just needed a quiet, clean, and comfortable place to stay for a long weekend, and Scott’s AirBNB was the perfect refuge. The house was a perfect location, not far from Onalaska where funeral services were, but also close to downtown La Crosse for shopping and dining. We also appreciated that Scott had written out in the dining room a variety of recommendations for restaurants and daily deals on dining. We didn’t need much, but we very much appreciated Scott for getting back to us quickly when we had any concerns."

The location was also very convenient to get to any of our destinations around La Crosse, West Salem, and Onalaska. Would certainly recommend to others to rent, and we would surely rent again. Thank you so much Scott!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend in this charming house. Scott was great to work with, the house was clean, well equipped, and welcoming.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice time here in La Crosse traveling with three friends and a dog. This listing not only met our expectations, but was one of our top stays at an AirBnb!
The house was a nice size and space and had all the things we needed.
The dining table was nice central space to eat at and unpack during the day. The beds were more comfortable than expected. And let’s talk about the refrigerator. It pretty cool, and we totally wish we had one. The Wifi worked well and we had no issues.

The kitchen has the necessary materials for doing your own cooking, including spices left behind by others. There are renters who live upstairs. They're quiet, but know that you may hear them moving around. Didn't bother us at all. Very comfortable place that was nice and cozy."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great! The property was as described. The kitchen was stocked with anything you might need to cook with and coffee! Check-in was a breeze!

The kitchen is fully equipped with more up to date appliances than my house! It is great to come back after a day out and curl up on the comfy sofa with a cocktail and watch Netflix that Scott set up for his guests. I travel with my hound and cat and Scott welcomed them....a very rare find! There is a nice fenced in back yard, a wonderful amenity for me and my hound.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to
La Crosse for a fall weekend and the home was cozy and perfect for us to use as a place of respite after a day of running around. Although the weather had turned cold and we didn’t
spend time around the fire pit or on the dock,
the home was uniquely situated on the shores of the Mississippi and it was neat to see the water traffic.
Had we been here when it was warmer, we would have enjoyed the outdoor amenities as well. Although the home is in a well-populated area of the city, it was quiet and peaceful."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cottage right on the river. Perfect for my husband and I . Our kids go to school in La crosse so it was a great find for us! Kids came over and went fishing! Great location!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed Becky's cottage while we were in town for the Great River Folk Festival. The setting is lovely-- and the sunset over the river was spectacular! The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our meals, and the living area was a cozy spot to unwind. We hope to come back in the future and would highly recommend this cottage."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was the quiet get-away on the Mississippi River we hoped for. Clean, modern, and quiet with a private dock situated between the shore of the river and a wildlife preserve; we couldn't have asked for more as tourists visting LaCrosse on a whim. We truly lucked-out, and will consider booking a longer stay with this little gem as our main vacation goal.
Also, we visisted during 100+ dehree temperatures and still managed to catcu a few fish (the air conditioning in the cabin kept it as cool as we wanted in between casts). Becky provided plenty of information about local amenities, and a coupon for a great little bar and grill down the street. Loved it 100%!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect for my fiancés weekend fishing trip. He said the place looked better in person than in the photos. The host was very kind. A great stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky’s cottage was super cute and beautiful views of the river. Fun to launch our kayaks there and find different sand bars. Sunsets are amazing. It’s only about 2 1/2 mi from downtown, 5 miles or so to the French Island, huckfins, river rats…
5 miles to Moxie tiki bar/restaurant.
Great peaceful and private, however close enough if you want to the action!
Recovery room, awesome food!
Thank you for a wonderful mini vacation. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely perfect!! The cabin was just what my husband, dog and I needed for a weekend away. We've been to La Crosse a few times before but never afforded to stay on the Mississippi - the view was amazing and we had the whole dock to ourselves to fish. The kitchen has so many utensils and dishes and even snacks left on the counter. TV worked great as well as WiFi. There were many flyers and menus left on the kitchen table which was much appreciated.
There is a hair dryer available to use in the bathroom. Water pressure is good. Lots of towels available as well as extra toilet paper. There are ice cube trays in the freezer and a container to keep ice cubes in if needed. All of the light switches are labeled so you can easily identify what the switch is for. There are ceiling fans in each room which is nice. Air conditioner worked excellent and is so quiet which is a plus!
Lots of extra blankets and pillows if needed. Bed is comfortable. Loved the view from the table"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Becky and her husband were fantastic! We had 2 boats and 2 trucks. Close, easy to access and beautiful. The host and accommodations were perfect!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,loved almost everything. Stairs and landing at entry could be better but is manageable. puppy did well and we were so glad to be able to take him. many little extras that make you smile; kitchen etc. could use a non stick skillet for eggs. we enjoyed our stay.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Thank you so much! We had a great 4th of July week in LaCrosse. We store our pontoon near and it was nice to be able to stay in town after a long day of fun in the sun with our dog:) Thank you so much! We didn’t have time to use the canoe, grill or fire pit, but it looked very inviting.
Hopefully another time!
Brad, Courtney & Paisley"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Overall the stay went well. Becky’s place was not far from downtown and right on the river as expected. The bathroom and bedroom are small. It was odd to have the water heater in the bathroom. Overall the space was clean, and the place felt private and quiet."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was wonderful! my husband and I enjoyed our time there immensely. The cottage is right by a channel of the Mississippi River. The kitchen area has big windows, and we sat at the table and watched fishermen and could see barges moving on the river.
The surroundings were very peaceful and relaxing. Becky and her husband were very cordial. There were several brochures left for us to find out things to do in La Crosse. Furnishings were nice, and the kitchen was well supplied with utensils and dishes and cookware.
I would highly recommend staying here if you need a relaxing place to stay. Everything was great, and Becky was a great host. I even left our clothes there, and she was kind enough to mail them back to me.
Our expectations were exceeded!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage setting is beautiful right on the Mississippi backwaters with sunsets right over the water! It was a perfect setting for a get away.

Access to a canoe was an unexpected treat too. We look forward to returning."

The fire pit provided a beautiful evening to take in the river and sunset. Being close to downtown, yet away from the noise of the city makes this a great getaway. All the amenities of town life just a short drive, but when you get back it’s a whole different feel."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Becky's place was great! The location to town and along the river make it hard to beat! Such beautiful views and open space for yard games if desired.
The place was stocked great with most of your kitchen essentials, and she even had a basket full of treats for us! She had life jackets, oars, a fireplace and lawn chairs/tables. She had games, puzzles, stereo, TV with various apps, umbrellas, blankets, and toiletries.
Becky was very responsive and also suggested us with her favorite places in the area! She honored an early check in for us, which was great as we had a wedding to get to! We had a great time and would come back if ever in the area. Thanks again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Becky's home is absolutely gorgeous. Access to the river literally on the property helped my fiance and I relax and enjoy a nice weekend away. We were able to bring our dog too! Becky was great with communication. We will happily return!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful and convenient place! We were so comfortable and really felt at home. It’s a super clean place and in a great location.
The bed and couches were comfortable and I loved the floors and how well everything was set up. The bathroom heater felt extra luxurious after a shower. The two way split air conditioning unit did an excellent job of keeping the place cool and it was so quiet!
I loved all the beautiful landscaping.
The host was so helpful and always responded quickly to any questions we had. She also recommended a few restaurants, which was appreciated. I also liked that she was so kind when we crossed paths after we did the self check in.
It was a little mini honeymoon for us and we were so glad to be able to get away and enjoy being right on the water at such a cool spot!
We asked and appreciated that she allowed us to amend the reservation to stay an extra night. The complimentary champagne that she gifted us was so sweet and thoughtful. We look forward to staying again. I am so happy to have spent a lovely few days there!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Becky's attention to detail for cleanliness was much appreciated! She replies quickly and seems committed to making the stay enjoyable. Thank you, Becky!"

It’s very well done, it doesn’t seem like you’re in a small of a place as you are. Plus you are right on the river! The only suggestion I have is the plastic on the mattress makes you hot while you sleep."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andrew's place was great! Everything was as stated in his description. We had a very relaxing time. Although it was 100+ outside, the window air conditioners and ceiling fans kept it very pleasant. The beds were comfortable and my daughter- in- law commented on how soft the sheets were. (I agree!). We were back and forth to an event in Onalaska, which was only about 15 minutes away, and Andrew's location made it an easy trip across town. We wish the weather wouldn't have been so hot, as we would have loved to have walked around Lacrosse and down by the Mississippi. We plan on possibly making another trip up to Lacrosse in the fall and will definitely be checking to see if we can stay at Andrew's again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Andy was a great host. Has put a lot of thought into his rental space, reflecting perhaps he’s done a bit of traveling himself. Everything was clean and efficient. We only stayed one night so didn’t use the kitchen except for the coffee (provided also) but for a longer stay, it looked well stocked and ready to use. Bedrooms were comfy and clean and even had a sunny and bright workspace for those who need it. The house is old but has been well updated and couldn’t find a a squeaky floor, leaky window or any indication of its age - even the outside staircase is solid and well maintained. Shower pressure better than mine at home and bath towels bright white and soft. Thank you Andy for providing such a comfy spot for us to stay while visiting our daughter. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay at Andy and Palm's duplex in La Crosse. Really lovely home. The kitchen was well equipped and the driveway was the perfect size to fit my SUV and boat. Linens were very nice and the bed was comfy! Will definitely stay here again if I'm back in La Crosse.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed in quite a few AIRBNBs/VRBOs around the US and this was the best! So many thoughtful little things and the beds/pillows were great! And CLEAN!!! The whole place was soooo clean !! Loved it in every way

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This has been one of the nicest air bnb experiences we’ve had. The bed was firm and comfortable. New technologies throughout including plenty of areas for charging all your devices. Very clean and well organized. Calm but contemporary space. Easiest check in ever! So many little things included that frequently are missed by other hosts including plenty of hooks to hang towels as well as toiletry bags. It’s the attention to details that makes it such a nice place to stay.This place and the hosts are absolute gems.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Close to downtown, which worked well for us. Certainly one of the best AirBnBs we've stayed in.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying here! As soon as we walked in, we saw a letterboard wishing us Happy Anniversary with our names on it (and there were chocolates too). It was completely unexpected but so so sweet and personable. The place was super clean and there were plenty of kitchen supplies to help us cook between eating out.
Andrew is super friendly and communicative -- I could tell I was chatting with a genuine person who was interested in my well-being. Would definitely stay here again. We got a discount for having a long stay (not sure if that's set up by the host or by AirBnB itself) but even before the discount, this was so affordable for a really nice place!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay! Will be booking again.

This has been our second time here and both
times, on a scale of 1-10, all around I would rate our experience superior. 10.+
The host Andrew is truly spectacular. He cares about his guest and it shows from the cleanliness of apartment and his overall greeting and response to his customer.
Finding this space to rent was a gift. We always look forward to returning. It’s home away from home, which we absolutely love.
Our family is grateful and appreciative of the entire experience.
Thanks Andrew

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything at this stay was awesome! They really thought of all the small details (lights on the railings, night lights in the hall, alarm clocks and white noise machines, signage around the stay, etc). The design was very cute and also practical. They had all the things we could’ve needed. We had more than enough room for the four of us. It is a bit of a hike if you were to walk to downtown, but it’s only a couple minutes in the car! There’s a cute park across the street that we visited as well."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,this place is beautiful! Although I was only there for a short amount of time I loved the space and the environment surrounding.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mine and my husband’s first time in the La Crosse area and could not have picked a better place to stay! So quiet and beautiful, this place is definitely a gem!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, in a neighborhood, but also right by the woods. Loved all the birds and deer that came to visit. Nice trail to walk in the woods. House was clean and view was beautiful from the house. Would have stayed longer if we could have."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed an evening away from the cities. We were looking forward to hiking, but mother nature had other ideas in mind with snow and rain.
Natalie had alot of ideas of places to eat or check out.
We saw 3 deer while we were there.
It's a very simple, quiet place. Was perfect for us!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved it! A perfect peaceful getaway but close to fun things to do
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a late winter getaway. Close to LaCrosse, but far enough away to feel secluded. Lots of large windows to take in the surroundings. Natalie is a great host. She even arranged to have a light snow fall on our last night to further enhance the setting!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The tiny home was wonderful! The surrounding area of the home is beautiful and the home itself is very intimate and modern. The bathroom and shower was very clean and everything functioned properly. Bed was clean and very comfortable. Natalie was extremely helpful and responsive to our questions. The fire pit was a nice bonus too on a cool evening! Only complaint was that the temp was quite cold in the house overnight. The temperature was set at 67 but the inside temp was around 60 at night. Overall a very positive experience though and would stay again, maybe in the fall when the leaves are colored!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great getaway from the city life! We enjoyed sitting outside and our dogs were fascinated by the wildlife visits every morning. The hosts were great and provided good local recommendations.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and peaceful! Great little hideaway just outside the city. ❤️
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was peaceful and a quick drive to everything we needed. It was a perfect few days retreat!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute little tiny house around Lacrosse, WI! It was perfect for my husband and I for a night away. The house is equipped with everything you need and super clean! We were a bit surprised at how close the other houses were to us but they had shades on all sides of the house that still allowed for privacy. The added touches of coffee, creamer, snacks and water bottles was a nice surprise too."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We heard owls! The windows are something else, it feels amazing to be in that space. The tall ceilings with variable height made it feel much larger."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a great stay at the tiny house! It was in a quiet neighborhood outside of La Crosse and was just the right size for two people. We enjoyed the visits from chickens and deer!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic time relaxing at this peaceful location. Got to see some wildlife too!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed two nights for our anniversary. Natalie was very responsive. She even brought a fan and dropped it off the second night because I forgot ours. The only thing we didn’t like is how close it was to other properties. Looking at the photos it’s hard to tell that there is other places on either side. Overall the stay was nice and we had a good time.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Kindred Tiny Home is a unique and LOVELY place to stay.
The design of the home with its many windows would definitely benefit from a more private location where the blinds could be open all around and you could experience being “in nature”.
But it was nice to have the option of the lit trail to walk on at night and that same woodsy area to go to sleep seeing and then wake up to.
It took us a few minutes to find the garbage can (under the sink) and we also had to eat standing by the counter because there was no table set up. (I did see on Insta - when scrolling back to older posts - that the table used for decor may have been meant for eating on?)
I understand aesthetics and how they can add to an experience, but we would have preferred to have a table to eat at.
We certainly didn’t want to eat in the bed and risk spilling or staining the linens.
Just would’ve preferred practical over pretty.
Overall, we had a nice stay - a first for a few things so for that, we’re glad."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Incredibly well maintained and beautiful setting to get away. Host was incredible, responsive, and had tons of great local recommendations."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was what we expected on the inside. It was very cute and the host decorated the home nicely. I did wish I would have inspected the pictures a little further, as I did not expect the homes on both sides to be as close. It’s my fault for not noticing but I did think it was a little more secluded. Other than that, it was a great stay. Would recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful tiny house! We loved all the natural light and it’s in a very peaceful spot. Natalie was a good host and we had a great mini vacation!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cute and cozy home! The house was an easy drive from downtown lacrosse. It was clean and cutely decorated. This house is in a residential area so closer to other houses than I was picturing, but it was still very quiet and peaceful."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay all around!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Natalie was a very helpful and communicative host!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was everything as pictured and more! It was nice inside, cozy, and a good amount of space. The town had some nice trails and some good local spots as well. Id highly recommend."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Kindred Tiny House was a great experience. We wanted a relaxing weekend getaway and that’s exactly what we got. The views were amazing and the space was perfect for what we wanted.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a lovely time staying at the Kindred Tiny House! It's a cozy and relaxing space in a great location. Would definitely stay there again to unwind and enjoy a nice break.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary and it was the perfect getaway that was still close to home for us. Adorable place and very well taken care of! Natalie was a great host, very accommodating and easy to communicate with. It was a beautiful and peaceful spot with views of the trees and surrounding nature, we loved it and hope to stay there again sometime!🤍"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is magical! It’s the perfect winter getaway. Excellent property for hiking and snowshoeing. It’s close to many amenities and local restaurants and parks. We hiked at Perrot State Park. The host is very accommodating and prompt with communication. Excellent location and beautiful place to stay. The tiny house is clean and decorated so nice. The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is very nice and the shower is big and open. It’s a relaxing place to unplug and enjoy being in nature. We had a fire in the fire pit and enjoyed the views from the comfort of the bed. The kitchenette has a nice small fridge that was sufficient and a microwave and a coffee maker. We hired Alex from Instinct Photography to capture our engagement! He planned everything perfectly and does an incredible job. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The tiny house was a cozy spot for a couple's getaway!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Fun place to get away from electronics and relax
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Another outstanding tiny house with all that you really need and a completely reasonable experience! Accommodations were excellent, and although the neighborhood isn’t completely secluded, it feels tucked away, and yet, accessible—fun time!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a great getaway for me and my wife! We had fun exploring La Crosse and just relaxing in nature!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place but a bit small for 3 people it prefect for 2 people.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. Aesthetically lovely and calming. Not as private as was hoping but there are nice shades. Thank you!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ugh! We loved everything about our stay-from start to finish. Customer service and responses were always an hour or less, especially during our stay. We were gifted water and a nice delicious snack-it’s the little things that really make the world of a difference. There’s another nice touch but I’ll let you experience it for yourself 🤫
It felt great to be able to relax without any worries. Waking up to watch the sunrise with coffee in bed was a great way to wrap up our day-cation.
I proposed to my now fiancé in this home and we are going to make an effort to make this trip an annual trip!
Until next time 💜"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect for our Holiday get away! The place was small but felt cozy! We only wished we had snow for an even better view from the home!
We were surprised that the neighbors were so close because the photos didn't show any signs of neighbors. It was a very quiet ""community"" but would have like to know the place wasn't as secluded as the photos showed.
Overall a great stay for our Holiday kickoff! We would love to go back in the fall to see this place with all the fall colors!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful little home in peaceful wooded area. Driving through this area, the bluffs are so beautiful; staying a night in this tiny home, now brings to life what it’s like to live on a sort of ‘mountain.’ I had a beautiful fire going as I watched Orion move along the sky. The cute fire starters helped, as well as various types of cut wood, including kindling and dry cut logs. Cozy bed, and waking up to see the trees and trail welcomed a happy morning walk which included seeing eagles fly above. Lovely shower with soft towels. Spacious bathroom. Good coffee, great dinnerware. Bring your own fire starting source (lighter) so that you get to enjoy the beauty and peace of listening to the sparks of the fire as you watch the night sky."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described and pictured. Easy to find and access. Peaceful, cozy, clean, close to restaurants and local shopping, yet private enough to feel like a perfect home-away-from-home. The countryside is spectacular! I would book again in a heartbeat!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This tiny home was just lovely! Situated on a mountainside, it had huge windows overlooking the trees and sky. We turned off all of the lights and watched the moon float through the sky as we talked into the night. Thanks for the beautiful stay, Natalie!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great secluded little house. Spent only 1 night here and that was a grave mistake. you need a couple days to soak in the environment and really get accustomed. however, even for 1 night we greatly enjoyed it and found it a wonderful respite from the city (although LAX is close to heaven as it gets)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Natalie’s place is the perfect spot for a relaxing, unplugged weekend getaway!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, tranquil, and quiet."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts were extremely responsive and helpful! You can tell they put their heart into this beautiful home and truly just want to share it with others. The space was clean, aesthetic, and gorgeous views to wake up to! Lots of beautiful details 🫶"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome spot!! I really enjoyed experiencing the Tiny Home! Very thoughtfully built with all the right comforts. I loved the rain head shower and the firm mattress. The view, and even the sound of the rain one night was a gift of relaxation. Very prompt response when I had a question, and had no issues whatsoever. Wonderful host/hostess! Thank you for everything."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,it was a great 24 hour get away! thank you for providing a beautiful place for relaxation!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our hosts were so accommodating to our little elopement on the property. We’re so thankful for them allowing us to have our special day here!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kindred Tiny Home has been beautifully placed facing a forest. It's a peaceful setting on the outskirts of La Crosse and a great stopover for a couple of days or more when visiting the area. We normally like to have more kitchen amenities for cooking when staying in a place for a couple of days or more, but appreciated and specifically sought the simplicity of this stay and the opportunity to experience life in a tiny house. We didn't get to take advantage of the fire pit the second night because we arrived back later than planned—do yourself a favor and save time for the outdoor amenities and, more simply, time to appreciate the natural outdoor space around you. Natalie keeps the place impeccably clean and rightfully asks the same of her guests—it's a beautiful home worthy of respect. The only word of caution on that front is since you'll be taking your shoes off upon entering, be careful on the steps if you step onto the patio—they're very slippery in socks! :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the trails, the Lacrosse area is full of stuff to do. All the rolling hills and rocks are a sight to see. The sap house was a perfect place to rest and reconnect!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We highly recommend anything to do with Teri! She was unbelievably responsive, thoughtful and her home was very clean. This is our first time using airbandb and because of Teri, we would definitely do it again. Nothing but great things to say about Teri, her home and her professionalism. Cannot recommend her enough!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay! The place was very cozy and clean. Host had lots of thoughtful amenities and great instructions and information on local sites and activities . Was close to the downtown area and both universities. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,The place was cute and comfortable. Just what we needed for our 1 month stay in LaCrosse.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first Airbnb experience. We were attending a funeral and my elderly mother was with us. We were so much more comfortable than if we had stayed in a motel. We did have to switch our room with the king size bed with my mom’s room with a queen because the mattress was too high for her to sit on or get into. A minor inconvenience but perhaps a step stool for older folks or short people like me (5’1”) would be helpful. We would definitely stay here again and recommend this cozy home in La Crosse.

When we arrived we spread out snacks on the large kitchen island. We played games in the game/tv room and the front room by the faux fireplace. The house was within five minutes of everything we had planned: meal at four sisters, rotary lights on the Mississippi, and the Viterbo Christmas show. We made a huge breakfast in the well stocked gourmet kitchen. When we dropped our daughter back at Viterbo everyone said their favorite part of the visit was spending time together laughing at the Cargill-Pettibone Mansion. We all highly recommend this historic house. Make sure you read the history of it when you enter the home."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place plenty to do ,4 bedrooms all with bathrooms was perfect."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our band stayed here after playing at Riverfest and we all absolutely LOVED it! It was spacious, historic, and the bathrooms were beautifully updated. We loved hanging out on the porch as well. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home with a lot of history. Our group really enjoyed the character of this house. The location is also very convenient, walking distance to everything downtown, and a short drive to Grandad Bluff and hiking trails."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying overnight at the Cargill-Pettibone house! Because of the cost, for us it was a one-time bucket list sort of visit, but extremely pleasant. For extended family groups planning a family Christmas or family reunion, or UW-La Crosse alumni looking for a very comfortable shared stay, or even a business looking for accommodations for a team spending a few days in La Crosse, the cost would be acceptable. Matthew and his team have renovated and furnished the mansion impressively so far, and it will only get better! The only minor down side was street-only parking, which was not a major issue for us and our Forester."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great historic place! Roomy and comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful house with an amazing and fun history! Loved the detail and everything about the place. Matthew was responsive and helpful! Every person in our group commented that they want to return and book a group for another time for themselves, and their friends, or themselves, and another family, gathering, or themselves for a getaway! We definitely recommend this place!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful historical house close to downtown. I loved that each bedroom has their own bathroom. Matthew and his team answered all my questions and got back with me in a very timely manner. This was my first time staying in an Airbnb home but it won't be my last. Loved it.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic experience. Great historic house, charming decor, and excellent value. We left a charger and Bethany, the property manager, personally went out of her way to bring it back. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Working with Bethany was fantastic. The communication was clear and timely. The location is great for an easy walk to downtown restaurants and bars. The beds were very comfortable. I think the front porch is its best feature and I would love to see an upgrade on the patio furniture for those lovely spring and summer afternoons.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, spacious house, within walking distance of downtown. We had a great time!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful vintage mansion w modern amenities, and a lot of history."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this place for a girls weekend and really enjoyed our stay! It is a short drive or Uber/Lyft to downtown La Crosse, and is just a few mins away from the nearest grocery store and gas station. The home is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood. The mattresses were very comfortable and the place was clean when we arrived. The backyard is spectacular and we loved being able to have a bonfire and enjoy the warm April evening under the stars."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at various vacation rentals in La Crosse, and this is in the top five. It is a sweet, little gem of a home that has a cozy, comfy vibe to it, plus located in central La Crosse, so easy access to downtown, etc. Very quiet neighborhood, especially at night...hardly any traffic. Manette had ALL the essentials for our stay, and she was so quick to respond to any questions I had. There is a cool back patio with a fire pit, but unfortunately due to the county burn ban--due to high winds--we weren't able to use it. Really enjoyed our stay there. Thank you again, Manette, for providing this home away from home, AND for your quick communication skills. Highly recommend this to anyone considering a visit to La Crosse!!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic visit and everything about the house was great. it is newly refurbished (and done well), well stocked, clean, and convenient. Manette was extremely responsive and helpful. on top of it, they did a great job setting it up to be a relaxing and enjoyable environment for a couple of small family (we have a 6 year old and it was perfect) that also serves as a great location for anything you may want or need to do in the area. we will definitely be returning and found this to be one of the best values we have ever found on Air B&B."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for myself and my two kids. They loved the fenced in back yard and the lights in the living room. We felt right at home and the price was great!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Delightful, homie place was as described. Main bedroom is small, but large living room area made. up for that. Host was responsive and everything was clean and organized. I had surgery at Mayo Clinic in La Crosse, and this being 1.7 miles away from the clinic worked out well for my husband to come/go and for me to come home to. I would definitely recommend."

The neighborhood was quiet and easy to find, and we really enjoyed our stay. We would have loved to stay for several more days and would totally book this place again on our future travels."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Manette has tastefully decorated her place which is located in a quiet area of the town. I was not familiar with the downtown district so I asked if she had any recommendations for dinner. She provided two and I visited one of the establishments and was impressed with the meal.

The patio with the fire pit, grill and gas heater (didn't use, but is great) made time outside relaxing. The home is decorated very well, is very clean and has all the amenities you could want. The beds were comfortable and the sofa was great for lounging. Nice, quiet neighborhood to walk in and about 10 minutes to downtown and closer to UWL. I could't recommend Manette's home enough; stay here if in La Crosse!"

Top tier communication from Manette, she messaged back almost immediately every time I messaged her. Our dogs felt so relaxed and calm in her home and the backyard was perfect for them to run around in after being cooped up in the car for 2 very long days. My only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer! We were passing through on our move from Seattle to Detroit so it was a very short stay- but if I’m ever in La Crosse again I’ll be staying here for sure!!"

Overall, it exceeded my expectations and we would certainly stay there again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really wonderful family visit during spring break. Walking into Beth‘s house, you have everything that you need to cook at home or go to the great restaurants around. Her house is a really wonderful option for a family or group of friends-a beautiful space to hang out, lots of games, a large dining table, comfy furniture and a lot of bedrooms. She is a great hostess- leaving out all those little things that you may have forgotten and waters and snacks as a welcome. Really wonderful. We bought our dog and it was fun to have an opportunity to have her with us on our vacation. Thank you. We will be back."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved Lem's place. It's laid out in a way that gave my husband and I each space (a bedroom/bathroom) to relax while he worked, and I read, stretched. The kitchen and laundry can both be closed off from either or both of the bedroom/bathroom spaces, so we could do cooking, cleaning, and tea prep together or separately, too. The design is clean and simple, the colors are soothing and everywhere you turn, there is a handy hook, a shelf, or light. Highly recommended. We hiked the La Crosse Bluffs for three days in a row. Also amazing!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a treasure! We absolutely loved our stay in the historic W.W. Withee House! We loved the modern decor paired with the historic architecture. The sunrise from the turret is stunning and we loved all of Emma’s extras that made the place feel like home. It was also fascinating to learn more about the building history from the builders/renovators. And we can’t wait to stay again! Such a lovely place! Thank you for a beautiful stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home; it did feel like a castle! Nice open space with great natural light.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was just as pictured. Nice and quiet for me. The floors squeak pretty loud so I felt a little bad for the people below me. Nobody complained so maybe they couldn’t hear me. I rise early so the sunrises were beautiful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed at many Airbnbs, but this was surely the best. Perfect location with parking. Honestly, the pictures didn't do the place justice.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning historic loft in downtown La Crosse. Can't beat the location!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely perfect for me.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The parking was awesome. The location perfect.....we could easily walk everywhere! It was a little hard finding the door....ending up walking around entire building. Guessing I may have missed the instructions. We plan to rent again!

Comfortable bed with plenty of linens. We definitely would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful loft in a perfect location. Large and airy with a beautiful kitchen, large bedroom with very comfortable king size bed, comfortable living room furniture and huge bathroom. We had some trouble finding the entrance as it’s in the back of the building-we were looking along the front on 5th St. Once we found it the parking was super convenient right at the door. FYI-The stairs are steep to get to the loft. But I must say it’s an absolute solid 5 star experience. Great communication with owners, excellent location and beautiful space. Highly, highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved this place and we definitely want to come back!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and Elizabeth is wonderful to work with
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay! The loft is huge, airy and beautiful. Was really nicely decorated and felt very comfortable and clean. There was a binder with all the information you could need and recommendations for food and things to do locally. Within easy walking distance of some great food too! ( Lovechild was fantastic!) The only time we were confused was checking in, the door to the space is at what feels like the back of the building. Not a big deal at all, parking was great, right outside the door. Would absolutely stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful loft in the heart of downtown. Loved the old brick and the detail, very cozy. Within walking distance to great restaurants, quaint shops and a great antique store. Thank You Liz for a great getaway!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth has beautiful place! The amenities made us feel like we were staying at a friend’s home.

We loved every second we were there and looking forward to booking again next year for my annual conference.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I went to this Airbnb for our anniversary weekend, and it was a wonderful downtown getaway. This Airbnb was extremely spacious and was a nice place to stay to celebrate. This Airbnb is also in the heart of downtown, so restaurants and stores were in complete walking distance which was really nice as well, we also had our own parking space and overall found our stay very calming and cozy! Highly recommend if you need a staycation or are traveling and need a place to stay in La Crosse."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Very walkable to plenty of great restaurants and coffee shops. Clean and very nice overall. Bed is very comfortable. Wish there was more of a solid door to the place, it is an all glass business style door."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay with Elizabeth. She was a great host with a beautiful loft in the heart of downtown La Crosse. I will definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in town.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was more spacious than we could have imagined! The bed was comfortable. The coffee was great. It had all of the comforts of home. The location was central to all the places we visited.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous loft in a perfect location. Pictures don't do the space justice- it is huge! Had a wonderful visit to La Crosse, catching up with old friends."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful space, open loft, comfy bedroom, large bathroom, kitchen with lots of counter space"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location in heart of Downtown. Easy walk to riverfront, restaurants and shopping. Loft is nice mix of old and modern & well-equipped for a comfortable stay. Wish it had usable outdoor space, but otherwise close to perfect!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down one be of the best experiences with an Air BnB! The loft was amazing!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful Airbnb property. It is in a great location. We were able to walk to many restaurants, bars, and shops.
The loft has a great vibe to it. I love how it is decorated. It was perfect for my getaway."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best ad for Elizabeth's loft would be a video of us walking in and experiencing it for the first time. As beautiful as the pictures are, the loft was even more beautiful in person- the bookcase, the high ceilings, the light-filled rooms. This is a very special place. And every detail reflected a concern for our comfort and experience- the comfy bed, the plush towels, the guest book with suggestions on how to enjoy the neighborhood. It's not just somewhere to stay; it's a luxurious experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded expectations. The place is larger than it looks in pictures. Very well stocked with everything you need. Very unique. Would have liked to know in advance that entrance was in the rear of the building, but we figured it out.
Will stay there again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for the wonderful stay! It was beautiful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space!! There was a pretty loud outdoor festival going on at a bar below, but that’s not something the host could have predicted. They didn’t start with loud entertainment til after we were up and were done at 10:00 pm, so all in all was fine. And theoretically to be expected when you rent a space over a busy downtown/bar area. The space was so gorgeous. The pictures do not do it Justice. We would love to stay here again!! One of our favorite air b and b’s ever!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, comfortable and nice, in the perfect location"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth's loft was everything and more we had hoped for! The space is huge with high ceilings, beautiful decor, and expertly clean. The location worked perfectly for our weekend and to anything in downtown La Crosse you may want to venture doing. It was a 10 minute walk to Riverside Park and shorter to other restaurants and shops. The only small downside is you can hear the businesses or private residences surrounding the loft very easily. Otherwise, this loft is an incredible stay. Elizabeth was kind, flexible with our check-in and helpful!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the loviest Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at! The location was ideal for the concert we went to at the LaCrosse Center. We were able to walk to everything and keep our car parked in the very convenient spot right in front of our place.
There were many nice touches in the loft - linens, beautifully appointed kitchen, books, games, snacks …
Would definitely stay again - recommend 100%!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Elizabeth’s loft was a great decision! Not only is it a beautiful space but it’s in such a convenient location with bars, restaurants and shopping within a block or two. The loft is huge, clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Hands down the coolest AirBNB we’ve stayed at!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft on 5th is filled with quality finishings and we greatly appreciated the thick towels, comfortable furniture, cozy blankets, and well-appointed kitchen. Best of all was the large, comfortable bed. I slept like a baby.
There were little touches and surprises that I don't want to mention because the fact that we weren't expecting them made them even more appreciated. Beautiful views of classic buildings made us feel at times like we were in a European city and the best of La Crosse was all within walking distance.
We enjoyed exploring La Crosse & the bluffs on foot and on bike. We are already talking about our next visit."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cannot say enough good things about this place! Very clean, unique charm, comfortable bed/couches, and amazing downtown location. Our host was very nice and had thought of every little detail when furnishing this loft. We felt at home the moment we walked in. We loved the convenient location that was within walking distance to many restaurants, bars and shopping. We will definitely be staying here again our next trip to La Crosse!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool place. Right downtown, and space was large, full of light and well appointed. Entrance as a little tricky to find initially but once you find it no issues. Host was great with communication. Would love to return!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,When you walk in the space it matches pictures but is even grander than expected. Great stay with all amenities. Walk to great restaurants. Host was responsive to questions. Wi be staying here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for a work conference! Everything was just as expected!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying here. We love LaCrosse and 5th St loft is our go to place!!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful open space with everything we needed for our stay. Great location to walk. We were in town for our grandsons 1st birthday and after awful travel, we could not have been more satisfied with the loft."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this place is like a story book.
it is a loft in the middle of their quate little grown and the view was out of the windows was cool! i loved everything about it.
i will probably never go back because of the reason i was there, but if i were to ever go i would stay at this little (it’s at actual very large) gem of a loft again again!!
Great job Elizabeth!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a spot! From check-in through departure … a wonderful choice. Great location, great loft, great host."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos do not do this place justice!! This one bedroom is huge and has a big open floor plan, perfect for our stay in Lacrosse and working virtually for a couple of days. Location is right downtown and walkable to all of the main stores and restaurants - Duluth Trading is close and Cabin Coffee is right around the corner! We had great instructions, but the back alley was a little hard to find at night, but it all made sense during the daytime and once we got acclimated with our surroundings. The bedroom is huge and very comfortable. We can't say enough good things about this rental and would definitely stay again - the only thing is the very narrow, steep staircase leading up to the apartment. If you have trouble climbing stairs this may not be the place for you, but otherwise you won't find a better place in downtown La Crosse!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at the Loft. Was very clean, beautiful and had everything we needed. Great communication, and easy check-in process. The location is also fantastic!
We’d love to return to LaCrosse for another getaway and would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a great place to stay if visiting La Crosse. The place is huge and was very nice. I stayed for a week and it felt like home. The location is fantastic and within walking distance of anything you’d want to do in downtown La Crosse. Elizabeth the host did a fantastic job with this property and communication throughout my stay. I will be back
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Very clean and had all the amenities needed for a very enjoyable long weekend in October. Liz is a great host!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is literally the only place I look to stay when in town. Can’t say enough good things about this place and Elizabeth is wonderful!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very modern and chic property. It’s in a great location and has loads of space and plenty to do all around. I would highly recommend staying here as opposed to even your upscale hotels.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at the loft was fantastic! It was a quiet, warm space for my stay in La Crosse. The bed was comfortable, the coffee was fantastic, and I couldn’t stop marveling at the gigantic book case that dominates the large main room. I would stay here again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely breathtaking loft, downtown, in the heart of Lacrosse. Everything was very clean and comfortable. So many great food options in walking distance."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was incredible! Great communication by the host, location was amazing, and the loft was so cool! Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great LaCrosse experience!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing amazing! What a great location and WOW … breathtaking loft!
It’s HUGE! You can either use the key in the glass door or take the metal steps up to the 2nd floor bedroom and use it there. I definitely recommend the metal steps, they’re easier to use. Also, the bedroom door doesn’t automatically lock, don’t forget to lock it before heading out.
After climbing either set of steps with your luggage, you can take a rest and let the ceiling fans cool you off > the dials below the thermostat.
Every room is fully stocked, just like being at home but so much more fabulous 👏 Treat yourself!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would 100% recommend the loft to anyone visiting la crosse! The check in/parking was super easy. The loft was big, clean and inviting!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Perfect location downtown. Walk to restaurants, bars, riverfront park and excellent grocery store one block away. One of the best appointed Airbnbs we’ve ever stayed in. Literally everything we needed in the large, open kitchen. Nice view of downtown street from living room. Bedroom looks over the large alley and we never heard any noise at night. Having the dedicated parking space was nice too. If you are mobility impaired- not for you, as there are 21 stairs to reach loft."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! I didn’t want to leave! Location was perfect. So close to everything. Bed and pillows were super comfy and the house had anything you could possibly need. I can not wait to come back.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have had a better experience. Fantastic place, All of the amenities one could ever desire.. We have stayed in 20 or 30 airbnb's and I have to say this was the best of all of them."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully updated and furnished unit in quiet downtown location. Very clean and organized kitchen. Elizabeth was very helpful providing check-in instructions. Will definitely stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Elizabeth’s loft was very clean, comfortable and full of character. Within walking distance of everything you need to enjoy your stay in La Crosse. We enjoyed our stay and had all the comforts of home.
Our only small discomfort was out of the hosts full control but worth mentioning. The staircase to get into the loft is very steep and you must be able bodied to navigate the stairs.
Well worth the money for convenience of location and character of the loft!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This Loft is Gorgeous & Spacious. We loved all the brick & exposed duct work! The Loft was walking distance to the river & great restaurants! Lacrosse is a wonderful place to visit!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Modern place with all the amenities, it was a great location for us to walk to local shops, restaurants, and the convention center without having to worry about moving the car or dealing with parking fees. We especially like the historic shelving (with great books), the fully ready kitchen and dining room, and the open feel with a skylight in the bathroom, tall ceilings, and big rooms. We didn't have time or a need for the laundry or many of the things offered, but would make a point to stay here again, hopefully soon, there is a lot to see, do, and eat in the neighborhood."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding facility in a great location. Tons of open, airy space, I would recommend staying here and plan to stay again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LOVE this place!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my husband visited La Crosse for his bass fishing tournament and decided to book this Airbnb for the weekend. The place did not disappoint! The place is HUGE and was stocked with basic necessities that you would need. Elizabeth was very easy to contact as well. I love how there was a “guide” of places to visit and check out left on the countertop for us to read! Highly recommended ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Will definitely book again in the future!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great downtown location and great host. Has everything you need.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft is a must see. Very well appointed. Great location. Very clean. I would highly reccomend and will stay again the next time I'm in town!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spacious downtown loft within walking distance to everything. Elizabeth was wonderful to communicate with and the loft was stocked with all the comforts of home. We will be back and highly recommend this place! Nancy
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was so nice. It is so LARGE. We had a wonderful stay and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Elizabeth was very responsive. The amenities were luxurious!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this rental! You can’t beat the location. Just step outside and walk to everything downtown. The loft was much bigger in person than it appeared in the pics. It is such a cool space. Both the bed and pullout couch were super comfy (best pullout couch I’ve slept on). The rental was very clean and had everything we needed. Checkin/checkout were super easy and Elizabeth was available if we had any questions. We loved our stay here and would definitely book it again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for an organic farming conference, and if I could give more than 5 stars for location and value I would. This is a unique, large, and beautiful space, intentionally curated but homey and comfortable. Elizabeth was helpful and responsive before and during my stay, and the loft had everything I needed. It was so fun to be in the heart of town but tucked away when rest or a productive zoom call was needed. Could not recommend more when you are visiting La Crosse!"
