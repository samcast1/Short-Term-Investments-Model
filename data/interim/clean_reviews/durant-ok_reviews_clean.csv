2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a tiny little cottage. Perfect for a sleep over for a day or two. It’s older and lock on door needs a slight adjustment. It’s in an older neighborhood but close to casino and a restaurant we like. Better than the hotel we used in the past. I will use again.

2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"After checking in, there were a few hiccups in the evening that were quickly resolved.
Great place to stay, located close to Main Street, plenty of parking and room to move around inside the AirBnB. Well stocked with towels, dishes, etc. Priced right for the accommodations. The shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure.
Bring a beside clock if you want to know the time in the middle of the night. We felt like we were in Vegas with no clocks anywhere.

We will be back!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a good stay overall. This little house was the perfect size for a quick weekend trip. It does not have central heat and air but they provided space heaters for the bedroom and bathroom and there is a unit in the main room. We were very comfortable the whole time. Clean fridge and shower. (There is a BIG step getting in and out of the bath/shower which might be difficult for older folks or people with disabilities.) A washer and dryer are provided. Very quick and easy drive to the casino! We will definitely stay again next time we come back to go to the casino. Very responsive and friendly hosts.

Mona was great. Had plenty of snacks and beverages. Inquired about all my needs and sent Charlie the Pug over for companionship as needed.
""I'll be back."""
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed our stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved staying at Mona's. The location is great and was very convenient to the different places I needed to be during my stay. The area is very peaceful and quiet which was lovely. This is a weird compliment, but the AC system was set perfectly. I did not need to adjust it at all and was quite comfortable throughout my stay, a minor miracle for someone who is always cold! The kitchen is great with a full size fridge and a wine fridge so you can separate party from business, if need be. Also: multiple coffee solutions! I look forward to staying here again in the future. The only downside: I never met the pugs! Maybe next time? Thank you so much for hosting, it was great!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely guest house in the giant backyard of a beautiful home in a gorgeous neighborhood. Ideal place to stay for a weekend in Durant.

The location was really nice, clean and comfortable and we would stay here again. The property is dog friendly and makes me think it's time to get a Labrador to bring on fun weekend trips like this."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed in AirBnB’s from Vietnam to Europe and throughout US. I found Mona’s attention to detail excellent. One of if not the best I have experienced. Gated community with beautiful homes and easy access. Only 10 minutes to the Casino were we attended a concert. From snacks and coffee to every amenity needed and excellent quality linens. Things like easy to use guest login for Netflix to a comfy blanket to watch TV with. I especially liked the frosted mug in the freezer and cold beer in the refrigerator on arrival! Mona! Well done!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay at this Air bnb! So clean and perfect for my boyfriend and I.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay for a small weekend getaway!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a fantastic stay! I really loved that it was a private guest house, rather than a room in someone’s house. Everything was clean, spacious, bed was comfy, shower was hot. I’ll definitely be looking to stay here if I come back to Durant and recommending this place to anyone I can!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mona's place was great. Clean, tidy and quaint. We forgot something in the fridge and Mona let us come back and get it with no hassle. We would stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We will definitely keep Mona in mind on our future trips to visit our daughter. She has the perfect place for a quick get away. Would recommend her space over any hotel in the area.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved Mona’s place. I wish I could’ve stayed longer. It was perfect!! Very quiet. It was just what I needed!! I look forward to staying again. Mona was amazing! She always answers my many questions very quickly. Didn’t matter what the questions were. I liked the little patio area in the back. I was able to sit out there and so some work that I had to bring with me. Thank you for a beautiful stay!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Mona you have a really nice place and location. Great experience for us.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. Mona was very responsive and made check-in and out easy.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent choice. Private and spacious
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place to stay! Mona is a wonderful host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was clean and had comfortable beds. Home is located on a dead end road with no other homes around, across the railroad tracks. Plenty of parking and room outside the home, with a large sitting deck. Would stay again if or when we visit Durant!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, would stay again!"
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home ! I would definitely stay again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great house! Lots of fun activities!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Very nice house. Great stay.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"House was very clean, spacious and very close to our venue. Beautiful home which we of booked a longer stay."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,House is decorated cute and comfortable. Kitchen was not functional for cooking. Had one disgusting old pot and nothing else to cook with. Dishwasher did not work. Appliances were otherwise really nice. It is very close to railroad tracks but they supplied ear plugs. Would also be nice if you could enter from the front as it was muddy to get to back door.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home. Kaine was very responsive and accommodating. Two issues I had: the heat was difficult to control. We could adjust the temperature; however, it would be stifling hot in some of the bedrooms, but very cool in other areas. The second issue was out of their control. We were very close to train tracks that seem to have a train pass every few hours, even during the middle of the night. It seemed to rattle the entire house, and the train whistle was very loud. Despite the train and heater issue, we would stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Such a great airbnb! Super close to the casino. Very spacious.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We all loved the house. Very spacious with plenty of room for 7 people. The host was very friendly and responsive. Wished that we could have stayed longer. We didn’t even mind the trains. The house is very close to the Choctaw casino which was the main reason we chose this house (very easy to get there). My only suggestion would be to have a few more ear plugs (there was only 1 pair) for guests who don’t want to hear the trains at while trying to sleep. Also, we didn’t have any dish detergent pods. Other than that, the house is lovely!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Communication was exceptional. Two minor issues with water and trash pick-up were taken care of with an hours' time.
The only thing the listing stated about the active train was that the railroad track was located near the house. Actually, the tracks are actually about 30 yards in front of the house. The train goes by twice every two hours, 24-hours a day. And it almost always pulled more than 100 cars. The entrance to the property has a private railroad crossing with no warning lights or retractable barrier so the conductor blasts the train horn before approaching the crossing. My guests and I never got used to the train horn."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,was good!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place! Felt right at home and fit all of our needs for the stay! Will keep this place in mind if we ever come back to Oklahoma.

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,I thought it was great. But i have severe allergies to fragrances and there was a plug in which i disconnected but somehow it still made my sinuses swell up. Also i took my 18 month old twins and the floor is wood and them running around on it was so loud. Not a big deal to me but the rest of my fam had a hard time sleeping.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was traveling from south Texas to north Oklahoma and found this place for a one night stay and I’m glad I made the choice. The house was immaculate inside and very clean. My family was impressed, and if I visit the nearby casinos, I would stay here again."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Why pay $500 a night for a single room at the casino when you can rent this entire 4 bedroom 3 bath place for less? Fantastic value and super close to the casino. Very private. Exceeded our expectations in every way!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Pictures do not do this place justice!! Beautiful place and close to Choctaw. Kaine is very responsive!! Will highly recommend this place and will probably be booking again!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Perfect for big group. 3 minute drive from Choctaw Casino (back road driving do not need to get onto interstate). Private/safe space. Beds are super comfortable!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute house, very comfortable, lots if space in the living and dinning rooms, plus, plenty of room on the deck if you have a large group. We enjoyed our stay."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was just as beautiful and clean as it shows in the listing. The casino was right down the street which was very nice. Kaine was very communicative with us. The train is very close to the house, but we thought it was fun and different. It wasn't a bother at all. The only criticism I would say is the front door was not working well and my husband had to walk up the deck stairs and unlock the back door and then let us in the front door. He then let us out the front door and locked it behind us and had to go out the back door again and meet us at the car. Kaine did offer to fix it during our stay which was very kind. Just know that that back entrance has multiple stairs and the front entrance has a huge step up so it was very hard for my 76 year old dad to get in and out of the front door because he uses a walker and is a fall risk. Besides that, the place is just fabulous!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great place overall. No complaints.
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great place, ideal for casino events."

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,This house was perfect for our girls weekend. Check in and out was easy. Location to the casino was great. Beds and linens were so comfortable. It was very clean.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Exceptional host, lovely home!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is home is a great meeting spot and has plenty of space for a small get together of 8 people. The beds were comfortable. And everything was laid out very well. Super close to the casino and pretty much anything in Durant. If anyone worries about being so close to the train, I wouldn’t worry about it. After I went to bed I never heard the train"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very nice. It was located on private land. The kids love seeing the train, and there is a fence in between the tracks and the house. The backyard is big and the deck also. The host Kaine kept in touch to see if we needed anything.So I would recommend if you want to get away this is the place"

2021-12-01,5,Group trip,Perfect stay! Third time using this AirBnB and it has been awesome!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was our second stay at this location, and it was a hit once again. The four bedroom layout worked great for our group. The kids enjoyed the space outside to run around, the frisbee golf, the oversized jenga, and cornhole. The common areas are spacious and well-appointed. The kitchen is outfitted with what you need to prepare meals, and it has a Keurig. The house is also conveniently located next to the Choctaw casino and close to Durant proper. It is our go-to place in Durant when visiting family."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is absolutely amazing. It is almost literally in the shadow of the Choctaw casino, and it is not far from stores and restaurants in Durant. The owner clearly put a lot of effort in making sure that the house is comfortable for guests. The furniture was all nice, the beds and linens were comfortable, and the entertainment items such as frisbee golf, corn hole, and fishing pond were fun for the kids. The kitchen has all nice and new appliances, the washer and dryer were helpful to have, and the televisions were all modern and functioning. If you are looking for a four bedroom, three bath in Durant, then you would be hard-pressed to beat this location. Finally, the owner was helpful with check-in and check-out.

The train right next to the house does come by in the night and early morning (per their report), but they did know obviously that was a possibility. Kaine was a wonderful host, very responsive!"
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,Great location if you are going to the casino. Train runs in the morning and a time or two during the day but it’s quick so it isn’t loud for that long. There are two huge walk in showers. House was sparkling clean inside. Has everything you would need. We used the backdoor since it was closer to where you can park. Don’t forget to lock the door on your way out!

2020-01-01,5,Group trip,Our family had a great stay! The location was perfect for us to go to the casino and ther home was spacious and rooms for comfortable
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,"Very convenient to casino , nice and spacious and nicely decorated."
2020-01-01,4,Group trip,"I originally booked for a lower price for NYE. I had to do some updates to my Airbnb account and it cancelled my reservation. When I tried to rebook, the rate was increased due to it being a holiday. Totally understandable! When I emailed the owner they thought I cancelled so they updated their price. However, when they realized the cancellation was a mistake they offered to let us have it for the previous price. They totally didn't have to do that, but were very gracious. The house and property is beautiful and has a privacy fence in front since it sits on a busy road. The rooms were nice. The decor was very welcoming. The only reason it's not 5 star (4.7 is more like it) is because it sits right across the train track and multiple trains happened to go by that night, horns blowing due to being at the crossing. The only other issue was the heat was not on at all so it was very cold inside and took a bit to warm up due to the size of the house. My friends and I would totally stay again. We didn't get to make use of huge deck and fire pit, but definitely would have we'd time. The casino was literally a minute drive away. I totally recommend this beautiful home.... and they did have ear plugs! Lol"
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"The house is spectacular, super roomy and excellent distance from Casino. Will definitely stay again in the future!"
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,We will do it again! The communication was quick and the facilities are great for family event! Warmer weather brings more to the location but we enjoyed our time inside in the comfort of a clean place! We recommend and for our first experience we are very satisfied! Thank you !
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"Great stay very close to Choctaw Casino!! Super neat, comfy, clean and updated house inside, lots of room outside! WiFi, directv, nice laundry facility and appliances. Although our light sleepers heard the train, which is just outside the fence, it’s not a deterrence from staying here again and recommending to our friends!! Kaine was a great host and very responsive. We’ll be back!"
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"I would recommend Kaine ' s place to everyone, it is very spacious and very clean."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kaine’s place was perfect for us! The back patio, bbq and yard games were used often. We were also able to visit the pond and go fishing. All the bedding was very comfortable and the house was clean. Would definitely recommend!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house and decor are amazing... Kaine was an awesome host, very accommodating. They have payed attention to all the details needed to make the stay, a great experience. It was JUST what we needed, everyone had their own bed and bathroom... so much space inside and out. I hate that we didn’t get time to enjoy all of the outdoor goodies. Will definitely be back to stay!"
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"You absolutely cannot go wrong with this place. It is clean, nicely updated, and fabulously close to the casino. The amenities are quite nice - you have access to a washer and dryer - and the kitchen is well stocked. You will hear the train...the tracks are right there...but we found it wasn't bothersome. We weren't here long enough to take advantage of all this house has to offer, but there is a nice large deck with a grill on the back of the house. You also have great parking space. We had a bigger group and there was plenty of room to spread out, plus adequate bathroom options. Again, you cannot go wrong with this Airbnb!"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,House was very nice and clean. Super close to Choctaw. Kaine was very nice and responsive. Definitely worth staying here to have nice a house vs a hotel room. Will be staying here again next time we go to Choctaw.

Sitting on the outside deck watching kids play in the open space and burning wood-fire in the gazebo was a lot of fun!! A lot of open space for kids to run around at the front and back. Plane spotting small airplanes was fun as well and kids loved seeing cargo trains from outside of the house. Overall a good place to unwind especially for folks with kids. Would give 4/5 stars and would be back for sure."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kaine’s home was beautiful! There was a leak in the guest bedroom with some mold but Kaine was responsive and told us it would be fixed once we left and he didn’t know it was there. We would for sure stay again!

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"The place was spic and span when we arrived and it smelled clean. Its very close to the casino if you want outta the house but there is plenty to do on the property if you want to stay in. I love that there was a large assortment of pool floaties, and the horseshoe pit and cornhole was a fun feature also. The pool is on the smaller side and about 3 and a half feet deep, which would be great if you have young children. We were a party of six ladies and it suited us just fine as many of us girls didn’t want to get our hair wet anyway. There is a lovely field of sunflowers along the back side of the yard that make a great photo op. It’s also a nice piece of property and you can enjoy yourselves without having to worry about being to noisy for neighbors, we packed our sound bar and we’re completely comfortable blasting our tunes for an outdoor BBQ. We walked the property a bit to check out the full moon and it was lovely. Great place to stay!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our experience was wonderful. We took a weekend girls trip and it was perfect
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"My family stayed for 5 days. The home had so many things to occupy our time with-swimming pool, fishing pond (don’t forget your poles/bait!), outside games, 4 TV’s and the donkeys! You can literally see the Casino over the trees from the yard if that’s your thing.
The kitchen and bathrooms had all sorts of necessities at our disposal. The bed was a little hard for my liking, but comfortable enough that I didn’t leave aching.
I would definitely recommend staying here if your looking for a country retreat where you just want to relax!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was my first experience renting on Airnb. I was so nervous. As soon as I got the nerve to reserve Kaine was an amazing host.

We are already making plans for when we can come back. :)

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house and property was perfect for a mother's day weekend. My husband and i spent weekend with our teenaged and college children. The house was spacious with new and plentiful cooking items. We enjoyed a game of corn hole and giant sized connect four on the back porch. My daughter swam in the pool, which was very clean. Saturday we fished in the pond and caught/released some small crappie. You can see the top of the new Choctaw resort tower from the yard (if close proximity to the casino is important to you) but we never left the property, as we were seeking something a little more low key. Highly recommend the place for all family types and can't wait to add it to our list of travel options."
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,beautiful place!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We spent 2 nights at Kaine’s place and loved it! Big home with everything provided. Love fishing in the pond and caught a couple of nice fish.

Everyone was really in awe of the rental, especially since it’s situated on land with plenty of space for our rowdy bunch. We are already choosing dates for a summer trip!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was awesome! It's quiet and has a great country feel but is close enough to some awesome amenities in Durant so you have plenty of options.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just outstanding. We are a musical group who are booked once a quarter at the casino. We normally play a two night engagement and our downbeat isn't until 10 pm. It was so good to be able to come chill out at the Ho On Day instead of having to hang out in a cramped hotel room or the smokey casino.
We looked to book the space again on 7/26 and 27, but alas, it was already booked. If there's a cancellation for any reason, we'll take it!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great. We drove up from MS fir the Colter Wall concert and were only 2 miles from the venue. I will definitely stay here again should the occasion ever arise. Charles was extremely responsive and even kept us updated on weather conditions as we drove through Friday’s storms.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charles is a wonderful host. The place was immaculate and very comfortable and homey. This comfortable home, has everything you need for your home away from home.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Charles place! Everything is exactly as described/pictured on the listing. We encountered no issues with finding the place or checking in/out. I do wish there was a curtain on the back kitchen window since there are housing basically in the backyard & maybe a light back there as it is awfully dark (the whole town/neighborhood is). But all is great & will definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I felt right at home. It was a great place to stay. Charlie was very communicative as well. It was a great home away from home for the price! Highly recommend!

I would recommend this house to anyone who is looking to book it!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for my HS reunion which coincided with a big weekend at the Casino, and lodging was hard to find. Charles's home was our first AirBnB experience and couldn't have been better. He was quick to communicate check in instructions and when I had trouble with the door (my rookie mistake!) he was quick to call me back and walk me through. The house is beautifully furnished and cozy and the master bed is so comfortable. He thoughtfully left snacks waiting for us when we arrived. The neighborhood is very quiet and easy access to the highway, whether you're going to Oklahoma or Texas.
We will definitely contact Charles if we need a place to stay in Calera again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,As per my boys this place deserves 100 stars and has been the best AirBnb we have stayed at yet. We had a wonderful stay. Ericka made our Easter one we will never forget. Thank you for taking time out of your Easter to make ours amazing. The house is adorable and cozy. We loved the decor and all the little touches from the fresh eggs to the welcome sign. My boys are already asking when they can go back. So glad I found this gem of a place.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was quiet and so peaceful. Erika was great at responding to any questions. An early check in was allowed and it really helped us because we were checking out of a place that did not meet our expectations. This is not the place for lots of electronics and/or tv. It’s a perfect place to unplug and enjoy down time. Super close to Choctaw. There is a dirt drive for about a mile. Be aware of that. We loved our weekend away!! We will be back.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Perfect location for a night at Choctaw
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely stunning property and so comfortable! the shower even had 2 shower head which was awesome! It was so quiet and peaceful.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were needing a little place to stay after seeing The Jonas Brothers (🩵) and this was the perfect location! Our only regret was not staying longer!! It was so cute inside!! Erika was welcoming and helpful as she responds to messages very quickly. They also have noise makers (white noise sound machines) already set in the bedrooms so I didn’t have to take mine out of my bag. Sadly we didn’t see the doggos!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very enjoyable stay. Nice country livin’!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I were traveling through later in the evening and thankfully stumbled upon this gem. The house was very clean and comfortable and the owners response time was almost instant. very cute and cozy little farm house that I wish we could've spent more time enjoying. Also they have a pack and play and swing for the babies and lots of toys for the kids. Very nice. Thank you for having us.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved this Airbnb! Hosts are amazing, easy to communicate with, quick responses, and very accommodating!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place. Clean, and comfy. If you are looking for a place detached and on your own this is your place. Large and spacious. It was everything we wanted and more"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay.. Highly recommend if you're around that area and want some peace and quiet after a stressful day.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Erika made check-in very easy. Would stay here again.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a lovely home. Decorated super cute and very clean. A peaceful stay in the country. Enjoyed interactions with Ranger (dog) and Pickles (horse).
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful place to stay, day and night. Wide open spaces, a friendly dog, a curious horse, and cautious, free-range chickens—during the day. When the night time rolls around, you could see every constellation in the sky.
The home itself was very clean with an open floor plan. I would definitely stay again if I am ever down that way. Thanks Erika!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love the place! I'll definitely try and book this BNB everytime I'm visiting family in Bryan County. 💗
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thus is an amazing place to stay. The hosts are very helpful, the place is always cleaned and prepared. They interacted with us when we were outside at the same time. Love the fact they also have friendly dogs ❤️
We will continue to stay with them if available during Durant Pow Wow"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,we had an amazing time and loved the pups.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Will be coming back again for our next visit to Choctaw!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The farm is gorgeous. It has chickens, a very friendly horse and a couple of farm dogs. A great place to bring the family. Be careful if you travel with dogs. Erika and James allow your dogs to run and play all day and have tremendous patience. My husky/shiba-inu mix did not do well. She barked at the horse and tried to get into the chicken coop. We left earlier than I would have liked because I could not get her to stop going after the chickens. I was just too worried that she would, somehow, get one of them. So….beautiful place with fresh eggs. It can be a bit overwhelming for a dog that is not experience with farm life."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a beautiful and peaceful property! It had everything we needed, and we loved that it was so close to the casino yet still felt secluded. Will definitely stay here again when attending events at the casino. Instructions were very clear, check in was a breeze, everything was clean, and the welcome committee, Sally and Ranger, were the absolute sweetest!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is great! Private. Clean Secluded. We will return next time we are in the need for a stay in the area. Close to the Durant Casino for awesome concerts.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This getaway is off the beaten path, a few miles to Choctaw casino, and yes, an Uber is available!!
There is just enough country to disconnect from our busy lives, yet close enough to have a night out on the town.
Comfy bed, nice linens, equipped kitchen, oh and Go for the FRESH EGGS!!! Yes, right out side your door!!
Ranger and Sally are great greeters. Erika and James are amazing hosts!!!
Definitely will book with them again and never stress about where to stay off premises for the next concert!!!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We had a moving caravan which included a large U-Haul with a car trailer and a full sized truck, so Erika’s property was ideal for an overnight stay during our journey. If you are visiting the area and value safety and privacy, this is the place for you."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was a great place to stay and close to the marina our guided fishing trip left from early in the morning. The easy, no hassle check in and check out process was perfect, and the recommended restaurant was delicious! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic stay and very comfortable. The access to fresh eggs was the cherry on top!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We showed up to the house late at night after being in the car with 4 kids for 11 hours to find the most beautiful country stay we could have imagined. Walking in to farm fresh eggs and an immaculately clean home was so relaxing. There was all sorts of toys for the kids to play with and swings and a bed for the baby so we didn't even need to unpack those. My husband and I sat on the patio after the kids went to bed and enjoyed the beautiful Oklahoma sky in the peace and quiet with Sally and Ranger. We will definitely be making this part of our yearly trip!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing and I highly recommend it
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beauty place! The fresh eggs were a cherry on top!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great location if you are wanting to get away from the city. Enjoyed a peaceful night under the stars and spent the day exploring Eisenhower State Park and the city of Denison. Would definitely recommend for a weekend getaway!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place with easy access. Very nice down home feel. Fresh eggs from the chicken coop for the morning and a cold beer waiting in the fridge upon arrival.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at Jame’s property. Plenty of space and beautiful as well . The eggs were a great addition to breakfast and the dogs were wonderful greeters
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was perfect for the family get together we had and we really miss it compared to our bnb in Kansas. The only issue we had was cooking because it seemed like when I turned the oven on the burners went off and vis versa so our food wasn’t evenly warm upon serving. Everything else was so nice and peaceful. It was nice to be in a secured property where it felt safe.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The hosts were so nice and very responsive! The property was soooo pretty and peacetime my kids had a blast. We would definitely stay here again. They thought of a lot of handy things for kids and the beds were very comfortable! 10/10 would recommend

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Very comfortable and quiet.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little spot. We were in town for a Dwight Yoakum concert and had zero desire to stay at the local casino, it’s pricey, crowded and way too busy. James place was a nice pace for us. Quiet, cozy, private, and Ranger(the doggo) made us feel right at home. We are dog people and hate leaving ours at home but they don’t travel well. Just consider Range as this rentals “director of guest services”, lol."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,The cabin is very clean with all the needed amenities. We stayed overnight and had a great time with family. James was very helpful and responsive. Highly recommend!

The place is beautiful and cozy perfect for a family get away although we only spent the night there they have a list of things to do within the property that my kids loved and want to go back to enjoy them.
It is peaceful and quiet yet is close to
many restaurants and others.
Definitely booking with James and family in the near future."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This awesome Airbnb is just like the pictures ……beautiful, peaceful. & affordable! From the minute I booked the host sent detailed easy instructions. The place was easy to find and prefect…. James was right there to greet us as we arrived. The welcome sign plus farm fresh eggs were an extra touch that made us feel like we were staying with fiends! We will definitely be staying here again and will highly recommend to others…… thanks James! 😊"

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place to stay wanted to get out of the city with some freinds . James gave us a amazing stay we loved the dogs and the horse pickles. definitely will come again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We arrived around 6pm the day of check in. We were immediately greeted by Ranger (who is an absolutely amazing animal); he and my 6yr old bonded immediately. The next morning my Grandmother and I were greeted by James and Ranger and shown the way to the pond for some early morning fishing. By the end of our stay, we'd met the entire family and all agreed that this was the most welcoming experience we'd had with an Air B&B. The fresh eggs were a bonus and you are also free to purchase more if interested. The best way I can describe this visit was ""Serene and Relaxing"". Thank you for entertaining our whole family and welcoming us onto your property. We look forward to visiting in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and very accommodating.

2023-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,The inside was very nice however first impression was terrible. Two or three dogs surrounding our car. The garage as it appears in pics has a large boat parked inside. Overall we didnt enjoy it.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a pretty home! We truly enjoyed everything about this place, being out in the country makes it so peaceful and relaxing.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb was located close to Choctaw. Very clean and had access to pretty much anything you’d need on an out of town stay. Their dog was also sweet and I’m not even a dog person, lol"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean and nice. Appreciated the fact that spices, oil, coffee, etc. we’re available in case we needed them. Complimentary fresh eggs were a bonus! Plenty of room for 4-6 guests. Planned to work out, but didn’t get to this time. Would go here again."

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing stay, great location! Very clean and comfortable beds! Ranger the farm dog is absolutely amazing! Love that lil guy"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was last minute, overnight, after a long day of traveling. We were so delighted to be invited to the pool at the main house, but arrived a little too late for a dip. The beds are comfy and kitchen is so thoughtfully stocked and equipped. This is Farmhouse- luxury and probably the most rested we have ever been waking up in an AirBnB. We stayed at 5-8 mph on the dirt road to be considerate and keep the dust down. Every detail was just as described, and the chicken coop is just outside the kitchen window if more eggs are desired! mahalo iā ʻoe my friends thank you for sharing your gorgeous Ohana with us!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was spectacular. It was super clean and the host were awesome. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a clean and cozy place.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,this home blew our minds! it was so affordable and a beautiful space to spend our night in. Not to mention how close it is to Choctaw and things to do in the area! I 10/10 recommend this home for a lovely stay !!! it also comes with a cute puppy to love on!!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is a hidden gem! It is beautifully decorated with farmhouse style decor with sweet personalized pieces such as a “welcome Sydne & guests” sign in the front, plus fresh eggs from their chickens on the counter. Their roaming pup is a sweetheart and the garage gym next door is an awesome touch. Right when you walk in, you’re hit with a wonderful aroma and a pleasant and cozy feel. We will definitely be staying here again - in fact, we’ll make trips to purposefully stay here. Our hosts, James and Erika, were gracious and friendly, as well, and came to welcome us. It’s a beautiful piece of land and so calming yet close to everything you might need! Thank you, again, for hosting our weekend getaway 💗"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"James place was great. Beautifully decorated, much bigger than I thought it would be. Very peaceful location minutes from the casino and all Durant has to offer. Great communication from hosts. I would definitely recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"This is a spectacular place to stay. Very clean, safe, and private area. The home was very well equipped with everything you could possibly need during your stay. Check-In and Check-Out was extremely easy with minimal (if any at all) contact needed. The dirt road to get to the property was in good condition so that was also not a concern for our small car, as thoughtfully listed by the hosts in their description. If you’re going to Choctaw it’s less than 10 minutes away, but unbothered by traffic, lights, noise etc."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family loved our stay here. We enjoyed exploring the property and visiting the chickens, the pup Ranger and the owner. We had a very comfortable stay after a day of travel, the beds and shower were perfect. The house has everything you need and is decorated beautifully. I highly recommend staying at this property!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I were traveling home to San Antonio and stopped here for the night. It was not far off our route but still allowed us to experience a country getaway! We loved our stay here! We were all wishing we could stay longer. The house is beautifully decorated and so comfortable. The fresh eggs in the morning and their sweet dog Ranger were added bonuses😊 We would love to come back sometime for a longer stay. Would absolutely recommend this Airbnb!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed the indoor and outdoor spaces provided. The beds and furniture were comfortable, and the fresh eggs were delicious. We used the pool, the fire pit and didn't quite make it fishing, but we liked that it was an option. We would certainly stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I've only used AirBnB a few times, but this experience is by far the best. The place was so clean and welcoming. We stayed with 2 adults and 3 kiddos. It was an excellent experience. I only wish we had stayed longer than one night so we could explore a little more. We loved having fresh eggs for breakfast. Our favorite part was Ranger, the best little farm dog I've met. Communication with James was timely and easy. I highly recommend this property for a relaxing and homey stay."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent stay. The property is perfectly located. It’s just far enough out in the country to be private and peaceful, but close enough to Durant, Sherman, Dennison, Lake Texoma, and the Choctaw Casino and Resort to provide plenty of options for dinner, family fun, nightlife, outdoor adventures, and more. James was a phenomenal host. He was available and helpful if we needed anything and even provided fresh eggs for breakfast (they were delicious!). The house was beautifully furnished, extremely clean, and super comfortable. We will definitely stay again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable accomodations that presented as described. Hosts were very timely on their responses and would book again.

The dual head shower was AWESOME! We will be back for sure!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Fun place to stay! Most comfortable beds!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,You can expect everything mentioned here. Great place to stay but don’t change the names of the chickens because I’ll be back and I don’t want to confuse them.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely the best home away from home. It was nice, beautiful, and super comfortable."

2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Excellent find! We're originally from California but live in Dallas. Had family from Cali visiting and they wanted to check out Choctaw. Instead of paying for a room at the casino for the six of us we stumbled across this place on airbnb and absolutely loved it. Exceeded our expectations and highly recommend. The hosts communicated well and were very hospitable and their pup Ranger was very friendly and fan favorite!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem! We enjoyed this place so much and hope to stay there again. Very convenient for concerts at Choctaw if you're not the casino type. The dirt road is well traveled and easy to manage, and addresses are marked clearly on mailboxes along the way. The hosts have made this a very comfortable space with lots of thoughtful touches and beautiful modern farmhouse decor. James was friendly and quick to respond, and his dog was so sweet, running from the main house to the guest house late at night to say hi and get some loves, lol. We will check availability on this place every time we return to the area. Well worth the money and simply lovely!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely gorgeous! This home is perfection placed in the most beautiful of places. It is close to all the amenities that you might want, but you would never know it. You can tell that great thought went into this place and it was greatly appreciated. My dad lives in Durant and this will be our go to place to stay. Ranger is an added bonus and our daughter can't wait to come back and play with him."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy Magnolia farmhouse with the comforts of home. Great amenities including fresh eggs and a genuine, friendly farmdog. You can fish in the pond, and make s'mores at the firepit. Also fun to check out the ammonite fossils at Lake Texoma and Eisenhower state park. We did not want to leave. Highly Recommend!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely sublime place, lots of privacy & super nice host. Highly recommended!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Dope
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of five stayed at James's farmhouse for a weekend. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and comfortable. The space was beautifully decorated, perfectly clean, and well equipped. We especially appreciated these special touches: farm fresh eggs, k-cup espresso machine, sounder/night lights in each bedroom, comfortable and spacious beds (one king sized bed, one queen and a handy pack-in-play for our little one), heavy curtains conducive to a good night's rest, and a luxurious shower. Our kids enjoyed getting outside to run and play, visit the chickens (next to the farmhouse), and hanging out at the little playground and trampoline by the pond (which was within walking distance from the farmhouse). If you enjoy dogs, you will love their friendly dog Ranger who will be eager to greet you as you spend time outside. There were multiple hiking options within 30 minutes to an hour away. We chose to spend an afternoon in Denison at Waterloo Lake Regional Park; it was great for our kids (all under age 5). James and his family were outstanding hosts. Five stars!"

Within just a few miles of the Crystal Creek Winery, Casino and Downtown Durant! Double shower! Comfy Beds with high end linens! And the decor was a dream. We didnt slow down long enough for the fire pit and fishing, but next time we will extend our stay! Thank you for an amazing Birthday weekend!"

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The cottage was just as described. Very quiet and peaceful neighborhood in a cute little historic district. Very clean and roomy, comfy beds, and the recliners in the living room are so relaxing! So many personal and thoughtful touches makes you feel right at home. The back porch ambiance was relaxing as well. Perfect location for a weekend at Choctaw Casino, less than 5 min away. Great communication all around. Would definitely recommend. Thank you!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect place for a girls trip and we would stay again!! We had everything we needed to cook and it was decorated beautifully for the season❤️!
A few things I noted:
-The mattresses are very soft!
-The bottom bunk is hard to get into/out of due to the low height. It’s more for a child but I slept there just fine!
-Ice trays are provided, no ice maker or dishwasher.
-It was walking distance to great restaurants and shopping on Main.
-10-15 minute driver to Choctaw!
Thank you Tasha for all of your help and recommendations!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"WOW! This little house is adorable. It’s well appointed for several adults and children. The house is clean, well furnished and very comfortable. I especially loved the closed in back porch. It’s a great, quiet place to sit and enjoy your morning coffee. But what really made our stay spectacular was the host, Tasha. If I could give her more than 5 stars, I would! My daughter has Down syndrome and is on a special needs cheer squad. We were in town for a cheer competition. Tasha really went above and beyond to make our stay special for my daughter and her friend. We will definitely be staying again next year!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a great time at the Choctaw casino. We decided to rent an Airbnb rather than stay at the casino and I’m glad we did! Tasha’s place was cute, clean and relaxing. They even had it decorated beautifully for Valentine’s Day!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,place was amazing! Tasha was very attentive. will definitely stay here again soon!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Tasha was such an awesome host. The cottage was decorated for Christmas and made us feel right at home. Tasha was very responsive and made it clear if we needed anything to just ask. Even though our circumstances for being in town were sad, Tasha's little pink cottage allowed us to congregate as a family during our grieving and reminiscing of our happy memories in private and under one roof. I highly recommend Tasha and any of her places. Thank you Tasha!"

Plenty of room for a family."
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Tasha communicates very well and is super friendly in conversation. The instructions are very clear for the maintenance portion of the house. The interior of the house is very cozy and welcoming and it has a fairly well-stocked kitchen. However, the floors needed a good mopping and the master bath needs a good cleaning (baseboards included). The back porch needs a good refresh - w/ a little finesse, it would be a nice place to have coffee/cocktails. The yard needs some finessing as well, it wasn't very inviting and we're outdoor people, so we like to sit outside for coffee/cocktails. We appreciated having a T.V. in the bedroom; however, we found the mattress to be very uncomfortable, and the bedding definitely needs a refresh. All in all, the stay was OK but w/ some work, it could be so much better!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Place was very cozy and clean! Will book again when I’m in town!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This was an adorable house with a rustic chic charm. Our group of 6 had everything we needed for a nice weekend.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house was just like the pictures, it was great"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our time there and when we will be coming back for reunions and etc., we will always try and book here first!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In the late 1960's and early 1970's my husband and I bought this house...it was our first home in Durant. We were excited to see it had become an airb&b and we'd decided we wanted to spend our 58th wedding anniversary in our old home. My husband died just a couple of months before we could accomplish this, so along with my friends, we decided to have a ""Memories"" party in the Little Pink Cottage...it was amazing! All changes are for the best...all memories are left in tact...and others felt that as well. Many voiced desires to me to extend invitation to others to stay in the Little Pink Cottage. It still has a ""home"" quality and the most exciting thing for me was that it also has such a strong Christian influence everywhere you look...that has not changed either...only gotten better. Thank you for a great stay..my husband would have been thrilled with it as well."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were traveling to Durant to care for a family member who is not well and needed our support. This cottage was just the right place to rest after long days and recharge. I'm happy to report our relative is also doing better!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Such a lovely, welcoming home 🥰"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was great, and the house was so inviting and relaxing! I would definitely recommend this place and will come here again when we visit next. Thank you, Tasha!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little Pink Cottage was a good stay for our girl's weekend. It was nice for each of us to have our own room and it wasn't far from the casino. It wasn't super clean, we did notice the bottom of our feet became black while walking inside and there was a thick layer of dust in all the corners and under the furniture, but it wasn't anything offensive. The host was very kind and really responsive. She had great communication and her recommendations were really organized and helpful. The Ice House restaurant down the street is super close and a great place for dinner. Overall, if you're in the area and don't want to stay at the casino, this is a great option!"

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"The place is beautiful and cozy, we loved it and were very pleased with it. Place is just as it’s described. Tasha you are a great host! Thank you for all the clear information and local suggestions. We would definitely reserve this place again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an adorable home and very comfortable. The host was extremely friendly and helpful. Very relaxing and clean. We had to be in the area because my dad was in the hospital down the road and I wanted a place where my mom could relax after being at the hospital all day. I am so happy I found the Little Pink House. 💕💕💕
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay in the little pink cottage, very cozy and the decor is super cute. We will definitely be back to visit ! 💗"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Little Pink Cottage was Great!! It was peaceful and only a couple blocks away from scenic downtown and wonderful restaurants. Minutes away from the casino.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,We were there very first guest. This place was great. It was decorated very cute! It had everything we need and more! If you are ever in the area this is the perfect place!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Mellisa and her husband are such amazing hosts!! They go far above and beyond what would be expected to make you feel relaxed and enjoy your stay. She really thinks of EVERYTHING!!! There is so much to do on the property we didn't even end up leaving for anything else. Everyone had such a great time we will definitely be booking again the next time we come to Oklahoma for a visit. This was my first Air B&B experience and I highly doubt anyone else could ever live up to the bar Melissa has set.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa's place is truly a hidden gem. So comfy and cozy. Very peaceful atmosphere! I will definitely be staying here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is truly a hidden gem! House was spotless and set up comfy. Melissa has thought of everything! She is a very gracious host! I will definitely be staying here again and again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa has vaulted to the head of the pack for area AirBnbs. This place was exceptional on all fronts, and extremely clean. Completely as advertised and a fantastic stay. Thank you Melissa! BTW - your “little touches” of snacks, coffee, soft drinks etc. are great!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfy beds, clean bathrooms, and peaceful surroundings! Melissa's place was the perfect getaway for us and our dogs :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Melissa is not a super hostess; she is an outstanding one. She provided everything from body and laundry products to games inside and out. Even little snacks. The fenced in yard was great for my dog who could run untethered and chase the cardinal family when they landed on the ground (they were way too fast for her to catch.) I spent one evening on the front swing as the sun was setting and felt like a carefree child. Even the roadrunners introduced themselves (sort of) and the mosquitoes were extra friendly (lol). I have no complaints and only wish it was a little closer the my home in Maryland.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fabulous stay. Everything we needed and more was provided. So comfortable and peaceful, a wonderful place for our family to meet an enjoy each others company. I would recommend to anyone; ladies retreat, family time or couples getting away. You're still close to Durant or the Lake for anything you might want there, but it's so nice to just enjoy the quiet. We will be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The roadrunner resort was a charming, beautiful property. It had plenty of indoor and outdoor games to keep all ages entertained. The fenced areas were great for dogs. The house was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Loved the fire pit and pond. Would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Durant."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"we couldn't ask for anything better than what we experience during our stay, love the place so much that we are looking forward to our next stay and if weather permits we are able to enjoy the outdoors as much."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my favorite Airbnb experience. Everything was so well thought out, from the hand soap to the placement of hooks to the built in storm shelter and the water bottles—a lot of thought and careful attention went into this place. Our dogs loved the yard and the beautiful country surroundings.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying here and it was just as great as the first time! Has everything you could possibly need. Will definitely stay here again this summer!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Didn't want to leave!
We were in town for a concert and decided to make it a weekend trip. We loved this place so much it was nice and quiet, and so peaceful and pet friendly which was a plus for us
It is very clear that the hosts have put a lot of thought into their place and it shows no detail was overlooked! They have a beautiful property and a lot of fun things to do while you are there
This will be our go to whenever we are in Durant."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cute little house provides the perfect get away.
It’s very clean and welcoming. There’s so much to do from the many games inside the house, to the cornhole, volleyball, fishing, giant Jenga, badminton, and of course exploring the land.
The kitchen is well stocked with everything necessary for our stay as well fresh eggs, bottled water, and soda. Oh, and the coffee bar.
Super cute home that we’ll definitely return to."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The place was perfect for our trip. Looked just like the pictures and our entire group felt right at home. Melissa was very good at responding in a timely manner and very helpful whenever we reached out. If I was ever staying in the area again I would definitely book another stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hands down the nicest people in the world. It's super quiet and peaceful. tons of games for the kids and adults. The pond has some nice sunsets and plenty of easy to catch fish for the kiddos. Some worms and a bobber and you will be tired of taking off the little catfish before the kids get tired of it. the story of the house, the tile, and the name I will leave a mystery until you rent it, but really makes it feel like home. I've worked on the road for many man years if I get close to this place I will hands down drive an hr each way to work to stay here."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were there for a conference at the casino. We wanted to bring our dogs with us because it was for 4 days. Thank goodness we found the roadrunner! Melissa thought of everything! It was all of the small touches that made it feel like home. She had snacks, water, fresh eggs, etc. The house was super clean and the beds were very comfortable. There were plenty of extra linens. No carpet in the house which makes it nice when you have pets. We saw some rabbits and a roadrunner while we were there. You can feed the fish in the pond. I wish we would’ve had more time to walk the property. It was very peaceful there. We will definitely be back! Definitely better to stay there than the casino. Thanks for everything Melissa!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful clean home with lots of amenities.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was by far the best airbnb experience we’ve had! The house was extremely clean and Melissa added so many thoughtful touches to the house. We loved everything about this place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Will definitely be staying here again! Beautiful, spacious house. The pictures on the listing don’t even do it justice! The house is huge with so much space in every room. Not only do they have all amenities, there was water and fresh eggs for us too! They go above and beyond for their guests!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Melissa was a great host. The Roadrunner Retreat and surrounding property was just as described, SUPER clean and so peaceful. Super easy checkin and access to the home. Lots of simplicity with thoughtful amenities and loved the personal story tied to this place. A wonderful gated yard for me, my hubs and our (2) doxies to enjoy nature, and nearby pond…while sipping coffee (morning)/wine (evening)…we know the spring and fall will be even more fantastic!
Bonus: The evening of July 4th we saw amazing fireworks.
Plan to return someday with our family. ❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful country feel with everything you need to have good time with family. Loved the coffee bar and the farm fresh eggs were a extra thoughtful treat. We all enjoyed our weekend getaway at the Roadrunner.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this house and property. We definitely would like to rent the place again. We found things that we didn't even know would be included. Melissa is a great host, and she thought of everything."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was so peacefull, and was just beutiful. Enjoyed every minute of our stay. The coffee bar was so nice. We forgot to bring coffee and it was just so great drinking coffee in the morning on the porch, and while fishing. It was worth every penny and will do it again. If your in the Durant OK area it is the perfect place to stay."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This was a great stay! Our group was playing in a disc golf tournament at Craig Parker. The house was clean and full of extra amenities that we enjoyed. We loved fishing for a few minutes one night! Several yard games to play and the land is VERY peaceful. The beds are a little stiff if you are picky about bed softness— more solid memory foam. Close to town but still away from the busy streets! loved it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a super blessed and peaceful stay. Very clean, the place was so relaxing and had most everything you could possibly think of. We will be back very soon!!"
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,Squeaky clean and peaceful. Very relaxing
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place and very quiet, will stay again"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place!! So many thing’s available.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely enjoyed our stay. As soon as we walked in there were instructions and a cool little story about the property. The hosts had farm fresh eggs waiting in the fridge. Everything was clean and the place was comfy. The kiddos enjoyed all of the games there were to play. The property was in a private area just outside of town. Every where we needed to go was a short and easy drive. Check in and check out went smoothly & the hosts responded quickly. We would love to stay again in the summer time.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I took stayed with our 3 young grandchildren and we loved our stay. Melissa and her husband were very attentive to our needs. Very thankful.
The house was very clean and well stocked with coffee, water bottles, soda, and fresh eggs. What wonderful added bonuses!
The location was perfect! I could hear turkeys in the distance and we saw deer by the pond each evening of our stay. Quiet and peaceful.
We definitely recommend staying here if you would like a quiet country setting at a very reasonable price.
James and Anne Marie"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a very awesome stay. Our host made sure we had everything we needed. Everything was just as described. We definitely will be back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a lovely a great place to stay. My family has been in this area for decades so I was excited to see a new house on Airbnb close to them. The beds are on the firm side but comfortable. They provide games and plenty of outdoor activities and the pictures and description match the property well. My family enjoyed our stay and we will definitely be back many times in the future.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect, quiet, safe place for my family. The first fully equipped/stocked kitchen I’ve experienced on air b&b! John noticed the air wasn’t working and notified me immediately and had someone out there to fix it same day, thank goodness! Definitely a great host!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very inviting and a comfortable stay. The neighborhood is a great neighborhood, felt very safe as we walked of the evenings. The home was filled with excellent instructions on everything and had a great list of restaurants that we used. The only thing was trying to park in the garage. I fully understand about leaving a remote and losing them, but it rained during the mid part of the day most of our stay. We had to get out and walk in the rain to the front door so we could go in and raise the garage so we could park out of the weather."
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Great location in Durant. The home accommodated our family, and it was very clean and quiet. If we ever have a need to be in the area, we would be happy to stay again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I chose this house for a combination personal and professional trip. The house was perfect in every way for all of our needs and wants. It has an unbelievably useful office area wherein we could connect with the printer and print! The house was beautiful and clean. Very peaceful and lovely backyard with a nice back porch to sit and enjoy. The master bed was very comfortable. This is important to us because both my husband and I have some back issues. The kitchen has everything you could want. We ended up thinking we would need the house for an extra day because it appeared the business end of our trip might take until the very end of the time we had booked. Our hosts were extremely helpful in helping us get that extra day arranged. Lastly, we left some things upon departure and our hosts were again extremely helpful in getting them. Excellent stay, excellent service, excellent communication, beautiful house! Staying in Durant? Stay here! You will be glad you did!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Our stay was great! The house was beautiful and had everything we needed to make our stay feel like home.
