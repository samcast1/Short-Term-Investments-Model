2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was very comfortable, uncluttered, nicely decorated, and clean, and the beds were very comfortable. I‚Äôd definitely stay again. The only thing was that it was a little cold at night so would have liked to have an extra blanket to use on top of the fairly thin comforter, but there were no extra blankets in the linen closet or anywhere else so bring an extra blanket if you like to sleep with a heavy comforter."

Thank you David!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I stayed at David‚Äôs place because we wanted a place that we will be comfortable as if we were at home and his place checked all the boxes.
We traveled from NYC and David was kind enough for us to do an earlier than usual check in.
The decorations were minimal but tasteful. While looking for an Airbnb I looked for white linen, white towels and great reviews. The place was exactly as shown in pictures. The beds were comfortable, bathrooms were clean and comfy. The kitchen was clean with all amenities. We were even able to used some of the food stuff that was already in the house.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice neighborhood, kids outside playing, families walking their dogs or infants around on the sidewalks. The home is very unassuming from the exterior‚Ä¶clean yard, looks like the rest of the surroundings. Then you walk in and are transported to an social media influencer‚Äôs dream. This is what an Airbnb is about‚Ä¶a home straight out of imagination. The architecture used throughout the interior are choices I wouldn‚Äôt make in my own home, but are what also separates this place from others and makes it a fun experience."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was super helpful and responded quickly, it is a duplex so just be mindful of neighbors. Most of the trim work looks pretty shotty but for the price it is a very nice stay."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We‚Äôve stayed here a couple times. Overall, not a bad experience. However, the attached neighbors are pretty loud at night. We had to sleep in the guest room. The dishes were a little dirty when we showed up, and it seemed like a lot of the kitchen tools/pots and pans had gone missing from when we last stayed. Be careful of leaving your pets out back by themselves. The latch to the gate did not work, and it was very easy for my shepherd to open it up. Some small things throughout the house here and there. Also, the dryer hose wasn‚Äôt hooked up, which could‚Äôve ended in a bad day. But overall not a bad experience."

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was definitely glad they put it in a garbage disposal! The only thing about this pet friendly stay was that the back gate would not latch. So my dog did get out of the backyard. And the bedding didn‚Äôt seem super clean. But the stay was overall, very good."

Overall it was good"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice, there is a discount store nearby. There's just not much to do in Jacksonville."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The neighbor girl did come over and asked if I could take her to her friends house if she cut the grass. I did not feel comfortable having a teenager come ask me to give her a ride.

2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The professionalism of the individuals I interacted with was above reproach. Despite a couple things that weren‚Äôt up to par, they were exceedingly speedy when rectifying our problems. Polite, clear communication made many problems easy to solve. The ONLY problem was a few cockroaches, but they were quick to offer us a different spot to stay without question. You can‚Äôt stop nature, and they did everything in their power to help our stay remain positive. Had it not been for the roaches, they would‚Äôve gotten 5 stars across the board from us. I wouldn‚Äôt go back to that home, but I would go back to those hosts. Outstanding group of people."
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the house. Very clean! Would recommend to others

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the coolest places I have stayed. I can‚Äôt even say I felt right at home but that‚Äôs only because S L Rental‚Äôs Airbnb is much cooler than my home. Very nice, clean kitchen. Massive TV in the living room with cool LED lights in the living room and bedroom. Would definitely stay here again üëçüèº"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice. We had to reach out to host and request the arrival instructions with code to house. After an hour and 3 attempts at contact they did finally message us. The place was comfortable, clean, and easy to find. We had trouble with the sink and reached out about it but didn‚Äôt get it fixed while we were there. So we ended up not using kitchen which was a bummer cause I like to save some money and not eat out all the time. Also we went to watch a movie on Netflix and it told us someone else was using that account at that time. Overall if the host fixed the kitchen issue and would be prompt on getting lock codes out before arrival day it would be a 5. But I just didn‚Äôt feel a connection with this host like I have with previous. Not very responsive."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, conveniently located near town. Very unique space, with a nice fenced in backyard. The home smelled very strong of air freshener and was overpowering.
I had to message the host twice on checkin day to get our instructions sent over. Host was quick to respond. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved staying here! It smelled clean and awesome hosts. Anytime we had an issue they where responsive. I will say that the neighbor next door would play music really loud all night and there is no dish disposal so the kitchen sink backs up. Because of this I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price paid for. Other than those minor things it was an excellent stay. We would come back for sure!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was real nice and cozy. The beds were very comfortable. I really appreciate the host for allowing me to stay an extra night after I forgot to request an extension and they were very understanding even after I told them that I had to check into Camp Geiger later in the day

The house has a lot of space with luxurious amenities, including a spacious common area and three cozy bedrooms. The festive and inviting back porch was neat, perfect for evening relaxation.
Daniel is an amazing host. He is proactive, responsive, and very thoughtful. His personal touches were heart-felt and special to my family. When we walked into the house, we were welcomed by Christmas trees and a holiday wreath, already lit up and festive. What an incredible welcome. It set the tone for the rest of our stay.
I wholeheartedly recommend this home and eagerly anticipate our return. A heartfelt thanks to Daniel for an unforgettable experience."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel was an absolutely amazing host. His wonderful communication made check in a breeze and he was quick to respond to any issues or concerns. The pictures do not do this place justice!! It is absolutely beautiful. and that goes for everything, from the outdoor patio, to the indoor patio, to each room of the home itself. I was able to cook my entire thanksgiving feast in his kitchen. I brought many things from my own kitchen with me, as I was not sure what his kitchen would have in it. However, I ended up needing very little of what I brought as his kitchen was plenty stocked with all sorts of kitchen amenities and tools. The home was warm and inviting and Daniel was an excellent host. I truly can't say enough good things about him and his home. This is the only place we'll be staying when we're in town. I'm certain you won't regret your stay either :)"

Thank you again for sharing your beautiful home with us.

Daniel went above and beyond to make our stay convenient and comfortable, he even had the cleaning person bring over brand new beach towels and chairs that were mistakenly taken by the previous guests. Whenever I would message with a question, his response was prompt, courteous and helpful. The beds are super comfortable, and the rooms are very spacious.

In addition to the beautiful decorating and the soft music playing when we entered 107 Foxberry Place, we immediately fell in love with the outdoor space. The screened porch was our favorite hang out! What made the rear outdoor area so special was the privacy, which is very unusual in a recently developed area. The kitchen is well-equipped for making a family meal, living /dining area is comfortably accommodating and beds and bath offer relaxation in the appointments.
The owners checked in on us shortly after we arrived , and were very responsive to our questions and needs. We met a few neighbors that we found to be welcoming and friendly.
Due to the weather we didn‚Äôt get to use the deck and the pool, but know that other guests will enjoy these amenities.
Thank you, Daniel and Gissel."

No serving dishes, no glasses, just 4 coffee cups . Couldn't have leftovers. IThe refrigerator did not get cold at all. If there was an extra piece of wood, they put it on the wall for decoration.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay here."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My stay was great, house was clean and I felt very comfortable. The only thing I can suggest is if you someone is staying there with a pet, make sure that the little fenced in yard is maintained. The grass was up to almost my knee until it rained. Honestly that was the most important amentity I was looking for when I booked it. Also, not being from the area, I'm not sure what kind of wildlife there is. (Meaning insects or snakes things like that.) I didn't trust letting my dog out there. I made her stay on the leash and only let her go as far as in front of the screendoor. Other then that it was perfect!"

I found this place and a couple others. I signed in and signed up for two days stay here. Then there came the wait for approval, which was sent to me in less than 5 minutes, maybe less! They sent me the door code and a very friendly message. We went there and checked ourselves in. The place smelled so good. The kitchen was stocked with items to use to cook, but not very many items to eat. The dishes appeared to be spotless, as well as the kitchen and living room area. The downstairs half bathroom was clean and well stocked with hand soap and toilet paper. My daughter loved the automatic soap dispenser, which is in every bathroom, and this place has 3! Upstairs, there are 2 rooms with 1 queen bed and 2 full bathrooms! Also well stocked and super clean! Bed were comfortable. Loved the area, friendly neighbors. Don‚Äôt wait to book!"

This neighborhood is very historic and has many small waterfront parks to explore. Biking around is my thing and it was an easy neighborhood waterfront explore on day one.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Suzanne‚Äôs attention to detail was outstanding! I greatly overpacked because she had all the extras I could have needed. Whose place has a sound machine to ensure you sleep well? Suzanne‚Äôs does! And don‚Äôt get me started on the luxurious sheets and towels!!! I even checked out the brand name they were so nice.
The only issue I could imagine anyone having is if they are tall. The ceiling is slanted since it‚Äôs an upstairs apartment, but it was perfect for me. I would definitely stay here again! I was traveling by myself and felt very safe as she lives on the premises and to access the apartment you enter a gate that leads into her backyard. The privacy fence is tall enough that it‚Äôs truly private from neighbors.
It was a great place to stay in Jacksonville and Suzanne was happy to make restaurant recommendations upon my request. Trust the reviews! Well done, Suzanne!"

Suzanne is a super host, indeed! Highly recommend for a serene stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is charming and Suzanne is so sweet and thoughtful.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a very cozy stay! Wish it was available all the time. Would definitely stay here again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Suzanne's place a couple different times now and will continue to stay here when I come to town. It is priced right and she does an amazing job preparing the place. Cleanliness, and accommodations including extra goodies are always prepared. Suzanne is always responsive communicating and very accommodating when staying. Hight recommended."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have been to many AIRBNB's all over the country but when we arrived at Suzanne's place we felt like we were home. Not only was it beautiful outside and in a beautiful neighborhood, as soon as you walked in it was so inviting. Everything was in its place, plenty of fresh clean towels, every item you would ever need in the bathroom and kitchen. Suzanne even had two robes for us and snacks. It was absolutely the BEST AIRBNB we have ever been to. And Suzanne is such a pleasure to talk to, she felt like an old friend. She was so helpful in sharing withus about the best places to go in the area and told us about the beach at Camp Lejuene, which we were visiting for a ceremony. We highly recommend Suzanne's place to anyone who wants a ""feels like home"" experience. We will definitely return in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suzanne was a gracious host that gave us all the direction we asked for in a timely manner. The place was fabulous! Had a large refrigerator, oven to cook , lots of amenities that you might need(Just in case). She had a lot of everything available Just In Case. I was very impressed with her place. The only thing is don't be too tall unless you want to do a lot of squats. My friend was 6'3"" and really had to be very careful not to hit his head. But she said she's had a 7' 0"" man in there before and he never complained. We didn't either-The place is so cute and well decorated-You'll love it!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First thing is that Suzanne was an amazing host. Communicated very well, made sure we had everything we needed, and offered information as to the local area and what to do. The space was perfect for my wife and I. Lots of room, and was very clean. For the time we were there, Suzanne was there if we needed anything at all. Pretty much everything you needed was in that place minus your food and drink of choice. Bathroom was cozy and stocked with toiletries. Plenty of lighting and the sitting area with tv was nice to enjoy some games! There is a sitting area out back with nice lighting to enjoy the evenings. Over all, I have nothing negative to say about the Marine Courtyard. If I come back this way, I will definitely book again. Thank you so much for your hospitality."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we arrived, I had the clear sense this would be a FIVE STAR experience - and it most definitely WAS! Suzanne was always responsive, the room was better than the photos let on, and the host had thought of all the perfect details to make the stay enjoyable for guests. The back patio area was a great private spot to unwind outside, the bed was amazingly comfortable, and the kitchen was fantastic for our needs. My wife and I enjoyed the park and boardwalks at the nature center nearby - both just a short stroll away - and the location was extremely walkable. Would highly recommend this place for short or even longer term stays."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Without a doubt, we'll return to this property. Suzanne was the most gracious host. The home had everything one could need when away. It was so warm, super clean, and cozy. The amenities were top-notch. I've not stayed at an air B&B with softer towels than the ones provided. The bed and bedding made for a wonderful night's rest. We had one question upon our arrival about the house. Within minutes, Suzanne and her husband responded and met the request. I told her I was cold natured and needed a lot to warm. My hubby and I left to get dinner. When we returned, there was an electric blanket and a new pair of foot warmers at our door. She set the bar on hospitality. That is something money can't buy but is worth more than anything. Again, we'll certainly stay again when we come back to visit our Marine. Thank you, Suzanne and family, for opening your home to us. The Sanders, from Nashville, TN"

She answered any questions we had and her response time was super fast. The place was amazing! Felt just like home and was very comfortable. Had everything we needed for our stay plus more. The air conditioning was super cold which is perfect because my wife and I get hot easily. Multiple ceiling fans and also an oscillating fan which is a plus because we like a lot of noise at night.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice lady, very easy check-in and out, overall great experience."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host ( Suzanne ) was very accommodating, we traveled a very long way to see our son graduate from his schooling on the New River Air Station. By the time we finally got into town we had already been up / awake and in transit for about 24hrs. The stated check-in time i believe was 4pm..i messaged her to ask if it would be ok if we checked in 4 hrs earlier at 12:00 noon, Suzanne was very quick to reply and she said that would be fine. In advance of our arrival she turned on the AC for us so that the room would be nice and cool. Everything about the room was in excellent condition, the bed was very comfortable, everything was very clean. Everything you could possibly need to survive is inside of the unit. Cooking, cleaning, bathroom supplies, linens, towels etc, etc. The TV is a ""smart TV"" and it also has a Firestick hooked up to it, so you can have access to all kinds of programming. Theres a strong wi-fi signal in the unit.
The neighborhood is excellent, very nice homes, everyone seems to take pride in ownership. The proximity to MCAS New River and Camp Lejeune and all of the things that Jacksonville offer could not be better. The room is above a detached garage that is next to the owners residence. We never heard so much as a peep from anyone at the house, nor any road noise. The street directly in front of the house has a very low volume of traffic, and its in a upper end residential area, so the speed limit is slow and in general the folks driving by tend to be more mature and respectful of their neighbors, hence we never heard any racket coming from the street. Excellent stay 10 out of 10!"

We really loved the room. It was beautifully appointed, spacious, clean, well-lighted and accommodating. The linen was especially luxurious. We commented that this was like a luxury hotel room that felt just like home.
The coffee in the morning we brewed allowed us to slowly and luxuriously start the day. The USMC cups were a great touch and shows the care the hosts put into preparing the room. We didn't want to leave that morning and wish we could have stayed for several more days.
There is an inviting courtyard down the stairs from the large 2nd floor room. The separate outside stairway and entrance made coming and going a breeze.
We couldn't recommend this AirBnB more highly. It completely exceeded our expectations."

Nice neighborhood, friendly hosts, and they provided tips for restaurants where we could get good food within walking distance. They also provided basic necessities like shampoo, body wash, coffee, creamer, etc.. The unit was much bigger than expected, very cute, and very clean!

It is in a great location, obviously close to Camp Lejeune, but there are a couple of really nice beaches within 30-40 minutes away. The neighborbood was very quiet and well kept. Keani stayed in contact, was quick to respond, and even reached out to ensure everything was ok and if we needed anything. This would be a great place to stay whether you are visiting family/friends in the military or wanting a beach vacation away from the busy beach resort towns. I would highly recommend this if you are going to the Jacksonville area any time soon! I would give 10 stars if I could!"

Pros: close to western blvd, easy to find, washer and dryer, pool table for entertainment, very responsive host. Cons: master tv was extremely slow and we could not use it, neither bathroom had towel racks on the walls (one of which looked like it was ripped out of the wall). Otherwise, great experience!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was ideal for our visit to Jacksonville NC. It provided the space, especially the back yard, for play time with grandchildren.

The house was very comfortable for us (my two parents, my wife and I, and our daughter). We bought some things just out of preference, but they have everything you need. Everything in the kitchen is labeled so it's very easy to find. They even had some goodies (some food in the fridge/pantry, cooking spices/condiments, coffee/K-Cup machine) so I didn't have to go buy a bunch of stuff. Overall, we had a great time.

We were surprised at some of the stuff that was already in the home.We did our own food shopping at a few of the many near by stores(less than 10 minute drive.) We Cooked our own food and the house had all the stuff we needed to do so. The house is only 10 minute drive to get to the Marine Corps base. Which was our destination.

It‚Äôs in the perfect location to be away from the center of town, but not too far that you feel like you‚Äôre driving everywhere for simple essentials.

The pool table is a plus if you have time to use it. Close to many things. We recommend the ""Brewed Downtown"" for your morning coffee and breakfast.
The place is exceptionally clean...a little heavy on the fragrance. The back patio and seating is a wonderful outdoor oasis. A place to enjoy a quiet evening of downtime and rejuvenation. Our only negative is this is not a place for the physically challenged. Seating is low and hard to get out of. All things considered, we enjoyed our stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Outstanding place to stay very clean and close to restaurants and shops. Will definitely reserve again.

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying here was a great option for our family with young children, especially compared to a hotel room where I would always be shushing them! We visited the nearby park several times
The only thing we would have enjoyed would be a binder with helpful information- where things are in the home, what to do with trash/linens, and nearby restaurants and things to do. Overall it was a great stay."

It‚Äôs super clean! I walked out back and took my daughter to the park. It‚Äôs close by EVERYTHING! I have no complaints at all.

North Topsail, Surf City, Topsail, Emerald Isle, Indian Beach, and Atlantic Beach, all within a pretty short car ride. But what sold us was that the cost of this apartment was a fraction of what it would have cost to stay anywhere on the NC Coast. Well worth a short car ride for those who are on a budget."
