2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay on their farm. Quiet, comfortable, plenty of space and feels like home. I enjoyed the country setting being right on the edge of Harrisonburg. Easy location and nicely furnished. Full kitchen area if you want to cook, which we did plenty of room for us and my kids came over to eat dinner with us.
They have a little toy box for kids. Some games and a puzzle if you just want to relax inside. This was my second stay and would stay again!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for activities in Harrisonburg: close to the action but secluded and beautiful. Would definitely stay there again. Happy cows!

We would definitely plan to stay at Glendora Farms when traveling through Harrisonburg again!"

Already booked to stay again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures don't due this place justice. Every direction you turned was beautiful. In the country, rolling hills, yet only a mile from restaurants and conveniences. The place was super cozy and quiet, adorably decorated and clean. Shenendoah National Park within a half hour's drive, so great hiking, great breweries, great coffee shops, etc.
We loved it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,a grt place for the price. sure will come back
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay for my partner and I, Bryce and Myron were super helpful and friendly.

Definitely recommend this stay, as well as purchasing something from the barn."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved, loved, loved Our stay on the farm! We stayed for a few days to celebrate Matts 30th birthday! Close to downtown and the local breweries but far enough away from noise! We bought some steaks from the barn and they were amazing!!! Plus seeing all the cows and the beautiful countryside was a plus! Everything was so clean and nice. We where worried that there would be a lot of noise because it’s a downstairs apartment but you would of never known anyone was home!
Thanks again, definitely will be coming back:)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A little slice of heaven far away from home! Stunning views and cute cows roaming around outside. The apartment was spacious and very clean had all the ammenities of home
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it is great! its super quiet!! its private enough to not have any noise at night but close enough to downtonw.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The only problem was that we didn't receive a code from Airbnb. When I texted Bryce, he soon responded with the code. The apartment was nicely done and clean. I was not disappointed. I would stay there again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hilltop was super clean and comfortable. We only stayed one night, but it would be a great place for an extended stay. And the absolute best part--the mountain views. Loved drinking my coffee at the kitchen table, looking out at the stunning landscape."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed an overnight stay at this lovely apartment overlooking the farm hillside with mountains in the distance. Everything was just as pictured and our host was most accommodating. Highly recommend. Hope to come back for longer visit sometime.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the location, great place to stay and enjoyed some cows!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Close to town but small farm community

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay - was blown away pulling up the driveway. Bryce and his family were very hospitable and responsive. Highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The views here are stunning!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed this place for our second stay. It has a spectacular view from its hilltop to the surrounding valley, superb in snow. More importantly for us it is sparkling clean, easy to get to, private and safe. Harrisonburg is a nice town with lots of good restaurants and a homey feel. We will most likely stay here again on our treks to see family in Philadelphia."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great night on the farm, the view is incredible and the steaks we arranged to have left in the fridge were delicious!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, very spacious!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great and friendly hosts. The area is beautiful.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As already indicated briefly: the view alone is well worth the price. The one sunrise was almost beyond belief--awesome! The ""apartment"" is spacious and could probably be advertised as such. The ""laundry"" was so nice and full-sized (though we didn't need it). The kitchen and eating equipment was wonderful and it even had a double-door frig. The sayings on the walls, etc. indicate that these owners are Bible believing folks but not overdone.
Also as already indicated briefly: the macadem driveway was a bit muddy--after the rain...due to cows, etc. And the well done steps down to the lovely apartment might be improved with a railing."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views! I loved being in the country but still being just outside the city limits and only minutes from everything. The space was clean, had everything I needed and felt home-like. I always love having a washer and dryer in the unit, makes traveling so much easier."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place to stay! The place itself feels very private, it also has amazing views and the hosts cows love to say hello. I also love that it’s within 5-10 minutes of downtown Harrisonburg. It gives you the feeling of a private getaway but with options to go out without driving a further distance. Bryce was super nice and responsive, we also bought some breakfast sausage and steaks to make during our stay from their business and I highly recommend trying it! Would definitely consider staying again if I’m in the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very beautiful stay. Would stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a good place, nice view"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning, friendly hosts, and we will absolutely stay again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great experience - beautiful view - nice space - would definitely stay here again.
I could go on in more detail, but wouldn't be saying anything different than the other reviews - this is a great space, with easy access to Harrisonburg. I highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place with LOTS of space and a great view. Bryce was a very accomodating host and was great to chat with when we crossed paths.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We were way later getting in than anticipated but Bryce’s directions and instructions were perfect. Everything outside was well lit and easy to access. We had a short but peaceful stay and the views once daylight hit were amazing. Gorgeous! Highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Bryce and the family are AMAZING hosts. This place is the best. We are already planning our trip back to the farm! The place itself is cozy and modern. The views of the hillsides are incredible. The host family is hospitable and warm. We got great food from the farm and recommendations for local restaurants and activities. The WiFi works well for remote workers. We stayed here for over 1 month, and we're so happy we did. The check-in and check-out process is seamless with our own door code: so no keys are required. There is plenty of space for parking. The location is close to all services, groceries, and a short trip to downtown. This Airbnb is a 10 out of 5. It is absolutely worth every penny of the price!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best experience - the place is a diamond in the ruff. Beautiful scenery, exceptionally clean, and great communication."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay, beautiful location, very clean and cozy."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have stayed in many airbnbs, and this is by far the best one to date. The view was breathtaking, the atmosphere was calming and peaceful, the apartment itself was spacious, clean, and welcoming. My partner and I enjoyed our stay thoroughly, and plan to come back again! Thank you so much to our hosts for having us!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great communication and great location. This place is underpriced, in my opinion (I’m not complaining!). Thanks to Bryce for a great stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only were able to stay 1 night but hope to stay here again sometime.
The bed was comfortable, bathroom and kitchen had everything we needed.
Bryce was a great host and we even had a chance to meet him at the Harrisonburg Farmer's Market (and meet his dad on the way in and out - ""had"" to buy some of their grass fed beef at the small shop on their farm.) Also highly recommend the bread from their neighbor (Mill Song Bakery!)
As everyone also notes, the view is so so pretty - and it's fun to be on a property with such a nice family including grandkids."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment near the center of Harrisonburg (car ride) with everything you need! With a fantastic view!! Host is quick to respond.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had a great time staying there. We ordered steak and patties from the farm and we were able to get it from the freezer directly in the apartment at our convenience after check in. The marbling on the ribeye was amazing.
Nothing beats waking up to that hill top view. I'd stay there again 100%. Amazing place to relax. Very quiet, clean, and peaceful. Incredibly spacious rooms, you won't find a better deal in the area."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great space for a couple’s getaway. The view is beautiful!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Look no further than this beautiful farm house for the perfect stay. From the beautiful view to the perfect simplicity and attention to detail, this is one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. I even had the pleasure to meet Bryce and his family and they were a delight. Stop looking, you've struck gold!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bryce's place was lovely. We were joust overnight while traveling, but it was relaxing and perfect!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We would highly recommend staying here! Close to the amenities of the city, but quiet and peaceful with gorgeous views! We hope to come back!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was absolutely lovely staying here. Beautiful views, quiet, kind and flexible owners, as described, and exactly what we needed. Highly recommend :) thanks again for sharing your space, Bryce!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Glendore Farm is worth the price if for nothing more than the incredible view. Throw in the spacious, clean, and comfortable apartment, and you have a winner. We stay in the area 2 or 3 times a year and no doubt we will book Bryce's place again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our quick stay. It was very easy in and out. The space and view was wonderful.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My partner and I wanted to explore the Shenandoah Valley and stayed at the Airbnb for a month while working remotely. The internet was very reliable and the place had everything we needed and was very clean. We put the kitchen to good use and had all the necessary items to make our meals. The hosts were very respectful and attentive, they even apologized for making noise while their family visited for the holidays (which we totally understood, but still very much appreciated them checking in)! In terms of the views, they speak for themselves. We loved waking up to the beautiful mountains and cows roaming the farm. If we are ever in the area again, this will be the only place I will be looking to stay again in!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Place was beautiful. My family and I really enjoyed it. Everything we needes was there.!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just stay here. The apartment is huge and gorgeous, the views are incredible, the farm is awesome and the hosts are kind and attentive. Harrisonburg is charming, the whole thing- I'm running out of ways to describe how lovely the apartment is so just stay there and see for yourself. Can't wait to come back for a longer stay next time!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space is wonderful with a great view! Great amenities in a beautiful hilltop location.
2021-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view. Great space.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect spot. 5 minutes from downtown, clean, and private. Even though it was a basement apartment, you would never it was apart of the house. Definitely recommend"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pros
- Unmatched view! It was gorgeous! Try to be there during the day so you can watch the world go by. They even had binoculars near the main window!
- Quiet and comfortable.
- Everything looked new and clean.
- The apartment was extremely well-equipped. We gave the kitchen a good workout, and everything went well! Every small and large appliance we could have needed was there, with the exception of a dishwasher.
- Tastefully decorated, with beautiful and clever touches all over the place.
- Nice shower.
- Great communication with the hosts. We never saw them, but they were very accommodating to our wishes.
Information
The mattress was soft, like a cloud. If that's good for you, you'll love it! The bed also had a down comforter/duvet. :-)
The tall kitchen table seats three; they have plates and bowls for four; and the living room seats four.
Cons
None! This place is fantastic!"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Appreciated our stay here! The scenery was beautiful & the cows watching us pass on the driveway was quite cute & amusing! The unit had essentials for the stay and the check in process was very easy.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The view of the mountains was wonderful.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All worth it for the view alone! Enjoyed the farm fresh eggs as well and stocked up on some beef. Very close to historical downtown area of Harrisonburg.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is just as if not better than advertised! Kitchen is very well stocked, apartment was quiet and peaceful and huge! I could live there full time.
Having the washer and dryer was convenient as I’ve been on a month long road trip, the location is outside of town but close enough for errands or a night out. Enjoyed my stay and wish I had known about this place sooner."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the beat weekend ever! The hilltop apartment was perfect for our stay. It let me cook a home cooked meal for my college freshman that was missing mom’s lasagna and allowed us to spend some time together outside feeding the chickens and watching cows. Bryce helped us with buying some delicious steaks before we left. We look forward to our next stay at the hilltop apartment!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was such a wonderful stay we wish we could have stayed longer! We're hoping to make it back again. Please know that the cows are ""out"" but they are supposed to be. We were concerned when we saw one next to the driveway but they are kept in by the metal grates you drive over! It's very cool and you get to see them pretty up close first thing in the morning."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at Glendor Farms because I needed a little getaway as I work remotely! I absolutely love the apartment and the view. It’s so peaceful and quiet and relaxing but a five minute drive from downtown. I always appreciate how clean and comfortable the space is. And of course the farm fresh eggs and lots of coffee. Thanks Bruce!!! I’m sure I’ll be back a bunch.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an excellant choice for us. The location was convenient; privacy was great; the view is wonderful! The furnishings and appliances are very clean and up-to-date. We would definitely recommend Hilltop Apartment.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce's hilltop apartment is amazing! I cannot imagine having a better view of the surrounding mountains. The space was very clean, comfortable and well-kept. He had everything that we could have needed for our stay, including farm fresh eggs in the fridge, which we thoroughly enjoyed for breakfast. Communication responses were quick and Bryce answered all of our questions. We also purchased some meat from the farm and are looking forward to enjoying that very soon. I would highly recommend staying here and we look forward to booking with him the next time we are in town."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely spot! Convenient to town but with a country feel and gorgeous views. It was a treat to have country fresh eggs for breakfast (waiting in the fridge) then sip coffee while watching the sun rise over the mountains and the cattle graze in the field. The apartment is comfortable, with a full kitchen and nice living area. The self check-in is nice when traveling a distance and not sure of arrival time. Appreciated the quiet and privacy of this location. Thanks for sharing your beautiful and comfortable space with us, Bryce! (thanks to the chickens too!)"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Coming from a big city to a small town, we didn’t know where to stay. This place was one for the books! It was home away from home and we would recommend it to those who wants to be in a quiet place with a nice view. If you are there when the sun is setting, you could even see the fireflies in the fields!!! It was very pretty considering I’ve never seen them in person. Only an 8 minute drive to downtown Harrisonburg. Another plus is that the sausage that was provided during our stay was really delicious. Thank you again to our host Bryce!"

Came here on a road trip back from TN to visit distant family. My friend and I needed a night to just relax on our way back to NJ and this was the perfect retreat! Place is stocked with towels, coffee, water and even food. Nice touches! Thank you so much!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing spot to stay. The sunset and views here are second to none. Simply amazing. This stay hit the spot for us in our motorcycle trip. - The town if Harrisburg is very quaint. We are at The Chop House per recommendation from host and it truly was one of the best meals we’ve had out in a long time. Stay here, period. The location and views are too notch, great place to stay, and the host was great."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was great, view was amazing. No picture will ever do the view justice. Great location.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great place. We were in town for graduation. This was a lovely quiet place to escape to after the busyness of the day. The view cannot be beat, especially so close to town. The eggs and sausage were a real treat."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was exactly what we’d hoped it would be, and more. Clean, convenient, and just what we needed for our son’s graduation at JMU. The view was amazing, and Bryce was quick to respond to all inquiries. Would definitely recommend!!"

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely stay, just what our family needed! Wonderful host family, a very clean and comfortable apartment and an incredible view. Our son loved the cows and the swingset. RIght on the edge of town but felt like it was miles into the peaceful countryside. We'll definitely have another getaway here."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Would definitely recommend.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a memorable stay! The apartment was perfect, the view was spectacular! We were able to see the sun set and rise over the mountains! The farm was beautiful! We were treated to orange juice, farm fresh eggs and sausage waiting in the fridge for breakfast!
The bed was so comfortable and everything needed was available! You have to check out their store right at the farm! We bought some of their farm raised beef and sausage! Couldn’t ask for a better way to end our trip! 🤩💫
Thank you Bryce and Family! 🎈"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Found this gem located close to family whom I visit, and staying here made it feel like more of a vacation. Stunning views and sunset, the bed and linens feel luxurious, and you can wake up to see the mountains from bed. It is so clean and feels homey and comfortable. The farm fresh breakfast ingredients knocked it out of the park and we left feeling full and very happy! We look forward to returning."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment on a farm.
2021-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,truly peaceful.. ☺
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely great experience. Thanks Bryce and family for letting us share of piece of your home.
From the beautiful views on the top of the hill, to the great touches inside the apartment, it checked every box for both myself and my girlfriend.
I wish you and your family the best!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The views from this farm are so peaceful and beautiful. My only caution is it might make you want to quit your day job and buy your own picturesque farm in Virginia.
The apartment was thoughtfully stocked for my visit and the bed was heavenly. I would highly recommend this place!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce is a thoughtful host and quick to respond to your messages. The stay has a gorgeous view of the mountains and sunset. The place was clean and the kitchen was well stocked with table settings and cooking utensils. The eggs and sausage he provided made for a delicious breakfast. We ended up buying some fresh ground beef from the farm before we left. On our visit we went snowboarding at Massanutten Resort, visited the Green Valley book fair, and ate at Magnolia's Tacos & Tequila Bar and Heritage Bakery. Bryce also has a wonderful list of suggested places to visit. We would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous Airbnb and it was a great spot to go and explore the nearby Shenandoah mountains! Michael was extremely responsive and very helpful from reservation to check out! Definitely highly recommend!! 5 stars!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! The chairs on the porch and the view made for such a relaxing time. We ate at a few places downtown and spent the day at the Lavender Farm and winery! Definitely a must if you are in the area for a few days! It was nice and clean and super cozy! Felt right at home.. and couldn’t have asked for a better stay! We will definitely be back and recommend to friends and family!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely getaway at Summit Escape. The space was perfect for us. Check in and out was so simple. The view was beautiful! I hope to visit again soon. Thanks for a lovely time.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay! The views were breathtaking and felt like being away from everything, yet close enough to the exciting, vibing city ! Our daughter adored the swinging chairs on the deck and loved to ""moo"" back at the happy cows in the area! The local coffee from Merge was wonderful - we stopped at the shop and bought some to bring home with us! The place was so clean and cozy and felt like a home away from home. Cory (Michael's puddle mix) was adorable and friendly and my daughter loved getting to meet him and hang out with him. Cannot wait to come back to the area and will definitely stay no where else except for Summit Escape."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! The view is beautiful and if you’re trying to stay in a quiet, peaceful area not directly in town this place is for you. The bed was really comfortable and much needed after a long day of exploring. Michael is an awesome host and provides a link with lots of recommendations in the area, a basket with welcome snacks, and even freshly ground coffee prior to your arrival from a local coffee place if you’re a coffee drinker. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay and more caring hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderfully peaceful, grand views, lovely neighborhood and neighbors, beautiful gardens. Couldn’t have asked for more. Exceeded expectations."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We greatly enjoyed our stay! You could not ask for better views. We only wish it wasn’t as windy this weekend so we could have enjoyed the deck a bit more! Close to great restaurants and downtown, which made it perfectly convenient for us. Great spot for a weekend away, had everything we needed and more at the Airbnb. Thoughtfully stocked and very clean. Thanks for having us!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Summit Escape was an amazing place to stay! Michael was a great host and was proactive with making sure we had everything we needed. The pack n play and baby bath tub made our first family trip with a 6month old so smooth! There were so many small details that showed that Michael wants his guests to feel comfortable! (Like a sound machine, first aid kit, games and books). The view on the balcony is amazing and the hammock chairs were so comfortable! They provided lots of recommendations on things to do and local places to eat which was so nice. Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view is STUNNING and it felt private and peaceful despite being close to many restaurants and local shops.

I never wanted to leave the porch. Michael was an exceptional host and thinks of everything to make the stay worry free and relaxing. We were celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary and we had such a wonderful time exploring the area. We appreciated all Michael's recommendations of places and restaurants to visit. We hope to return in the future and would highly recommend Summit Escape if you are in this area. Thank you for helping us to create wonderful memories!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most pleasant Airbnb’s we’ve ever been to. Felt very safe and found everything in good working order. Furnishings were very comfortable, the porch was awesome (even in the rain), everything was very clean. The only surprise was about 20 steps to climb. However, it was our own entrance into our own space. We did occasionally hear downstairs kitchen sounds and smelled yummy cooking! A wonderful experience. We would definitely return.
Thank you. Glenn and Linda"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Thank you very much!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We're regular visitors to Harrisonburg and wanted a break from hotel stays. We found the perfect alternative in Summit Escape. It is peaceful with spectacular views in 3 directions. It was spotless and comfortable and quiet with everything we needed--reliable wifi, ample options to recharge devices, a coffee maker and almost-full kitchen stocked with snacks and water if we wanted them. We met the host, Michael, and he could not have been more hospitable. Our weather was perfect so we drank in the view and listened to the mockingbirds during those times when we weren't visiting family. Grocery, drug store, and coffee shop all nearby. Just as an FYI, there are outside stairs to get to the unit but they are well-maintained and lit at night. Good signage and a dedicated parking spot make it clear when you arrive that you are at the right spot. We'll be back without a doubt. Thanks, Mike and Jen."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful two night stay for my birthday weekend! It’s tucked away up at the top of hill. The fresh air and mooing of cows below is so relax and fun. I can’t wait to come back! And the beanbag is definitely in my top three of favorite things at the escape!! 11/10 recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a digital nomad, Michael's hilltop escape was exactly what we were looking for. The view is truly breathtaking and turns every day into something special even when you have to work from home. The unit itself is also well equipped with a comfortable bed, a functional small kitchen, clean bathroom with great water pressure, and even a white noise maker for sleeping! As for the outdoor space, the spacious deck is great for yoga, reading in the morning and working with a view. As for the area, Harrisonburg is such a gem! There are excellent breweries, cideries, and restaurants. There are trails as close as 30 minutes away. As for the hosts, I was so pleased with Michael's communication and his hospitality. Thank you so much! What a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutelyloved this place
It was honestly the cleanest place we've stayed at thus far, the scenery was incredible, and the local restaurants and things to do were awesome. Visited the Luray Caverns along with the village and museum on site, the Fajita Factory which is 4 minutes away IS AMAZING, along with the Bar-B-Q Ranch Drive In, phenomenal food and such friendly people. 10/10 would recommend this place, Michael was so great and welcoming!!"

2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Room was very comfortable and the view of the valley off of the patio was beautiful. Grew up in the area and always loved coming home. This time was less of a family trip and more of a getaway so the facilities were perfect for our needs.
Thank you."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Summit Escape. Beautiful views & awesome amenities. The place was well maintained and clean, and the host was both responsive and made himself available for any questions or concerns we may have had. We will be here again!"

We had a safe, convenient parking spot and easy access to the suite. The suite was very cozy and welcoming and immaculately clean! If we had forgotten something, it was there, just in case. The view from the deck (which had great furniture to help you enjoy it) was gorgeous! What a view folks! The only thing missing from this visit was great weather. So, of course, we will visit again the next time we visit our son at JMU. Thank you both for being great hosts. We hope to meet you both next time! ~ Renee and JW."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael answered quickly whenever we needed anything. It was super close to downtown. 5 min drive to the water st garage. It gives you the feeling of not being in town as you look out over the valley, but you’re just a very quick drive to downtown and JMU. The deck was perfect for sitting and reading in the morning while I drank my coffee. We even worked from home on the deck during one of the days. I will definitely be returning here next time I visit."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Easy & comfy stay in a location on the edge of town with incredible views. Easy check-in and good communication. We ended up having an additional kid with us at the last minute and they were very accommodating & flexible, providing extra sleeping arrangement for us.
Water filter would be a nice touch. Very slight smell of cows outside was not a problem for us, more nostalgic than yuck, but if you are really sensitive to that sort of thing, beware. Unlocking the lock-box was a little tricky if you, like me at first, did not read the instructions carefully.
Would definitely stay again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy place with everything needed for a relaxing stay. The views from the deck are beyond words, and the proximity to downtown is unbeatable. Looking forward to returning to returning to Summit Escape on our next visit to Harrisonburg."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved your place. As I shared a few pictures of us at your place, at least 10 people ask for the details! The whole place is well-organized and it seems they put a lot of thought into organizing it. I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Cheers!"

2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this stay for a long weekend away for the first time away as a couple. Its perfectly located close to harrisonburg but far enough away to feel private. The studio was perfect for what we needed. It was very clean and the kitchen had everything we would need. There was a designated parking spot which was wonderful and the path to the stairs and the stairs had been salted after the snow to prevent slips. The view from the balcony was beautiful, i only wish it had been warm enough outside in the hammock chairs. The hosts even had a helpful guide of the area with suggestions on what to do. The only note we had was that because of the placement of the suite we could here at lot of the noise from the rest of the house so light sleepers be aware. Doors opening and closing, faint dog barks etc. On one of the nights of our stay the hosts had what we assume was a game night which was in the room next to the suite. There was a bit of shouting and carrying on. We mostly found it funny but we could see how it could be bothersome to a different kind of guest. They had wrapped up their night before 10pm so not bothersome to our sleep. Overall a fantastic trip and i would recommend this place to anyone"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike was a great host! He’s responsive and his directions/guidelines were clear and easy to understand. The space was cozy and had everything I needed.

The room and bathroom is spacious, the bed comfortable and the kitchen easy to use. There were some extras included in case you forgot something--lots of attention to detail and the instructions were clear and simple.
We really enjoyed sitting on the outside deck in the hammock chairs. Our experience was enhanced by using the ""sky view"" app where you can see the stars, planets and constellations."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael is absolutely amazing! He is friendly, communicative, helpful, and very detailed. He thinks of everything to make the stay as pleasant as possible!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I stayed here for a few days as we explored Shenandoah. It was a great place to come home to after a long day of hiking. And downtown Harrisonburg had lots of great places to eat and drink. The view was the best part and can not be beat for sunsets and star gazing.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay, watching the sunset on the porch was perfect. Michael was super easy to communicate with and very accommodating!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Echoing others here: Mike was a wonderful host--friendly and clear communication, easy stay. The apartment itself is both spacious and cozy, as well as very clean. My husband and I had everything we needed for a week of working remotely while I had meetings in Harrisonburg, and yes, definitely enjoyed the gorgeous views."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Summit far exceeded our expectations. The view was beautiful, the guest suite was sparkling clean and comfortable. The area left a tad bit to be desired. Harrisonburg is beautiful but it’s also a very small town. Lots of outdoorsy stuff to do but not for you if looking to be extravagant. We just wanted some peace, quiet, and relaxation so it was absolutely perfect! This will be our new getaway spot!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a place with a beautiful view, THIS is the place.

Michael was responsive and so hospital. We hope to come back again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't think of a better way to spend my 31st birthday. My boyfriend and I loved looking out at the beautiful view with a mug of tea, walking around Elkhorn Lake and High Knob Tower (both 20 minute drives at most), and getting a delicious meal at Clementine downtown. We hope to return soon and would highly recommend to others."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The view from the balcony is amazing! Very close to lots of good restaurants (especially this amazing coffee shop called Shenandoah Joe). The loft was super clean and the owner was very quick to answer any questions we had and was very helpful in extending our stay. Also, the owner has an adorable dog. 10/10 recommend."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing spot for a getaway! 5 minute drive to downtown Harrisonburg, where there are amazing breweries and food spots. On the weekends there is live music at Pale Fire Brewing company. Its an hour drive to Shenandoah National Park, where we did many hikes and explored many breweries on the way home ( Elkton Brewing Company and Cave Hill Farms Brewery). The Summit Escape Apt has a great balcony with two swings and an amazing view anytime of the day! Very clean space with great amenities! Great host and great communication! Highly recommended for the quality of the space and the location! If you get the chance, visit Luray Caverns and Stable Craft Brewing Company!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very comfortable bungalow with an incredible view facing the West Virginia mountains. Five minute ride to central Harrisonburg. Lots of thoughtful touches made it a very pleasant stay.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! What an awesome view especially with the swinging chairs. Just a few mins from downtown Harrisonburg. They provided a great list of activities, restaurants, etc."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I begin? This location surpassed any of my expectations. Anything that Michael can think of was executed, customized parking signs, the labeled cabinets were my favorite. A basket in the bathroom in case you forgot anything. I just loved the attention to detail. The view was amazing as well! Great location. Hands down best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We LOVED the summit escape for our retreat from the city. View of the mountains is unmatched. Everything you need for an escape!
2021-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice, cozy place for a weekend winter getaway. I liked the separate entrance and parking space for the unit. The host had thought of everything and had all light switches labeled. I enjoyed the local coffee included and heating up takeout in the toaster oven. The shower was amazing and the bed was comfortable. Really nice Airbnb. Thank you Michael et al for the great stay!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have any doubts about this location, let me put your mind at ease. This room is fantastic. The pictures do not do the room justice. First and foremost, the room was spotless and so spacious! The bed was most comfy! The bathroom has little additions like the ceiling heater that make getting out of the shower so much more comfortable (it’s the little things!). The kitchen has everything you need! The view from the balcony is priceless! More importantly, the host is the best host I’ve ever encountered on Airbnb. We had groceries delivered to the room before arriving, and the host was so accommodating. Just book this room! It’s great! Thank you Michael for everything!!!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view from the deck is amazing and Michael was a gracious and attentive host. Loved the place and would recommend a stay!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were fortunate to discover Summit Escape for our visit to Harrisonburg! We planned to visit our son and daughter-in-law and first grandchild; but due to Covid concerns it was best to stay in a separate space. This beautiful apartment is only minutes from their home! Summit Escape is cozy, clean, comfortable and, as others have already shared, the view is AMAZING. The kitchenette was perfect for our breakfast & lunch needs and the bathroom is huge with extra toiletries provided. Michael is a wonderful host; we appreciated that he messaged us to make sure we had everything we needed. If a trip to Harrisonburg is in your future, we highly recommend Summit Escape."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Michael’s place! We loved looking out at the view and all the cows! Some nice added features were the heat lamp in the bathroom and the swings on the porch! We enjoyed hiking High Knob tower trail along the VA/WV border and then spent the afternoon at Swilled Dog cidery in WV! Michael made sure we had everything we needed for our stay and was very quick to reply to any message I sent!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view once we got to top of the stairs was far better than expected! It was completely breathtaking and Michael was a fantastic and thoughtful host.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Summit Escape is a wonderful unit for a weekend away. Although attached to the main house, the separate entrance and large layout made it completely private. The view is outstanding and the owner was wonderful with communication. They even left out some goodies just because it was our anniversary, which was very thoughtful. It was also spotless....The cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed at! Will definitely stay again in the future."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot day enough good things about Michael and this place! The space was so cozy and perfect for a long weekend away. We loved sitting on the hammock swings and taking in the gorgeous view. We enjoyed many local restaurants and shopping, and Michael had a great list of recombinations for us before we got there! Overall a wonderful experience- we would for sure come back again!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Three words: what a view! We had a wonderful time at Michael's place, which was thoroughly cleaned, comfortable, and in a great location. But again, that view...
If you're reading this and on the fence because this is relatively new listing that doesn't have many reviews yet, I can't recommend this spot enough and am thoroughly confident Michael is on the way to superhost. Go visit!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can definitely say that it was one of the best airbnb experience. Michael is so kind, nice and helpful with responsibility, the place is suuuuper clean and neat. Will definitely go back if i visit the town again!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our short stay at Summit Escape. The view is amazing and the space is cozy and clean. Great proximity to downtown Harrisonburg. Michael was extremely hospitable. Would stay again for sure!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, although the walls between the apartment and the rest of the house are very thin, so it wasn’t very quiet."
2020-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Very nice for a weekend getaway. Plan on eating out & nail down exact directions.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael's place is a quaint upper level guest suite of their home with its own entrance. The suite is an open floor plan and you easily walk from living room, bedroom, and kitchen. We stayed here for access to Shenandoah National Park, and after a long day of hiking it was a nice touch to come back and unwind by watching Netflix on the SmartTV. The place was tidy and in order and had hand-sanitizer, masks, and gloves in the kitchen area for use. The kitchen is pretty minimal-- a hot stove with a single pan and a toaster oven for cooking, but plenty of cups , plates, bowls, and cutlery for use. The biggest draw is the deck. You get a gorgeous mountain view you can watch right from the bed, or sit out on the deck in the two swings and sip some coffee and take in the morning with a pal. Perfect stay for a hiker or couple for a short stay."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Booking this guest house with Mike & Jen will not be a mistake. They take beautiful care of the space they rent out & make sure their guests feel comfortable & right at home
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Summit Escape is indeed an escape into nature. The view from the porch is stunning. The swing chairs are a lot of fun. The studio is beautiful and has everything one could need. Everything was pristine too. Michael responded immediately when we had questions. I can absolutely recommend renting this studio apartment and would immediately come back if I need a stay in the Harrisonburg area.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is everything that Michael described. We had a wonderful time there. Will certainly come back if I am in the area.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a peaceful stay in a place surrounded by beauty. It’s spotlessly clean, and an easy drive to downtown and many nature hikes."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael was such a gracious host! He provided amazing suggestions on local trails, wineries and breweries.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute place with a gorgeous view. Incredibly clean, proper cleaning supplies provided given covid, and overall communication was superb!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was such an honor to be the first guest here. The place is just perfect, as it totally feels like an escape into the mountains, yet is in a beatiful, quiet suburb, a 5 min drive from anything you could want. The view from the large, private deck is amazing & mesmerizing; the place is both large AND cozy; the amenities are bountiful; the internet is fantastic. And Michael is the perfect host, who seems like he's been doing this for years. This place is special, and I'll be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily & Gabriel are the most amazing m hosts! They are extremely friendly and will give you all of the best Harrisonburg recs. The views and peaceful atmosphere here cannot be topped. And you will have plenty of privacy.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Emily's place is a gem. From the moment I walked through the door, I felt at home. Emily has thought of everything. I have stayed in many Air B&Bs and this is definitely one of my favorites. I honestly didn't want to leave😀."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Gray house was outstanding. The home was easy to locate and access thanks to Emily's clear instructions. The decor is absolutely beautiful, and everything was spotlessly clean. We felt right at home in the cozy sitting area and enjoyed complimentary snacks, filtered water, tea and coffee from the adorable kitchenette. The beds were comfy and the bathrooms even included little jars of necessities. In our downtime we enjoyed the beautiful views as well as the games, movies, and books that were available to us. Emily and Gabriel have truly thought of everything! This place is amazing, and we will definitely be back!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic stay at the gray house at Inglewood! This was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Emily was a wonderful host - she was very friendly and clearly put a lot of effort into the little details to make the stay special. The house is beautiful & the surroundings are so peaceful, we loved watching the sunset each night. It was only a 10 minute drive to Harrisonburg where we found plenty of cute restaurants and things to do, and we were an hour outside of Shenandoah national park. The bed was a bit firm for me, but I would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Emily's. The location is quiet and the setting beautiful and just several minutes away from downtown shopping and restaurants in Harrisonburg. We felt very comfortable hanging out in the living room. The bedrooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. Kitchenette and bathrooms were clean and thoughtfully arranged. Thanks, Emily, for welcoming us to your beautiful home."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I had the best stay. The space is beautiful and very spacious. Nicely decorated down to the details. The surrounding property is picturesque as well. Emily was a sweet host that checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. The house is less than 10 minutes to downtown. Next time we are in Harrisonburg we will definitely be staying here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly one of the most beautiful, comforting stays ever!! Felt so homey and the attention to detail was priceless. The host was so communicative and you can tell they care about making sure your stay in their space & the area was to be amazing! It was a great place we were excited to come back to every night and it was even difficult to leave! Whenever we plan to be back in the area, this airbnb will be a priority! I could not recommend this Airbnb more!!!!!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Grey House was perfect for a quick getaway weekend! The historic property had so many tiny features that made our stay super comfortable. The sights, the fixtures, the horse, & the surrounding amber waves of grain had a real rustic feel. If you like to live some history while also having modern indoor plumbing, this is your destination.
Specifics: we loved the proximity to downtown Harrisonburg (lots of little shops & breweries), the many little touches of the unit (like a classic VCR & tapes & a vanity to beat all vanities), the property was walkable with barns & views of surrounding fields, & there was a very peaceful atmosphere that lets you really relax."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful surroundings make for a peaceful visit. Great location with lots of privacy, while also being close to downtown Harrisonburg and the Shenandoah National Park.

She had recommendations for local things to do and she was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Check in was simple and it was easy to find. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Inglewood is a beautiful listing that manages to blend history and nostalgia with modern comfort. Emily has clearly put in a lot of effort to think of the little details and create a welcoming environment. She and her fiancé were on their way out when we arrived, but took the time to ensure that we were comfortable getting in. 10/10 would recommend."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the best stay in the Gray House! The Inglewood property is so beautiful, and we made it just in time to see all the leaves change for Fall. The house is so clean and cozy - we especially loved the coffee and heated blankets! The hosts prepared awesome itineraries for ideas of how to spend our day in Harrisonburg, which was perfect for us since we don’t know the area. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect couples getaway!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at The Gray House was an absolute dream. The beauty of this property is enchanting. The sweet winding lane leading to the house sets the perfect tone. Upon entering, we were greeted by a warm and cozy family room that exudes charm and comfort. The half bath, with its moody ambiance, and the well-equipped kitchenette, gorgeous bedroom and master bath were just what we needed for a weekend escape. It's like stepping back in time while having all the modern comforts at your fingertips. There's a record player, and we found ourselves sinking into relaxation while enjoying some great tunes. The level of thought and care that Emily, the host, has put into every detail of this property is truly commendable. The Gray House is a haven of peace and quiet, and it offers the kind of comfort that makes you feel truly at home. We would highly recommend staying here, and cannot wait to return. Thank you, Emily, for creating such a remarkable and welcoming space."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Inglewood is just as dreamy as it looks! The property is stunning with gorgeous views of the mountains. Although easily accessible to the main roads/downtown, this home is so peaceful and quiet, allowing you to get away from it all. The Airbnb has its own private entrance off of the main house so the space is all yours. It has its own mini kitchen and living room downstairs. Upstairs you’ll find your bedroom and full bath. The amenities feel like you’re at a nice hotel- Emily has thought of everything you need! Bathroom was fully stocked, bed super comfortable. One of my favorite parts was the view from the bedroom window. Can’t wait to come back!!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Howard's place! It worked well for the three of us with the comfy sofa bed, kitchenette (full fridge and dishwasher but smaller cooking appliances), and wonderful front porch. Howard provided lots of delicious and thoughtful details! The driveway was easy enough to back out of after the first try. Tons to do in the area... GlenDor Farms right down the street is great for a local meat pick-up, the Saturday farmers market has a wonderful group of local vendors (including Mill Song Bakery and The Long Acre Elderberry Farm), we had tasty food at a Bowl of Good and lots of other Harrisonburg restaurants, hiked at Massanutten Resort etc."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have clicked on this airbnb and are reading this, trust me when I say your expectations will be far exceeded in every way. Enjoy your stay. That’s all I will say because the rest is for you to go and be amazed by what an excellent host could do to a place."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s place is impeccable. Yes, the driveway to walk to and from your car is steep, but it’s manageable. Howard communicated proactively, pleasantly and genuinely was interested in making my stay what I needed. The inside is immaculate; extremely clean. The bedding extremely comfortable.
This was really a nice stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down one of the best Air BNB’s we have ever stayed in! Howard has taken the time to make this a truly magnificent place to stay. We felt welcomed the minute we walked in with homemade cookies, sangria and a kind note. Furthermore, Howard was incredibly responsive as well as great to talk to in person. Would happily stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Howard's place! Everything was very clean and cozy. Howard was intentional and thoughtful in making sure that we had a good experience.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t stress enough how relaxed and at home we felt at Howard’s Urban Oasis. We have family in the area and would 100% stay at Howard’s place again on any future visits. Howard was quick to respond and thought of every single detail that a guest might not even consider - truly the host with the most. Thanks again for your hospitality, Howard!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A gem of a property. The Urban Oasis was the ideal set up for our stay. So nicely appointed and exceeded our high expectations after reading the reviews and browsing through the pictures. We will happily stay here again if we are in the area or passing through.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Easy to find yet out of the way. Love the quiet area. Howard warned us about the steep driveway. And it sure is....
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time and I will be back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay with Howard! We were visiting Shenandoah and it was lovely to come back to Howard’s studio and feel at home. The studio was very clean and tidy. He was a very responsive host and checked in with us several times throughout our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. The cookies and sangria were a great plus to enjoy on the beautiful porch!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,He really thought of everything!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's Porch Is My Fave Thing About His Home. WE Spent So Much Time Swinging On His Macrame Chair&Futon. The Bed Was Comfy, The Space Was Neat & Clean.
The Cookies & Sangria That He Left Were So Thoughtful.
Great Memories Created At Howard's"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give 100 stars to the Urban Oasis and Howard, I would. It is by far the best airbnb I have ever stayed in. From the homemade cookies and sangria on arrival to toiletries and yoga mats, Howard has thought of every thing you could possibly need when you're away from home. I loved the local art decorating the walls. The space is so well used that it feels bigger than you would expect. I was sad when I saw rain in the forecast for the entirety of our trip, but we were still able to use the porch because it is fully covered and there are curtains on the side that help keep rain (and bugs) away. Highly highly recommend this place if you are visiting JMU or just want a relaxing place. We loved exploring but definitely looked forward to heading back to the Urban Oasis each day. I can't wait to book another stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s space was truly an oasis. I don’t believe there is anything he hasn’t included, from the conveniently placed phone chargers, to umbrellas to chess games we had everything we needed and more. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances and he even included some grocery items that meant we could enjoy a breakfast in the room without needing to stop at a grocery store. We loved hanging out on the deck and listening to the bird song and watching the squirrels chase each other. When we are back in Harrisonburg we will definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very impressed with Howard's approach to our use of his home and his willingness to explain or be available when called upon. The space was a bit smaller than we had realized, but well organized and well stocked in both kitchen and bathroom. Older visitors should be aware that the walk from the guest parking to the entryway is very uphill and calls for some degree of ""being in shape"" to navigate. That said, we (at 73 and 74 respectively) were able to navigate without much more that a need to breathe deeply. Also, the porch and swing are great!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was sold on this place when I saw the picture of the porch swings! Beautiful setting in the treetops above a rural valley! It was very quiet and restful. Unfortunately, because I was so busy helping my parents at VMRC (right over the hill), mine was more of a sleep-and-go kind of visit. I did spend one tranquil evening lying on the porch swing, listening to the birds and the rustling of the leaves in the cool twilight. Heaven!
Only two things during my stay were less than perfect: (1) I did not fully pay attention to the very clear notice that the guest parking spot was so steeply below the house level (my fault, bring your sneakers); and (2) the clothes closet was not tall enough to hang my longer garments. I guess the outside setting was just so enticing that everything else paled in comparison!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family couldn't speak higher of Howard and his place! He went above and beyond make it comfortable and relaxing trip! Howard's home was spotless and won high praise from my Mom!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay here very much and loved sitting outside to watch the sunset through the trees. It was exactly what I was looking for. I recently moved to Harrisonburg and needed a place to stay while I was waiting for my place to be ready.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks so much howard it honestly was the best airbnb i’ve found in harrisonburg. What a sweet touch with the cookies and sangria. Both so delicious! Everything was clean & cozy!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice location and feels private
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s place was really nice. It was a nice, clean place with thoughtful touches, and the porch swings were great. We were hiking in Shenandoah NP– about 45 minutes to an hour away but an easy drive. Cute area and good views too."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is truly an urban oasis! We loved our stay with Howard and would highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a cozy getaway in the area. The neighborhood is nice, quiet and safe. Very convenient as it was close to restaurants and grocery stores. We went hiking in Shenandoah and this location worked well for that. The place is exactly as pictured and even better in person. Check-in was very easy as Howard gave clear instructions. The welcome was also so warm as Howard provided amazing cookies and sangria. The Airbnb was extremely clean, organized, and well thought out. And emphasis on clean because it was truly spotless and by far the cleanest Airbnb I ever stayed in! It was also very well stocked. We were able to cook meals easily and there were many coffee and tea options that we enjoyed. The bathroom had basics you would need like towels, shampoo and body wash and Howard also provided other useful items that we found helpful during our stay. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. All of the thoughtful touches the host added to the location really made it stand above other places I've stayed. I would rate the naptime I had on the porch swing amongst my top ten naps ever. The accommodations were relaxing inside and out.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's place was as described and very clean. The bed was comfortable with nice sheets/linens. Everything was exceptionally clean. Nice kitchen stocked with coffee and essentials. The cookies left in our welcome basket were delicious, wish he included the recipe!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard was incredibly helpful and had lots of small touches that were very nice. The space was super clean and very nice with good amenities. I would definitely recommend a stay with Howard!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first stay at an Airbnb. The urban oasis was 5 stars from the little things like sangria and cookies at check in to the well stocked pantry and bathroom. The host thought of everything. Howard was very responsive to any requests too. urban oasis was a quick 2 mile drive from downtown Harrisonburg so the location was ideal too. We hope to stay again in the future.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had a fantastic stay at Howard’s place! It was so clean and felt so comfortable and homey. Howard made sure to help us feel taken care of by ensuring we had all the things we might need and even took the time to put in thoughtful personal touches! We would recommend staying here and would stay here again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I can’t say enough great things about this beautiful space!! It was so cute, so clean, and just so cozy. Howard left clear instructions on how to get in and where to park, the kitchen had any little thing we might have needed (we had coffee and tea mostly, and the fridge and microwave came in handy!)
He had cookies and sangria waiting for us when we checked in, perfect way to start our vacation!
The bed was comfy, including the sheets and pillows! And the bathroom was spotless! He had phone chargers already set up by the bed and desk so we never even used the ones we brought.
Overall I would stay here every time we make our annual visit to the burg! A lot of thought and time were put into the details of this space and it shows. Thanks for a wonderful stay Howard!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My gf and I had a great 3-night stay. It was comfy, cozy and has a mountain view that we enjoyed while relaxing on the patio. The best part about this space was how clean and orderly it was and we really appreciated all of the small details added that made it feel homey. The kitchen has all the essential cooking utensils anyone would need. We could tell there was a lot of thought put into setting up this space so that guests have all they need. There are iPhone and Android chargers, a speaker, plenty of pillows & blankets, shower products, emergency tampons, makeup wipes, and a makeup mirror which are such great touches for ladies. We didn’t need for anything at all. Howard was even nice enough to gift us a bottle of prosseco as an anniversary gift and some homemade cookies which were so good. Though a shared space, we felt like we had privacy being on the lower level. We didn’t hear much noise from above and actually only saw Howard one time. We would highly recommend this stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying here and Howard was a greet host! The whole check in process was very smooth and the studio was exactly like the listing. 10/10 would love to come back again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"one of the best airbnb experiences we’ve had. Howard was friendly and helpful. He truly “hosted” us with fresh cookies & a fully stocked kitchen (appliances, basic spices & ingredients, drinks/snacks). The room was comfortable & cozy, with so many little details to make the space inviting. The front porch was amazing, so peaceful & relaxing to sit by the fire!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely accommodations. I would suggest a photo of the driveway/walkway. It was steep for me; I'm in good shape, but late 60's. I would suggest being more visible about the driveway/walkway."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks to Howard for a comfortable stay! We loved the location and comfortable accommodations. Kitchen had everything we needed. The right amount of space for two. This is a place we would stay again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely time staying in Howard’s place. It’s a beautiful little hide away, and the view is amazing. It was just right amount of space for you to be comfortable & cozy. Perfect location for my needs, and Howard is a fantastic host. And he makes some delicious cookies.☺️
I look forward to rebooking this place again soon."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely airb&b! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Room was extremely clean and had all the amenities and supplies we needed. Area is so beautiful, neighborhood was great to walk each morning. Friendly and beautiful place Harrisonburg is!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beautiful and comfortable, inside and out. Modern, clean, and so much thoughtful attention to detail on the part of the host. I'm someone who uses the kitchen and this one was equipped and stocked to perfection. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this little guest suite. It was super cute, just like the pictures. The porch was incredibly cozy. Super plush towels and soft bed linens. The driveway is a doozy, and I would not have wanted to have to back out of the guest parking spot without a car that has a backup camera. Quiet little neighborhood, but only a couple minutes drive from downtown. The host was incredibly friendly and pleasant the one time we ran into each other. Would absolutely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard’s place was great! Super clean and filled with amenities. The swings on the porch are perfect to sip an early morning coffee or to warm up by the fire on a brisk night. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay with Howard was everything we could have imagined. The accommodations were spectacular. The views were superb. We hope to be able to come back to visit soon!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard’s place was one of the best experiences we have had with AirBnB. It was very clean and stocked with everything and anything you could think of. Lots of small touches in place showed that Howard cared about the guest experience as a whole.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I stayed at this AirBnb for a few days. Howard’s place was absolutely beautiful, welcoming, and cozy. It had all the amenities that we needed to work remotely and make some meals. There was a lot of attention to detail, and really appreciated Howard’s attentiveness. I will definitely stay here again if I’m ever in the Shenandoah area!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Howard is the perfect host!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for money. A quiet, well appointed place. Spotless and modern, and Howard provides great instructions. If we are ever again in the area, we'd do what we could to book Urban Oasis."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful spot for Shenandoah views while still staying connected (if you want to!). We did a half working/half taking-off-work vacation, and this place served all of our needs. The host is very responsive and the space has basically everything you would need for a short trip. The outdoor space is especially lovely for relaxing or for working from home in the comfort of a swinging couch! Highly recommend. Only thing I would note is to make sure you are aware of the house location description as there is quite an inclined walk up the driveway to get to the AirBnB space from the parking area. This was not an issue for us and the host does allow you to pull up to the top of the driveway and drop off people or luggage...but it is still something to consider as not everybody will be comfortable with that inclined walk. But otherwise, 5/5 stars!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Howard for checking in that we had everything we needed and making our stay so perfect.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay was excellent.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard is a great host with an incredible Airbnb that has everything you need for a long weekend stay. We valued the cozy porch area and quiet surroundings. We would definitely stay at this Airbnb again. Also, we highly recommend the White Oak Lavender Farm for a fun and relaxing tour, only about 20 minutes away."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely accommodations.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would absolutely recommend a stay at Howard’s! Communication was through and prompt. The space was clean and beautiful. I definitely felt like Howard went above and beyond in ensuring the details of the space including small add ons and supplies in the kitchen area and bathroom. All of your essentials for a great stay. I really enjoyed working from the porch swing and the location was perfect for a visit to Harrisonburg! Will be back for another stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall excellent experience. Everything was so clean and the place itself was filled with everything we needed. Would definitely return.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s place is absolutely wonderful. There are several personal touches. House is exactly as described, area is BEAUTIFUL. Host was attentive and helpful, as well as accommodating. We would recommend this to anyone!!! Would love to stay again!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at the Urban Oasis! There were so many amenities included that made our stay much more comfortable. Howard was responsive and answered our questions quickly when we reached out.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the Urban Oasis! We were greeted with cake and champagne for our anniversary, and the apartment was extremely clean. Hanging out on the deck is so relaxing. The home is close to downtown with a bunch of really good places to eat, and some nice coffee shops. The area is so beautiful with all the mountains. You will definitely enjoy your stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway in Harrisonburg! Beautiful studio in a beautiful home, in a nice and safe neighborhood. Howard is a fabulous host!

2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Howard was a great host who adds lots of personal touches that make the Urban Oasis pleasant and relaxing!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Urban Oasis is a gem of a getaway. Howard is a SuperHost and really makes your stay special.
I was welcomed in with a personalize card, cookies, homemade sangria, chips, and the coziest, prettiest apartment I think I have ever stayed in.
This is a one bedroom studio attached to the Host's home. It is beautifully kept and well furnished. Private entrance and perfect location. The sunset can be seen through your window or the front porch. It really is magical to see.
In less than 20 minutes, you can go to a vineyard, JMU, downtown Harrisonburg, a Route 11 cruise, a brewery, or just a scenic drive. You will love the visit and feel right at home."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place very clean and welcoming

2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Howard is a fantastic host and he give a lot of attention to there visitors. You will appreciate the patio with the sunset, and the fact that this Airbnb is in a very quiet place but near everything! We will come bake for sure!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had a great stay, very comfortable and well stocked AirBNB. A lot of thought has been put into the experience. Host communicated regularly and quick to respond. Outside area was nice for working or relaxing. Some good food I had around town - La Morena's (burritos/tacos), Jimmy Madison's (southern)."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Please do visit this place to catch a little break from day to day busy life. Howard is an amazing host and you will feel completely at home at this cute and cozy Airbnb. The little town of Harrisonburg is really fun exploring and you can visit Lurray cavern (Just 30 mins away) and can drive through the Skyline drive as well. There are many trails near by as well if you are feeling adventurous. 😊
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beautiful, that patio was amazing and so peaceful. Very clean and tidy space, had absolutely everything you would need. Would 100% recommend if you’re looking to stay in Harrisonburg ."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's unit is one of the most delightful Airbnb's my friend and I have ever stayed in. He is also the most thoughtful host I've ever had. If I ever need to stay overnight in Harrisonburg again, you better believe I will be staying here!
To start, Howard was very easy to communicate with! He was friendly and answered all of my questions promptly and without judgement. He provided ample information in advance AND inside of the unit itself.
The street the unit is on is lush, quaint, and quiet ~ save for delightful bird chatter and musical windchimes! It was easy to get to and about a 6 min. drive to downtown H'burg.
The studio has a gorgeous and inviting porch with comfy seating and string lights that you will not be able to resist.
Inside, the unit is even cuter than the pictures! It's a beautifully designed space, complete with local art work on the walls! The sleeping options were very comfortable ~ ample blankets and pillows were provided! The kitchenette had all that we needed, and even additional luxuries ~ there was a filtered water pitcher, a french press, and even a couple of treats waiting for us! The bathroom has a large mirror, with plenty of space for 2 people to get ready comfortably.
Every detail was thought of ~ there were apple & android phone chargers, a bose speaker, lotion and makeup remover in the bathroom, an egg crate foam cushion for the futon, and even a brush to wash bottles in addition to a sponge. These things may seem small, but they meant a LOT during a hectic weekend and made our stay incredibly comfortable.
I *highly* recommend staying at Howard's place!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was amazing and anything you need on a trip was there. Very peaceful area and the recommendations given for food were amazing as well. Would definitely come back next time in Harrisonburg.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Simply marvelous.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for your hospitality. The studio was great for us to relax and unwind after our adventures at Massanutten. We really appreciated the cleanliness and privacy. We also enjoyed how you were advertising work from local artists. Thanks again!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard was a super host, the communication with him was great, he gave us a heads up regarding weather conditions and snowfall so that we could be prepared accordingly. He is such a perfectionist, a hospitable person which is reflected in the design of this special, detail-oriented place. The space is immaculately clean with a beautiful view. It is tastefully and functionally designed where personal touches make the experience warm and comfortable."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard provided a beautiful, cozy space of rest and relaxation. Everything we could’ve needed was available, and we didn’t want to leave!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard is quite simply a beautiful person and one the world needs more of. He was extremely thoughtful and over the top kind. Our hearts are grateful for the time spent in this urban oasis!! Our 3rd wedding anniversary celebration is one for the memory books. Thank you Howard for sharing your home with us.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is definitely a place we would go back to again if possible. Howard made the studio feel really comfortable and personal as there are just so many amazing details about it that made us feel welcome. We even received a very nice Christmas gift! And Howard himself is super friendly as we had some nice chats with him when we happened to see him. 100% recommend!!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Very comfortable!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a place to stay near Harrisonburg, look no further. Among all the places my wife and I have stayed at this was one of the best.
The place was in pristine condition, all the dining utensils, appliances and accessory items are very clean and easily accessible. My wife and I travel quite a bit, and needless to say to have encountered places where dinner plates, utensils and appliances were not properly cleaned. Since then, we have been skeptical about using utensils at Airbnbs. However, Howards place threw us off totally. The dishes and utensils were squeaky clean, all the appliances were in working conditions and were also clean.
Howard had taken the time to make small pouches for pressed coffee so guests don't have to guess how much coffee to use. Made our coffee making experience so much easier. That takes time and a foresight.
My wife was especially impressed by the toiletries. It was very thoughtful to have feminine products, make removing wipes and a first aid kit. In so many Airbnbs that we have stayed in, we have never seen feminine products and making up removing wipes anywhere. There was travel side toothpaste, scrub, mouthwash etc. There was even a first aid kit.
Howards place is a home away from home. So much thought has gone into making this place as comfortable as possible. On our last day we had the chance to chat with him and get to know him a bit. He was very pleasant and friendly and make us feel very welcome in his home."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Howard is a great host and his place is located in a very beautiful setting. He lives on-site but the guest studio remains very private. My boyfriend and I loved the complimentary cookies. The only thing that was a bit of a hassle was the guest parking spot since it was difficult to back out of. Overall, a great stay and would recommend!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Nothing beats it at that price
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's ""Urban Oasis"" is just that. A wonderful location convenient to town but tucked into the woods. It was sparkling clean and wonderfully equipped. Very comfortable."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A terrific find! Howard is a gracious host. The studio is well designed, impeccably clean and is very thoughtfully stocked for guests. Very convenient for nearby adventuring and JMU visits."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard is the most gracious host, he has thought of everything that could possibly make your stay comfortable. His chocolate chip cookies were the best anywhere! We especially enjoyed the large outdoor area to just sit, relax and enjoy the view. It feels like you’re out in the countryside and yet you’re actually only minutes from a multitude of things to do. We plan to visit again soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"BOOK THIS PLACE!!! It’s impeccably clean, well decorated, and comfortable, with a well stocked kitchen area and the most tranquil porch! Howard was a great host and included personal touches that made this trip memorable. I only wish I could have stayed longer!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s place was a great find! His guest suite was very private, although attached to his home, it feels like you’re in your own place. Very intimate and peaceful.
Place was very clean with so many thoughtful extras if you forget to bring something from home. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you need and the baked treats were delicious!
We ran into Howard once and he was so kind. He checked in with me often to make sure we had everything we needed, but there wasn’t anything extra we could ask for.
Place looked exactly like pictures and the swinging chairs were nice to sit on in the morning with a cup of coffee or tea."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are reading this review, I suspect you might be considering Urban Oasis as an option for your trip. The good news is- you are done searching for the perfect accommodations —as you have found the hidden gem!! While the location was perfect (w/in minutes to everything) and watching the sunset amongst the mountain backdrop was breathtaking (forever imprinted in my memory), it was the actual temporary living accommodations that far surpassed my expectations! Quality (check): Cleanliness (check): Comfort (check): Amenities (check): Serenity (check): Hospitality (check): Attention to Detail (CHECK, CHECK). Nothing in all the other 5-star reviews is fabricated. They are all true. If you are fortunate enough to meet your host, Howard, you will witness the genuine concern he personally has for your comfort and enjoyment. I will, without a doubt, be back."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a relaxing stay at Howard's home. He had everything there we needed and was an awesome host!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was everything in the description and more. You can tell Howard puts thought and care into this space and really cares about his guests experience. The area is quiet and peaceful with conveniences nearby. The swing is the perfect place for a nap, Netflix and wifi are available. Pots, pans, a cooktop, toaster oven and a selection of spices & teas really do make you feel like you can make yourself at home. Will definitely return!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place to get away and relax. Has a beautiful porch! It is in a very quiet neighborhood and you would hardly know there are people close by. The place was clean and very welcoming.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Urban Oasis is a sweet little spot for someone looking for quiet. The studio is well furnished and clean. The swings on the porch made for a nice afternoon. Thank you for a great weekend.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Everything was super clean and neat. Awesome outdoor patio with comfortable seating. Highly recommend this place!!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's studio is very nice and clean, and the deck is very comfortable. We spent quite some time on the deck in Howard's comfortable ""hanging"" chairs. They were great. I broke my foot two days before we left. We planned to do some hiking, so instead we hung around. We relaxed and still had a great time. The relaxing was exactly what we needed. We did go into Harrisonburg where they had craft shops, bakeries, ice creams stores and regular restaurants. We liked Clementine's for dinner, and the bakery next to the information center for take away breakfast foods. The Arboretum is nice too, and nearby.
All in all it was a much better experience than I thought we would have. Howard also provides the renter with cookies and a stocked up refrigerator."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard is truly a super host. He added special treats, the kitchenette was fully stocked with everything you can imagine, and the outdoor patio was magnificent. He made us feel very welcome and answered all of our questions. His place was very clean, modern, and peaceful.
We were able to make it to downtown in just minutes and to Shenandoah was a short drive away. Definitely will come back when in the area."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 3 nights. This was the perfect spot for a quiet get away, it was only about an hour from the trail we hiked in Shenandoah. We would for sure consider staying here again. Howard is a great host!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's space is a gem! It was equipped with all the necessities for our stay while also being filled with thoughtful touches. The outdoor space is cozy and wonderful to relax and the indoor space is just as cozy, comfortable, and very clean. The location itself is not only beautiful but very ideal as it is close to downtown historic Harrisonburg where there are a bunch of lovely local shops and restaurants. Overall I'd highly recommend this listing!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Howard's place made for a really wonderful stay. The guest room was nicely maintained, comfortable, and had all of the things we possibly could have needed. The location was ideal as well considering it's only a 10 minute drive to the downtown area's restaurants, shops, and farmers market and about one hour drive to Shenandoah National Park. The porch also makes for a wonderful hang out/relaxing spot after a day out. I would love to stay here again!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best AirBnB I’ve stayed in!! There were so many small touches that made a huge difference to me. For example, there was a brand new sponge in the kitchen still in wrapping, there were cookies and sangria for us, the towels were folded nicely, there were individual cartons of milk in the fridge... I could go on but it was set up so beautifully and made us feel really at home! Also the place was SPOTLESS! Howard was very communicative and the location is great, probably about 10-12 min to downtown Harrisonburg. Perfect for two people! I would highly recommended!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard was incredible, great communication and great hospitality! Gave us amazing food recommendations as well!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Loved the decor. It is so clean and comfortable. We'd love to stay again! The snacks and such were a wonderful touch too. Great place to stay!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, cozy place to stay that feels secluded yet convenient to many restaurants, breweries and other places. Howard was so kind and there were many thoughtful touches in the space. The weather was unfortunately unseasonably very cold and rainy during our visit so we couldn’t enjoy the amazing deck with ultra comfortable swings and beautiful views. It was a great place to stay and we highly recommend it."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place. The host was friendly and included many ""extras"" that I didn't expect. The scenery on the deck was captivating and the swing made it even more relaxing - it was like a spa. Would definitely recommend this place for one or two people who need a quiet relaxing place to stay in Harrisonburg."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Once you do the steep climb up from the guest parking spot and go into your room everything is so clean that all you have to do is appreciate the details that Howard provides such as snacks and other goods. What Howard provides is enough for anyone who wants a small but comfortable get away.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My parents stayed at Howard’s place for my graduation from JMU. They absolutely loved it and the place made their weekend a great one in Harrisonburg! Howard included many small details such as art from local artists, scones and sangria. The hospitality was great and the communication was fast as well. Go dukes!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s place is such a gem!! My husband and I stayed for three nights to do a little fly fishing in the area and this was the perfect spot to stage from. The studio was immaculate and very cozy. Howard has taken steps to ensure everything is sanitized between guests and we immediately felt at ease.
This place is loaded with amenities....too many to list but the extra thoughtful touches of a wireless phone charger, speaker system and fresh cookies and scones were appreciated. After fishing we’d store our gear on the porch and enjoy the peaceful view from the swinging bench.
We’d stay here again in a flash!!!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's place was even better than expected! It was in a great location for exploring Harrisonburg, hiking in Shenandoah National Park, and just relaxing. If you forget anything, don't worry, it's there. Howard has thought of everything, including nice extra touches like baked goods, beverages, etc. The place was also spotless. I would highly recommend staying here if you are in the Harrisonburg area."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Howard’s place was perfect for us. The location was lovely. He has an amazing deck swing- perfect for lunch, a glass of wine or a nap! The apartment is incredibly clean! Beautiful local art displayed. Lovely home baked treats. Very quiet at night. Howard is a very gracious host. We come this way quite often and would definitely stay there again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s place was great! It was a perfect location—less than 10 minutes in to town for great food and a little less than an hour to most entrances of Shenandoah National Park. Perfect amount of space for 2 people, and we especially enjoyed the porch swing on a warmer evening. Highly recommend staying here!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Howard's cozy and comfortable studio apartment. It is set among trees in a peaceful spot on the edge of Harrisonburg. The space was sparkling clean. All the instructions and directions were crystal clear. What really makes Howard's place special are the thoughtful touches, like snacks and drinks, including homemade sangria. We loved sitting on the patio swing, enjoying a glass of sangria and watching the sun set. To top it off, it's great value for money. We would highly recommend to others."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely enjoyed our stay!!! So quiet and serene and so close to Harrisonburg!!! The personal touches made it feel more welcoming...homemade scones and cookies and the sangria was superb!!! Thank you again Howard for the constant communication and providing us with an amazing weekend!!!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard's place was wonderful to stay at! It was so comfortable - loved all the personal touches!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Howard is such a great host! He was super kind and checked in to make sure we were okay. We loved the space! It was clean and comfortable. A quick drive to hikes and the Massanutten resort. We loved the views and the porch swing so much! Good weather allowed us to sit out and enjoy nature. The Airbnb had everything we needed including snacks, the most comfortable bed, extra blankets, everything we needed to cook and eat comfortably. I was able to bring all of our groceries for the week. We would absolutely stay here again and again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location and its host, Howard, were absolutely lovely! From the snacks to the decor to nearby restaurants, we loved everything! We highly recommend this place for people who want to get out of town and have great hikes and vineyards within a 30-minute drive!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came up for an extended weekend trip and can not say enough good things about this place. Howard was a great host, he had a lot of little treats to make you feel very welcome as well as a beautiful space for us. Everything was very organized and clean. Great location with a great view off the front deck, we were minutes away from some really good restaurants and shops. Highly recommend a stay here!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time here! The place was clean, had everything we needed to stay for a few days. Lots of nice touches throughout, and he even brought us homemade sangria for happy hour! We did get there on a snowy/icy day and I didn't have 4-wheel drive to get up the driveway, but we were able to park on the street so it wasn't an issue. There is also a good deli within walking distance and spectacular sunsets to watch from the front window. Would highly recommend staying here!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard's place is everything you would expect and more! My boyfriend and I had such a relaxing and enjoyable weekend. The space is very cozy and the thoughtful touches are endless. We will definitely be staying here again once we find ourselves in Harrisonburg again.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the Urban Oasis was exactly what we needed. The space is both incredibly convenient to the downtown area and also nestled away enough that you feel engulfed in the woodland landscape. The area is large enough to spend time in beyond sleeping and as clean & hospitable as promised. Howard was so kind and took the extra mile to ensure our safety and transportation abilities by shoveling the driveway mid-snowstorm! Definitely an ideal spot for anyone wanting to enjoy all the sweet treats Harrisonburg has to offer (:
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s Urban Oasis Studio was everything we expected and more for a short weekend getaway! Howard’s studio felt like home away from home! We were greeted with Sangria, scones, cookies, and a cozy environment. Not to mention the baked goodies were amazing and delicious! The apartment studio had a kitchenette which had everything you could possibly need! We appreciated the thoughtfulness of our host and for him to go out of his way to make us feel welcomed and in a safe environment due to COVID. Definitely a place to go when looking to relax and get away from the city! Highly recommend!!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely perfect! My wife and I have stayed at many Airbnb's and Howard's place was one of the best. He puts in so many little touches to make you feel at home. Cannot recommend enough.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's place is great! In a very quiet and safe neighborhood. We arrived to a warm, comfy, and clean studio. This place is great if you need to get away for the weekend. We also took the opportunity to look up trails and places to do walks.. there are great and close places to get your exercise on! During COVID-19, it may seem hard to travel but Howards set up and cleaning policy made it feel VERY safe! Thank you for the AMAZING stay, Howard! Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t hesitate. It’s a lovely space, great location, and Howard is so friendly and thoughtful."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very happy with our stay.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cute little place, perfect for a weekend get away."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time in the urban oasis. Howard was a wonderful and responsive host, who provided snacks galore and a kitchen that had so many thoughtful touches. It really helped for a few day stay when some things were closed due to Christmas, Covid, and the combination. We also loved the porch swing and the bluetooth speakers, and the tree! The area is beautiful, and we were able to check out the small towns of Harrisonburg and Staunton, as well as enjoy Skyline Drive and snow tubing in Massanuten, and some local wineries. Adorable AirBnb."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic time at Howard’s place. He was responsive and supplied great recommendations for food in the area. He left special touches - his homemade scones, cookies, and sangria were AMAZING! The space was beautiful and a perfect size for the 2 of us. There were many cute, artistic, and modern touches. Our absolutely favorite part was hanging out on his porch swing. If we are ever in need of a place to stay in Harrisonburg again, we will be returning to Howard’s!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's place is a small but stylish and comfortable studio in a quiet neighborhood within a reasonable distance to Shenandoah National Park (about 45 min. to 1 hour to some great trailheads) and near to other great hikes and sites in the area (only 20 minutes to Natural Chimneys and other nearby wilderness hikes). The studio itself has a well-appointed kitchen for all your cooking needs, including delightful snacks and drinks. The bed is quite comfy and the TV is setup for Roku streaming services. The porch swing is pretty dreamy with excellent bird watching opportunities right there in the front yard. Howard had all the bases covered and was warm and welcoming. Highly recommended!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb is a true gem! Howard is so pleasant and it’s true...he left cookies and scones! He also left me a carafe of sangria that I happily enjoyed after the 2 hour drive. I was looking for a weekend escape with my son and this was so perfect. He has thought of everything to make it a great stay. It was clean, bed was comfortable, outdoor swing amazing, and very close to downtown. I adore his spot and Harrisonburg!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A great place to get away from it all.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Howard's place is awesome! Beautiful studio in a natural setup. Moreover, Howard is a caring host."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this charming space in Harrisonburg. Everything was clean, tidy, and stylish. He offered lots of coffee drink options, fresh baked goods, as well as a delightful cocktail. My favorite space was the cozy porch swing."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard is hands down the best host on AirBnb. This place was so perfect for our weekend away, and if you haven't read enough reviews about it yet, let me say that the day bed/swing is a gem (we spent at least two hours everyday on it, enjoying the view of the mountains through the trees). Howard is all about the thoughtful touches-- the space was stocked with coffee, homemade baked goods, SANGRIA, soaps and blankets, the works. And in the era of COVID, it was reassuring to know that the space was clean and cared for. You pretty much just need to show up and relax. We can't thank Howard enough for being such a great host and we hope to be back again in the near future!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s place was cute, quaint, and perfect for a little getaway. The place was exceptionally clean and has everything you could possibly need. The porch swing was my favorite, perfect for a morning cup of coffee to enjoy the scenery."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard's space was super clean and exactly as pictured. It was quiet and relaxing. The attention to detail was awesome and Howard left thoughtful treats scattered throughout the place. My partner and I would definitely stay again :-)
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I used this location as a base for hiking in the Shenandoah park, it is only a short drive to the historic center of Harrisonburg and a 20 minute drive to the park entrance at Swift Run. It is in a quiet location off a dead end street but easy to get to. It was tastefully decorated and well appointed. The kitchen had anything I could have needed including nice flatware, dishes and stemware and a selection of fine teas. Multiple coffee makers and a water filter were also provided. The bed was very comfortable and there was a couch, a big comfy chair and a small counter with two stools for a quick breakfast. The bathroom was large and well lit and came with some amenities such as a blow dryer, shampoo and body wash. The host thought of everything you could need for a short or long stay. The host followed up upon my arrival and made sure I was comfortable and had if I had any questions, they were very discrete and accommodating. I especially enjoyed the fresh baked cookies and scones, they were delicious."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a wonderful launching point for our hiking adventures! Clean, thoughtful, comfy, and high-end details made for a perfect relaxing retreat at the end of the day.
Amazing host, Howard, inspired a lot of confidence that his place is cleaned with the highest standards, and we could tell that he doesn’t cut corners anywhere by the level of detail and care he’s put into the space.
Next time, we will explore the town, but the mountains were calling!
The price was very reasonable, and when we consider the quality of accommodation, the value was pretty the best we’ve ever had from an AirBnB anywhere!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Howard’s urban oasis was beyond lovely. The space is so cozy and welcoming. The space was immaculate and so clean, which during these uncertain times was comforting. Even the little touches, like a basket of baked good and homemade sangria in the fridge were so thoughtful. My boyfriend and I will certainly stay here again next time we’re in Harrisonburg."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place. Howard was great and the views and atmosphere were terrific. Well worth the money. We see a repeat visit.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have to say that discovering Howard’s Airbnb was a bright moment for me in this pandemic. The homemade scones and cookies were delicious, the space was immaculately clean and nicely decorated, and there were so many thoughtful, additional amenities. Howard himself, of course, was very kind and accommodating.
The best part of the studio for me was the beautiful porch, swing, and surrounding trees. I was able to practice yoga, read, and journal outside on the swing and it was the perfect escape from the city. This Airbnb gave me a chance to recharge—I look forward to booking again in the future and I’m grateful that Howard is the kind of host who goes out of his way for his guests, as it really makes the stay special."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Could not have asked for a better stay. Howard's home truly is an oasis. The porch swing was everything I dreamed of, and I sat on it more than once. Inside was stylish and comfortable. The kitchenette was impressively well stocked. Howard's thorough directions and treats were appreciated. The house felt removed enough to feel away, while still very accessible to downtown Harrisonburg. I didn't want to leave..."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard’s Urban Oasis is a treat! From home-baked goods to special COVID precautions, this Airbnb is a 10/10 - would recommend :)"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard's place was wonderful. Very clean and well organized. The perfect place to come back to after a day of hiking. The outdoor swing was my favorite part! Would stay again.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a friendly, welcoming and incredible space. The house is amazing and so much better than we ever anticipated in an Airbnb. You must stay here!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home, wishing we stayed for longer!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Howard went out of his way to find a recipe for vegan scones for me! This is such a lovely place with many wonderful touches. My one regret: oversleeping on check out day so I did not have time to eat breakfast on the comfortable porch swing! Looking forward to staying here again in the fall as business brings me back to Harrisonburg.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a way better stay then I could have ever hoped or imagined! My husband put it best when he said, ""This is more like a resort then an Airbnb!"" If we are in the area, definitely will book again! Howard is also very thoughtful and obviously cares about his guests and wants them to have a great stay! Is about 30 minutes from everything we wanted to do (which was mostly hiking in the surrounding mountains) and is a great central location. Also, this place is so much hang for your buck! Would highly recommend you stay here, you won't regret it!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Clean. Organized. As advertised. Wonderful little touches. Good coffee and tea. Great.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are seeking a beautiful, and peaceful environment, this is the place for you!
Howard has clearly poured love, creativity, and hard work into every little detail of his space. We were lucky enough to double the amount of time that we could stay and it was worth every minute. We drove away fully relaxed, and recharged, ready to return whatever life might have in store for us.
We loved sitting on the tranquil porch swing while mediating in a private rainforest, this alone was worth the trip.
Howard was the quintessential host, excellent at communicating, and being available if needed, but plenty of privacy. The wifi was superior, the space was immaculately clean, and included a fully stocked kitchen loaded with thoughtful touches, tea, coffee, oatmeal, spices, and even things for baking. Homemade cookies and scones too!
We will be back here again to replenish! Highly recommend this space to anyone!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard was an exceptional host. We’ve stayed at many Air BnBs over the years, and this was hands down one of our best experiences yet! We really appreciated his thoughtful touches that made the guest suite feel like home - including the delicious baked goods he left for us. Watching the sun set from the porch swing was a memorable experience each night. The location of the Air BnB is great for accessing Shenandoah NP, and Harrisonburg has many great restaurants. Would highly recommend Urban Oasis to anyone looking for a tranquil and relaxing getaway!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay and a great host! The studio was incredibly clean and set up very nicely with lots of personal touches.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was PRISTINE. Just immaculately clean which is so important these days, and fresh and stylish and comfy. Amenities are so thorough and thoughtful; the best is the delicious home baked goodies! Health and safety thoughtfulness was just a home run here. I was able to just relax. Got to chat with Howard and he is very friendly. The property is gorgeous and peaceful. Definitely take some time on the outdoor porch swing! A great value for the price."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard's place is amazing. Very peaceful but within a good distance to stores, restaurants, and Shenandoah National Park. He is very thoughtful and the room really shows it - far better amenities than a hotel."

2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed in!

2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at good ole Howard's place was astounding! We walked in and were enveloped with the smell of lavender fields as the diffuser was doing it's thang. The space was immaculately clean. The touches of home warmed our souls immediately, the photos do not do justice to the sophisticated decor + layout
Though it is not equipped with a full kitchen, the appliances that Howie supplied more than met our needs for the full meals we prepared!
10/10 recommend"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the nicest stays I’ve ever had with an Airbnb. Howard was an incredible host and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. My boyfriend and I loved the space and enjoyed our weekend. Highly recommend Howard’s place!

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy, sweet spot! Beautifully appointed, with everything one could possibly need. Sparkling clean. We were so grateful for the extra welcoming touches - luscious homemade scones (!), and ginger cookies (!), as well as a couple of yogurts to help us get things started. Fantastic coffee/tea setup. With the great restaurant scene in Harrisonburg, and access to the beautiful mountains, we totally loved our stay and look forward to coming back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved the quiet, comfortable, clean yet unscented accomodations that Howard provides. He is kind, considerate and prompt at addressing questions and concerns. While he usually bakes cookies for people, I am gluten intolerant, so he thoughtfully got me some berries instead. I also loved waking up to a view of the mountains, and walking outside to smell the fresh, fragrant morning air. Thank you, Howard!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Howard was a terrific host! The Urban Oasis Studio was wonderful!! It was warm, cozy very clean and filled with everything from fresh baked goodies, to common staples that you may need if you like to cook. He was available if I needed anything and made my very first stay in an Airbnb a real delight."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and neat. Great amenities.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Urban Oasis is fantastic. There are several thoughtful touches that Howard includes in his place; such as a small basket of baked cookies and scones that are yours to enjoy. His place is sparkling clean throughout, and you can tell he takes pride in his property. The shower and bathroom are immaculate with great water pressure, and draining. Howard was respectful of our privacy we felt free to come and go as we pleased through the private entrance into the bottom of the unit. There is a door between the bottom floor and the upper floor that has a chain installed on both sides to give you an added sense of space which I appreciated. Should I ever be in the area again the Urban Oasis is going to be the at the top of my desired places to stay!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Urban Oasis was a wonderful place to stay. Every review before mine is accurate. Howard has made this a very comfortable, clean and homey place with many added touches (cookies and scones to name a few)! I would recommend it to anyone."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay and highly recommend it! The location was great for us to see local family and it was close to food and shopping! Easy on and off the highway also! It was the perfect size for our family and had everything we needed.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We felt right at home with all the special touches. Every detail was carefully thought out and planned for a perfect stay.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for JMU graduation weekend and we couldn’t be happier with our stay! We have a family of five with kids ranging from 3-18 and there was something for every age in the house. It had the right bit of everything one might need when borrowing a house. So many thoughtful details and everything felt brand new and fresh. Eliot welcomed us even before we arrived and made the process so easy throughout our stay. The location is on a road without a sidewalk so no walking to anything-however, it was such a short, easy drive to campus and downtown with great places to eat! We loved staying here and would definitely book it again next time we are in town!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Martin Cottage was filled with beautiful simple touches that made our weekend wonderful! The location is about 8 miles from the JMU Campus- a short/easy drive!
We had 2 couples for the weekend but could easily have had 3 couples. There is a beautiful view from the deck and everything was set up so thoughtfully! The place would also be great for a family with children who
would have a very safe backyard to enjoy!
Lots of games and some toys too! There is a corn hole game available for use and a ping pong table!
The Martin Cottage is a Great place to stay!
It is necessary to have a car."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved staying in this lovely home. It was near Harrisonburg and not far from the many orchards in Winchester. The house was clean and up to my expectations even though I am very picky about cleanliness. The house is decorated like a home not like staying in a spartan hotel room. Eliot responded quickly and friendly if we did have a question. We were also pleased that the house had everyday needs such as trash bags, detergent, cleaners, coffee, and etc.
We hope to stay again when we are in the area."

The basement was an amazing place to hangout if you are coming with a large group. The place was spotless and with loads of extra comfort items. Playing ping pong and corn hole with the family made our evening’s more engaging. The host is always easy to get ahold of. I could go on and on. Thank you for going above and beyond."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Martin Cottage exceeded my expectations. The house was clean and spacious, and having three full bathrooms was priceless. Eliot’s communication was spot-on.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is great place. Maybe the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Thoughtfully renovated and furnished. Very clean. And Elliot was fantastic. Super clear and responsive communicator.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a last minute rental and Eliot was fabulous. His communication before, during, and after was so professional and prompt.

We've rented quite a few times with Airbnb and other platforms and at various locations; this was the best ever!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Martin Cottage was super! Eliot is a thoughtful host, in every sense. The house is tastefully decorated and extremely well-equipped, including lots of dishes, mixing bowls, pots and pans , cleaning supplies, travel items a guest might have forgotten, extra linens, etc. The “coffee bar” was ideal, complete with Peet’s coffee!
We also very much appreciated access to Netflix et al on TV. Loved the small deck looking over the back yard field below, especially when the traffic was light.
One more very important aspect of Eliot’s place is the lower level full of games, ping pong and even cornhole.
We heartily recommend the Martin Cottage!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying at an Airbnb and Martin’s Cottage has set the bar really high! Our family went on out first vacation since the pandemic to the Shenandoah Valley and this home really made our vacation complete. We loved how homely the house felt because of it’s location and how everything was set. Our family loved getting coffee in the mornings and sitting in the front porch and just talking and relaxing with each other. Moreover, Eliot was an incredible host and was always in touch with us throughout our stay! Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this house and will definitely be coming back again soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very well appointed home with lots of unexpected extras and nice touches. We especially loved the guide to local spots and visited several!

I will definitely stay there everytime I go back home to Harrisonburg."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our short stay was made phenomenal, cozy and fun thanks to your beautiful home. Thank you for thinking of everything your guests could possibly need from: q-tips and lotion, to a pen to fill out Cards, tape to wrap our gifts and toys for kids (my 2.5 yr old loved the toy box of goodies lol). The guidebook you created was also super cute and informative.
Looking forward to booking with you again the next time we’re in the Harrisonburg area."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at The Martin Cottage! It was a peaceful area, just a few minute drive away from downtown Harrisonburg. The house is decorated beautifully and Eliot has thought of every amenity and nice touch to make his guests’ stay enjoyable. The coffee bar was a highlight! Eliot was easily to reach and very accommodating.
The only downside was that there wasn’t a door between the main level and the basement. So, in the morning, the people upstairs had to be super quiet to try to not wake up the people who were sleeping in the basement. (But if you all woke up at the same time, or didn’t have people sleep downstairs, it wouldn’t even be a problem.)
Bottom line: I highly recommend it. We had a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and clean house. We had a wonderful stay.

The surroundings are beautiful --a delightful country setting, just a few miles from James Madison University. I ran on the main road that leads to The Cottage, and even though it's a busy road, I felt safe. Views on my run included rolling hills, lots of cows, bubbling brooks, historic churches, and gorgeous sunrises.
Eliot and his wife go out of their way to provide amenities -from coffee to goodies at check in, and everything was very clean. There is lots of room to enjoy at The Cottage, so it would make a great place for a family get away. ~ I was there for a work related trip and needed excellent wifi --The Cottage did not disappoint :--)
I highly recommend not only The Cottage, but Eliot and his wife as hosts. <3"

We needed a place to stay while visiting our son, daughter-in-love and two little granddaughters, a place to rest and relax after spending each day with them and Carrie’s space provided that and more.
Her home is in such a beautiful and quiet area, yet minutes away from anything you might want to do or see in Harrisonburg and the surrounding area. The kitchen was well-stocked with essentials, the bed and linens were beyond comfortable and the shower – wow! We also appreciated the perk of having a washer and dryer in the unit, first time ever in an Airbnb for us and it came in very handy.
We highly recommend Carrie’s “Spacious & Bright 1 Bedroom Apartment”!"

We were able to hear footsteps upstairs and a dog barking at times but absolutely nothing to be bothered by. There was even some lovely piano music one afternoon that was great to relax to!

Tier 1 place and will keep it on my list if I ever have friends and family visiting Harrisonburg."

She’s very responsive to your questions & needs & incredibly considerate since the apartment is the ground floor of her house. The place stayed cool & comfy on some very hot June days. It was clean, well-organized and stocked for guests. You have access to your own patio with nice outdoor furniture and shade. She is welcoming & at the same time, respectful of your need for privacy. She’s a top-tier SuperHost."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute apartment, beautiful and safe location, close to great restaurants, breweries, and vineyards!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Carrie's home again. It is a very nice neighborhood and close to everything. We visited Woods Edge Farm just down the road and there is a Food Lion not far away. The flowers in the neighborhood were gorgeous. I thought they were fake at first because they were so pretty! Carrie's home is very comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. Carrie's place is excellent for those with mobility problems. No steps to get in or around inside and no steps for the shower. The washer and dryer were very helpful, so we didn't have to pack much for our trip. The temperature was perfectly comfortable. We never turned on the TV because there was so much for us to see while we were there. I did use the internet once and had no issues with connectivity. Everything was very clean. We stayed here again because we enjoyed it so much the 1st time and we'll stay there again when in the area."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our very best AirBnb experiences, meeting every expectation for comfort and cleanliness and surpassing them in terms of what's provided. Location is great with easy (car) access to downtown Harrisonburg and JMU. The neighborhood is quiet. And a quick walk up the hill provides great views of beautiful mountains and colorful sunsets."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great Airbnb.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cozy place. The place was clean, decorated really cute and had everything we needed and more."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie's basement apartment was amazing. Absolutely everything we could have needed for cooking, plates/cups/utensils, cleaning supplies, laundry essentials, as well as some pantry staples we're included (rice, spices, sauces, etc). Even a blender, teas, coffee. The bed was incredibly comfortable, as were the pillows. My husband and I stayed here with a friend, who said the air mattress and bedding was comfortable as well. She went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is underneath their household, so there is some noise, but we actually loved hearing their dog occasionally as it reminded us of our dogs at home. On our last day, we had car trouble and needed to have it fixed before we could drive 7 hours home. Carrie let us check out a couple hours late so we could get that sorted out. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone lucky enough to find availability. Thank you again Carrie!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie truly is among the best of the best when it comes to hosts. Prior to booking, she was quick and informative when responding to questions. We were looking for a place to stay while visiting Massanutten resort. This was only about 30 minutes. Shortly before our visit, Carrie reached out to make sure we were aware of the upcoming snow storm that the area was expecting. She also let me know that if conditions were too bad and we needed to stay an extra night, that they had the availability. While visiting, she made sure everything was as expected, that the driveway was shoveled for us, and provided an awesome recommendation for a place to go sledding that was just a few blocks away. The apartment was beautifully decorated and stocked with all the normal essentials and then some. This place exceeded my expectations and I would book the apartment againin a heartbeat if I need accommodations again in the area."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie was very welcoming and you can tell she wants her guests to feel at home and comfortable.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For selfish reasons ONLY, I would say don’t stay here…move on to the next option so this would free up days for me to book more time there. ☺️
In all seriousness, yes I would absolutely recommend staying at Carrie’s when you are visiting Harrisonburg and/or areas close by!!! She is very personable, responsive, and will be involved as much or as little as you need her to be throughout your stay."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The apartment was perfect , cute and very clean and having the washer and dryer was fantastic. There was a little noise from a deck being built while I was there but Carrie was great at communicating and it was no real problem."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,M
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Carrie is a great host. She was very easy to communicate and the place is perfect for a quick little getaway. She also had a few things that we forgot to bring with us. Really happy with our stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Count yourself lucky if you are able to score a reservation at this charming and lovely AirBNB in the heart of a peaceful retirement community in Harrisonburg, VA. This place is truly a hidden gem and a rare find. The apartment looks exactly as advertised and your host Carrie has seen to it that every convenience has been provided for your comfort .One can easily see that the apartment was just remodeled and everything worked very efficiently. Also, the entire place was immaculate. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the appliances and accessories you could want and the bathroom was just as pictured with a laundry hidden away behind closet doors. One of the best features for me was to treat myself to as many outdoor café breakfasts, lunches and dinners as I could make on that lovely patio that sits to the side of the entrance. The scenery from there at night is just beautiful. Another really nice perk was being able to drive up my own private driveway right to the front door almost. That was a really big help getting things back and forth from the car to the apartment. Your host Carrie, always responds within minutes of receiving your communication and will go out of her way to provide whatever convenience you might need to make your stay more comfortable. She really exemplifies the meaning of ""Super Host"". This AirBNB rates 5 stars across the board for exceptional everything. I highly recommend you try and get on the waiting list for this beautiful little home away from home. You will not be disappointed."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The space is very thoughtfully designed with everything you need and even a few extra things that you didn’t realize you might need while you are away. It’s extremely clean and private. The location is close to everything and we felt very at home!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very Clean and comfortable!
Nice little touches throughout.
Great communication and we loved the newly renovated bathroom."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carrie was a great host. The bed was so comfortable. I would definitely book this space again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This basement apartment is the perfect spot for a weekend getaway! Only about 10 minutes from downtown Harrisonburg and right next to EMU.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars for sure! Very clean, complete kitchen, laundry facilities. Highly recommended."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! Worth every penny! Walking distance to EMU, and Carrie is amazing- so are the blackberries! :)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie’s home was beautiful! Everything was clean and ready for us when we arrived and it felt like a home away from home! Communication was excellent, she even offered us some fresh berries out of her garden. While it’s a little bit of a drive (about 45 minutes to a visitor center) I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re looking for an air bnb near Shenandoah NP."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to spend a week -- so comfortable I felt like I lived there. Carrie was an excellent communicator and checked in regularly to make sure some unexpected yard work that had to happen during my stay wasn't bothering me. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Carrie made it so comfortable and pleasurable with her warm and welcoming hospitality. We couldn’t have asked for a better hostess or environment. Carrie and her family live upstairs, but you will rarely hear any sounds; maybe an occasional bark, or chair moving. Our favorite was listening in as her daughter practiced her piano! Delightful! The apartment was perfect for a couple and well equipped for our time away from home. Cozy and so nicely decorated. I especially loved the shower! Felt like a luxury hotel, complete with soft fluffy towels! She really supplies everything you need. Very responsive and helpful in recommending places to eat and things to do during your stay. Friendly and fun to connect with.
Carrie has beautiful gardens and shared her raspberries and lettuce with us. She encourages her guests to use the little patio and even provided tiny string lites in mason jars to enhance our evenings spent outside! I could go on and on. We are already looking forward to our next stay! Don’t hesitate to reserve this apartment. You will be so glad you did!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie was the best! She even welcomed us with some fresh picked raspberries from her garden, and invited us to make ourselves at home there. When I forgot a favorite hat of mine at her Airbnb, she offered to mail it to me and facilitated it's quick recovery. We'll definitely be returning!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic apartment in a quiet neighborhood with a beautiful backyard, lots of fireflies, and 10 minute drive to town. Couldn’t ask for a better place to stay in Harrisonburg. I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to other folks needing a good sized space with full laundry appliances, elegant bathroom, and a full kitchen. Host family upstairs above the apartment is very nice."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We drove across the country to Virginia and stayed at many Airbnbs, and can honestly say that Carrie's place was the best one of all. It had everything that you hope for - a comfortable bed, awesome shower, space to stretch out, a functional kitchen, nice neighborhood, and of course, affordability. What put it over the top for us was the aesthetic appeal - we felt good being in the space. All of the elements - furniture and decor - come together really well; Carrie obviously has a great eye for decorating and really cares about providing her guests an excellent experience. In our opinion, she's earned the super, super host award. Thanks Carrie, well done!!!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the coziest, homiest airbnbs I’ve stayed at. Super clean, spacious, and a great value in a great location. Would 100% stay here again."

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carrie’s place is such a lovely long weekend find. The place is modern and charming and feels like home. The host family lives above the apartment, so expect that upon arrival. Everything you need is present in the apartment. Would definitely recommend!!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little apartment! Pretty close to downtown, but quiet at night. The host is great and there are so many little things in the apartment that let you know she cares a lot about her guests!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"close in, but private and ""away""--You won't be in the country but in good weather you will have a deck, and yard and a garden to view and enjoy. Very walkable to EMU and to a grocery store. A short drive to downtown, local food at a co-op, Farmer's Market (growers market year open year round on Saturdays) or to a roadside stand. In not-so-good weather if games are your thing, then you have your choice of puzzles or online games.
Carrie always responded to my messages quickly."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a truly lovely stay in this beautiful home! Thank you for all of your hospitality!!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This basement rental was perfect for our weekend stay in Harrisonburg. It was a short drive to downtown in a very quiet neighborhood.

We can’t wait to come back!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s real cozy. For people who love small but private places, this home is a winner. With a well stacked kitchen, fresh bath, cozy bedroom we had a blast in there! Looking forward to go back again"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space and great value. It is close to downtown restaurants and about an hour from Shenandoah park and trails. Just a warning. The family upstairs does live with a dog and kids, so you will hear them practicing piano and playing, however, they keep to the quiet stated so it was definitly not a problem for us. You will be able to get a great night's sleep and feel like you have wonderful neighbors. :)"

It felt like a cozy apartment and even though it is only one bedroom it was a very spacious unit. The washer/dryer is an amazing amenity that I very much appreciated and the bed was BEYOND comfortable. Yes, you can hear a little bit of footsteps from upstairs during daytime hours but it’s no where near bothersome and actually made me feel more at home. Much better stay than a hotel room that’s for sure! Thanks again Carrie."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was incredibly clean, cozy while also plenty of space to relax, and it was in a peaceful, residential neighborhood with beautiful views of the mountains. I was taking a week-long trauma course at EMU (a brief walk to campus from the apartment) so was grateful to have a relaxing place to come back to each night to decompress, cook my own meals in the full kitchen and prepare for the next day. It was exactly what I was hoping for. Carrie is wonderful and very quick to respond to questions. Check-in and check-out was super easy too. I hope to come back again soon!"

In the evening, we enjoyed watching movies on Netflix. The room is big and the bed is super confortable.
Thanks you Carrie"

The apartment was especially clean and neat, the bed was comfortable and there were a lot of nice touches and amenities, including some cold bottled water in the fridge. . At the last minute we found out that my brother in-law would need a place to stay for a night and Carrie helped make that happen.

2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying in Carrie’s apartment was perfect. Although technically a basement apartment, it doesn’t feel basement-y.

Quiet and safe neighborhood. It’s a short and easy walk downtown to tons of shopping, bars, restaurants, farmers market, etc.
The space is completely updated, very comfortable, well appointed and spotlessly clean.
The host was very communicative and accommodating. He took the time to provide two very helpful welcome books full of great tips, local recommendations, etc. Definitely take a few minutes to read through them - They are very well done and spot on.
There’s parking for two vehicles, but, just a heads-up: it is a narrow driveway. Our Honda pickup fit, but it was tight. Consider a smaller car if you have the option.
Overall, a great find. Would definitely stay again.
Thanks!"

Josiah was responsive and gracious. The suite is beautifully decorated, the bed is super comfortable, there are extra/different pillows in the closet, the kitchen is nicely appointed, etc. Run, don't walk, to book here!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed my stay! Would def come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place exeeded expectations! Josiah went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The rooms were comfortable and roomy and having coffee on the porch watching and listening the birds was a great start to each day!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good spot
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Josiah's place was great. He was extra accommodating with a late check-in and left a bottle of wine for us to enjoy after a long day's drive. His place was clean and a perfect stopover on our way.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The suite was lovely, spacious, and immaculate. It was nicely decorated and comfortable, especially the bed and pillows! The mini fridge did a great job of housing the food items I brought. I liked the checkin process-- just receive a code and tap it on a keypad. I also appreciated how careful Josiah was to check on me and fill me in on stuff. He is also open to feedback, which is very nice and means an even better experience for those who follow me."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was truly spotless. Yet, still comfortable and cozy. They have everything you could need (other than room darkening curtains, no Airbnb has those, whhhyyyy???), they even have a fan (!!!!), a white noise machine, and extra pillows (which for once we didn't need because their pillows were actually awesome!). They were communicative, friendly, and accommodating. Wonderful place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,A gem is found! This home was perfect for our overnight needs. Quiet and relaxing.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our one night stay at Josiah’s was more than I could have asked for. We aren’t far from home but didn’t want to drive back while my daughter was attending a two day camp at JMU. Hotels in the area were pricy and more than we wanted to spend. Josiah’s space was perfect for my daughter and I! Wi-Fi worked perfect for me to get a little work done in the evening, was able to access my work VPN with no issues! Loved the ice in the freezer and book of recommendations. We got bagels from the recommended spot and they were AMAZING. The house is secluded private and quiet but still so close to town. The bed did make a little noise when getting in/rolling over etc. wasn’t problematic to us but was more worried about noise upstairs for Josiah :-) Thanks for everything!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were visiting friends nearby and this was the perfect place to stay with our baby. There was a huge closet that was just right for our pack and play. The separate entrance made it super easy to come and go as we pleased without bothering anyone. The space seemed brand new and was immaculate.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing suite in a beautiful area. Just outside of the city but a very quick drive into the heart of town. Grab breakfast in town but bring it back so you can sit outside and watch nature all around you. Don't be surprised to see a dear while out.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect Air BNB in a beautiful area near Harrisonburg close to wineries and a lavender farm.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow this place is amazing! High ceilings, and is more spacious than it looks on the photos. Lovely place to spend the night."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Josiah's place was a beautiful, peacefull place to stay! Wish we could've stayed longer."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Josiah & Samantha's place is lovely. We stayed here on on our way down to NC and liked it so much we stayed on our way back. The space is very comfortable and the surrounding area is lovely. They were very quick to respond and provided great suggestions for places to dine. We would stay here again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed at Josiah's place as a halfway point on a long trip. We attended late and were so grateful for a comfortable spot to rest.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, so close to everything but tucked away nicely."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this Airbnb. Josiah was super friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The suite was really nice and we agreed it was much better than a hotel! Noted from another review, it can be a little tricky to find the first time, especially during nighttime - the driveway is a couple hundred feet farther up the road than Apple Maps said and when the driveway splits, stay to the right! There is marked parking and stairs going down to the suite. There is a little bit of noise overlap between the suite below and the main house above due to an air vent running between the two - not a big deal but good to note (there is a portable fan provided if you need a little extra white noise when you sleep).
Josiah provided great food recommendations and was super responsive during our stay. We stayed here to be close to Shenandoah National Park. The Airbnb is a little over an hour from the top entrance and 20 minutes from the closest entrance. We highly recommend staying with Josiah!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and host was great
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed over JMU graduation weekend and this place was the perfect getaway from all the craziness of the weekend. Peaceful and very relaxing stay, close to campus but just far enough away for some rest"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and had everything needed for a private guest suite, including microwave, small frig with freezer, coffee maker, table and chairs with window view. Comfy bed, sitting chairs, wifi, and TV. Bathroom was exceptional with a heat lamp which was great."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"2nd stay at one of Josiah’s Airbnbs and will always choose his on our visits in the area if it isn’t booked. Superior place and host! Peaceful, private, with beautiful scenery and wildlife to match. Space was absolutely beautiful! Thank you Josiah for another wonderful stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great visit at Josiah & Samantha's private space. I would love to have a view like that outside the front door, a green wooded area perfect for this time of year (April/May). I've stayed twice and these hosts are really communicative and it's easy to see they want their guests to have a supremely comfortable stay. I'm going to recommend them to anyone coming through this area for sure. Also the neighborhood is lovely for an afternoon walk, lots of nature to enjoy!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Josiah was a great host. Room was as described and check-in/check-out was a smooth process.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place. Deer right outside of your porch door! The suite was clean and private.
There are quite a few steps going down to it so if steps are hard for you, pack light. Josiah was super nice. He was readily available and communicated quickly. He also has a great list of places to go eat in the area if you get hungry!
If you need utensils or dishes, those aren’t provided so be sure to bring your own. Also, extra K cups for the Keurig."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is super cozy and worked for my short stay. Tucked away in a beautiful green residential neighborhood, the home itself is very private and has a great small patio view on an expansive green backyard. As the home is new construction, everything is well-appointed. Josiah and his family have a friendly golden retriever on the property who is the most handsome friendly pup! Easy parking, keyless entry, I highly recommend this private space."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I always love staying with Josiah and Samantha! They’re very welcoming, communicative, and thoughtful. The space is beautifully designed."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here 2 nights. my and I this place! There's a shared driveway with another house and our nav took us to the other house first (but it's the house on the right!) Once inside, everything was immaculately kept. Our only issue was no silverware in the kitchen. TV is wifi only, so we only managed to watch LG channels without having to log into the subscription channels. Not really a big deal, but just a heads-up if you're used to a guide-full of cable channels to surf through. All-in-all, a great place to stay and we would definitely consider staying here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fabulous place to stay and exactly as pictured. Clean, safe, well equipped place to stay. Make sure to visit the lake down the road while staying, a nice walk!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Josiah’s place was just what we needed! Quiet place in a private neighborhood. Felt just like home! This is a good 25-30 min drive from Ski Resort and Water Park so this is a perfect option for a stay if everything is booked around the resort. Will definitely go back here if I am in the area!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Patricia's husband met us at the door to show us how to use the entry lock and show us the location of the room. He stayed to point out the amenities and checked to see if we needed anything else. A small, clean, comfortable compact space in a great neighborhood.
We had time to walk to the nearby park and was impressed with all the different spaces it had to accommodate everyone - a great playground, small groups engaged in a variety of sports, a number of park shelters, walking trails, etc. Wish we had more time to explore the area.
We would certainly stay here again."

Everything was well thought out! We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the Little Yellow House."

Thank you for your hospitality!"

This place makes us feel like home as well-Cozy and you got everything you need here. You can tell they’ve taken each comment serious and kept improving this cute little spot. We absolutely love the portable table, good for work/movie time/eat while you’re still in bed!
Lol we also got lots of recommendations for where to eat, fun things to do in town. Also, it took us 50-60 mins driving to Shenandoah NP, nice spot to kill time and get away from city. Would highly recommend to stay here for your road trip and have a nice chat with them :P"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I met and communicated with Victor during my overnight stay. He met me promptly at the clearly marked Airbnb parking entrance and showed me the space. Everything was very clean and comfortable. I would recommend the space for anyone who needs a small space for a short stay.
While the place was excellent and inexpensive, do be aware the space is, as advertised, small. There is also no microwave, or at least not one that I could find. The air conditioner kicking on and off is a bit loud. You can hear footsteps and floor creaks, but there was very little movement in the house and the movement was outside a decent range of sleeping hours. These things did not bother me and I would stay here again, but I could see them being an issue for anyone with sound sensitivities.
There are other nice little touches, such a surge with multiple USB charging points. Water, hand sanitizer, wipes, and a lot of the essentials.
Victor was very friendly and accommodating. I'll be looking to stay again."
