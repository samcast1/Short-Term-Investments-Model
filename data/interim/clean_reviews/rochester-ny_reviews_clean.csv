2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home with the cutest kitties :) This was my first time visiting Rochester and I’m glad to have stayed here, was super cute and offered everything we needed for a nice weekend. Nice and peaceful area with a good walking path around the water."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Totally Recommend it, Amazing Place and very friendly Hosts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, peaceful, and very well-appointed! This place is a gem. Located in the upstairs of a beautiful, historic home, the grounds and surrounding properties are lovely. The apartment had everything needed for a very comfortable stay, and Michael and Laura were very proactive and quick to respond when I had questions. I highly recommend staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt like we made new friends! Mike and Laura are awesome. We will definitely stay in touch and would highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura's place is absolutely beautiful and in a lovely historic district of the city of Rochester, just a short walk from the Genessee River. The house is on a large property with a deep yard, giving a sense of privacy and peacefulness, just a five minute (at most) drive to the heart of the city. We stayed in the Ellwanger apartment, one of three in the home. It was large and spacious, very clean, well stocked and beautifully decorated - and very private. We were invited to use the yard and front porch, and spent a lot of time relaxing there between exploring the city and visiting family, and felt very at home and welcomed.
We enjoyed taking walks along the Genessee River, to Highland Park, and to the beautiful Mt. Hope Cemetery where we found the graves of Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglas - all within a short walking distance. Several restaurants are also within walking distance, with many more just minutes away by car.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful historic home that made it hard to decide whether to stay in or explore the city! Everything was clean and comfortable.

This was a great location for our first visit to Rochester -- walkable to cafes and shopping, and a short drive to many other attractions. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, I had a lovely time at Michael and Laura’s place! They were excellent hosts, took time to meet with me, and had many wonderful, thoughtful touches around the apartment. The unit was a great size and the location is excellent. A few kitchen items I’d anticipated being available were missing, and my timing in realizing this didn’t align well with the host’s availability (bad coincidence)— otherwise everything was spot on."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay in the lovely Ellwanger apartment. I felt right at home, and I had everything I needed.

The building has wonderful architectural charm, inside and out. The kitchen was ample and well stocked. The coffee/hot beverage choices were varied, with creamer and sugar provided, and a small supply of cold beverages were provided and welcome. Much appreciated the tips on the neighborhood and especially where to park for the college bookstore. I did take a walk in the back yard and enjoyed the Artistic Catalpa that serves as a lovely centerpiece! I was in for a UR Reunion and this was very close, very comfortable, and very affordable."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My third stay at this beautiful home and I’m hoping to return next time I’m in Rochester. Everything made me feel right at home!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"we never actually met our hosts. but they were very efficient and ensured that we received the information we needed. the house has several apartments in it, and the one we stayed in was very clean and spacious. I do think it was worth the money. we were in town to see family and so the location from a tourist point of view was not important to us. but we do like that section of Rochester.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I almost don’t want to share how amazing this place is because I know once others experience it for themselves they will want to stay here during every visit to the Rochester area. But, since Laura and Michael deserve exceptional reviews, it’s only fair that we share how fabulous our stay was. The apartment more than met our expectations and our hosts were fantastic. They were in ongoing contact without being overbearing and provided clear, detailed instructions and useful information about the area. We are already looking at our calendar to find dates for a future stay!"

2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Charming historical Mt. Hope Ave building, which is readily accessible to downtown and the University of Rochester. Check-in was rather seamless however there were a few stains on the pillowcases when I arrived which were a bit offputting. Had some issues connecting to the wifi when I was trying to get set up for work. And I could hear someone downstairs complaining about me leaving the lights on when I left…(I paid for the Airbnb, therefore, I don’t care to be reprimanded about my usage of the lights, I’d imagine that is factored into the price of the stay — whether I choose to be environmentally conservative with my utilization or otherwise)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend this Airbnb! It is conveniently located to many of the areas attractions. The place itself is just breathtaking and immaculately clean. It was better than the pictures could even reflect. If we are ever in the area again, we will be back!"

Great value, nice large living space and homey feel, easy access with parking in back, safe neighborhood, can walk to UR and stores and the owners really helped us out. We will definitely try to stay here again in the future when visiting our student at UR. Thank you Laura and Michael!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura’s place was so comfortable, charming and clean. The bed was amazing, plenty of pillows and towels, and even though we didn’t end up using the kitchen, we could have cooked our own meals with how it was stocked. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay - great location - looking forward to being back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very spacious and beautiful. All kitchen, bedding, and bathroom accommodations were It is an excellent space to work with lots of space and flat surfaces to utilize. However, the internet was a little fidgety here and there and of slightly lesser than average speed. It was generally very quiet except for a lot of movement sounds from another floor around 8am on a Sunday. Typically this would not be an issue for us, but we were working at a gaming convention, up late the night before, and needed to sleep in a bit. Earplugs solved this issue. The location was great. It is near pretty neighborhoods with historical houses and also near some cafes and restaurants while being close to the university. Overall, a very good value."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb is a gem. Excellent hosts. Ideal setting. Comfortable and beautiful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My favourite place I’ve stayed at. Bed is very spacious and comfy, lots of privacy and very clean inside and out! Neighborhood is beautiful and the price was definitely worth it! We didn’t want to leave:)

We highly recommend staying here!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was simply a privilege to stay in this majestic and historic mansion. Enough space to make you feel like you never left home, but views of the yard which closely resembles a municipal park! And I could not leave a review without mentioning Gus the gray cat who was always there when we wanted him to be and obligingly gone otherwise--what a cool host! You can look far and wide but you will never find a more inviting, beautiful, and perfectly located BNB in Rochester...."
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient location for families bringing students to U of R or RIT. In our opinion, better than any hotel in the Rochester area.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Michael and Laura were great hosts! Beautiful home with lots of household touches that made us feel at home. They had wonderful communication and easy check-in / out. We will be staying again when in Rochester!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find. This is in a beautiful historic residential area adjacent to UR. The apartment is lovelier and more spacious than the listing shows even - the living room can totally function as a second bedroom (with a legit twin daybed with trundle that also functions well as a sofa) - and the eat-in kitchen space leaves a place for hanging out when/if the living room is in use as a bedroom (by, say, early or late sleepers). Well appointed and supplied, and the proprietors are extremely considerate, clear and prompt with communication. If I become a UR parent, this will be my go-to place when visiting my kid at school."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura’s apartment could not have been more comfortable or delightful. Within the historic home, it is beautifully and amply furnished. Each room is tastefully decorated, and its historic charm impeccably maintained. Furnishings provide all the modern-day comforts—it’s a hand-in-glove experience combining the two eras.
Though I did not meet our hosts, they were wonderful with communication before, during and after the visit. They were clearly ready to respond should there be any need and extended a warm welcome that was felt throughout the stay.
This was a wonderful experience. I would recommend it without hesitation!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house exceeded expectations. With a beautiful decor and arrangements, the house is definitely a hidden gem. We had everything we wanted and more. Laura and Michael have a wonderful place and are super nice people."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spacious apartment in a great location. Great place to stay in Rochester
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a retreat and peace for a couple of days. I could not have found a more lovely home, location and beauty. I was so taken in that I made another booking before I even left! The owners are wonderful, kind and extremely responsive. If you want perfection, it’s found here."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was the best place I’ve stayed at hands down. Michael and Laura where great and answered any questions i had right away. There home is beautiful and very clean and makes you feel like your at your own home. There place is close to everything you need to do In Rochester and only a hour away if you want to go watch the Bufflo Bills. They even went out of the way to take the ice and snow off my windows early in the morning. Thank you Micheal and Laura and for your help with anything I had to ask and your suggestions of where to go to eat and have fun.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,It was a beautiful place. Has everything you need.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those places that you want to keep to yourself! We loved this place, it's very charming. There was lots of room and everything was very comfortable. The living area and kitchen were on one side of the hall and the bathroom and bedroom on the other. The living area had a door so if someone is staying on the trundle, they can have some privacy and quiet. There were hammocks and tables in the large shaded yard, but unfortunately, we were too busy to enjoy them. We drove a large F150 and had no problem getting into the drive and parking in the back; plenty of room to park and turn around. It was quiet.
There's plenty of places close enough to walk to eat and Highland Park is very close."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay at Michael and Laura’s home. This time in the beautiful spring weather we were able to enjoy the front porch and hammocks! Excellent location for Lilac Festival and biking around Rochester. Laura is very good communicator if you have any questions she responded very quickly and certainly makes us feel welcome.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, spacious apartment in a historic home. The bed was very comfy and the bedroom quiet. Shower was great with lots of towels provided. The kitchen well-equipped and the kitchen table was a sweet place to sit in the moring and have some coffee. Plenty of worry-free parking and a beautiful yard which I didn't use but it was relaxing to be surrounded by such beauty. Within walking distance to great restaurants and places to explore. Nearby Mt Hope cemetary is a great place for history buffs to wander. Thanks for your hospitality, Laura and Michael!"
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find! The location was amazing, and for the price, it was a large amount of space. My only critique is that the space could have been cleaner. A good vacuuming throughout, and some dusting in the corners would go a long way 😊"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment at Michael and Laura’s was beautiful and spacious! It was very quiet and private. We truly enjoyed our stay in Rochester!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. This is our second stay here. Perfect for our needs. Close to where we were going. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Thanks much
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael and Laura's space is totally beautiful and they pay special attention to making sure it is extra clean and ready for your arrival. You couldn't as for more helpful and flexible hosts -- and they always get back to you very quickly (both during the reservation process and once you are already there). This is also a great location -- close to a great city park and a number of great restaurants.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura's place was just amazing- high ceilings, high doors, huge rooms and everything else you would appreciate when you are staying in a new place to be comfortable. Thumbs up, cannot wait to stay in this place again."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,A very clean and spacious apartment in a brilliant location. The network of walking trails along the Genesee river and Erie Canal is just steps away. Downtown Rochester is also within walking distance along these trails. Michael and Laura were excellent hosts.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is absolutely beautiful! The high ceilings and the period correct details were lovely, blended perfectly with modern amenities. It is well-appointed and even small things are thought of. (The basket of cozy blankets in the living room especially impressed my daughter!)
The location is *beyond* convenient to pretty much everything you could possibly need."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place and I highly recommend a stay here. Michael and Laura are gracious hosts and I even got a tour of their house. It is magnificent. The apartment is clean, spacious and well appointed. The location is very convenient to UR and local attractions and restaurants. We will return!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment was very spacious and sparkling clean! Michael and Laura were quick with communication and made the check-in/check-out process a breeze. The home and property are beautiful. I believe there were a few other people staying at the house at the same time as me but I honestly didn't hear or see anyone else over the few days I was there. It felt very private. The apartment was bigger than I expected and extremely welcoming and comfortable. I will definitely try and stay here again next time I am in town!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the best Airbnb property we have stayed at. Almost afraid to leave too good a review for fear we won’t be able to find it open to book again! It is a truly wonderful apartment to enjoy. The setting is quiet, relaxing, and peaceful. It has been beautifully renovated with a lovely artistic style. Spacious grounds to enjoy as well. Our hosts were friendly but not intrusive. Really can’t say enough positive things about our stay."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great stay. Master bed was really Comfy and everything you need is in the kitchen. Views from the workspace were great. Will definitely stay again!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, stylish and well kept historic property. Very clean, with helpful touches like shampoo and body wash, and recommendations for activities in the area. Huge, beautiful backyard with hammocks, Adirondack chairs and tables with seating for six. Walking distance to the South Wedge neighborhood, and a number of bars and restaurants. We mostly kept to ourselves, but check in was very easy, and Laura made a point to introduce herself when she saw me outside. We have a number of friends in the area, and we have recommended Michael and Laura's property to them for when they have family in from out of town. Thank you, Michael and Laura, for a lovely trip!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful, spacious, and beautiful place right next to the University of Rochester/Strong Hospital and Southwedge and minutes from downtown. Would definitely come back during my next stay."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We were a bit unsure that this space would work for us and our two girls (ages 14 & 12), however it was exactly what we needed for our full month stay.
Laura and Michael are super easy to get along with and give great advice on things to do in Rochester.
Free use of outdoors, their grill and their laundry room - we brought our own laundry soap but they were easily willing to share theirs ...
The backyard is a dream - the house sits on a full acre and we had free use of grill, outdoor seating in front and back and fire pit (which we sadly didn’t get around to.)
Our 2 room apt rental is upstairs in the back of the house & just what we needed as far as privacy and space. If we come back to Rochester (which we fell in love with) we would definitely be contacting Laura and Michael again."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Beautiful home with a wonderful location. Huge yard and outdoor space for the city. Spacious apartment. Would highly recommend.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They were simply amazing nice space love it
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This a roomy and comfortable spot in a great location.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place! It was huge and nice and close to the action. I’d definitely stay again!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is clean, comfortable, cozy and well-located. It felt like (a very very nice) home from the moment we stepped in! Spent four nights there and always looked forward to our time at the apartment. Michael and Laura were great hosts --- always responsive and accommodating. Great spot to go on walks from, close to lots of food options and bars."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I really can’t thank Michael and Laura enough for their hospitality and beautiful space! The pictures do not do this apartment justice. It is very clean, with all the amenities listed, high ceilings, and all at a great price! The cable TV is a nice touch, everything works great, the bed is extremely comfortable, I could go on and on. But besides the awesome apartment, the house is centrally located and within walking distance to Collegetown and close to downtown Rochester. I enjoyed being able to walk the Genesee River Trail (when the weather was nice since I was here during the winter) and also walking in the Mount Hope Cemetery. There’s so much to do and I only caught a glimpse in the 8 weeks I was there. When it snowed, Michael cleaned off my car, and they always had the side walk shoveled and iced. Both were quick to respond and gave me some local travel tips since I’m from out of town. If you’re coming to Rochester, this place is a must!!! My best Air BNB experience to date."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful house. We loved staying there. Thanks for an amazing stay!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura's space was great!

I highly recommend for anyone to stay at their place."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really great apartment in an amazing historic house. We were very comfortable and it had everything we could need! Plus there were friendly cats greeting us on the way in and out.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful old home that surely has a fascinating history. The apartment is clean and comfortable, spacious and inviting. It's perfectly located near U of R and a variety of pubs and restaurants. A wonderful place to stay in Rochester!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed in Apartment No. 2 for two nights and were very pleased with our experience in this lovely Victorian style home. The apartment is spacious and comfortable. The extra touches they provided were definitely appreciated. Check-in and check-out were very easy. We would definitely stay there again next time we are visiting our son in Rochester!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura's place is a spacious apartment with all the character found in a lovely big older home. There is convenient parking on the driveway. The location was perfect, easy short drive to RIT and walking distance to some great restaurants like Swiftwater and Dinosaur Bar-B-Que and attractions like Mount Hope Cemetery. We were visiting Rochester for Brick City Weekend and were close enough to walk to the RIT hockey game at the Blue Cross Arena. We loved staying here and this will be our first choice for lodging whenever we visit Rochester!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely historic home in a great location close to medical school. Very easy check-in and communication with hosts. Very spacious.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great location in a beautiful historic home. It’s very close to the University of Rochester. The apartment was very spacious!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay at Michael's place was stunning, an old 1840 house with a very artistic touch and the owner's taste.The surroundings are spacious and the garden is large.Michael's daughter has three lovely cat.If you are willing to cook by yourself, there is also a full set of utensils.We cooked a Chinese meal for the kids this time which was great."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Laura and Michael’s place. The space was big, bright, beautifully decorated and comfortable. It was sparkling clean! There were lots of lovely touches and over the apartment. The bed was comfortable quite spacious. I highly recommend staying here."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great stay! This is one of my favorite Airbnb places we have stayed. It’s old and charming but well-maintained. Lots of room. Great location within walking distance to places. Highly recommend!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really lovely place and location. Very spacious and warm. I highly recommend.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All other reviewers pretty much cover Michael / Laura's place. The photos make the place seem smaller than it really is (normally it's the opposite). The welcome cats were awesome greeters to the property. And most of all, the communication was fantastic. In most cases they respond within minutes of us asking them random questions. This will definitely be our future go-to place when revisiting Rochester."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This private apartment had a great feel of a classic brick and stone home. The ceilings were all over 9 ft high. Lots of space to sit and think. Comfy bed and lots of clean towels. There were two deer in the backyard every morning and evening, and even a small flock of turkeys stopped and fed in the back lawn. The home is close to many Rochester attractions. I hope to stay again."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We've stayed in both apartments on this property and this is our favorite. It's a lovely place, quite roomy and we felt at home there. Also enjoyed a visit from three young deer on the lawn one evening. On our next trip to Rochester, we'll be back."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura were very nice hosts with an absolutely gorgeous apartment. Despite being in the middle of the University of Rochester area, it felt very secluded, with a private backyard, plenty of parking and a quiet surrounding. The apartment itself had high ceilings, nice touches and a comfortable bed. Every room was wonderful.
They met us upon arrival and even allowed us to check in early to accommodate our early flight into Rochester. Their suggestions for what to do in the area were appreciated as well.
If and when we travel to Rochester again, they are at the top of our list for where to stay."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A charming and large apartment close to U of R. Clean, well stocked, and very comfortable.
At the top of our list for accommodation on our next Rochester visit."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and spacious 1 bedroom apartment. Walking distance from University of Rochester. Near good eating places. Loved the cats. Check-in was smooth. Lovely place 😃
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space, sparkling clean, great location, friendly and helpful hosts. Definitely ask to be shown around the main house if historic preservation is your thing! Highly recommended and we’ll check availability on this one first when next in Rochester."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a short, yet wonderful stay. The location is superb and quiet, and a walk to historic Mt. Hope cemetery is a must. We highly recommend the apartment over a generic hotel experience: Full kitchen, luxurious linens, and cool breeze in the breakfast nook made it special and memorable."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place to stay in Rochester. If you are traveling for business, you will appreciate the quiet space and the easy location with access to everything Rochester has to offer. If you are on vacation you will have many options for walking or driving to local cultural amenities and dining.
Michael and Laura are great hosts. They have a list of restaurants in the area. I would add a stop in to Cheesy Eddies for delicious cheesecake. Mount Hope Cemetery is lovely, as is Highland Gardens. All just a few
blocks away. Wild turkey and a woodchuck on the grounds along with beautiful trees will make you feel like you are on vacation in the country. This place is a treat."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I am completely in love with Michael and Laura's home. The apartment is historic and decorated beautifully. Bed is very comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked. A special touch I enjoyed was the variety of animals at the home. Behind the house is a large yard with many fabulous creatures including deer, groundhog, turkeys, and sweet cats (don't worry if you're allergic, the cats do not come inside). Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home. I didn't want to leave."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Laura and Michael’s place is a beautiful, clean, and very spacious apartment in an old Victorian house that has been gorgeously renovated. The backyard is large and bordered by stately trees, and we were happy to see fireflies during our stay! There is a fairly busy street in the front of the house, but we didn’t notice much traffic noise at night. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom and shower were updated in a way that fit the character of the house. The kitchen was cute and well outfitted. Michael and Laura were friendly, but left us our privacy. We will definitely return if we’re back in the area!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable and clean apartment. Great home base for our weekend in Rochester!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, large apartment in a great location. Easy check in and check out. Lots of information available regarding local spots. We look forward to returning when we are next in Rochester."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would highly recommend this BNB. The apartment was very clean and private. The apartment was spacious and the location was great. There were lots of personal touches that made it a very welcoming and nice place to stay.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Laura and Michael's place exceeded our expectations. Everything was very clean and comfortable. We had no problem making ourselves at home. Laura was quick to respond to our questions and they made check in and check out a breeze. Location was great - easy access to downtown and plenty to do within walking distance. We are definitely hoping to stay here again!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the perfect place to stay in Rochester! It was very spacious and clean. Michael and Laura provide you with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The location is great. There is a lot to do and see within walking distance. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Rochester.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My husband and my 2-year old just came back here for the weekend. We chose it for its proximity to the Strong Museum, but didn’t realize until we were there how central it was too most places we wanted to visit and how charming the neighborhood was.
The apartment is bigger than advertised. It was clean and spacious. Sheets were soft, towels were fresh and new. The thoughtful touches were our favourite: coffee pods to make coffee and a few drinks in the fridge. The kitchen was well stocked with pans, pots and dinnerware. We loved outdoor space too, which Michael and Laura graciously let us use. My toddler loved running in the large yard and my husband was able to play basketball for a bit.
Overall a great stay. I would come back here 100%!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Michael and Laura's place is amazing. Situated in a beautiful neighborhood full of historic homes. Michael greeted us as soon as we arrived. Offered to help with our luggage and showed us around the place. The space was huge, clean and so comfy. We only stayed one night, but I wish we could stayed a week! We will be back!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Mount Hope home is beautiful, and lovingly attended to by Michael and Laura. I've stayed there multiple times and they've come to be my favorite travel-hosts. As such I've come to expect an impeccably clean, well appointed, smartly furnished spot with a fully furnished kitchen. The apartment is on the second floor, and while I have grumbled while hauling my luggage up it reminds me to heed my wife's regular admonishments not to over pack. Being up there puts one in the boughs of many stately trees - an Arts and Crafts tree house...
They have provided a set of hints for the area which, as a once-local-kid, I've reviewed and can recommend their editorial decisions.
Communication is quick and easy."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet apartment in a fun part of town. We hope to explore more when we come again.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura's place was the perfect choice for us. We wanted to be close and have easy access to the U of R, and have a comfortable, private place to stay. We couldn't have chosen better. Thank you for a great stay."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great apartment attached to a beautiful historic home in a historic area. Michael and Laura both made sure I had everything I needed. The apartment was clean and stocked with the essentials. Many attractions are just minutes away. This trip was for business. I hope to be back for pleasure.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding and had a wonderful stay! Michael and Laura’s apartment is beautiful, comfortable, and clean. It is at a great location as well! We got to meet their kitties, Gus and Eli, who are not allowed in but are more than happy to receive lots of love outside! The entire house, like the neighborhood, is so charming and Michael and Laura take great care of the place! We will definitely be staying here the next time we visit Rochester!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and beautiful place!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful house in a great location with plenty of parking. super nice apartment that was comfortably furnished and clean. no complaints whatsoever. we travel to rochester periodically and will absolutely look to stay here again. nice amenities (like genesee beer and water bottles in the fridge plus everything you need to make a good cup of coffee!) information about the area was readily available and we took some of their suggestions and found them right on point.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mike and Laura are amazing hosts, super nice and super friendly. Their house is beautiful and spotless. I booked their apartment for my mom when she was visiting me and she was super happy with the location and the apartment... Will definitely stay there again 😊😊"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a special spot, which Laura and Michael effortlessly provide to the weary traveler. Their attention to detail and easy deportment create a relaxing feel I don't think I've experienced elsewhere.
A pleasure to return to when visiting Rochester."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Michael and Laura's place for 3 nights while we were visiting family in Rochester. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and just as pictured. Check in, communication with hosts, and check out were as expected and easy. The only slightly negative thing for us was the bed, which was firm and uncomfortable to us, but that is a personal preference and does not reflect how we feel about the place overall. The porch on the front of the house is really nice, and if we had better weather we would have loved to take advantage of it. The backyard is also a green and welcoming space- we saw many deer and even a turkey when we were leaving, very charming! Great place to stay in Rochester, very close to restaurants and college town."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A really nice appartement: the living room is spacious and confortable with a large TV (we were not lucky with the weather so it was enjoyable) and the bedroom has a bed so confortable that we are considering changing our back home!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay in this apartment, walking distance to University of Rochester and to cool trendy south wedge The apartment is definitely bigger than one may think from the pictures with plenty of light."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, beautiful, nicely decorated, clean, quiet roomy private apartment with thoughtful touches. The off-street parking is a plus. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely location and residence in a historic neighborhood in Rochester. Close to the U of R and downtown Rochester. Highland Park and beautiful gardens are nearby as is Mt. Hope Cemetery where Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglas are buried.
We had an entire spacious apartment. Very private and quiet. Wonderful experience."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Michael and Laura's space exceeded my expectations. It will be my home in Rochester from now on. The house is extraordinary and the property is gorgeous. You can easily walk to very interesting neighborhoods with historic interest and great dining. The space was bigger than I expected and spotlessly clean. I would highly recommend.
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, highly recommended."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful spot! If this is available, you want it! It’s comfortable, spacious, conveniently located to the local universities, and stylishly designed. The hosts are generous and terrific with communication. Loved the warm welcome from the kitties, too."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Huge and clean! Total bargain for the price!
2019-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Better than in pictures. Great hosts. Very private, yet in a location right in the city.
Highly recommend!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Michael and Laura's place is very clean and comfortable. I'm pretty picky about mattresses and prefer a softer bed. The mattress on the queen bed was great and I slept really well. The space has really tall ceilings (12'?) and huge windows so it is full of natural light. Even thought it's February, we were plenty warm and it wasn't drafty like some historic homes can be. Michael and Laura were super helpful with tips for different Rochester neighborhoods (we were in town to find housing for my son who's moving here next month). I will definitely stay here when I come back! Thanks!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Home away from home. All you need and more. Beautiful, clean space with plenty of space to relax and chill. Sorry I did not have more time there to make the most of it. Great location for U of R. Thank you."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,BEAUTIFUL home in a really nice part of Rochester. Huge space for a good price.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly, I cannot recommend this apartment highly enough. It was so beautiful – more beautiful than it appears on the Airbnb website, immaculately clean, and beautifully appointed. Architecturally, it’s a very interesting space, with extremely high ceilings, beautiful unusually tall doors, and flooded with light. Michael and Laura were extremely responsive, getting back to me within minutes of my communications with them. They were very generous and offered us a tour of the beautiful first floor that they have lovingly restored. The location is great, the neighborhood elegant, and check in and check out were a cinch. I will definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed over a week,Lovely place to stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in the park ave area
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great quiet place to stay in Rochester! Hosts are responsive and give help and advice when needed.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had such a lovely stay at Michael and Margot’s place! The loft was comfortable and spacious, and Michael and Margot were wonderful hosts who went above and beyond when I had a question about anything at all. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A delightful loft apartment in a fantastic neighborhood. Highly recommended!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I contacted Michael and Margot very late with a booking request and they were very responsive. They were very helpful ,understanding and I appreciate it a lot !!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My stay at John's Loft for the month of August was incredible. The house and the neighborhood are truly unique. Being on the third floor gives you a feeling that you are hidden away even though you are right in the city and can walk to many places. The skylights are a huge positive. Even though you are in a one-bedroom, attic-style apartment the natural light is beautiful. Also, the loft was larger than I expected which was a nice surprise. Michael and Margot were super responsive and friendly. I felt really at home. Some of my favorite local places were Apogee Wine Bar, Roam Restaurant, the Science Museum and Planetarium, and the Fragrance Garden. All of these places were within a 5-minute walk. It was also great to have a covered parking space. There are 2 flights of stairs to get to the loft so if you have knee problems or back issues the loft is probably not the best choice. 5 stars I'll defintiely be back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Michael and Margot were super hosts. Always responded ASAP for requests and instructions. We had a coffee pot confusion and Mike had a french press at our door in a blink. The location was perfect for us, in the heart of the Park Ave neighborhood, plenty of restaurants, easy walk to the park and museums and easy access to the highway. We would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Michael and Margot are seriously some of the loveliest people I've had the honor of being my hosts. They're extremely responsive and were there to make repairs whenever needed.
The loft is very comfortable and spacious with a well-stocked kitchen and other amenities. In addition to its walking distance to numerous restaurants, the loft is also in a beautiful historical area. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who'd happen to be in the area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Fantastic place! Would stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lots of space and everything was as listed. Area was really good to walk around and very safe.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a very clean and accommodating unit. For convenience, it has an all-in-one washer/dryer. The area is quiet and peaceful."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Michael and Margot have a beautiful, private space. It's quiet and cozy and they are fantastic people, you will feel right at home!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a lovely stay, it was quiet, cozy and comfortable we had all we needed. It was spacious and exactly what my partner and I were looking for in our two week stay. The bed was comfy and was really just a good place to relax in. We hope to stay here again in the future."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our little ""home away from home"" for a week while we travelled to Rochester to drop off our son for his freshman year at RIT. The location is key because you are steps away from a variety of restaurants and can even walk to museums, like the George Eastman House. With off-street parking, you can easily come and go without worrying about parking your car, because this area off Park Ave is popular and finding a spot on the street could prove challenging.
The hosts were nice enough to allow us to use an additional off street spot for one night before our son took his car to college. We really appreciated that nice gesture.
The loft itself is clean and cozy. We had plenty of room for the two of us and with a kitchen, we even ate a few dinners of leftovers a few nights and just stayed in after a few long days of college move in and shopping.
Do note that the loft is truly a loft and is up two flights of stairs. For us, that wasn't an issue whatsoever but something to take note of if you have mobility challenges.
In reality, we probably could have had dinner out every night at one of the nearby restaurants and we almost did! :-) We ate at Roam twice and also The Hideaway. The brie burger at The Hideaway was one of the best, based on my husband's review, and I loved the aracini at Roam. Breakfast at the Mad Hatter is just around the corner and they had a variety of dishes along with good coffee (or pots of tea).
We would come back and stay here again when visiting our son at school!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great location and apartment. Hosts are very accommodating and nice.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,The loft was great!! What I appreciated most was how clean it was. Margot and Michael were very pleasant and they were very helpful! The loft is also in a great location! I would definitely stay here again.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A great place to stay, will for sure stay again. Mike and Margo are the best hosts, and the apartments is clean, modern, with all you need to make your stay a pleasent one. One of the best airbnb’s I’ve stayed."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,This place is absolutely adorable and close to so many amazing restaurants and coffee shops! It is also so great having a parking spot off the street because this area is always really busy.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is a great place. Michael and Margot are very kind and responsive. They left a very helpful note with local recommendations. The space is wonderful and has lots of character and natural light. There are two flights of stairs so just be prepared for that and you'll have a great time.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the Petite Maison very much during our stay at Rochester visiting relatives for the holidays.

The river view from the back porch is a big bonus! We will for sure stay here again in the future."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect! i’ll be back thanks
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Rochester for a RIT reunion with friends and a wedding. Location is right next to campus and Jefferson Rd, so easy travel to all the locations we needed to visit.
House was adorable. We used the kitchen to make breakfast and heat up leftovers from Tully's, the shower has some of the best water pressure I've experienced, sectional/living room was big enough for the three of us to hang out on together.
Overall, a really great stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicole's place was exactly as advertised and very convenient to RIT. Would definitely stay there again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really blown away at how nice and well thought out the home was. Wonderful stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Le Petit Maison was perfect for our needs and close to RIT. The place was spotless and decorated beautifully. Looks just like the photos. Highly recommend. Will definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicole’s place was SO clean. We stay often in other Airbnb’s and this place was spotless. The decor was very well done and the location was perfect for the business we needed to do while in Rochester. Right across the street from RIT and close to stores and restaurants. If you get the chance- drive a short drive to Pittsford and have a lovely river front dinner. Will be back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicole’s listing was just as described. Tastefully decorated. Beds were super comfortable and the kitchen was outfitted with everything we needed. Right at RIT campus and a 15min drive to University of Rochester. It was a great location to stay while visiting our daughter at U of R.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property is beautiful. The balcony overlooks the water which is very peaceful. The check-in process was super smooth. I even extended my stay and Nicole walked me through the seamless process. Would definitely stay again when back in the Rochester area!
2023-09-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Cute home. Ok neighborhood. Easy access & fairly convenient to town. Would’ve preferred (2) bathrooms and a dresser or at least a suitcase stand in bedrooms. Living room furniture was comfortable but obvious prior stains on couch. I found the mattresses way too firm. Kitchen was well stocked & we loved the gas stove. Ice maker didn’t work. There were no free apps to watch tv. I had to login to my own Amazon Prime account. When I texted Nicole to ask about possible places to go eat when we arrived she never responded. There was no communication received until the morning that we checked out. Overall it is a nice place to stay for a couple for a few days but not longer in my opinion due to lack of place to unpack clothing, single bathroom, and no real tv. Also cell phone signal inside was poor."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole’s place was exactly as listed! I felt right at home yet as if I was on a mini vacation! Beautiful home, squeaky clean, fresh linens, fully equipped kitchen with necessities, and bathroom essentials. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,La Petite Maison was absolutely stunning! The entire house was squeaky clean and In a great location! The front and back porch made for great spots to relax in the quiet night. We hope to stay again next time we are in the Rochester area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I think the best compliment I can give this place is that we literally booked our second trip here in the middle of our stay. This place had everything you could possibly need, it had lots of supplies in the kitchen, lots of cleaners for every use case, and the bed was super comfy. The bathroom especially was impressive, it had full sized body wash/shampoo/conditioners, sanitary products, etc. Basically, the only thing you would need to bring is your own food and a toothbrush, this place has everything else you could need. We could not have asked for a better experience. Highly recommend this if you ever need to stay in Rochester."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was newly renovated and decorated. They did an amazing job with it. Very open feel with a high ceiling great room right on the river. House was VERY convenient to the RIT campus and clean. Was a great stay and would recommend highly!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host has done everything possible to make it a bright, clean, inviting and a comfortable place to stay.
It has a very relaxing but modern and classy feel when you walk into the cottage...completely my style :-)!
The neighborhood is very quiet and very close to RIT.
What a wonderful surprise to see a well appointed kitchen.
I was able to fix dinners for my son and his girlfriend with left overs to put in the college dorm freezer.
It was such a wonderful experience for all of us!!!
Home cooked meals are very missed when you go to college ;-).
This place was great for me but, I feel if you need closet space for an extended stay you should know the second bedroom has no closet or dresser to put your clothes in.
I am looking forward to staying there the next time I visit my son."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole's place is thoughtfully appointed. I wanted the feeling of ""coming home"" as I returned to Rochester for a funeral even though my family has since scattered from the area. She provided that experience. When I realized I forgot my toothbrush, no problem, Nicole had one. When I wanted to have a glass of wine, no problem, glasses were on the shelf. I would definitely stay at Nicole's again.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place to stay if you want to make unforgettable memories.

Everything was taken care of at the right time in the right manner. We could not have asked for anything more.
2023-04-01,3,Stayed one night,"The photos look much nicer than the house and area actually are. The bathroom was shoddy and needs work with dirt in the floor grout. The view was lovely and it was very quiet. The photos make the home look fairly secluded, but it is an area of many tiny vacation shacks. It was difficult to find, and Maps is very inaccurate for it."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had the most amazing stay! I got the stay and the meal. It was AMAZING! Dan’s food was some of the best I’ve ever had. He lives up to his mentor, Jean George! I’m looking forward to a return visit! His love for food and what he does is apparent. The experience was engrossed with his culture and unique style of cooking. From the music to his choice of traditional fish native to his home country! I can’t say enough about my stay. This isn’t just an air B & B, it’s a. Experience! One that I will never forget."

Loved waking up to beautiful sunsets and taking strolls by the lake. It was just a short drive from Rochester where we were visiting a friend and a ~2h drive from Niagara falls. Dan also cooked for us an EXQUISITE five course dinner that absolutely blew us away. The ingredients, flavors and wine pairings were so well developed and sublime. Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dan is an amazing host and chef. We were delighted and truly impressed with the dining experience he offered. The five-course meal he prepared was delicious, unique and truly the finest dining experience you will have in a private setting.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such a beautiful view and cozy getaway
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The dinner and wine was incredibly delicious!! I loved learning about the history of the house. The location is gorgeous and the house was very clean and comfortable. Dan is a welcoming and gracious host that made us feel very comfortable during the dining expirience and stay. Truly an unforgettable expirience overall!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Dan was a great host! We accidentally locked ourselves out and he was very helpful in getting us back inside quickly. Building a fire on the private beach and laying out there well into the night was definitely the highlight. Would definitely return!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was amazing. Dan had the Airbnb all set up for us on our arrival with the sliding glass door open so the waves of the lake welcomed us. The views at both sunset and sun rise were amazing and the small porch overlooking the lake was so nice to spend time on. The food Dan created was some of the best meals we have had on our travels ( my wife and I always do food tours when travelling). From start to finish Dan did an amazing job not only creating the food but also explaining the food to us and pairing it with delicious wine . If you are looking for a special experience with world Class food BOOK THIS AIRBNB!!!!
Thank you so much Dan for making our 1 year anniversary so special"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place at the Lake. Highly recommended. A little treasure on Airbnb.
The Dinner was extraordinary and the best Food we ever had in America.
Dan is truly a Host as it best!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing night stay at Dan’s Airbnb. Dan went above and beyond to accommodate our special requests (which was a lot!) and make it truly a memorable night stay. The place is very cozy, amazing view and had all the accommodations we needed. We can’t wait to return again soon!
Thanks again Dan A++++"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Dan lives next door was very helpful. Nice cozy spot with a wonderful view. Recommend for a peaceful escape
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the most unique stay ever and most definitely unforgettable!
The house it’s self is right at the end of small street and is right above the water. The inside is cozy and beachy all at once.
Dan was very helpful when helping us park (it’s a bit of a squeeze but manageable) and get settled in.
The hands down best part of this experience is the culinary experience by Nossa Terra. This review could be pages long but to keep it short, the fine dining and wine tasting is a MUST! Amazing food, great wine, beautiful views and a great host to guide you through it all."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing find and what a View!!! House was adorable and loved learning about the history of the area. Dan was a great host and quick to answer any questions we had. He went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. Having all the baby dear show up one evening was icing on the cake :) We will definitely be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was excellent! Dan definitely knows how to treat his guests. We found a bonfire ready to be lit and a view that was incredible! Don’t miss out on this opportunity!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful cottage getaway in a cute and welcoming neighborhood. Gorgeous beachfront, and absolutely incredible food! We can’t wait to come back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the Views at Sunset and Sunrise! Great swimming spot. resting and eating on the deck was great. Slept listening to the waves crash along the shore as the bedroom has full view of the lake! It’s a newer rental so be sure to ask if they have a few things before you plan on cooking. We were told there was bbq Utensils but there was none. No salt/pepper. No regular sugar. Internet needed to be rebooted and signal not great in bedroom. No remote for bedroom tv so hopefully found for next guests. No matter those issues we still gave a full five star. We did leave a four on cleaning because it could use a deep
Clean. Dan had great communication and helped us check in with photos on where to park and enter and He made it easy to address a few issues he resolved right away; like adding a curtain to the bathroom window :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely stunning… you can hear the waves from your bed! Definitely will be back.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time! The views from the deck were amazing, from the waves during the day to the sunset to the clear skies at night for stargazing. The beach itself was really nice, too! The house is really comfortable and had everything we needed for a relaxing weekend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Dan and his cottage was such an amazing experience. Incredible hospitality, beautiful home and view of Lake Ontario. Dan was very accommodating with everything and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. If you’re looking for a little getaway on the lake, I highly recommend Dan and his home. Hopefully be back again one day!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet spot in a real neighborhood. It’s light & feels big with 3 bedrooms, but is also cozy. Gotta take a sec to wax on the kitchen. Most ABnB kitchens are weak. What’s the point of having one if it’s not usable. Avi’s kitchen accoutrements were clearly chosen so that a person can actually cook a full meal. Bonuses: a bag of coffee, boxes of tea, and even a box of spices! A high chair & a step stool. The beds were great. Easy walking to small shops & eateries. My father lives in Roch & this is going to be my home away from home from now on!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and clean, you could tell this was recently renovated! If you have small children I'd recommend bringing a simple baby gate for the entry stairway. So happy we had off-street parking...a lifesaver!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The house looked exactly as pictured. It did beautiful and full of character with modern furnishing and amenities. There’s a flight of stairs to access the space, which was hard for my grandma. There were plenty of dishes, coffee beans and a grinder, and all the basics to be comfortable. My only suggestion would be to change the shower head. It seems to be the one original to the home, which is so charming but not very practical."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is very comfortable to stay at! The interior of home is very beautiful
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,felt right at home wonderful place frfr
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We were the first guests in this rental. It is complete remodeled and essentially brand new. They have a “oops” basket in case you forgot anything you may need. Loved the decorations and beds we comfortable.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay. I like that high ceiling all of the rooms.
Thanks again"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot! Beds are amazingly comfortable and great location.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time staying at Gina's apartment. It was private, clean and felt right at home. I would highly recommend this spot if you find yourself in the Rochester area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Gina's listing in Rochester! Two couples in town for a wedding at The Wintergarden, conveniently located right around the block. The building is also directly next to Dinosaur BBQ, which is always a treat. The unit is very spacious and beautifully appointed with everything you would need for a weekend stay (or longer). They really did think of everything when preparing this place for guests! Gina communicated early and often, which I really appreciated as a planner myself. Overall a great experience! Would definitely stay in one of Gina's units in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gina’s place was spotless and beautiful. Our three year old daughter also had a great time and it was nice to not worry about stairs at an airbnb. We walked to the strong museum. Also did a wegmans Instacart which was helpful for breakfast food. They had robes to use which was nice to lounge around in . The high ceilings were so nice in the building .
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place is so nice and it has everything you need to stay comfortably. Proactive and thoughtful of the host giving instructions and provide everything you need. Great location.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very pleased with everything. I would stay again with this host and would recommend to others.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My niece is in her masters program studying Opera at Eastman. We decided Gina’s listing is our home in Rochester.
Stunning condo. Beautiful but comfortable decor. Wonderful location - loved checking out the river during our stay from the outdoor space.
Beds were 5 star hotel comfy. Kitchen fully stocked. Great super safe location.
We will be back. A real value for people coming to town for performances compared to a standard one room hotel - two bathrooms!!!
Amazing. We loved it. Thank you for your quick and easy directions and prompt communications.
Lisa"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy beds!
Great linens and pillows!
Gym was a nice bonus!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina very responsive
Apartment well stocked"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented two units and both were exactly as pictured and described. The building was very safe, the lobby very welcoming and the units exceeded our expectations. The attention to detail and comfort were excellent. If we are ever in the Rochester area, this would be our first choice."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"nice place, I will come again"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay! Would definitely book it again when I’m back in town.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Home away from home
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Gina's place. The apartment was spacious, clean and had a lot of extra touches like bottles of water and a basket of items in the bathroom if you forgot anything. Both bathrooms were large and the beds and couch were very comfortable. My son attends U of R and we would definitely return to Gina's place when we visit him."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone seeking a five-star experience. Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, this property offers the perfect blend of comfort, style, and convenience. Thank you to the host for creating such a remarkable Airbnb experience. I can't wait to return in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! Only a 5 minute walk to the Strong Museum. Two amazing bedroom and full baths. 15 foot ceilings. Off street parking. We can't recommend this cozy home-away-from-home enough.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,flawless! Will book again :)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an awesome place. There was plenty of room and everything was clean, clean, clean! Amenities were available if something was forgotten, and coffee (keurig) was also provided. Comfortable furnishings too. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina's place was amazing. It was exactly as shown in the pictures. Gina and her team ensured to provide clear instructions before check-in and were always available for any queries. The apartment was well stocked with toiletries (if you forgot something, you would definitely find it here) and more than enough towels in the bathroom as well as snacks/coffee in the kitchen. They even provided makeup removing towels. Every detail in the apartment is well thought of and shows that the hosts really care about their guests having a super comfortable stay. We had an opportunity to view another one of Gina's listing in the same apartment complex as it was booked by our family members who were in town for the same event as us. That apartment had the same amenities we had. It really goes to show that you cannot go wrong with any of Gina's listings. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great stay whether visiting for business or pleasure."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved Gina's place! This was our second time staying at her place and we even rented the place across the hall to accommodate the extended family traveling with us. So spacious and clean and a wonderful location. We were able to walk to the strong museum which was wonderful. Will definitely stay here again when we are in the area!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this apartment in Rochester! The space is beautiful, impecible and just as described. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love staying at Gina’s place when I travel to Rochester. Another successful trip. Thank you to my super host team.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great, walkable to everything and right on the bike path. It is clean and large and stocked with so many extra amenities in the kitchen and bathrooms. I highly recommend it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The apartment was beautiful and so clean!! I really liked how items were labeled that they had been cleaned and sanitized. It had everything you needed and more. We had no issues getting in with the latch app. It was pretty straightforward and easy to use. Very accommodating, they let us drop off some of our belongings and food items prior to check-in time so they weren't in the hot car all day. Nice location, close to a lot of different places. We brought our 3 yr old son and took him to the Seneca Park Zoo and Strong Museum. He had a great time! Enjoyed dinner at Dinosaur BBQ right next door one of the evenings. No complaints whatsoever regarding our time here. Would love to stay at one of Gina's places again in the future!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Overall place was great and you can tell they take a lot of pride. My only caveat is the walls seem to be pretty thin as sounds travel and it’s on a street corner so you may get a bit of car noise or noise from the people that live above. Not really disruptive but did wake us once or twice. If you are fine with that the rest is all positive and the place itself really nice.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot to stay in Rochester! Clean, big, bright apartment. Many things are provided like free laundry, dishes, cooking utensils, Keurig with coffee, some snacks, towels, robes and many more. I highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay in Rochester NY (‘Stylish and Modern’). The apartment is big, and the 12’ high ceilings magnify even more the sense of space. It is spotlessly clean, has a modern decor and it was quiet, despite being in the downtown area. It is walking distance to the Museum of Play and there is a cute coffee shop very close to the apt (walkable). It’s an open layout plan (kitchen and living room). Gina and team left games that we enjoyed playing with our kids and there were many, many, thoughtful touches all around the apartment, such as water bottles, toiletries that you might have forgotten to bring, super soft bath robes and much needed snacks to help our kids. We loved the reclining couch! You could definitely cook in this kitchen and there is a large washer and large dryer in the apt. for longer stays. Communication from the hosts was excellent and response time was quick."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"wow, fantastic place to stay. I came from Canada and was a little nervous renting an Airbnb, but I'm glad I did, especially Gina's. once we got there, we loved the secured underground parking and apartment. then when we walked into the apartment, it was so nice she had everything that you needed, from bath robs to shampoo and conditioner in the showers and little caddy full of stuff if you for got something. If you need to speak to the host, she will get back to you right away, which was really nice.
Yes, I would really recommend this place. Thanks for the awesome stay
Karen"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for a wedding at the Wintergarden and Gina’s place was perfect! We walked everywhere! Coffee place a block over and right behind Dinosaur BBQ! The apartment was super clean and had so many extra amenities! Our 1 year old son loved the snacks and the bathroom extras were so handy! Highly recommend this place!
Gina made sure everything was crystal clear so there were no surprises. Having parking was a plus!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is perfect - it has everything you could possibly want or need. It is well decorated and spacious and has so many extras. I have stayed in many AirBnBs and this one is an incredible value. Hosts were helpful and responsive. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay. Very nicely appointed and furnished. The building is brand new, stylish and ultra clean. I will definitely stay again next time I am in the Rochester area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina and team are excellent hosts. They provided clear instructions and the apartment had everything we needed, including some snacks and toiletries. The apartment was very clean and the extra touches made the stay very enjoyable. I highly recommend staying at this property."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Gina and her team are amazing. Great recommendations for our 1st visit to Rochester. Walking distance to strong museum and quick drive to restaurants and grocery store. Place is large with super high ceilings. Has ever you need. Will define visiting again and staying at one of Gina’s places.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is even better than expected. Gina has thought of all of details to make your experience away from home, as close to being at home. I would recommend this property to anyone staying in the area. It’s one of the best Airbnb properties that I have stayed in so far."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful Rochester stay. Very spacious,
Extremely clean, fully stocked kitchen. The beds are more comfortable than my own bed at home. My family of 5 fit comfortably. Walking distance to the Strong Museum which I highly recommend. The location is convenient, close to dinosaur bbq , highway etc.
Gina has thought of everything and everything was well stocked - if you forgot any toiletries or essentials Gina has you covered.
Thanks for hosting us and we had a great time !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place was luxurious! The tall ceilings, dark shades, comfortable beds, spacious rooms, and lovely decor made for a nice stay. The extra touches - like toiletries, a list of nearby restaurant recommendations, and quick responses took this stay above and beyond. The app to get into the building and unit is for the entire building, not just this Airbnb, so there’s no alternative way to get in. While the app was easy for me to use, my dad did have trouble understanding it, so I’d be hesitant to stay if I wasn’t comfortable with smart phones. All in all, fantastic stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina's place was perfect!! We appreciated the responsiveness and clear instructions. The space was new, clean, loved the tall ceilings and especially all of the little touches - coffee maker with coffee pods, extra toiletries in case we forgot.... Huge thumbs up for this place. We would definitely recommend and would love to stay here again of the occasion arises."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Perfect, central location. Great space."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly excellent Airbnb, with the most thoughtful amenities. My only issue was the app to get in - the instructions from host were a bit complicated. Worked out fine in the end, but after a very long and tiring journey it was a bit much to figure out. Otherwise - everything was perfect."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place was immaculate, friendly, and conveniently walkable to everywhere I wanted to be. I couldn’t have imagined anything that would have made my stay better! She and her crew were great communicators, flexible, and I felt right at home with all the thoughtful touches and the secure access for the building and parking. Would like to come back in future!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay at Gina’a place. Highly recommend it and will be back next time I travel to Rochester.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best suit Bnb I’ve ever stayed in and the best overall experience. I was new to the latch digital lock app - so a bit trouble getting in at first. But after that it was a breeze and easy. Gina was right there via text to help.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the quintessential Airbnb. Great space, thoughtfully supplied with spare bathroom knick knacks. Well furnished, clean and comfortable. I wish all my Airbnb stays were like this."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. They made sure we had absolutely everything we needed! The Nathaniel was a beautiful building giving it a great NY feel. It is right in the middle of Rochester with great sights and many attractions in walking distance. I will definitely be checking out the other listings!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely 2b2b apartment! VERY clean and quiet. Really appreciate the ""supplies"" such as bobby pins, hair spray, and beer! We had a great stay in Rochester. Will definitely recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Could not have asked for a better stay! The host is every definition of a super host! If you needed it this place had it! Super easy check with an easy to use app that got us throughout the building. Lots of places to walk to grab food or drinks around. The host had listed restaurants and things to do close by. Beds were large and very comfortable. Kitchen had everything we needed and more. This is a must stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal host, amenities, location & space. Epitome of above & beyond!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gina is really sweet. She replied message in a short time and prepare everything in a perfect way. I would choose this place to stay again if my friend or family come for visiting. Highly recommended!!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was visiting my daughter at RIT. Usually stay near there. This was a change and a very pleasant one. The patio overlooking the river and dam is a wonderful place to spend a spring weekend. The BBQ place next door is classic and delicious.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great host and great apartment! Gina was extremely helpful and very responsive when we
Needed assistance, the apartment was as per the pics- very spacious, very clean and very secure building.
Would highly recommend if you’re visiting Rochester 👍🏽"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I loved staying at The Nathaniel with my family. The apartment was clean and spacious and the small touches like the Oops Baskets, snacks and coffee variety were an excellent touch. My family and I loved the view of the waterway and the promenade!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay. The place was full of small details and personal touches that made us smile the minute we walked in. Would stay at this place again next time we come to Rochester for sure
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed in Gina's place with our kids and visited the Museum of Play. One night we ate at Dinosaur BBQ, which is right next door to the apartment building. We parked our car in the underground garage when we arrived and didn't need to move it until we left to go home - everything was close by and easily walkable. The unit itself is great - very clean and comfy. Five stars!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ginas place was absolutely wonderful. It was beautifully decorated and large. We easily fit our family of four in the two bedrooms, Gina even already put the crib in the walk in closet to give our 1 year old his own space and our four year old got her own big giant bed. Gina was super clear on instructions and very responsive. She kindly let us check in a bit early because our little one needed a nap and it made our afternoon so much smoother. Everything you could possibly need it provided. It felt more like a hotel with the space of an apartment! And if it wasn't for the snow we easily could have walked down to the Strong museum. We definitely want to stay here again the next time we come to town for the museum!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay. Everything is well thought out for guests and it is gorgeous. Gina was easy to deal with and we’d love to stay here again in the future.

The unit is beautifully styled and provides all the cooking necessities and toiletries one needs. The host has thoughtfully prepared the space for guests. We also appreciate the prompt and clear communication from the host. Our toddler didn’t want to leave!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic stay at Gina's property with our two young kids over the Thanksgiving holiday. The unit was as described, very clean, and she even provided a crib for my youngest. The soundproofing in the building is not great (you can hear the people above and next to you) but that wasn't a huge issue as we always have white noise on at night. We plan on coming here every time that we return to Rochester!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was truly amazing and we didn’t want to leave! The place was thoughtfully curated and intentional about every detail. Gina well anticipated everything to make our stay luxurious and relaxing! The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept on during a vacation (even the couch was nicer and more comfortable than my own couch at home). I highly recommend Gina’s place!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The stay met our needs perfectly! The apartment is very comfortable and the location was perfect (we were visiting our kid who is a student closeby). The building is really nice, with a great outside are with views of the Genesee River. Gina was super responsive and helpful. I only have great things to say about our stay and would definitely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just say “no thank you to the Hyatt” and stay here. We hosted a convention at the center— I scored by staying here over hotel.
Lovely place — crazy high ceilings, all amenities you could ask for when traveling.
Really nice. Access to gym was a plus for sure."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place was absolutely stunning - a spacious, clean, beautiful 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom luxury space. Close to everything with every amenity imaginable. Washer/dryer in the unit, awesome gym in the building. If we ever come back to Rochester, we wouldn’t even think of staying anywhere else!"

Keys were connected to our phones which was super convenient!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most amazing time in Rochester, and our stay at Gina's place couldn't have been better!

She was very relaxed about our stay and responsive. The apartment was styled beautifully. We really felt like we were away on vacation and we had plenty of room for our family of five.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Definitely recommend staying here. The apartment is beautiful - even better than the photos. Very spacious and very comfortably fit two couples and a baby (Gina even provided a crib and high chair for our baby). Gina was incredibly quick to respond and went above and beyond helping us out when we needed it. The walk along the river right outside was peaceful and quiet. Being walkable to Dino bbq is a major plus! There was also a pleasant little coffee shop right next door. Definitely a 5-star stay.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Extremely clean and had everything we needed. Easy check-in and out. I would absolutely look to stay here again when back in the Rochester area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an excellent property! The location is very close to so many things, making the ease of getting to whatever you need very efficient. Gina was a wonderful host-all instructions were very clear & everything worked just as explained. The unit was very clean and well-furnished! I was even able to bake a cake to celebrate our son’s birthday! This will absolutely be our go-to spot, especially when we come in between semesters (our son is at U of R)— the underground parking & indoor fitness facilities are a definite bonus for Rochester winters!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous accommodations. Modern and cozy. Back patio is amazing. Owner is fantastic. A must stay.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb stay at Gina‘s lovely spot was so nice! There was so much attention to the details of what might be needed during the stay and although we did not need much of them it certainly was nice knowing that anything you “might need“ was right there! Gina was also very responsive when I had questions. Being a bit of a clean freak I really appreciate it that the property was simply spotless. We loved having the two bedrooms each with a separate full bathroom so everyone’s privacy was respected! Sitting on the deck overlooking the river was a special treat! We were househunting so the central location made it easy to get to locations, quickly. Thank you so much for a lovely stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is an amazing spot in Downtown Rochester, the building is beautiful and very modern, yet the apartment is very cozy. Spotless clean and comfortable in every sense, the beds where out of this world! Gina is an excellent host, thoughtful, communicates very efficiently and leaves notes throughout the place about how things work… I have never seen this before and loved it!
If we come back to Rochester we will return to this apartment, highly recommended"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This unit was across the hall from a bigger unit we also rented — which was great for us. With the electronic key, we were all able to come and go in each unit because Gina set it up that way for us. New, modern, well appointed."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apt was exactly as depicted or maybe even better in person! Pristine clean! The building is fantastic with great common areas and gym. The apt has tons of extras. If you happen to forget anything don’t worry, Gina has an extra there for you. From the laundry detergent, shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the showers, fluffy towels to the individual bathrobes for use while there. It is a first class apt. Check out Dinosaur BBQ next door too- delicious."

Not only was the apt immaculate, the beds comfortable, the blinds black-out, the kitchen a delight, the sofa reclinable, the location convenient, the ambience peaceful, the bathroom stocked and comfortable and the gym a delight, but Gina was a truly outstanding host, Petra the cleaner a kind and caring person, and every hint of a whim met with immediate resolution. This was honestly a flawless stay."

2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Gina’s place is light, airy, and modern. It’s ideally situated and close to Fuego coffee Roasters, Dinosaur BBQ, Strong Museum of Play and more.
Gina is incredibly attentive, helpful, and responsive. She is detail oriented and provides bottles of water and snacks for her guests. She offered to provide us with a crib for our 21 month old, which was really sweet. Also, she has THE most comfortable beds ever!
Parking is a dream, the space is fairly new, and there are some really lovely views from the building. It’s a bit close to the expressway, so if you’re a light sleeper this could be a consideration, but it wasn’t a concern for us. Definitely recommend her place!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s apartment is absolutely gorgeous, and so luxurious! She has stocked the place with anything you could possibly need, from bathrobes to hairbrushes to seltzers in the fridge. The beds were incredibly comfortable (which you don’t always get with even the nicest of Airbnbs!) and the couch was nicer than the couch I have in my own house - every seat reclines separately! Great place to stay, would totally recommend"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, immaculate. So much attention to every detail for a comfy retreat. Highly recommend! Also, close to excellent restaurants. Gina is an awesome host!!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best Airbnb by far!!!!!! Absolutely stunning lobby and great gym. Beautiful fire pit and common areas, and the apartment OMG - AMAZING. All the little attention to detail makes this stay a 5+ star experience. Gina is absolutely the perfect host, kind, attentive, and solutions oriented. The sheets are soooooo super soft and silky and the showers and bath -wonderful. Great to have laundry on site and if you forgot anything, Gina has thought of it all and has complementary items if needed"

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This Air B N B was by far the best one we have ever stayed at. It was spacious, SUPER SUPER clean, central and had everything we needed to enjoy our weekend.
Also, the bed was INSANELY comfortable and the linens were soft- it was literally like sleeping on a cloud. We looked forward to bed every night.
There are so many things we loved I could write a whole story but I will keep it short. The host responded quickly when we had questions. The place was a A++ and we can’t wait to stay here again the next time we visit Rochester.
P.S. Better than any hotel we’ve stayed at.
Best,
Chip & Olu King"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and well-appointed. Easy walk to restaurants. Underground parking is a plus, especially during winter time."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family agreed that this was our favorite Airbnb thus far. They really went out of their way making sure our stay was a lovely experience.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the best place to stay in Rochester. I can't believe this is even available here! Gina was very easy to communicate with and went above and beyond to make my stay the best. I will recommend her always. I feel super safe because of the ekey - yes it can be a little annoying but it is totally worth it.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place was perfect for our stay. Centrally located, super clean, and many amenities to make you very comfortable. We enjoyed the walking path along the river, and of course the BBQ joint next door. Hope to be back soon."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible. This is what an Airbnb stay should be like - thorough communication, impeccable lodging, all in a comfortable setting.
I 100% plan on going back, much like
that reclining couch. 🙂
Rochester? …more like Wowchester!!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very wonderful place. Clean, spacious and comfy. I love the little bit of extras that the owner thoughtfully added. I flew in from a two hour flight with just checking. I’m glad I didn’t have to buy shampoo and all that stuff. I was also starving by the time I got there (late flight) the snacks were amazing for someone hungry lol good location and easy to find. Gina gave specific information on how to get into the parking garage so it was easy to use.
Bed was very comfy and soft sheets."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina's place was even better than expected, and we loved our time there. It felt like a home away from home, with so many thoughtful touches throughout to make us feel as comfortable as possible. We'd definitely stay here again if we return to Rochester!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was everything that it was described to be and more! Gina was really helpful and communicated very well. Her instructions were clear and helpful.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a very pleasant stay in Gina's apartment. The unit was just as it was listed - clean, comfortable, and spacious.

Would 100% stay here again when in town. Gina is the BEST host!! She was always available to answer questions and gave amazing dinner recommendations. The app for the key/garage was a bit annoying at first but its not too bad. Great location, you can get on the 490 immediately upon exit. Just a really great place!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved staying here. Everything was very nice, cozy, relaxing, and welcoming. The area was perfect and the host was very responsive. This def will be my first choice on my future visits. The host was very generous to provide snacks along with other home condiments that one may forget to pack."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. We'd stay here again. Elegant. This is a nicely appointed unit in a high end building downtown It's perfect. The building is on the river; the unit is on the street side. But there's a large common riverside patio that was usually completely unoccupied. There are two flat screen TVs -- one very large. They're both Samsung. There's no cable provided, but using your own streaming services on the TVs is easy enough. Great location; dining options within walking distance or a very short drive. Great access to the bike trails, and there's a very convenient bike storage room. We loved this place."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,An absolutely perfect experience in a gorgeous place. It had every amenity imaginable. Perfect!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely would recommend to ANYONE renting in Rochester. You don't even feel like you're in Rochester because the place is so high end! Nice deck (grill and lots of seating) overlooking High Falls & community area inside with coffee and plenty of chill space. The apartment itself surpassed ALL expectations. Decorated to the T adorable, lots of little touches in the kitchen and bathrooms. Spacious, clean, comfortable beds/linens/pillows. Played music on youtube on the tv during our stay which was fun for our little girls weekend. Even the couch was SUPER comfortable and our one friend slept there. Owner VERY accommodating and quick to respond. Located in a great location only a few minutes from restaurants/bars. Can't wait to continue to stay here in the future for other girls weekends :) Thank you so much!! The value is 1,000% worth it's price (which is silly once you see all you get with it)."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place looks amazing it’s a bit of a task to open the car gate but overall it was great and super clean! Gina was very helpful and very responsive
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was just absolutely beautiful! So nicely decorated, had literally everything you could possibly think of if you forgot something, even some dreamy-soft robes to use.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gina’s place is beautifully furnished and in an ideal location for exploring downtown Rochester. She left the sweetest, hospitable little touches that made our stay even easier.
Also, the recommendation to Dinosaur BBQ is legit; growing up and living in the South, I didn’t expect such great bbq, greens and deviled eggs as we found there. Delish, and thanks, Gina, for the tip!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location is amazing and convenient! Gina was so responsive.It was a nice touch that she has extra things on hand like hair spray and Advil (both things I forgot to pack).

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Absolutely beautiful!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was beyond our expectations! The location is convenient with coffee shops, restaurants and a museum within walking distance. The view of the new skatepark next door made for some fun people watching and conversation! The Nathaniel Building was beautifully decorated and easy to navigate. The best thing to say about our stay though was the way the host really cared. Gina was accessible, warm and understanding. The attention to detail in the apartment speaks volumes about her kindness! There were snacks and cereal, jars with candy treats, creamers and many coffee choices. The kitchen was well appointed if one chose to cook. The bathroom had a basket with many of the usual forgotten items from toothpaste to a hair straightener! The soap products were delightful and the towels exquisite! We enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep. The pillows, linens and mattress were a nice quality. The decor was light and airy with a bit of whimsy. So good!! You won’t be disappointed should you choose to stay! Thank you for a lovely stay Gina."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was all we could ask for. It’s fully stocked with toiletries, plenty of towels, snacks and nicely decorated. There are restaurants within walking distance that offer amazing food. It’s located right by the Genesee Riverway Trail, so if you’re looking to run outdoors...you’ll love staying here. Gina is quick to respond if you need to get a hold of her."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My second time staying at Gina’s place and it was once again amazing! Great communication and the location couldn’t be better. The apartment was sparkling clean and thoughtfully decorated.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great!! Beautifully decorated, sparkling clean, great location, attention to every detail by Gina!
Highly recommend staying here"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t say this lightly, I’ve been going to Airbnb for 5 years, this was the best place I have stayed. Location, room quality, personal touches, furnishing, they even had bathrobes hanging in the closet and extra toiletries for use in case you forgot something. The pictures speak for themselves, they have nailed the design of this place. It is truly top notch. I would 100% stay again, and highly recommend."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location downtown. Underground parking was secure and a nice feature as it was quite cold during the trip. The apartment is brand new and it’s gorgeous! Thoughtfully decorated with some extra touches that make it feel like home. Views of the Genesee River out of the back windows. I liked it so much that I’ve already booked a trip back!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place to stay. Worth the visit
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was everything I hoped it to be and more. The building was incredibly stylish and esthetically pleasing. It was also a very quiet building, and very safe feeling.
I really enjoyed the keyless entry which made everything simple and streamline.
The apartment itself was gorgeous and so clean. The couch is sooo comfortable I think that was my favorite part of the whole apartment. A couch with adjustable headrests!! Great for movie watching.
The whole vibe of the apartment was relaxing and vibrant. The large windows let in so much natural light. The view of the Genesee River was also a nice bonus. Loved it here. Can’t wait to come back.
Also many door dash options! Visitor parking is a little tricky but manageable. And the Fuego Coffee shop is just a short walk for some delicious coffee."

Best part was the king bed, super comfy with luxurious sheets. Like sleeping on a cloud. I'm a pillow snob and they were just perfect. super close to the BEST restaurants (sinbads, venetos, jines) and conveniently close to blue cross arena for concerts (5 min uber, 21 min walk). Colleen was responsive and very accommodating. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

We booked during some terrible weather so the apartment was quite cold but our gracious hostess had a space heater readily accessible. The apartment was just as pictured and the night life outside of the apartment was lit (great)."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Book it! I’m very particular about hotels and airbnbs but this unit exceeded my expectations! The bed feels like you’re sleeping on a cloud and the bathroom is immaculate. I love the open living room and kitchen as well. This place is super cozy, and the view of the city just ties everything in nicely. Kitchen appliances are squeaky clean and everything you need to cook is there. The design and decor is also very unique not just in the unit, but in the common areas as well. The private parking situation is very convenient considering the struggles of city parking. Colleen is such a great host and is very responsive. I visit Rochester frequently for business trips and I gatta tell ya, this place will always be my go to!"

Having parking avail is really helpful in this area. Super quiet spot in a busy part of the city with easy access to a lot.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Colleen’s place is just perfect. Skyline view, walking distance to everything I needed, sunny apartment, comfy bed, quiet building, great working environment. I hope I will be able to stay here again when I return to Rochester!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Colleen has a beautiful apartment. I will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Based on some of the reviews, and our understanding of the general area, we weren’t sure if Colleen’s place was going to feel safe and quiet. We couldn’t have been happier with the accommodations! We thought the space felt peaceful and had great energy. And it was literally silent to anything going on outside. The view out the windows was beautiful, the parking garage felt safe and secure and it felt perfectly safe to walk to the shops and restaurants that were very nearby. The bed was very comfortable and the space was super clean upon arrival. Colleen’s check-in directions were easy to follow, which made the process simple. I’d definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this condo to anyone visiting Rochester!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great! Awesome location and good views. Colleen was very helpful and responsive.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stunning loft. Clear directions on how to access the property, parking info, rules etc. seamless process. Colleen is very responsive and helpful. I had zero concerns during my stay. Very clean space and the whole experience was 5 star! Highly recommend. This is now the only place I will book when I’m in town! I’ve been spoiled! Lol"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Colleen’s place was just as I remembered, I used to live in the building. She was helpful, and very responsive to all my questions. We had an issue with the HVAC not keeping up to temperature at 70. She ordered a new filter and I was able to replace but it still didn’t keep up. A tech visit will be needed. Besides that very small hiccup, the place is wonderful, close to everything and highly walkable, has a beautiful view, and easy freeway access. Would easily come back for a short or long stay without question."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a refreshing alternative to the dated, dingy hotels in Rochester. The space is beautiful, comfortable, and just like the photos depicted. Colleen is a wonderful host. She proactively reached out to make sure I had everything I needed and was extremely responsive. I will 100% stay here again when I visit Rochester again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best hosts I have had the pleasure to interact with. Any questions answered in an immediate response!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Colleen's apartment was great for a one week work stay. The apartment was spacious, bright and incredibly clean. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here while we explored Rochester and the surrounding area. The loft is beautiful and spacious--exactly as pictured! The off-street, garage parking was a huge plus, and the building was clean and secure. Colleen was an excellent host, providing very easy instructions for accessing the apartment and checking in with us throughout our stay. She's very quick to respond to messages/questions. Overall, we loved it here and would stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for the weekend and very much enjoyed our stay. The space was clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The building is very secure and in a good location."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Colleen’s loft was a perfect week getaway for me and my husband. It was walkable to several bars, restaurants, the Strong museum, Axe throwing…etc. The loft was very safe, was quiet (even with a bar on the bottom floor), bed was super comfortable, and the view of the city was amazing. HIGHLY recommend staying here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,Loved staying here. Would highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time staying here, the location was in perfect walking distance to plenty of things! Recommended it to a friend coming into town soon. Would definitely book again! Thanks Colleen you were a perfect host!"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Simple but nice. It was quiet, the private parking was great, and the space was comfortable."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wish we could have stayed longer - what a gorgeous place, right in the middle of everything, with tremendous views and luxurious accommodations. The place was spotless, the bed too comfortable (my husband had to drag me out of it), and we had everything we needed for a lovely stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Coleen and her team did a great job. I would recommend her place to people wanting to explore downtown Rochester and looking for a safe place to stay. The room itself has a comfortable modern feel with lots of natural light. The parking is convenient and safe. I really enjoyed the walkability of the nearby districts. 5 out of 5!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here. Colleen was very responsive to questions. Everything was brand new, classy, and comfortable (including the air mattress) Laundry facility worked well.
Lots of great food, coffee, drinks, and activities in easy walking distance.
Parking is a little tight if you have an oversized vehicle. Mid size SUV was not too bad, but glad I was not in anything larger. That said, I did feel like it was a very secure parking situation.
The gym has a small, but sufficient collection of cardio machines and weights.
I would, and will most likely make this my go to choice for stays in Rochester."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this spot, close to great restaurants like Fiorella! The place was clean and felt like home, Colleen was super helpful and made sure we had a wonderful stay! Would definitely recommend and even come back again! <3"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot to stay if you find yourself in Rochester! The space is very clean and checking in was super easy with the detail instructions. One thing that really sets this space apart are some of the little things that are provided which include the free laundry, laundry soap, and even a laundry basket, dishes, and plenty of cooking utensils, Keurig with coffee, and plenty of towels and blankets throughout the space. Having your own private parking is a very nice touch when it comes to the downtown area as well. Colleen was very response and did an excellent job of making sure I was set for my visit. If this space is available to book don't hesitate."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and in a quiet building. Will definitely repeat. Fast communication with the host when booking. Very great experience all around! Thank you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was blown away when I walked in to the space. It’s so much larger than the pictures and felt very high end. The views were great and it was extremely clean.

I adored that all the bedding was cotton and that the kitchen had everything we needed. Would recommend and would definitely stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Barbara's House was perfect for a quick getaway for 2. The neighborhood was walkable and it was close to a riverfront trail for a quick run or evening stroll. The kitchen was well stocked for when we wanted to eat in, and the furniture was comfortable. The desk in the larger bedroom was great for remote work. We would stay at Hanna's place again."

L & S"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Hanna’s place was so comfortable and pleasant to live in. She provided many things that went above and beyond to make it feel like home. (Lovely soaps, a refrigerator stocked with seltzers and v-8 juice, cupboards with coffee and good quality olive oil, etc. The furniture was very comfortable and tasteful. The art work was lovely. It had enough in it to not be sparse, yet there was room to put your own things. There were beautiful tea sets. It was a very functional place to stay and had plenty of sun. The porch was perfect on warm October days! Parking and walking to places as well as driving was easy. Hanna was very kind, friendly, and very helpful. I highly recommend Hanna’s place."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome host!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It was our first stay in Rochester very far from our home in Bangkok! The house provided was converted into a welcoming home with so many details, care for the host, and items for every single need/use you could think of. In my entire stay and travel over 50 countries, I never found anyone that could take care of the needs of the host just like you did! We had an unforgettable pleasant stay and would always like to come back.
Thank you for your kind hospitality and we briefly had the opportunity to greet in person.
Highly recommended as the first choice in Rochester for everyone, look no further!
Best regards,
Sameer"

Kitchen was super well stocked and nice to do meal prep in.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay, we will revisit!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay while visiting our 16 year old granddaughter who lives in Rochester. The apartment suited the three of us quite well. The location is an easy drive or walk to many places. An old home with character-a mixture of old and new-lovely updated decor, a well equipped kitchen including a dishwasher, comfortable bedding, good shower. All was clean. Also it was nice to be able to park our car off street in the driveway. We found an appealing collection of books in the flat. We felt comfortable and at home.
We are ever grateful to the Air BNB property owners who welcome pets-our two elderly Brussels Griffon dogs were glad to travel along with us. The flat is up steps, and there is no yard for guest’s dogs, but we managed fine by carrying our little dogs and they found plenty of grassy areas to do their business in the front and along the neighborhood sidewalks.
Hanna was very helpful and communicated well. We texted, called and talked to her at the property. She herself is an interesting person to talk to-energetic, hardworking, with admirable goals and dreams.
In fact, the “Rochesterians” that we encountered were all quite friendly.
Our stay at Barbara’s house was positive and we will definitely stay here again."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Hanna's place at the tail end of our trip through the Finger Lakes. It looked just like it did in the photos except better in person. She has a eye for decorating. We were amazed at how well stocked the kitchen and bathroom were. Her attention to detail was evident. It was extremely clean and comfortable. We met her as soon as we arrived. She had a welcoming smile and is a fantastic host. Highly recommended and would return.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay with Hannah at Barbara's House, and the experience was just as wonderful as our first! A personalized note and a bowl full of snacks greeted us as we checked in and made ourselves at home. The beds are comfy, and the place is the perfect size for us as we stay in town to visit family. Hannah was readily available for questions, and promptly returned my call when I inquired about having my daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter over for dinner on Mother's Day. It was wonderful being able to host my family as if they were coming to my home! Thank you, Hannah, for being so amenable and a wonderful host!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hanna is by far the most incredible hosts—the apartment was not only beautiful, but was supplied with so many thoughtful snacks and pantry items.
Hanna also had incredible food recommendations— every since place on her list was amazing- on top of that— she was always reachable and available if we had any questions. This was a 💎 when we paid for far less."

Hanna was a very responsive host, the place was extremely clean, and there were even some hidden treasures like games and coloring books that make my littles very happy. Highly recommend and would stay again!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's house is the best! The off street parking alone would be worth it but it is a beautiful space, perfectly cleaned and filled with thoughtful touches. The host, Hanna, was quick to shovel all walkways and the driveway after an overnight snowfall. A short walk takes you to the Abundance Food Co-op that is filled with healthy, delicious food choices. I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great! We really enjoyed staying here. It’s very cozy and super cute. I will be staying here again when back in the Rochester area!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful place to stay! Per all the previous reviews, this place was perhaps one of the nicest AirBnb's I've ever stayed in. A thoughtful note and snacks greeted me upon my arrival. The place was beautiful and full of character, and just a super comfy place to hang out during my Rochester stay. Will definitely stay there again!"

I look forward to staying again when I return in May. Thank you Hanna for being such a great host."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hanna’s place is exquisite. It is spotlessly clean and cozily decorated.

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding place!
Extremely cozy and stylish!
Great location in the Wedge!
Close to all Restaurant and bars and activities!
Very clean
Great communication"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara’s place is so special. It truly feels like a home, there are so many artful touches throughout the space that make it feel like a true South Wedge apartment.
A few highlights:
The view of the tree outside the front windows near the couch is breathtaking - we stayed in fall when it filled the window with bright orange, in the summer I’m sure it’s lush and green and can imagine the branches holding snow in the winter and would be lovely as well.
The plants! There are so many that are clearly well cared for.
The art - every wall had something interesting and the entryway was something else, a whole staircase lined with prints and newspaper clippings about the previous owner (a really special woman it seems).
The spacious open concept kitchen.
Privacy - while neighbors are close in this neighborhood, the blinds were great where they were and any uncovered windows didn’t feel like we were exposed.
The couch and TV - we stayed during COVID so a comfy place to stay in was important and this did the trick.
The lighting - there are about a million and one light fixtures and dimmers so we could set everything exactly how we liked.
Storage - the closet in the bedroom is spacious and the closet in the living room held some great games!
Outdoor space - we didn’t end up using it, but the porch off the second bedroom is a perfect addition to get some fresh air.
Parking - Hanna generously offers the driveway and we never had to think about street parking.
Neighbors - this one seems like an odd highlight, but the neighbors had a really gorgeous garden and we really felt surrounded by interesting homes so returning home after a walk or drive was pleasant.
RECYCLING! We have found many Airbnb’s don’t offer the option, so we were really pleased Hanna had a full sized bin in the apartment to collect and an actual recycling can outside to dispose.
Overall would absolutely recommend!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved everything about this little treasure we now consider a home away from home. We can't say enough about the decor, the cleanliness, the amount of supplies and we could go on and on. The location is super convenient to walking trails, downtown Rochester and a whole host of little local shops, restaurants, coffee shops etc. We can't wait to come back again soon!!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Hanna's place! Super clean, very stylish (loved the touches!), extra amenities (snacks when we arrived, packed fridge, plenty of kitchen equipment, tons of blankets and pillows, and board games!), easy and safe check-in (no contact/via keypad, and quick responses from Hanna. We had a wonderful stay."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very homey ❤️ thank you Hannah for your hospitality and putting so much good energy into the place.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend staying at Barbara's house. Hanna is great at responding to any questions or concerns. It was great meeting and chatting with her when we arrived. Everything we needed for our stay was available. House is clean, warm, cozy and inviting. We felt honored to stay in a place that is well loved and that highlights her friend and previous owner. We felt at home being able to make something to eat or pick up something since there is a co-op a short walk away. We are definitely planning future trips back to Rochester and I would definitely stay here again."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect South Wedge location!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I just completed an extended stay at Barbara's House, hosted by Hanna. After several cancelled trips (due to Covid) to visit our first grandchild in Rochester, we finally made it and had a wonderful visit. The apartment is absolutely fantastic!! It has the charm of an older house in a historic and trendy neighborhood, AND all the modern comforts including air conditioning and a fabulous, well stocked kitchen. I worked remotely during some of our stay and the nice big desk and excellent Internet were very much appreciated. As an extra bonus there is an outdoor semi enclosed porch with two large comfortable chairs where we relaxed in the evenings. The apartment is extremely clean and tidy and very well organized. It feels spacious throughout and has enormous closets!
Hanna is a first class host and I would recommend this place to anyone. We plan to return!"

2020-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great space and great neighborhood. Right down the street from a co-op if you need groceries and a delicious ice cream store (hedonist). I was traveling for work, so having the full kitchen and an area to finish up work at Hanna’s/Barbara’s was great. Off street parking was an added bonus, but the real treat was walking into a very cool apartment on a 90 degree day - the two window ACs work well."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This apartment was one of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed in. The location was perfect with a coop supermarket and local shops down the street.

I will definitely be staying at Hannah's place again in the future!

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's house is a beautifully decorated spot with a functional kitchen and great location. The location + off-street parking made for such a convenient stay. Hanna was an awesome host: appropriately communicative and left us a personal note to make us feel welcome and offered her help if there was anything we needed (there wasn't - she already thought of everything!).
We had a cozy, relaxed stay and enjoyed the selection of teas provided. The kitchen had all the essentials for us to cook a few meals. The desk in the bedroom was a convenient touch. We would stay here again without hesitation."

2020-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Simply the coziest location in all of south wedge. Hanna always provides the sweetest touches for local tips and treats. Her kitchen amenities are all you’ll need to whip yourself up those healthy eats. My favorite location to stay while in Rochester.

The apartment is cozy, quiet, very comfortable and a great place for anyone! It was the perfect size for our family with a small child and 9 month old. The location is perfect. It’s less than 15 minutes from everywhere we wanted to go. There’s a brueggers close by, local taverns, coffee shops, the strong museum of play, dinosaur BBQ, wegmans, everything is so easy to get to. We enjoyed our stay so much and swear that when we return to rochester we will hope to stay at Barbara’s place again. Hanna was an excellent host and got back to us quickly. Thank you for having us!"

2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Barbara’s house is as beautiful as it is in the pictures! It was so tastefully decorated and Hanna left some amazing touches with snacks and flowers in the apartment. The place was clean and comfortable as a home base for the conference we were at with such a great location. Thank you Hanna!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hanna is a wonderful host and Barbara’s place is a genuine treasure! Upon check in, we were greeted with a hand-written note welcoming us. There were suggestions of things to do hanging on the frig and games in the living room closet. The apartment was cozy and warm and welcoming. It felt like home the moment we arrived and even had a souvenir glass from a brewery in our hometown! Quite a cool coincidence! We experienced some wintry mix and ice and thought it best to extend our stay by a day. Hanna was amenable to adding an extra day and even went to extra mile and had the drive cleared for us when we were ready to leave. This is by far the best Airbnb experience for our family!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great little place to stay. The little extras Hannah left made it feel like a home away from home.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time staying at Hanna’s place! It’s in a fantastic location, very clean, and Hanna was a very responsive host. I highly recommend staying here in future and hope to be back!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! Not only is the place dazzling clean & stylish, but it is also perfect for a couple or small family. The host, Hanna, is very polite & quick to respond to any questions. A perfect little getaway tucked into some cozy neighborhood streets, only moments from the center of the city. Both thumbs up - would stay again!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great stay. Hanna included so many thoughtful touches and amenities that we weren't expecting. Our kids loved playing with the puzzles, games and books. The space was so clean, comfortable and well designed. The whole place is stocked with anything you would need and so many thoughtful extras. Hanna was helpful and quick with communication. We definitely recommend this place and would love to stay again."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"To start, the response time from Hanna was quick and friendly. Checking in was easy with a door code to the building and key to the apt. The apt was stylishly decorated yet we felt cozy and relaxed instantly. The apt was also spacious and clean. Every room was unique in its own design.
In terms of amenities, in the kitchen, Hanna provided us with coffee, teas, spices, oils, plenty of cookware, the fridge had condiments and beverages for us to enjoy, and snacks were left for us. The bathroom was well-appointed with toiletries, plush towels, and a roomy shower with good water pressure and heat. In the living room, there were blankets and a comfy couch to relax and read or watch TV. We stayed in the master bedroom and the bed was comfortable and there was space to unpack our clothes and hang anything.
We arrived when Rochester received over a foot of snow and it was still falling the days we were there. Each morning, Hanna quietly and kindly shoveled out the drive so we could get out easily. Every aspect had been thoughtfully planned out and executed perfectly. I would definitely recommend staying with Hanna and if we come back to Rochester we'll ask to stay again."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The ambience, coziness and location of Hanna’s home is delightful. The best kitchen to entertain yourself and friends to a good meal. Within walking distance e to all the south wedge eats and treats. The canal pathways are just two blocks away for running and biking. By far the perfect place to stay."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hanna's place is a cozy gem located near all sorts of restaurants and bars in Rochester. We were very comfortable and well-cared for with all the extra snacks, bedding, and amenities. Hanna herself is very responsive and evidently takes care to make sure the apartment is warm, clean, and comfortable. We really enjoyed just hanging out on the couch when we weren't out exploring. Would definitely recommend!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hanna's place is WONDERFUL. Certainly the best airbnb i have stayed at!!! Beautifully decorated, has everything you need, sparkling clean, and wonderful location! She is very responsive to questions and acted quickly when we needed something.
