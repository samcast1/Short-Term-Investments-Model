2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is a great place, super close to the Capitol!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We chose to stay at this house because of its proximity to the Fairgrounds where we spent our days, but we really enjoyed our nights relaxing in this beautiful clean house that was very private. Our two dogs barely barked at all because it was such a quiet neighborhood at night. The beds were extremely comfortable and the single floor layout of the house with the kitchen, family room and dining room in between the two bedrooms made for easy comfortable living. If we ever come back to Springfield, we would definitely stay in this house again!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Adam has a great house!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a place to stay walking distance to downtown this is it. House was immaculate , each room was comfortable to spend time in. Very quiet in the morning there is no traffic driving by and the walks my wife and I did were wonderful. We would stay here again on our next trip to Springfield."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Adam was great to work with, very thorough and not a lot of check out requirements.
The place was very clean and the bedrooms were great - soft beds, great linens, and lots of pillows.
The only complaint is the armchair in the living room was severely stained from a previous guest and the long sofa was really uncomfortable. We spent less than 20 minutes in the living room eating take out and just went to bed early.
This is a beautiful historic home and has been painstakingly restored. It was lovely! With older homes, expect character and a few quirks. The driveway was right next to the back door but you had to go to the front of the house to unlock/lock up.
Otherwise, very comfy stay."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The house had character and was clean. It was a nice central location. We greatly enjoyed our weekend and our accommodations.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great little Gem downtown !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect location, close to everything we wanted to do and easy to get to from things that were further out. We had easy access and off street parking in a nice neighborhood. The house was incredibly clean and well outfitted. We had plenty of things we needed.
If you're looking for a great location in Springfield, this place fits the bill!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Central location and responsive host
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good space/good location
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and clean home with all the amenities to accommodate cooking in a fully stocked kitchen, handle the family’s laundry, relax in the living room, and get a great night’s sleep! We selected this home because it was close to the Bank of Springfield Center (only a 5 min drive) and would definitely stay here again.
Adam, the proprietor, was super responsive and kind through the Air BnB app - his instructions and information were very clear. If you’re looking for a great home that’s close to the capitol and the downtown Springfield area, this home is a winner!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve stayed at Adam’s house several times now, and it’s great."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this house and enjoyed our stay! Host was very proactive and informative. Definitely worth the price!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved The Market Street House! It was clean, cozy, and comfortable. The location worked great for us, being in walking distance to downtown, as well as being in close proximity to Springfield Memorial hospital where we had a family member staying. We highly recommend it!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adam’s home is a gem, conveniently located close to the state capitol and minutes from the BOS convention center. We felt right at home there, and enjoyed the peace and quiet of being in a home rather than a busy hotel. It has all the charm of an older home but is nicely updated with a contemporary feel. We truly enjoyed a restful weekend there."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed at Adam's house, and I'll be back. The location is great if you need to be at the Capitol. Super easy walk."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was great. Super close to the Capitol, clean, and comfortable. Nothing fancy, but met all my needs. As soon as I left, I rebooked for a few other business trips I have to Springfield."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very cozy and felt safe and clean. Would stay here again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This property worked well for our purposes, as we needed extra space to house family traveling here for the holidays. Adam was very prompt and clear with his responses and the property was well maintained!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place near the city and close to the hospital where I worked. No issues but just some things to note. The blinds are hard to put down or some don’t go up or down so we had to buy clamps to put them down. There isn’t much light in the front porch or kitchen if you are cooking. The front door is hard to close unless you pull or push it closed harder than normal. Not a big deal still a great place so I gave it 5 stars.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay and was very clean!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"excellent place and host

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! definitely recommend this location and house. It is a charming historic 1860 house decorated beautifully. The beds were very comfortable. Only little thing possibly some better living room furniture as the sofa and the recliner were a little dated and a little uncomfortable. Checking in and checking out was super easy. Excellent parking in the back and could’ve accommodated three or four cars, area felt very safe I would’ve liked to had a light in the back where our cars were parked. It was a little dark back there and it would’ve been nice to be able to go in and out the back door instead of the front door as our cars are in the back. Would have liked to have had a deadbolt on the front door. Would have also liked to had an inner lock for the door that leads out of the back bedroom down to the basement, which is unfinished. I had to put a door against that just to make me feel a little more comfortable. Awesome stay and so rich in history!!! Thank you to our host!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Nice old house close to Downtown
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,The house was very nice. And there are places to walk around the neighborhood. Steps are a little steep with no handrails except one door on the side has a handrail. Couch was great if you had a young adults there was lots of seating.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic property, could not have been better. Just what we needed for our Springfield and Route 66 adventure. Would definitely stay again when back in the area. 5 stars !!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautiful! The neighborhood rather quiet considering it’s right next to a school, very well lit neighborhood, and the house was clean and had plenty of activities available to use, and plenty space to sit and enjoy each others company. Will definitely use again when I make my twice a year trip as long as it’s available!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We made a three day “Land of Lincoln” trip to Springfield. There was so much to see in the area-most of it free! We also took in some Route 66 restaurants and stops too!
The Market Street House is close to all things Lincoln, the Frank Lloyd Wright Dana-Thomas home, and Old Route 66."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Market Street House was great for our weekend away. Pet friendly with lots of areas to walk our dog. Felt completely safe in the neighborhood. Lots of towels and the beds were fantastic - luxurious memory foam! Easy walk to to capital and surrounding park areas. Great restaurant close by that were open on the weekend including Sunday night. Highly recommend this home.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Adam’s home is lovely and well- maintained, just as pictured. Proximity to historic sites and decent downtown restaurants a plus.

My only suggestion would be to add a curtain or blinds to the frosted window in the bathroom. (Fine during the day, but I felt a little exposed taking a shower at night. )"

Arriving/departing via Amtrak was a convenient and scenic walk past the capitol building. Communication with Adam was clear, direct, and concise. Wifi was speedy for a few work calls I needed to do.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a great place. Quiet and safe feeling neighborhood. Best stocked kitchen of all the air B&B I have stayed at. I have a 3 to 4 month job in Springfield and have been making a lot of trips there and this is the best Air B&B yet.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could write a novel about how wonderful this stay was, I would. This stay was the definition of hospitality. The place was beautiful, clean, cozy, I've never felt so at home at a place I have stayed. Dan was truly the most incredible host. My friends and I were in town for an event through the weekend we had to leave early for everyday. They typically host Saturday morning breakfast, well, since we weren't able to make it, Dan made us scones the night before, labeled them with our names and what kinds they were so we didn't feel like we were missing out. Dan was so kind to our dogs (and they absolutely LOVED him), even though we were staying in his home, he made us feel like it was our home too. You can't get a better stay than this and we can not wait until we get to stay here again. 20/10 would recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cal’s home is absolutely beautiful! Every comfort was considered. Linens, fans, toiletries -everything. We were very comfortable and will absolutely be visiting again. We look forward to it! The drive around the lake is a gorgeous added bonus."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kind, flexible host with reasonable expectations. Will stay again when I am in town. *SHOOT FOR SATURDAY* as the down home cooking offered will soothe the soul! Thanks?"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cal & Dan
Opening your home to others to appreciate offers great comfort and a welcoming atmosphere. Your home is a museum of interests and presents many interesting places to relax including multiple porches viewing the grounds. You’ve thought of everything to make any guest feel at home. We look forward to our next visit as part of our next travels. M&M"

Highly recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place. If I were to describe it with one word, it would be 'comfortable' -- the bed, the oversized luxury living room couch and loveseat, the carpet we walked on in stocking feet. And Dan made us feel comfortable with his concern for our wellbeing and his warm conversation. We can't wait to return for a longer stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down, the best Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Above all, Cal is a most gracious host and super nice guy. You can tell he loves his home and sharing it with others. Top-notch amenities, beautiful decor, super nice kitchen you can use (with a crazy fancy coffee machine that makes the best cup of joe!) and plush, comfy beds. His gorgeous Victoria home is near Springfield Lake in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Hop on I-55 and you're downtown in just 10 minutes. Truly amazing home but I'd say the highlight was Cal and his thoughtful touches to ensuring you have a mini vacation even if you're just there for a night."

I've never been so satisfied by an Airbnb!"

First, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud.Cal and Dan put a lot of effort into making their beds so comfortable. Only the best of everything. As a travel nurse I truly appreciate that. This weekend I also missed Saturday morning breakfast again, one day I’ll make it, but Cal and Dan were so sweet that they made me an individual Saturday breakfast (eggs, sausage, fruit, homemade blueberry scones, coffee, sooo yummy) before I had to go into work that morning. As a nurse I’m so used to grabbing my coffee to go and running out the door. Being able to have breakfast when I was planning on missing out was amazing. Thanks for another great stay!"

This bed n breakfast will far exceed any and all of your expectations! From the moment we walked in the front door, it felt like home. Our hosts were so friendly and accommodating. The house was beautifully decorated and unbelievably clean. The house is stocked with anything and everything you would need! We slept in the most comfortable bed, it made getting up hard to do. Fresh coffee was always available. Cal and Dan, don’t stop doing what you are doing! Loved every minute we were there and wished we could have extended another week.

We chatted with them throughout the stay and loved to interact with them. The property is beautiful and suitably located close to Springfield Lake and Lincoln Memorial Park. Tons of amazing food joints in and around the place. If you want to spend few days of your life away from noise and hustle of city this place is your ultimate destination. Everything about this property and its amazing hosts makes you feel sad when you check out and say good bye to Dan and Cal.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautifully restored Victorian home in a tranquil setting. Hosts were warm, welcoming and genuine. A delightful stay."

Cal was such a gracious host making sure to meet and greet me when I arrived at the house and get settled. The house had so much charm and is in such a beautiful area with a park and Lake Springfield footsteps away. Lou and I agreed that our bed was like sleeping on a cloud. If you have the opportunity to stay here, you won’t regret it."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was truly perfect! Beautiful large home and you seriously won’t ever find a better host! He made you feel like family. The room was clean and bed was super comfy. In fact, we slept like babies for over 12 hrs! The best perk was the delicious breakfast around the dining room table (on real china) with a wonderfully diverse group of guests. Best Airbnb ever."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home rooms are very accommodating and clean. Beds are beyond comfortable. I am a travel nurse and have had the privilege to stay here several times never disappointed with cleanliness and comfort. Can’t wait to actually be here on the weekend to get the food 😊
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Step back in time when you stay at this incredible home. The owners have created the perfect blend of history and modern amenities and their hospitality is genuine.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cal and Dan are always very accommodating and cordial to my son and I which is why I frequently stay. My situation is a very unique situation at this time and they have bent over backwards to make sure my son and I have a comfortable stay when I come in to town. They have made my son and I feel very welcome and I am proud to call them my friends.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A most beautiful property and home! Cal is a super host for sure! I was traveling with a dog and he was most gracious in welcoming my pet, which means a lot to me. I would most certainly book with Cal again. Thank you Cal for making my first AirBnB stay a most pleasant one!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a great little room, quiet and nice."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cal and Dan are amazing host. Always so delightful to talk with and enjoy morning coffee. Cleanliness is an understatement when it comes to this place above and beyond. Fresh coffee every morning is always a welcomed start to the day.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a wonderful trip, Cal is so welcoming. My dog Fin was also welcome, and had many cuddles and hellos! Wonderfully comfortable, stellar conversation, and gorgeous spaces. We will absolutely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As I approached this dreamy Victorian yet modern architecture home, as if I became Scarlet in the movie Gone with the wind. Of course Cal and Dan are not any less charismatic than Clark Gable. I had a wonderful, time walking through their life time of memories, antiques and art works. Wonderful room and plenty of toiletry. The morning coffee and the stroll in the back yard almost made me want to call in sick to work. Close to so many parks and across from the lake. My two day stay seemed like a vacation. I even walked the Lincoln Gardens after I left their beautiful home. I definitely felt I was invited to be charmed. Thank you Cal and Dan for your help and information. I suggest to everyone to make this place one of the must see places in Springfield IL."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cal's home is conveniently located, beautifully furnished, and very comfortable. Cal was also very hospitable during our stay and even made us coffee in the morning. Highly recommended."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Calen Dan are a class act as always
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"While we only stayed for one night, Cal made us feel right at home. We were lucky enough to attend the Saturday brunch anf got to engage in conversation with the cast/crew of a movie being shot there. Lovely hosts and a lovely home. Will hope to stay again next time I am in town."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a must!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cal was such a wonderful host. He accepted my late time of arrival since I was on the road. He made sure I was comfortable and had all the amenities I needed! I am definitely coming back here. I would highly recommend this place - such a beautiful place for a good price with a champion host. Worth every penny. Oh and the scones are wonderful too!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perhaps one of the best airb&b experience yet. Cal (and) Dan are true gentle-folks who clearly have excellent taste in the decorum of this absolutely beautiful home. Words can not adequately describe the splendor, charm, and grace. Thanks"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was amazing. The hosts were very kind to us, allowing us to arrive late and they were so gracious as to bake us fresh scones and make us some coffee. They also made some special accomodations by putting an extra twin bed in our Mary Todd room. Thank you for the place for the night!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home and grounds a short block walk or drive to lakefront park. Very hospitable hosts. Very nice sheets, bed covers, pillows, towels and a thoroughly enjoyable base for the Lincoln sites. Try Chesapeake Fish House for huge portions and William Van’s Coffee House across from Lincoln sites."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love love love this Airbnb and it’s hosts. My needs are always met as well as exceptional attention to detail in all manners of hosting. 10/10 recommend.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cal's place was just what we needed. We booked once per week this summer and were NEVER disappointed.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"First rate, kind and curious, and there to help. This was a great experience."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific, relaxing, and first rate."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cal's place is just as described. He and Dan went overboard to make our stay make us want to come back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! A must stay!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house. Cal was very welcoming and answered all my questions. My only regret is I only got to stay there one day. Definitely will stay there again if I am in Springfield.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is by far the best short term rental stay I have experienced. Cal's home is inviting, clean and such a treat, from the heavenly bed to the delicious hot coffee. I will definitely be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We were just passing through so we didn’t get to stay for the Saturday brunch but it was a great stay nonetheless! Extremely comfortable bed.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We can't say enough about this beautiful home, the fun hosts, and the lovely grounds. Our only regret is that we weren't there for the complimentary Saturday breakfast!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cal’s place was absolutely wonderful. The location was absolutely perfect and close to the interstate, the hospitality and communication were incomparable, and the room was so unique! Not to mention I had the best nights sleep there! I couldn’t recommend Cal’s enough!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts, home, and hospitality are impeccable. From the morning coffee to the evening chats and Cal’s knowledge of the history in Springfield, it is a must see and experience AirBNB."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,I just relocated to Springfield and hadn’t had somewhere to live. Cal’s lovely home gave me one for several weeks. This was my first experience with AirBnB and it was a good one! The house was thoroughly cleaned on a regular basis. The hospitality was amazing. Cal was so accommodating for anything I could possibly need. I particularly really liked the key pads on the front door and each bedroom if you’re a person who likes that extra security. If I’m ever in need of an Airbnb in Springfield again I’ll definitely be back to Cal’s. By far exceeded all expectations!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There aren't enough stars to review F. Cal's--beautiful beyond words, the kindest hosts on the planet, and a bed that's like sleeping in a cloud. The surroundings are idyllic and the accommodations immaculate. You'll never want to leave."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is a great place to stay! The air fryer will have you hooked!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My second time staying with Cal, won’t be the last. Such a lovely spot off I-55; and i’m glad to have met Cal."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I find myself fortunate to have spent a morning with Cal and his lovely estate.
I came in at 3am after telling Cal 8PM initially - he handled it with grace.
I was fortunate to be served a fantastic breakfast upon waking up in the morning. Truly a delight. I didn’t stay long but what i stayed for was a treat.
Thanks again Cal and hope to see you soon."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying in the Mary Todd room exceeded my expectations. This space was amazing and after a long driver from Michigan, (thank you for waiting so patiently) I was so thankful to arrive and lay my tired body in the most comfortable bed. Also happy to know masks are worn inside the home to keep each other safe. This was my best stop on a very long road trip to Joshua Tree, California.
Such nice owners and very welcoming ! The Saturday morning breakfast was such a Great touch and they gave me some extra food for the road. It came in handy for sure. Would definitely stay again !"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Their hospitality is second to none! The home is incredibly beautiful, and Cal is serious about ensuring COVID-cleanliness."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Like my second home now.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply put .. you’ll be glad you stayed here.
Cal’s place is clean, comfortable and stylish. Offering 4 individual rooms, Cal’s place is similar to a Bed and Breakfast.
With work-related Covid travel restrictions in place, we were able to comply with all restrictions by gathering for Thanksgiving at Cal’s place. With family from Texas and Illinois, we booked 3 of the rooms. The 4th room had a long-term renter who was away for the weekend, so my family essentially had Cal’s place to ourself.
That was good, but even better was the special consideration and hospitality that Cal made for us. Cal was away for most of the weekend and he gave us plenty of time to enjoy being together as a family. But we also enjoyed our chats with him when he stopped by urging the stay.
Cal’s place would make a great venue for a wedding or a family get-together. I’m sure Cal will work with you, as he did with us, to make your event memorable.
We’ll definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great as always
2020-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Cal truly is a SUPER host! I just moved to Springfield and I can say Cal has made the transition to this city feel more like I’ve come home; I wish I could give a million stars. Not only is the place sparkling clean and ready with towels, toiletries, etc, Cal will tend to any need you may have, always ensuring that his guests are his top priority. He treats everyone with the upmost respect and I can honestly say I’ve always felt welcome and safe every minute I’ve stayed here. With Covid, I was concerned with having to stay with others in the same house, but Cal ensured he and everyone in the house follow CDC/Airbnb rules, enforcing social distancing and the wearing of masks. I would recommend this place to any and everyone that may come to Springfield, whether it’s a night or month stay. This is the place to be! Thank you, Cal!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Comfortable bed and sparkling clean room and bathroom. Will stay again.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room was wonderful, clean, quiet and cozy. Cal was a gracious host and I was able extended my stay one day."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cal made our stay one to be remembered for life. We held our wedding and reception at this location and it was more than we could ask for! Cal made breakfast for us each morning that was a welcomed surprise and very healthy!
Anyone would be pleased to stay if for a night, a few nights or the week!
#safetravelinglocation"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Can't recommend this AirBnB enough! Amazing hospitality, beautiful space and cozy, soft beds. I had a wonderful time and l forward to staying here again."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Cal Dr.Robinson is one of the best human being I have ever met. His hospitality, communication with people is on another level. I’m really that I got chance to live there a month. After I made booking he regularly communicated with me until I arrived to the house. Once I landed to the airport, He called me and asked me about my situation. I was really in shock, because I have never seen host and such great human being yet. Every day he called me to diner with him and with other guests. House was so sparkling and clean and All the necessary things were provided more than enough. Within a month I got a chance to learn so many things from such great human being. His knowledge and wisdom helped me to realize how every person should be in this life. I got great friend and mentor for my entire life. I definitely recommend to everyone to visit there and get a chance to see beautiful nature and stay with such great human being. Thanks Dr.Robinson for everything. I forgot to tell he brought me to the airport in the morning at 5am"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay here and felt right at home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space for a solo person to cheaply stay close to downtown.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Xuna was an awesome home, friendy and very responsive. Communicated clearly and was always on top of things. My stay in with Xuna was worth my weekend in Springfield.
I'll stay with her again if I ever visit again Springfield.
I recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot to spend a quick couple days in Springfield! Right by downtown and very comfortable. I definitely recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our room was perfect for our 5 day stay, we had a lovely time. Location is fairly close to downtown Springfield so it was easy for us to get around and fine things to do. Space was nice, clean, and cozy. Host was great at responding to questions quickly. Overall a great stay, would recommend and would stay again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,So peaceful! Nice cozy basement apartment. Perfect location for being close to the capitol. Xuna is super friendly! Very easy process. Definitely would stay here again if it’s available!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The host was extremely welcoming and helpful. It was perfect for a restful night on my way home. The location was very close to things to do!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We only stayed one night, the home was easy to find with a private alley and plenty of room to park. Xuna was very responsive and her restaurant recommendations were very helpful! Overall, the stay went smoothly with no hiccups so I am satisfied and feel it was worth the price (which is affordable anyway haha). I would stay again or recommend to others traveling to Springfield."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thanks, Xuna!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As a solo female traveler, this spot was perfect for a short stay. It has easy access to downtown and felt safe. The dryer with steam functions was extra nice for someone living out of a suitcase."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place surprised me. You will have a very secure room in the lower level of the house, Very spacios parking in the back, it was very clean and neat, nice big smart tv, and very close to downtown. I would definatly stay there again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Xuna’s, it was a great deal. We stopped in Springfield on our way down south for the Solar Eclipse (which was incredible!) The Capitol building and State Museum are free to enter, we quickly saw both on the morning we left. The Illinois State Capitol was our favorite part of our visit in Springfield, it is beautifully structured."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean and quiet basement apartment. Little touches to make it comfortable like seasonally-inspired decor and a bidet. Some creaky boards from above during daylight hours, as would be expected in an older home. Mattress is quite firm. A nice little place for me to stop on a long drive!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space is great. Nice and private basement space. The hosts has paid attention to providing all the small details.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Good value. Convenient!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was less than 5 minutes from downtown Springfield. It was pretty quiet and the space was clean. The price was right and was everything we could ask for. The downstairs unit's ceiling was pretty low so anyone over 6'4 would need to duck regularly because of the pipes. The driveway is also pretty steep from the main road and very narrow as you pull in. We went through the alley behind the house to pull into the back of the house.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Xuna's place was cozy, clean, quiet and convenient to downtown. As a corporate traveler, It had everything I needed. Her place will be at the top of my list if I need to stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Xuna took three little basement rooms and made them very pleasing with good furniture, baskets, arrangements, and sweet touches, especially the bathroom. I very much liked having TV—quite nice and large. The cost was less than a boring motel room, and I only wanted a bed with a TV, since I was traveling from one state to another. Great place to rest and be on the way in the morning."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice private space with all the required amenities. Xuna was very responsive and helpful. The most cozy place is the bedroom. The space heater and a big TV was special attractions for me
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed Xuna’s place❤️
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay! Peaceful
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Photos and description of Xuna’s place were accurate. Excellent value. Heard train but it was very distant. Creaking floorboards of upstairs rental were only noise - you can really hear every step - especially at 5am.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great host with excellent communication. Xuna always responded quickly to any questions or concerns. I arrived on Christmas day and once I entered the door, I saw that Xuna had subtly decorated my unit and left a card and present for me. That touched my heart to the core. The unit was clean and cozy. The only take away from this unit is the fact that it is a basement apartment. You can hear voices from upstairs and the walking back and forth. I would recommend this unit to those who are not sensitive to noise and those who are going to be there short term. I stayed for a little over a month. Thanks Xuna for providing a safe and clean environment for me. I wish you the best!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little studio type apartment. The place was very clean, easy to check in, and close to the highway. Nice place for a 1 night stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re coming to Springfield then I highly recommend Xuna’s place. It’s affordable, about a mile to downtown and the Lincoln attractions, bed is comfortable, huge smart television, and Xuna is the perfect host.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host reached out for a 3 hour early checkin. Instructions were very thorough. I have stayed in Springfield at about 5 different places, and this ranked among the top in comfort, ease, accessible and a couple of wonderful nights sleep. Thank You so much!"

I am looking forward to staying here again on my next trip to Springfield."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Xuna's place is a nice space. I needed a single overnight accommodation on pretty short notice and one that didn't break the bank. This space is simple and met my needs. Xuna's decor in the bedroom and bathroom were tasteful and made it a relaxing area.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice stay. just as described

We had many family members come in for a Celebration of Life and we needed a place for 8. The small studio like BnB was a perfect addition the bigger BnB we stayed in. We were all able to stay together at one property. The place was super clean, labeled well and and I love how welcoming Xuna is. She is always quick to answer any questions if you need anything. I highly recommend any of her places. We will DEFINITELY BE BACK!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Good
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Xuna’s place is a gem . You have designated parking. The house is clean, bed is comfy. All the things that you might need could be found in Xuna’s place. I ask Xuna if I could use the address for the shipping of my regalia and she instantly agreed. The fed ex messed up my delivery and Xuna is very helpful. She did everything to get my regalia on time. Xuna is a great host. When we arrived I even get a Congratulatory card and chocolates from her a very nice touch"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adam was super responsive. This was a staycation for us and it was perfect for a family of five. The shuffleboard table was a complete hit. Such a unique attraction in the middle of Springfield. We will definitely be returning in the summer to play bocce ball.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a couple to stay for a long weekend and see the sites. The majority of the Lincoln sites are a short 10-minute drive. The whole place really makes you feel like you're right at home.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our couple's weekend getaway. The amenities were good, very welcoming. We did have an issue with the bathroom plumbing. While we did have to wait some time before the issue was resolved, it was an easy and quick fix."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Hideout is INCREDIBLE! I don’t want to spoil the surprise but I’ve never had such a fun first experience when I entered an AirBnb. It is so unique and unexpected. I just LOVED it! The furnishings and artwork we’re comfortable and so fun. The place was spotless and in a good location for exploring all Springfield has to offer. There were plenty of “extras” like snacks, games, and labels on everything so you can easily find things. While I didn’t cook, the kitchen seems pretty well stocked too. Best of all, the host is friendly and responsive. Book this one if you enjoy having an “experience.” Great fun! Will definitely go back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place looks super hip and fun. Lots of decor and little touches. Definitely more of a party place than a comfy stay, as the couches were not very comfortable to sleep on. Black lights definitely show all the washing stains in the sheets so that is something to consider as well they weren’t dirty but the lights make it appear that way. I slipped down the wooden steps because I was wearing socks, so be careful of that, you may not want to stay here if you have issues with that. I wished the outdoor had a table and chairs to enjoy the outside. Overall the place was clean and really fun, I will consider staying here again on my next trip, but would need to bring an air mattress if I had more than two people staying here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All as per description and great value.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I is absolutely beautiful comfortable clean it’s like stay in a art museum. The decorating is everything the contemporary furniture fits very well. I am a outdoor person and there outside is clean and relaxing. I would refer this place to anyone

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in Springfield has never felt so cool! This was not our first trip to Springfield and we enjoyed following Adam’s suggestions to find new local eats and activities. Adam was an attentive host and was quick to help. The lighting, decor, and custom art made this space the most unique place to stay in town. Make sure you book some time in your trip to hang out, play some games, and throw your own dance party. We would absolutely stay again next time we’re in town."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"More than your average airbnb! It's a work of Art! So much consideration has gone into every detail! From the high tech Google home assistant, The Murals, lighting, sound system, Jacuzzi Tub down to the Ice Machine & Silverware. It served as a ""wingman"" for my wedding proposal! She said YES 💍. We had so much fun and will definitely be back for our Shuffleboard & Giant Jenga rematch!"

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The Hideout was just as described! Loved the atmosphere and vibes of the whole place. Great location if you need to be nearby and feel safe, just a short trip away from lots of things to do in Springfield. Adam clearly communicated back and forth with me whenever I had a question and was extremely fast with responses. I would say the place is worth the price and I've never seen anything set up like this place, it was absolutely amazing !! Decor was perfect, and all the lighting was amazing."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we had a great time at the hideout 😊
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This hideout in downtown Springfield was the absolute perfect location for my daughter’s 9th bday slumber partly. The layout was so cool, the fun lighting was a hit and the decor was so unique. The place is so unsuspecting when you see it from the outside but the inside blows you away! I has some confusion about the track lights so I texted Adam on the number left on the info at check in and he literally texted back in one minute. Highly recommend this spot as a staycation or a unique alternative to a boring hotel room!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay in this airbnb! The home looked even better than it did in the photos. Nice location with many places to eat nearby. Adam was friendly and responded quickly when we needed something. I would recommend staying here!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My experience was a 10/10 Walked into the place and felt right at home. I had a beautiful place to stay at with a very communicative host and had a wonderful weekend. I would high recommend giving any of his places a shot.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't even know where to start when it comes to Adam's place. From the creative artwork and hyper-local vibes (Black lights! Neon! Lincoln!), to the built-in entertainment options (Shuffle board! Huge TV! Smart speakers!), all the way down to the ""little things"" (On-sight parking! Free washer/dryer! Full kitchen!), I've never stayed at a more well-thought-out, inspired AirBnB than this. It's clear that Adam has poured his heart into curating a unique, comfortable, experience (yes, really!) for his guests. I'd definitely stay here again, and strongly recommend ""The Hideout"" to anyone who's looking for a local getaway, a place to have a small celebration, or even someone (like me) who's returning home for the holidays and just wants a comfortable, relaxing place to unwind at each night. PS The only negative thing I can say is that there was no toaster in the kitchen. I know, a real tragedy :)"

The place was immaculate and we appreciated the extra linens and towels that were easily accessible. Lots of very nice touches throughout, including wifi connected speakers and shuffleboard!

They loved every single thing about the place. Being the wife of a contractor I could not get over how well the space is designed and decorated. Super fun and everything we needed! Adam offered fun suggestions for teenagers to do in the area and we loved being close to downtown.

There are so many parks to enjoy. Centennial was my favorite. Lincoln's adult home is only 5 minutes away! Luckily, we were able to get tickets to tour inside. We walked downtown and had lunch at the Springfield Carriage. I had a chance to say a quick hello. I experienced a car emergency and Kirsten was more than helpful providing resources and options.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved Caleb's place! It is so cozy and sweet. The aesthetic is calming and lovingly done down to every detail. The attic apt. is spotless, comfortable and stayed plenty cool even on a hot, muggy summer day. The 3 fights up are disclosed, and was no problem for us, but if someone was out of shape, afraid of heights, or had lots of heavy luggage, they might not be too thrilled with the stairs. There is a lovely little place to sit at the top of the stairs (which feels kind of like a tree house!) as well as in the yard area, but the heat and drizzly skies prevented us from doing so.
We appreciated the recommendation brochure and enjoyed several of the suggestions given. Caleb was an excellent communicator, parking and entry was well labeled/signed and a breeze. We loved our stay and would definitely stay again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute attic airbnb. Small but the limited space is very well used. The armchair by the window is the most comfortable chair in the entire world! And the kitchen is very well equipped, we were able to make some very delicious homecooked authentic spaghetti napoli. The experience was absolutely worth climbing up the long stairs with our suitcases. :)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautifully-appointed, comfortable, CLEAN, super-spacious. Just really well-maintained and pretty. Responsive, kind hosts. Will always be the first place we check for availability when traveling through Springfield-- our new favorite! My favorite detail was a tiny little shelf for your phone/jewelry/glasses etc on the wall by the bed! And the big, comfy chair by the window, where you can relax after a long drive and look at the pretty, tree-lined neighborhood."

2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"An excellent place to stay while in Springfield. Although it's quite a walk up the stairs with heavy luggage, the view is excellent, the space is just right for one or two people, and not too far of a drive from the President Lincoln sites."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cute little Airbnb. Clean, cozy, and just all around adorable. Only note would be that since it is a third floor room, getting up and down the outdoor stairs could be a little tricky for someone with mobility issues. Other than that, definitely worth the stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a clean, comfortable place to stay. The AC was from an in-wall unit that cooled the apartment pretty quickly when turned on. Bed was very comfortable, parking was easy, and the unit was very private.
The communication was FANTASTIC! I extended my stay and heard back incredibly quickly, and after a transformer down the street blew (power was only out about an hour) they checked on immediately to be sure I knew. I was very impressed with the communication!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment was really nice and cozy and we had lots of space. It’s located in the middle of Springfield, just a few minutes drive away from the Lincoln house. The bed was really comfortable, but the refrigerator made a lot of noises and we couldn’t turn it off."

Thank you!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The hosts were friendly and responsive. Accessing the apartment was easy and we appreciated the privacy and flexibility of the separate entrance. The exterior stairs could’ve been slippery, but there was enough de-icer on the steps to keep them safe in bad weather. The apartment was clean and the extra blankets and tea were really nice; it was a little cold. A large window, plants, and thoughtful lighting made the room feel both open and cozy. The only trouble we had was sleeping through some loud noises that the fridge/freezer made during the night. We let the hosts know about this after our stay and they appreciated the feedback, which speaks to their “super host” status."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space was perfect for our needs. It was easy to find when we arrived after dark. Parking was clearly marked, and the stairs are well lit. The room was quiet and comfortable. The shower was great! Caleb and Kirsten were great hosts with excellent communication. I would stay here again if in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cozy stay nestled in the tree tops. Very clean, stylish and comfortable. Super comfy bed. Loved the plants and lights around the window. The space is larger than what the pics show. I do have some trouble with heights, and the last few steps going up kind of freaked me out, but I am a 62 year old woman. There’s a little landing with a few chairs that’d be fun to hang out on in nice weather. All in all I really enjoyed the birds eye view, and this cozy space."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Caleb and Kirsten were fantastic hosts. They were very attentive and accommodating. The place is very cozy and comfortable. The only small issue I had was that I heard noises as if something was crawling in the ceiling (maybe a small animal) my first night. The place is on the third floor so it may have been something on the roof or in the chimney. However, the host were very responsive and even came up to check to see what it was during the middle of the night. They offered me a refund but I decided to stay for a second night since it was my last night in town. The second night, I didn’t hear anything and slept like a baby. ☺️ Besides that small incident, I would highly recommend this place. Super affordable and close to town. Thank you Caleb and Kirsten for a great stay!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Caleb and Kirsten’s apartment was the perfect place for a weekend in Springfield! It was super cozy and clean, and the instructions were clear and easy to comprehend. I appreciated the off street parking, and the string lights were so welcoming when I arrived late at night. The decor was also beautiful, I’m taking notes for my own apartment! 😊 I’d love to visit again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Caleb’s place. The perfect place to unwind and rest on our cross country journey. Everything was as promised in the listing.

In the future, whether we spend some time in Springfield or are just passing through, this place will be at the top of our list for places to stay."

He recommended The Winner’s Circle and the ribeye sandwich was delicious! This cabin that felt like a perfect home away from home.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steve’s stand-alone cottage is what other AIR BNB properties should aspire to be. This modest looking cottage on the outside is extremely well-thought out on the inside, impeccably clean, super comfortable, and is well-stocked with everything one needs. This property is like “Great Wolf Lodge” meets “Tiny Homes” with a beautifully decorated lake/hunting cabin feel. When you enter, you will be amazed with a beautiful downstairs bed and linens, a fully functional kitchen and cabinet space, Wi-Fi, TV and a super clean full bath. There is a comfy upstairs loft bedroom which further gives the property the cottage feel. Steve was a super communicator and if ever in Springfield, IL again, this will be our first place to reserve. The cottage is perfect for a couple or small family to enjoy. Thank you Steve for making your property available."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Steve's Tiny Cabin was exactly what it says, tiny but comfortable! the place was very clean and relaxing. The bed was very comfortable and much needed after sleeping in hotels for the past 4 nights. The area is very quiet and you get to see some wildlife deer and rabits. You truly feel like your in a cabin when in fact your in town. My family and I highly recommend picking Steve's Tiny Cabin as your next Air B&B ☺️"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a lovely time at the cabin! My kids loved it! It was a warm weekend and Steve had frozen ice pops waiting for us in the freezer upon arrival. He had all kinds of complimentary snacks which we enjoyed as we relaxed and watched a movie at the end of a busy day. Everything was spotlessly clean. Steve provided all the extra amenities we could possibly need. All the thoughtfulness and attention to care did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. The cabin had a cozy woods feel. It was on a quiet street but was just minutes from the downtown area where we were sightseeing. Steve was available at all times for any need we had. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Springfield area!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place rules and Steve does too! Beautiful little spot and cabin with dozens of ""nice touches"" all over the place. You'll learn like 10 little spacesaving or decorating hacks just staying here.
Encountered a deer passing through later in the evening, she seemed unbothered by me and just mosied along. Also did have a few of the complimentary snacks since they were better than my own snacks I brought....
Everything was great, hoping it won't be booked up next time I come through town! Thanks Steve and Gene (and Mark and Mosha!)."

It’s close to routes to take you to other parts of the city. Check in is easy. House is beautiful and extremely clean. Mattresses were very comfortable. Length of bathtub alone was a dream! The plentiful amount of trees in the backyard with comfortable seating was very nice at sunset, with lots of birds, squirrels, and a rabbit or two. We would stay here again when in the area!"

The rooms were cutely decorated and everything looked clean. My only “watch out” for this place is that the electric outlets are pretty old and my hair drier actually got fried when I attempted to use it. Just something to be aware of if you’re a woman and plan to stay here! 🙂"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My stay at Larry's was clean and cozy. Everything was as advertised, and he provided a clean and cozy space. Close to the best coffee (Graba a Java), donuts (Melocream) and park (Washington). Great value."

Larry is a excellent host and there when you need him, Very nice and wants to share all hé know about the area. We loved this place! Such an amazing time. We'll be back for sure! The location really surprised us, Just minutes from the state capital."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Overall a good stay. A very cozy home and nice decorating. Two things that stood out as not amazing was the bathroom and kitchen. The bathroom was dated and could use some minor renovations. In the kitchen the stove is right next to a wood panelled wall. Because of the proximity of the stove the wooden paneling was burned. Seemed like a safety hazard potentially. Final thing to note is that the location is close enough to train tracks that you will hear trains during the night. Still a good stay and got the job done.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Larry, we enjoyed our stay in your charming cottage. We will book again when we travel through."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The guesthouse was cozy and exactly what I needed. It’s in a great location, close to lots of historical sites and restaurants. The neighborhood was quiet. I felt safe staying there by myself.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Neat and tidy little cottage with cabin-like feel. Consideration was given to guest experience and decor. Unfortunately, lingering previous smoker smell. Appreciated the two air purifiers. We had a great stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, well kept, clean and smells especially fresh. The decor made it very cozy and positive. Just felt safe and private, curtains and blinds everywhere. TV’s both rooms, wi-fi, and nice size for one or two people. I appreciated my stay, was cozy and relaxing. I would stay here again. Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an adorable little spot! There are restaurants and stores a short walk away, the kitchen has a little of everything, and the decorations are very cute! It’s the perfect size for one or two people to comfortably stay and it was extremely easy getting my dogs in and out for walks and such. It’s very cozy. I highly recommend booking it if you are bringing pets! Larry was also very helpful when I had questions!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a fantastic little space! We had a great private dinner after all day out and about. I would highly recommend this place for anyone needing clean, well thought out spaces!"

Very comfortable, safe neighborhood and pet friendly.
Was great to have a kitchen and grocery store nearby."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"I really enjoyed my stay! Clean home and great price. Larry was responsive and came over to help me get inside. Just a little feedback: maybe a motion light outside to help illuminate numbers and get inside in the dark. Also, leave out linens for couch since it is listed as a second sleeping option."
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with kids,"You get what you pay for. Cleaning fee high for square footage of usable room.
Sofa is not sleepabile for third person, we were provided no linens for the sofa.
You definitely get what you pay for with this listing."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent place to relax. We were here on a business trip and had the most amazing relaxing place!
2023-08-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Very peaceful in the morning, easy walk to good Thai food. All the basics but no replacement toilet paper rolls, which made for a frantic exploration of all the cabinets and closets in the morning. Larry was responsive when I let him know. Towels were new, but unwashed and still had paper tags on them. Fine for a quick overnight stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As a repeat guest, I will always try to stay at Larry's properties while in Springfield"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place for a short stay. The home exceeded my expectations, and offered a comfortable, private getaway at an affordable price!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our one night stay, it was the perfect cozy stop on our long drive."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,It’s a great location if you’re looking for a quiet place near downtown.
2023-07-01,3,Stayed one night,"the place was simple and clean noisy neighbors and people.shouting outside during the evening. big tree branch was in the driveway, from recent storm days before and I had to drag it into the yard so I could pull into the driveway. lockbox did not have a very secure code."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you so much for hosting! Your place was easy to find in great order and easy parking! I love the neighborhood and the cobblestone streets.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home is very welcoming
Perfect size for us, the bedroom also made you feel at home.
While inside you don't really hear any type of noises from the outside.
Well stocked bathroom with towels & other convinces."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was perfectly decorated. It was so cozy and located so close to all the Lincoln sites. We hated to leave.
2023-06-01,2,Stayed one night,"ENDED UP AT A HOTEL! Was excited to find a ""tiny house"" and was eager to stay here until I arrived. The place reeked of pot smoke when I walked in and there were two air purifiers running at full blast. As small as the place is and as strong as the smell was, whoever was toking in there could not have been gone long, but i was going to let that slide until I saw the leftover food on the pans, grease/dirt all over the front of the fridge, dried gunk on outlet covers, trash in one of the trash cans and a used trash bag in the other, a huge hunk missing out of one of the doors, a bedroom rug that had clearly not been cleaned/vacuumed in a very long time (visible stains, worn down pile, and you could feel the dirt when walking on it), broken/missing blinds in several windows, a random washcloth on the floor beside the nightstand and, to top it all off, a half-smoked joint sitting on the towel rack in the bathroom! DO NOT RECOMMEND."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and quiet. Close to all the important stuff.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I booked this place for a night but life happened and unfortunately we couldn’t stay the full night. Overall it’s a really cute cottage. I love the wood panelling! You can tell the hosts take the care to decorate the place and make it feel like home. It’s about a 25 minute walk/5 min drive to downtown (something we didn’t have the chance to do). Parking in the driveway is great! Neighbourhood seems really quiet and there’s a local doughnut shop around the corner. The bed is so comfortable and this place has a cute kitchen! It’s a perfect little home for 2 people. The only thing that left me a little unsettled is, upon arrival the hosts messaged me saying they weren’t sure if that was me outside (parked on the street) but I could go ahead and check-in. So I was a little creeped out that I was being observed. Otherwise, place is really cute and comfy! It’s definitely worth staying in."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable stay and cute, eclectically-decorated space. Easy check-in. It was really nice to be able to park our car in the driveway."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was VERY cozy, convenient, safe, hassle-free, and extremely fair in pricing. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, providing a great night of sleep. I HIGHLY recommend staying here."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The pictures really don’t do this place justice. The bones of the house have an old rustic charm, but the decor and furnishings added a modern element that felt very cozy but cute. I especially loved the green tiled bathroom. Also, this bed is one of the more comfortable I’ve ever slept in. Would definitely stay again if I find myself in Springfield, and would recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable. Perfect for a couple to stay for a day or two and visit the Lincoln memorial and library.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,very cutely decorated. close to downtown. quiet and cozy.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We came from out of town to attend an event at UIS, and this place was perfect for our quick stay. It was easy to get to, not too far from campus, lots of places nearby to grab food. We had our two dogs with us and felt safe walking them at night, the neighborhood seemed quiet. The guest house is small (as we expected) but it was clean and comfortable."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first time doing an airbnb. We had a great first experience. The area was quiet and the little cottage was clean, smelled good, and very zen like. Our communication with the hosts was very quick and pleasant. They answered any questions we had within a very short time. The check in and check out was very easy. A very good first experience."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved Sierra's place as I love older homes and I have an affinity for paneling! Everything was very nice and I especially enjoyed her retro green tile in the bathroom. The house was super clean and everything was decorated nicely. This place is a heck of a value if you find yourself in Springfield for the night or a couple of nights. The kitchen is very usable and it could be used to prepare food if you don't want to spend money going out.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic stay! Great price, great location, simple instructions, and absolutely no issues.
And it was cute to boot!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"A cute little rustic place to stay while staying in Springfield. Needs some renovations and upkeep to the exterior and interior. Not far from the center of Springfield. Lots of nice restaurants and shops to choose from. Unfortunately, I will not be planning on staying again on any future trips to Springfield."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a nice place to stay, quaint home and easy to find. I loved that it's dog friendly and there's a small park nearby. Communication was timely. I'd definitely stay there again!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"What a cute, functional, clean and quaint place. The kitchen and bathroom are quite small, but they are well stocked and furnished, nevertheless! The main room is the cutest! They even have a hook in the ground, in the grassy area outside, to hook your dog’s leash onto so he/she can roam around freely for a bit. The place is lovely, all in all, and has everything you might need; more than that, however, we appreciated the hosts the most for their thoughtfulness, their flexibility, and for their hospitality (especially with us contacting them so last minute.)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"this is a wonderful little space in a good part of town! not too busy, right near downtown. the cottage is very cute and cozy, with lots of little things in little corners we kept finding to enjoy. highly recommend this stay!!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Sierra was awesome, and her place has everything you need in an Airbnb. I needed an extra set of sheets and unfortunately didn’t realize it till around 7pm. I reached out to her and within the hour she personally delivered them to us. Great place and better service, definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the Springfield area."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Place was lovely. The bathroom was tight for us tall people but the bed was super comfy, bedroom was great size as well as the living room. Plenty of space for us to work from home. The brick street was cute and quiet as well which we loved."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place is very cozy, with even wooden paneling on the walls. The temperature control worked perfect. So many nice touches to the space. Many areas to sit and enjoy. Full kitchen with main dishes needed to cook. Sierra was very accommodating. Great airbnb."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sierra and Larrys place was clean and cozy. Everything appeared just as pictured. I felt like I was at home, and the location is near great Springfield classics like MelOCream donuts, Sunrise cafe, the state capital and downtown. Check in and out was easy. I will definitely check availability the next time I'm in town."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I cannot recommend staying here enough. The cozy Cottage vibes were incredibly comforting after long days of training (I stayed here during a work trip). Everything was incredibly clean and the instructions were easy to follow. I had two pups with me and was able to take them for walks through the neighborhood without a problem and even had friendly conversations with folx in the neighborhood. If you’re in Springfield for any reason I cannot recommend staying here enough. It’s close to everything and you’ll feel at home away from your home.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely very charming and a smaller house. Perfect for a couple and or one child. The driveway is narrow and steep for a SUV but you can park on the street and there is actually a huge parking lot across from the house if needed too. Very quiet neighborhood and close to everything. Good amenities for the price.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely wonderful little place. Just enough space to not feel cramped. It’s also walking distance to tacos and I think donuts. Great neighborhood, nice and quiet."

Larry also gave us a bunch of dinner suggestions - we ended up going to Obed and Issacs and it was delicious. The cottage was spacious, clean and in a great area. Minutes away from lots of food places/stores. Parking was perfect, and the place was easy to spot. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area, and will recommend to all my friends/family in the area."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A cozy, inviting, welcome reprieve after a long day of sight seeing. Centrally located, easy to find, and felt safe and secure. My only thing to mention is the driveway: pull into it instead of backing in so you dont scrape the under side of your bumper!"
2022-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,This place is fine for a short term stay. I liked that Larry provided 100% privacy.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Charming cottage, cozy and clean. Good Internet and great value."

2021-03-01,3,Stayed one night,"clean place, decently decorated. wasn't a huge fan of the neighborhood, but it was quiet, which was nice. my biggest complaint was that the bed was very hard, so I slept poorly. I couldn't find extra blankets...but didn't contact the host about it as it was late...so I might have just missed them."

2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Larry's home was conveniently located and perfect for anyone traveling with a dog: it was quiet, not a lot of people traversing outside, and was comfortable to leave a pet alone for a few hours. Larry was also extremely flexible and kind with accommodating our travel schedule. For anyone bothered by passing trains or a lingering smell of cigarette smoke it is worth noting that these are both present (but the home is thoughtfully stocked with all new sheets, towels, and soft furnishings!)—overall this was perfect for our needs and I'm thankful for Larry's hosting!"

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house to stay while visiting Springfield, Illinois"
2019-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"Larry's place was fine for the most part. However, when we arrived the bed was unmade, there were towels on the floor in the bathroom, and there were dishes by the sink in the kitchen. Luckily we found clean sheets in a dresser and were able to make the bed with what I hope were clean sheets and there was one towel that seemed to be clean. The place was located near downtown which was nice. Really the only bad thing I can say about the place was the uncleanliness."

The only thing is that there are trains you can hear in the distance...

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time using an Airbnb & it couldn't have been better. I was traveling with my adult sons and brother. I was looking for the ability to have privacy, a convenient location and a place to prepare a few healthy meals. This exceeded my expectations by far. The neighborhood was cute & quiet but adjacent to a grocery store and other shops, not too far from highway access. The house was pretty, very clean & extremely comfortable. We all noted that the beds & pillows were more comfortable than ours at home. The house was stocked with a lot of little convenient extras that ensured that we felt right at home. The check in & check out process was painless. We were provided clear and helpful information about the house & area before we even got there. My son's, who use Airbnb often commented that this was even their best experience. The host, clearly, takes a lot of pride in this home & puts a lot of thought and consideration in the experience provided. Thanks for a great stay!"

Our three girls kept asking to go “home”, and each was referring to the Angela’s cute Airbnb, it truly felt welcoming.
Thank you Angela for all your hospitality. We will definitely be using one of your cute Airbnbs when we visit Springfield again."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This very clean small three bedroom, one bath house was lovely and perfect for the three of us. It was -7 during our stay and the house was warm and cozy. If you are looking for luxury, bells and whistles, this isn’t the house for you. But it is if you want a nice house with a roomy kitchen, new appliances, good sized bathroom with great toiletries, plenty of big fluffy towels, it.
The only small negative, only one of the bedrooms had a dresser. Maybe a small table would be good in the others? Thank you Angela for your great communication with answers to any question. Would definitely stay here again."

This neighborhood was nice, very mature landscaping and very curvy roads- heading towards the lake-- even saw some deer! One thing, it does say, ""lake access"" in which I was kind of confused on that-- however, I never asked. It was about 4 miles away (like a 10 min drive) from the lake, so not far (we were there for a wedding). Tyler has the place stocked with everything you need, from breakfast items to bottled water (thank you, after a 13 hr drive... this was SO appreciated-- I was too tired to go shopping.) Beds were very comfy too! Place has all you need minus your toothbrush! 😊 Thanks for a wonderful stay!"

The special touches with snacks, a few staples, etc were much appreciated given the weather.
We loved it so much, we’ve booked another stay in a couple of months. Your hospitality was most appreciated."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tyler made the experience wonderful for us! We drove 21 hours to get there and we got in super late. With that said it was so easy to get in and unload and feel welcomed in their home after a long day of driving. My husband and I are originally from around the Springfield area so we are familiar with getting around. With us being military it is not easy to make it there with our schedules and when we do we stay with family. This time we wanted our own place to feel more like home and that’s exactly how we felt!! It’s in a wonderful location too. We even seen deer in the front yard a couple times. (Might have made my girls believe in Christmas even more.) Its in good neighborhood to walk around and quiet at night. He helped answer about the internet down super fast and it fixed it right away. Also, we ran into another dilemma before we even got there and he helped with that too when it wasn’t listed, which we are beyond grateful. My girls felt right at home right away too. We were able to have presents under the tree (Tyler’s wife put up) that made it one less thing for us to stress on Christmas Eve to put up a tree. Tyler and his wife helped us have a perfect time visiting family and friends since before Covid. From the little things around the house to putting up a tree and all the way to being there for us we highly recommend Tyler and his wife. One of our favorite Airbnb’s we have stayed at. Thank you so much!!"

Additionally, they take care of everything after check-out - no laundry list of things for the guest to do before leaving. After a very long day of celebrating our daughter's university graduation, it was nice to use the space and be able to leave easily the next morning.

Parking in the garage is a nice feature in winter. Well equipped except pots and pans are adequate for normal use but if you are a gourmet cook like my wife, you may want to bring whatever you like. Don't remember what the description says but the coffee pot is a really nice Keurig, the one with a nice water tank but not the confusing computer interface, just normal buttons for normal people, and the host left enough K-cups that we used the last one the last morning."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tyler's space was great! Perfect location, exceptionally clean and he responded to any question I had so quickly!"

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This was my first time staying at a airbnb and it was a great experience.I love the size of the home.I love the front porch fresh air.I love the street we were on.

Everything was within walking distance; very convenient."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bill & Jen are the consummate “hosts” as they ensured we had a relaxing stay. The apartment was cozy and offered all of the amenities you’d find in your own home.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bill and Jen were so helpful, and the place was beautiful. Would have loved to stay for longer!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Stay here if you are working or visiting Springfield! We walked with two little kids all over town for 5 days! It is perfect if you love old vintage homes and walkable neighborhoods! We walked straight from the Amtrak to the home in about 22 minutes.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! Felt like I was staying at my grandma’s or aunts home. Owners were extremely responsive and kind. House had everything we could ask. And coffee!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Just as described. A little pricey, but definitely served its purpose. Stayed 1 night here and next night at another one of their AirBNB locations. Was told we could stay at 1st location until other one was ready for us for following day and was not told next unit was ready until they came and were upset that we had not left even though everything was cleaned and belongings were ready by the door. Was told it would be ready at 2pm and when they came at 1255pm, they were upset we had not gone to the 2nd unit, but we were never told it was ready before the 2pm time we were originally quoted. That was only issue, but it was not a big one, just felt as though things might have been more cordial if told next unit was ready early. Overall loved both places! would stay again"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely would book it if visit Springfield again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great Stay in Springfield ❤️ We felt immediately like home. Great home !
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great historic house to stay in. Close to historic downtown. Would stay again. Owners were very friendly and helpful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was really great! I loved that the apartment had so many kitchen appliances and a grill, they got a lot of use over the beautiful weekend we spent here. The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was very quiet and pretty. It was nice to sit out on the front porch for a while and take things in. This apartment is also walking distance from a coffee shop, antique store, and Washington Park. It's a great spot for enjoying your time in Springfield just outside of the downtown area, but far enough out that it's quieter and more private-feeling. Bill and Jen were great hosts who communicated clearly and set us up for a fun weekend stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed my stay at the Philip’s house. Everything was as expected. Bill and Jen are very responsive and accommodating. Will definitely stay again on future trips to Springfield. Thank you for a great stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bill & Jen’s place is a lovely historic home that is nicely renovated. It’s comfy, clean and cozy. Very comfortable beds. Kitchen is large. Hosts are responsive. We would stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We ventured to Springfield for a quick overnight to visit all the Lincoln Sites and the Dana-Thomas Frank Lloyd Wright home. We loved that this Airbnb allowed us to do a one night stay (as two was not going to work for us). The place was clean, comfy, as described...the bed's slept great, kitchen was perfect and spacious. We enjoyed the family area as we played games and watched a movie. It was perfect for our 5 person family! We would return without hesitation."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Would reccomend this place to anyone. Close to resturants and bars. Of course close to downtown. Nice neighborhood. You get the whole downstairs but there are occupied studio apartments (2) upstairs. If people were up there we didnt see or hear them. Glad we could smoke on front porch but you need a couple of tables out there for drinks and ashtrays. Beautiful old home with history. Loved it!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect for our quick and short stay! Clean, quiet, bed was super comfortable! Bill and Jen were very responsive and helpful with any questions we had! We will definitely be back!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place to stay with easy access to all things Lincoln.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable large space! Perfectly located for the sites we traveled to Springfield to visit and close to great choices in restaurants. Bill and Jen were responsive with all communications!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, wow, wow! This rental experience far exceeded our expectations. It was much more spacious than I expected, and everything so beautiful, with gorgeous antiques, historic photos and turn of the century architecture and workmanship. It was an unexpected, special treat to spend time there. The kitchen was great, nice dining area, beautiful soft bedding, It was squeaky clean, beautifully decorated, comfortable and interesting, a historic masterpiece. Good restaurants, great location and our hosts were also very helpful and responsive. Oh yes I wouldn’t hesitate to rent here again, hopefully it will be available the next time we travel through Springfield."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very pleased with my stay. Simply check in early and adjust the thermostat so you’re comfortable would be my only advice/change . I went to the home and got ready to bed after a nice dinner. I should’ve adjusted the thermostat and then gone to dinner. But of course, I checked in one of the coldest days in almost a year. ;) Would book again. Very cool. Very happy."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to spend a weekend, very close to downtown Springfield."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay, close to all the tourist attractions"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment is in an old home that has beautiful original woodwork and flooring.
It was clean and spacious."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home. Clean. They even had toys, books, and board games. The pack and play came in handy since I had my grandchildren with me. The area felt safe. Bill and Jen were very responsive and friendly. Definitely would stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, older home with tons of character and plenty of space to relax! We arrived after dark and it was easy to find with the porch lights on. I stayed in the smaller bedroom, the bed was great! Had an oscillating fan that I took advantage of just for some sound since you could sometimes hear cars drive by if you're a light sleeper. I believe she also has a sound machine, if needed!
The only thing we used as far as appliances was the programmable coffee pot, which worked great!
Thanks so much for providing a wonderful night's sleep only minutes from the Bank of Springfield Center where we were at a weekend wrestling tournament! We'll definitely stay again when in the area!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bill and Jen are lovely hosts. Their establishment is close to the Capitol among several other entities as well. Definitely recommend for anyone who wants to have that old time feel of home with every day modern amenities.
Beds are comfortable, kitchen is stocked, towels are wonderful. No reason not to enjoy."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great value! Perfect for a short weekend trip. Comfortable, clean, and they let us check in early! Would stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable home. Enjoyed our experience.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful restored old house. Very comfortable, clean, well decorated and fully equipped. Has everything that you would need. Centrally located. 5 min in a car to most places."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The location is extremely convenient to the Lincoln-related attractions and the Dana Thomas House, and within easy distance of multiple local restaurants, but is in a nice residential area. The house is unique and charming. A white noise machine is provided, but I did not use it or need it. I appreciated that there is dedicated parking next to the house, so I did not need to test my parallel parking skills.
I curled up on the couch under one of the provided throw blankets in the evenings and watched TV, and it was very cozy. I didn't really use the kitchen, but it appeared to be very well equipped. I noticed there were a ton of dishes available, including some for children. The primary bedroom is very large, but both have plenty of space. It feels like someone's home, not a sterile space equipped with only the basics, as some AirBnBs are. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was perfect for my family.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great value. Spacious house. Loved the place. If ever in Springfield again, would definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place absolutely beautiful and stunning. In a great neighborhood and was close to a lot of things
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed Bill and Jens place!
Although we were just driving through Springfield their place was such a cute place to stop and enjoy!
They even put out a box of toys for our baby. It was such a sweet touch! She had such a blast playing and we appreciated being able to give her something to do.
The location is also great for anyone visiting the city.
We will plan to come back and see more of the city next time!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,The place was comfortable and very quiet
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Timely responses, clear instructions, very homey! Will stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My sister and I were staying in Springfield for a show at the UIS campus, and needed a last minute place to stay. Bill and Jen were so accommodating - the apartment was ready so we could check in early, they were very responsive, and overall, the apartment and house were gorgeous. Would 100% stay again! Thank you guys so much!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time here and everything was just as great as before. The place has lots of historic charm, plenty of space, and is very clean/comfortable (with lots of amenities). I feel very secure here and the neighborhood is close to many shops/restaurants."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My first trip home to Springfield in nearly 35 years and the top of my list was quietly going alone to the place where I met my spouse for our 37th anniversary which was during this trip. (Sadly, I am now 3 years a widower). The house was close to that spot which made it an easier commute and being able to come home to this place in particular afterwards, made it emotionally much easier to be able to just kick back and relax and feel at home… The house is an old historic place and exactly the type of home I remember growing up in Springfield here with my spouse… the neighborhood is quiet and filled with other old homes with huge trees lining the street! So pretty with the leaves changing colors and blanketing the ground with the colors of fall. It was a totally comfortable place and everything you want to see or do is just minutes away so the location couldn’t have been better… if you love old homes but want comfort as well this is it, you won’t find anything better! Thank you both!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Clean, spacious and perfect for our weekend get away!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice accommodations. Cool bathroom mixes the old with the new. Kitchen was spacious and had a great space for sitting around the table socializing. I did not cook while I was there but I did look at all the cookbooks in the pantry. Living room was cozy. Both bedrooms were equally nice. The front porch has an inviting swing and I am glad the cold weather held off.
We enjoyed walking to the downtown area, Aristocracy Hill and the Dana Thomas home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Definitely a good place to stay in Springfield!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second home of Bill and Jen’s that I have stayed in. It was just as nice. Clean, comfortable, and nicely appointed.
It is walkable to the capitol and activities. A great place to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bill and Jen's place was great! We appreciated the dedicated parking spot on the side of the house so we didn't have to worry about parking. We also felt like it was in a very walkable location--about a half mile to the Dana-Thomas House, three quarters of a mile to the Lincoln Home National Historic Site, and just over a mile to the Lincoln Presidential Museum. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It is a very charming place. It is close to all the sights we wanted to see. It was perfect for four people but would be a tight squeeze for 6 in my opinion. They were great at filling you in on all the things do do in Springfield.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"nice vintage house in
a great location
beautiful furnishings and super functional kitchen,
quiet neighborhood"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Historic home that was quaint, peaceful and comfortable."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful place, we enjoyed our stay very much."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My significant other and I along with another couple came to town for an evening out and to see a musician and local band play. We chose to stay in Springfield, since we all live about 2 hours South. Bill & Jens place was great! Clean, easy to access and very comfortable accommodations. The antique and vintage decor was right up my alley. The perfect combination of modern comfort, and vintage flare!(And that bathroom - Perfection!) 😍There was a menu for “Boone’s” within walking distance. On the fridge. Turns out, it’s a local pub that serves Breakfast/brunch with a mimosa and bloody Mary bar!! SAY LESS!! In one word - AMAZING! (I left them a review as well) 😉 If you plan to visit Springfield and you need a place to stay, check out Bill & Jens place! Two thumbs - way up!! 👍🏼👍🏼"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ideal location. Clean, quiet, spacious. Highly recommended."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great hosts! Phone with the instructions on how to get in was dead so we had to call them and they picked up right away and got us set in the right direction!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,What an amazing place! Very clean! Beds were so comfortable! Quiet area and just a walk away from local attractions! Would highly recommend! Would love to come back next time we are in the area!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have asked for a better place for our first visit to the state capitol! The house itself is in a very convenient and quiet area. We never felt unsafe walking or driving around. The rooms were beautiful and so cozy. It really added to our trip to stay in a historic home.
The amenities were very, very nice. The beds were fresh, clean and comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you could need and more! The bathroom was clean and the shower was powerful and hot. Perfect for ending our days.
Our hosts were very friendly and suggested places to visit and eat at. There were also several books and guides that really helped us plan our visit. Everything we wanted to see was within a 5 minute drive. We loved that too.
HIGHLY recommended for anyone looking to explore Springfield!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very spacious. Quiet street. Thank you for your hospitality."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We flat out loved it. When we were too short to reach beyond the first level of kitchen cabinets, Bill was right over to retrieve step ladder from the basement. Absolutely spotless. Spacious. However be sure and remember your pins/passwords for your various streaming platforms on Roku. And if you require a firm mattress then maybe here is not for you. But that is a minor quibble in a wonderful stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bill & Jen’s place is absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful landscaping, stunning furnishings. A very historic building. Was well worth the price. I will be staying there again. Strongly recommend this to anyone wanting privacy in a beautiful neighborhood. A+ for the front porch swing!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very spacious, clean, well decorated home!
It was perfect!
Thank you again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay! We were only in Springfield for 24 hours and we packed in a lot of sightseeing, so we were only at the house long enough to sleep and then get on the road to home. But we loved the space so much that we are already looking for when we can go back with some friends as we didn’t have time to see everything. We really enjoyed how spacious, clean, and well decorated it is, plus so close to all the attractions. And the porch was really nice, the perfect way to unwind after a day full of adventure! It was also a plus having a dedicated parking place off the street. We highly recommend this home for your Springfield vacation!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Plenty of space, cool old building nicely refurbished, great beds! Dining table light/fan was a little confusing but that might have been my brain failing to grasp the dimmer operation after driving all day. Host is super clear and easy to understand. Once again, I can't see how hotels stay in business with places like this to stay at!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great stay. Loved the furniture and style of the apartment. It really felt like hanging at home. Easy check in and out and price was right.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space was everything you want in an old house. High ceilings, beautiful details, authentic feel. And yet, it was still very homey and comfortable with two small children. Bill and Jen were very responsive and kind. Would definitely recommend and stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay! The space is wonderful - beautiful, spacious, and clean. Cute historic neighborhood. Bill and Jen provided us with a number of recommendations for local eats. We enjoyed eating at Bernie and Betty’s - good pizza and very affordable. Will stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended!!! Well worth the price!!! The house was just as described. There are residents living upstairs, but they are quiet and nice. The neighborhood was not fancy, but close to downtown attractions. Parking was down an alley and on side of house. You have to walk around and up steep porch steps to get inside. So, if you have walking issues or in wheelchair, it would not be for you. Otherwise, it was very nice, clean, beautifully decorated, very clean. There are towels and hand soap provided. There is a coffee pot. Otherwise, bring your own soap for showering, and your own coffee and food. Plenty of blankets and bedding. TV is Roku. You sign in to your own account for Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, etc. TV has HDMI, so you could bring your Firestick. Free WiFi, air conditioning, quiet, private. 2 bedrooms with queen beds, a couch, and room for an air mattress if you have one. Overall a great place to stay! Will stay there again if in the area!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We choice to stay at Bill & Jen’s on a recent trip to explore the Lincoln things in the area(Presidential Library was AWESOME!). We have stayed at many, many Airbnb. This one was a great value, clean, looked like the pictures with two bedrooms, a blow up mattress, older but very clean bathroom, kitchen with room to cool and a table seating 6.
We walked each evening (2 miles+) and felt very safe in this neighborhood. Sat on the porch for a while one night too. So if you are looking for a good place to stay, at a good value, but new—has a historical charm…this place is great!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet neighborhood, clean, comfortable, would stay again"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this house, which was perfect for our family. We especially enjoyed walking down to Washington Park and sitting outside on the porch. Would highly recommend this property for anyone wishing to visit Springfield."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was just as described, no problems at all. We stayed to and from on our drive to Minnesota for a reunion. It was clean and comfortable, even a nice comfortable chair with ottoman for my dad that rarely sleeps in a bed. Everything was convenient the location was nice. Would recommend, would stay again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the most lovely Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! I would visit Springfield just to stay there again. We just needed a place to stay overnight and it just was such a magical little space. And the breakfast place three blocks away was perfect to walk to with great food, and that was suggested by
Bill and Jen. It was really clean and light and airy and the beds were just so comfortable. Great place to stay."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a single night’s stay while we explored Springfield, and this provided that and much more! Lots of space to accommodate us with all the amenities you could ask for. The distance from all the Lincoln attractions and the capitol was perfect- you could walk almost everywhere if you wanted to. This apartment’s excellent location, cozy setup, and a very simple check in process allowed us to focus on all the things we wanted to do and made the start of our vacation trip a great one!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jen & Bill's apartment was full of charm! We loved staying in the apartment. Everything was exactly as described. All the rooms were really spacious. Jen & Bill had thought of everything. There were extra pillows, blankets, the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you would need to cook, there was plenty of comfortable seating for lounging in the evening, and the beds were comfortable. The neighborhood was super quiet. I am not sure how walkable the neighborhood is, as it was too cold to walk, but everything we needed (grocery store, gas station, variety of restaurants, and all the Lincoln sites) was only a few minutes drive. I would highly recommend staying at their apartment if you are visiting Springfield."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly how Airbnb intended its listings: a textbook example of well thought out and well done. Pristine clean and every little detail was well thought out.

Bill and Jen’s Phoenix House exceeded all my expectations. I highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a charming, wonderful and really spacious place this is. It's in a historical house with all the comforts of home and Bill and Jen couldn't be nicer and more willing to assist with anything you need. The house was close to everything and just down the street from the Capitol building. Nice quiet neighborhood with a really great front porch to just hang out and relax. This is the place to stay if you want comfort and a place in the center of the Springfield universe."

You can’t go wrong reserving with them at this venue.
We cooked, we watched movies, read, sat around the dining table and the living area taking etc. and it was close to everything including an easy hop on to various Highways to explore other small towns nearby.
THANKS BILL AND JEN!!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bill and Jen's house in Springfield, Illinois was an absolute joy where to stay while visiting the city and surrounding area. The house was so clean with two bedrooms. living room, bathroom and fully stocked kitchen with every thing needed to cook your meals. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms nicely decorated with a very homely feel, very nice to come back to and sleep and refresh after a day of travelng. The bathroom shower had instant hot water with great pressure. There was also a washer and dryer in the basement. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe, and was only about a 10 minute easy walk to downtown with the museums, restaurants, sites, etc. There was off street parking which was very nice. The television had numerous channels if interested in watching TV. Communication and getting into the house was very easy and was no problem. Bill and Jen's house is just the perfect place to stay in Springfield."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was all we expected it to be... a large suburban house in a residential area of Springfield. For us, being from the UK, it was a brilliant experience to live in a typical 1890s American home. ( with all modern conveniences of course.)
Thank you Bill and Jen."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We always enjoy our stay whenever Bill and Jen are the hosts. This property and experience were no different. We feel welcome from the get go. Everything is very clear prior to arrival and once we get there. The accommodations are just what we needed! Everything is clean and maintained. Kitchenware is exactly what we need. Beds were comfy; great decorations. Cute porch and backyard area. Will definitely stay again!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I'm not hard to please, but I'm also not easily impressed. This place was perfection. I wish all AIRBNBs were this cozy and put together.
Bill & Jen thought of everything. The plates for kids. Blankets in each room. Every kitchen utensil. There are even board games and a Roku TV.
VERY big fan of the ""no shoes"" rule. Be mindful of the large vent cover by the kitchen. Catches you off guard barefoot, and our toddler found it first.
The bed was incredibly comfortable. The water pressure is ideal. There's even a pack n play. Plenty of space for my hubby, myself, and our kiddo.
Bill & Jen are a wealth of knowledge of area restaurants. Our pleasant discovery was Melo Cream donuts. This home is close to everything you want in Springfield, and super close to the Hyvee for grocery needs. Parking accomodations were convenient and easy.
Highly recommend this space."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Definitely covers all the bases. I reserve 5 stars for places that surprise and wow me. I’ve stayed in a few places like that recently so perhaps I’m spoiled. I’d stay here again.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Phoenix house is in a perfect location and within walking distance to the Capitol, State Museum, restaurants, and even downtown itself. The house was clean and furnished really well so all we needed was food.
Bill and Jen were amazing hosts and very responsive. They were very helpful and informative when it came to an unexpected AC issue. We were brought additional fans and were kept up to date on when the repair would take place.
It was a seamless experience and one that we will definitely want to come back to when we visit Springfield again!"
