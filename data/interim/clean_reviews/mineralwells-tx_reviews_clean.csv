2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We are very pleased with our stay.
It would have been better if there were a few more available (clean towels) without having to wash while we were there. Also we didn’t find an iron to use, we used the dryer with wet towel to remove wrinkles.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,What a fantastic place to stay. Quiet. Clean. And perfect communication. I love the rustic charm and enjoyed bringing the house to life on the 100 year old piano that graces the living room. Thanks so much for letting me share your gem!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a baseball tournament at Rocker B for the weekend and found this place not far away. Exactly as described, very cosy home with an old Texas vibe.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Bryan's place is exactly as pictured and described. Super cute house, plenty of space, comfortable beds. If you're interested in walking downtown Mineral Wells, this is a great spot. I truly appreciated the coffee provided, such a great touch. The kids played with the games provided and we enjoyed a rainy morning on the comfortable furniture watching a movie. There are so many thoughtful touches, Bryan has done a really great job.
The only negative was arriving after dark with just me and my two kids. There aren't any streetlights and the house isn't lit, so the kids were pretty scared. There is a motion light at the back, but it doesn't stay on for long at all. The only other visible house on the street is a poorly kept home with a lot of cars and furniture outside, and this added to the scary feeling for the kids. Obviously that's beyond Bryan's control, his property is well kept."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice place. 2 bathroom which is nice. Big kitchen and living room.

It was a chilly day when we arrived, and the A/C was on and set at 55 degrees! Thankfully the house is equipped with a Smart thermostat, so we were able to warm up the space quickly.
You will be well within walking distance of downtown, which has many cute shops and restaurants. The house sits on top of a pretty steep hill, so be mindful of that if you're carrying your fab finds home from town!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house.
In the evenings we got to see a little family of deer every night and the are that the home is on feels very private.
We were walking distance to a the Crazy Water offices where you can buy and sit and drink outdoors as well as the Crazy Hotel with lots of restaurants and shopping.
Less than 15 mins from the fossil park and not far from Clark Gardens, Mineral Wells SP and the Vietnam War Museum.
The beds were comfy and they had games and a puzzle that was perfect for our stay. We love it and will stay again"

2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A charming, older home. Surprising amenities included an upright piano. Beautiful, high ceilings, very spacious layout. Extremely clean!
No back yard, dog walkers could use a motion light; a little unsettling at night.
Would be delighted to stay again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is super cute, spacious, and in a walkable location downtown. The mix of modern decore and antique hardware gives it a cozy and welcoming feel. We enjoyed our stay and would book again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cool old historical home. Bryan was super communicative and accommodating. Very short walk to Crazy Water, and you could definitely walk to all the downtown shops and restaurants from there. We didn't do that, b/c it was like the surface of the sun while we were there, but I can attest that the games, wifi, and television situation in the home were solid enough to make for a good weekend of hiding out from the heat."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This BNB was perfect for a family trip. One block off the Main Street through town. We were able to walk the whole area. A very nice bonus was a family of three deer that, as if on queue, would appear every morning and walk down the street. Very comfy beds and loved front and back porch sitting. We were right down town but felt like we were on the edge of town in a country setting. Will stay again next trip. So much to do in this charming community! Best BNB I have been in so far."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was very comfy, and the bedrooms were great as were the showers. It would have been nice if there was a grill outside, but fires might be a worry, as the porch is covered. Lots of wildlife to watch out in back. The driveway was nice to get in and out, but it would help if it was smoothed out. We had a great time and would stay again."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great comfy clean home base for our outdoor activities….cute decor, comfy bed and couches and large kitchen for cooking; easy access to downtown. We love Mineral Wells and plan on going back! This place is definitely on our list to go back to"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was full of charm from the original wood plank floors to the transom windows above every door frame. The kitchen was well-equipped and the bathroom amenities included quality shampoo, conditioner, body wash and hairdryer. We enjoyed being able to walk to the historic downtown area for food and drink. Plenty of options there including places offering live music on the weekend. It’s a short drive to the Lake Mineral Wells State Park for hiking, biking, rock climbing and swimming. When a day of park activities wore us out, it was nice to relax back at the cottage that night and watch movies on the large smart tv….while enjoying the sweet Dove chocolates and Crazy Water left for us by our host! Thanks, Bryan, for helping make our girls’ weekend away a great experience!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bryan’s place was clean, comfy & inviting!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wow, this place is soooooo cute! We just couldn't believe it when we walked in. The neighborhood is sketch, but when you walk in, all is forgotten. Love all the great windows/light and tall ceilings, I mean really tall! Beds super comfy, bathrooms super clean, new appliances, and large kitchen. Everything you need. Close to ""old"" town downtown, so you just walk on down. Wish it were a bit less and then we would come on a regular basis. Regardless, definitely worth it for a once in a while visit to Mineral Wells. Thanks Bryan!!!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Bryan was so responsive with my last minute booking and request to check-in early. This place was stunning! Gorgeous features and characteristics that struck up conversation many times. Extremely well-kept. We couldn’t decide which room to sleep in - both were fabulous, spacious, had a TV, and were king-sized. I appreciate that Bryan allowed 2 pets in such a nice, large home without making any deal at all about breed/size/etc.
Many thoughtful details in the home such as well-labeled light switches and useful refreshments. So easy to book, find, access - seamless experience. Thanks!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for us, or any family, to stay in Mineral Wells. We will definitely be coming back very soon.

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We booked this house last minute due to AC issues (107 outside) at a lake house we were going to stay in. We had a handful of teens with us and were so thankful we found this place. The host is very hospitable. Even with the very sort notice they had everything arranged with a note on the board welcoming us. The space is large. The kids really enjoyed the ping pong table and the pool table.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The host was very helpful and the property was absolutely beautiful. I’m a big fan of nature so we all had a blast exploring around and fishing. The barndominium was awesome with plenty to do and a large area for everyone to enjoy their time!

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"If you’re looking for a quiet, exceptionally clean home out in the country, look no further. Melissa and Warwick were great hosts and we were very pleased with our stay. From relaxing to a movie, kicking back shooting a few games of pool, lounging by the fire or taking in some heat in the hot tub, you can’t go wrong with this Barndominium. I would highly recommend to anyone! Would definitely stay again In the future!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,absolute gem of a place to stay
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We loved the place it was great for our three families that were with us! We can’t wait to go back in the spring or summer!!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful barndominiam and a great experience. Everything was beyond the description. We had a great time fishing and exploring.
Melissa was a super hostess.
We will definitely keep them in mind in the future"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time at Bonnie Doon! Our family needed a break from everyday hustle and bustle, and Bonnie Doon was the perfect place for us to disconnect and be together. There is something for everyone - outdoors, hot tub, ping pong, pool table, games, etc. We only wished we could have stayed longer, and we can't wait to come back!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! Beautiful clean home with plenty of amenities and family friendly! My little artists loved the art station! Property was beautiful and well maintained and we enjoyed a peaceful family walk down to the pond during sunset. The kids enjoyed time in the hot tub and roasting their own hotdogs on the fire. Visiting the fossil park was a lot of fun and so many great restaurants in the area!
We only wish we could stay longer! We would definitely stay here again when in the area!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful barndominium! Exceeded all our expectations. The barn was clean, warm and inviting. The host thought of everything and the barn was fully stocked with everything we could have needed. From board games, a pool table, and hot tub, to dishes, champagne and charcuterie board, this barn was planned and stocked perfectly for a weekend getaway! We celebrated a 30th birthday girls weekend and the barn made it magical. We will definitely be returning."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Melissa is a very incredible and hospitable host who goes out of her way to make you feel more at home. Her Barndominium was a spectacular stay with incredible views and with many things to do around the property. The weather outside was bad with constant rain for most of our stay but this home definitely made up for it by keeping us occupied with all the included amenities! I plan on booking this stay in the future and I definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting to escape or have a quick getaway!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can’t say enough about this awesome casa! First off the layout is great, the views are awesome, and the amenities are top notch! Everything about our stay here was perfect, from the hot tub to the firepit to the kitchen door that opens up to the outside. We had originally planned on spending most of our time in town but ended up just relaxing at the house the majority of the time. We highly recommend it and will definitely be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Sarah's place and she was the best communicator, proactive and super friendly. The space is perfectly set up for a convenient and comfortable stay and the property is lovely, private, and peaceful. The s'mores provided were an extra special treat! She truly has thought of everything, including great local recommendations! Thanks, Sarah!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described. Process was easy. Place worked well for my son and I.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Cozy Coop was a great, peaceful get away in between games at Rocker B! Sarah graciously showed my girls around and they loved meeting the animals, especially Bolt! Thank you for a wonderful stay! We hope to return during the Fall!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Grandkids loved the fishing at the pond. Very thankful that the hosts went out and help us get our fire started to roast marshmallows for s’mores. 🥰
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sarah’s place was just what we needed! Nice secluded/private area with lots of outdoor space. My friends and I really enjoyed being out by the fire pit & just cooking out. The home was clean & very comfortable.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful place! It’s cozy, quiet and our family made wonderful memories during our stay. Sarah is a great host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sarah and her family were incredibly welcoming! Our kids loved the ducks, dogs, and chickens! The property was beautiful and relaxing. The property was clean, well stocked and the beds were comfortable. We look forward to staying here again!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah was an excellent communicator throughout the reservation. The property and accommodation were perfect for a getaway to Mineral Wells - clean, well-stocked, and spacious (inside and out). An ideal Airbnb!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We came for baseball at Rocker B. great location...close to town as well. reasonable drive to possum kingdom lake.
The kids enjoyed the chickens and ducks."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful family vacation, this is a special place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for a baseball tourney at Rocker B. It was perfect for our family of 5. My kiddos had a blast chasing chickens and fishing the pond. A nice touch was having s’mores and a fire pit loaded with wood for us to close the night out. Highly recommend this spot if you are ever in Mineral Wells!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This getaway was perfect! The cabin lived up to its name and the property was so peaceful. I was looking to escape the city and recharge somewhere quiet and Cozy Coop was just what we needed.
The location is close to the lake and downtown but secluded so you feel like you’re the only people around.
I fell in love with all the chickens on property and the star gazing was fantastic.
Sarah was an amazingly helpful hostess and went above and beyond for our visit."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was super cozy and quiet. The bed was sooo comfortable. We stayed here because my son had a baseball tournament at Rocker B and we wanted a nice quiet place to relax. Although, there is not a tv, we enjoyed family time playing cards and going fishing instead. Mineral Wells State Park was $7 for adults and kids are free. Sarah made us feel welcome to fish in her backyard as well. The chickens are super cute on the farm. We loved our weekend stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fun time!
The Cozy Coop was just what we needed.
We were able to reconnect and spend quality time with each other.
Sarah was so helpful in giving us some ideas and suggested some activities as well as several places to eat
We highly recommend the stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. Sarah went above and beyond to accommodate when she totally did not have to. This was a great little escape and we would definitely come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and her family were so welcoming, and they truly understand genuine hospitality! From the very first communication to check out, we knew exactly where to go and what to do to make this excursion first rate. Sarah accommodated for our late check in the first night, and we were touched by the extra little surprises in the kitchen when we arrived.
The room was very well laid out with adorable chicken décor (frankly, this is what drew me to the place anyway, lol), and would sleep 5 comfortably. We had only 2, so there was plenty of space to spread out.
They have gorgeous old pecan trees, chickens, ducks, turkeys, beehives, fishing ponds on property. Fun to explore! It's very quiet -- you can hear a tiny bit of road noise when you are outside the cabin (not bothersome at all), but inside is amazingly quiet. We slept great!
A 5-minute drive into town yielded several great restaurants, and Sarah had great recommendations!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stay there for a Four day tournament in Rocker B Ranch it was 16 min drive.. Sarah was really nice with us thanks so much for doing kids baseball cloth laundry
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Incredibly responsive and flexible host; clean and well maintained. Highly recommend. It was very convenient to where our boys were playing baseball at Rocker B Ranch.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quiet place. Did not spend much awake time at your place. We spent most of our time in town. Had a great time in town and at fossil creak. Bed was a little too firm, but that would be authentic for the time frame you are going for. Thanks for the chance to visit."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stunning views and amazing stay! My son picked up last minute for a tournament at Rocker B and I’m so glad we landed here. Amazing hosts and really felt like at home. My son already said before leaving when we come back for future tournaments he most definitely wants to stay again and gives a 10/10 Thank you so much for hosting us. It was so peaceful and relaxing. This place does not disappoint!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Such a peaceful ""getaway"" . . . . we've loved the view, the freshly blooming iris's right outside our door and the feel of space around us. Thank you, Fern and Danny, for sharing this piece of ""paradise"" with us. We would highly recommend anyone who wanted to be in nature, yet have access to the DFW ""city life"" within a couple hours, to come and rest here."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great host, very attentive and courteous. knowledgeable about the area. Fun to be around."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great spot for a peaceful stay. Definitely recommended if you want a place away from city. Fern & Danny are so friendly and welcoming. 5/5
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Pretty cool to be able to swim in a sun heated pool and use the grill anytime.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,location was lovely and hosts were nice
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Fern & Danny were amazing hosts! Super friendly and really made me feel comfortable, especially for my first travel experience! Gave me my privacy but were there when I needed something! Amazing views and super peaceful stay!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very nice place. Comfortable and quiet. Far from everything but not too far. There’s a great uphill driveway for exercising on. They also have an extremely comfortable couch. Danny and Fern are great people who really care about their guests.
I would definitely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is as advertised. Nice room with peace and quiet. watching the sunrise over the valley with a cup of coffee was a highlight. The hosts were friendly and helpful.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay, the room is super charming and the view is stunning. Fern and Danny were super accommodating and very kind! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly what it said it was plus you can’t get better than the views! Fern and Danny were so accommodating and so sweet!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here while helping with a wedding nearby. It was only a few miles away and a great landing spot for us for the weekend. Great location and beautiful views. The host was wonderful with communicating but we never met them with our crazy schedule. My only complaint is the bathroom/shower which was very small with a huge plastic clingy liner. I mean it was kinda bad. The sink is small and I didn’t even have enough room for my cosmetics and hair stuff to get ready. The decor is fun and rustic but not really my style. There is a lot of western decor and stuff. Great couches for sitting and reading or watching tv. The kitchenette would have been great if needed but we only had coffee and were out the door. Overall a good stay.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and beautiful view. The place has everything you could need and makes for a great getaway from the city.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! Great views and awesome hospitality! Close to Mineral Wells - which is such a great place to explore. Couldn’t have been happier with our stay!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed with Fern and Danny for 5 weeks while remote working. I cannot recommend this place enough — not simply because the location and room are wonderful, but because Danny and Fern are good people. This was above and beyond what was advertised."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely cozy, comfortable and immaculately clean! We wanted to move in! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the quiet, relaxing and serene atmosphere!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location was incredible. Great views, very clean and decorated with charm in mind. Just minutes from town but you still feel isolated. Very affordable and enjoyable."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Such a nice quiet getaway - had a very relaxing time. Beautiful views of the country from the house. And getting into town only takes about 10 minutes.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We absolutely loved Danny and Ferns Air BnB. It was in the perfect location for us, and the view is amazing. They are helpful and friendly hosts who want to make your stay the best it can be. We stayed there for two months, and gained friends who we will stay in touch with.
Highly recommended!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"…not promised too much! Cowboy haven is a real haven also for not-cowboys placed on top of a hill with a really wonderful overview in the middle of the beautiful nature.
The unit is furnished very lovingly and cozy with comfortable bed and couches but also the hosts thought of every existential little thing you needed.
They are very helpful if needed but also decent in the background."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. It's a great little one room get-away. It is attached to their home, but we never really interacted. Great pool area, and an amazing view to the east. Highly recommend it you are looking for a quiet hideaway."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place was perfect. The views, the location, the service, the communication and the little extras that a hotel just doesn't offer. My mom & I can't wait to be back here next year. We've found our new place to stay!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet, convenient location but still country. Awesome views."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful experience, everything is exactly as it is depicted in the photographs and as advertised. The view is to die for, it is a relaxing and comfortable place and the location is a great getaway. We highly recommend!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,BEATIFUL room & view. Fern was very prompt with answering any questions or concerns I had. Her and husband were very sweet. My husband and I can't wait to come back again very soon.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You can’t go wrong with Belle Vista! It’s like home away from home in the first few minutes! We love the owners and can’t wait to book another stay here! This place is worth every penny!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The bed is very comfortable, and the location is very close to downtown."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful home. Lovely host. And the breakfasts were the best! Alice is an amazing chef, take her offer for breakfast every morning. The house is close to everything you might need and easy to find. Will definitely stay here again when I return."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alice was a gracious, responsive, and flexible host. My stay was short and for business. The place and all the wonderful reviews matched my experience. I wish I had the time while I was there to engage with Alice. My affairs and accompanying exhaustion from being on the road most of that day kept me from the opportunity to do so. She was very hospitable and accommodating. The stay was very comfortable and clean. I highly recommend Alice and Hubbard House."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice was super nice and accommodating, and made a tasty breakfast for me as well!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice is a lovely landlady, very flexible and a Paris (France trained) cook ........so she cooked me an English breakfast every morning and had Rib Eye with peppercorn sauce one night for dinner.
I will be going back for sure
Well worth the visit
Cheers"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely host .......and she's a cook too, so had Rib Eye for dinner on the Fri night .....and breakfast every morning.
I will stay there again and recommend it to others
Cheers"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful more than century old house which was spacious and elegant! Very friendly and accommodating host! Be sure to relax on the front porch swing and walk to downtown.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alice is a great host! Her historic house is very cool, the bed was great, and the towels were soft! I would recommend staying at the Hubbard House anytime you're in Mineral Wells!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent location!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were traveling to MW for a family celebration and stayed in Alice's home. Her home brought back so many wonderful memories since I grew up in an 1800's home. Alice is an amazing host and very responsive to all communication before, during and after our visit. Her home has so much character, was very comfortable, safe and the perfect location for our stay. We only wished that we had the opportunity to visit with her more, but hopefully we will be back for another visit. If you are in the area and looking for a unique place to stay, please consider. You will not be disappointed."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alice is very kind and gracious, I love to visit her place. Always cozy and relaxing!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Alice's communications were flawless, and the house is close to everything we planned to do and see. Mineral Wells' main drag is just about three blocks from the house, so it's very handy. We got a good night's sleep."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Alice was wonderful and so kind. Her air conditioner wasn’t working upstairs but she still accommodated me and the bed was very comfy.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Alice is a fabulous host. She provides accurate descriptions of her home and an easy check-in. She is friendly and responsive. I enjoyed returning to her Airbnb.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Alice is such a special and kind person! Beautiful home in a welcoming space. Will stay again!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Alice is a friendly host. You are sleeping in a private room upstairs in her house with a private bathroom. You have free use of her washer and dryer which was a big plus for us since we were traveling on a 2 week motorcycle trip which limits the clothes we can carry. The accomodations were very comfortable as supported by us sleeping until 8:46 AM which is highly unusual
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alice is a very thoughtful and proactive host. She provided me with info about local attractions and we had a good conversation. The house is quite old and full of beautiful furnishings. Fortunately, the bed in my room wasn't very old! It was extremely comfortable. The bathroom had a claw foot tub, but it was set up for taking showers too. The house is on a main street, but because this is a small town, it quieted down at night and I was able to sleep. If you want a convenient location in Mineral Wells this would be a good place to stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alice is the BEST!! She's kind, thoughtful, and considerate. Hubbard House showed her love of the home, and i it was beautiful. I highly recommend staying with Alice."

2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about our stay was comfortable and pleasant; Alice is a warm and wonderful hostess. There's a lot of privacy on the floor where you stay, and it is quiet. The large bed is quite comfortable. The old home is charming in its lingering glory. Also, the service around town, no matter where we went, was so friendly (quite the opposite to be found in Dallas)! We had lots of fun drinking all the Crazy Water we could, and getting to know the kooky town. Be sure to go INSIDE of the Crazy Hotel lobby ... there are cool shops and a bar that sells all Crazy drink recipes, also an interesting museum of the place, with all sorts of ephemera. Great antique stores, too, though the best one only accepts cash and checks, so be prepared! It saved us a lot of money! LOL (We didn't have any that wasn't plastic). Mineral Wells is a great place for a fun, weekend adventure."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! We had such a relaxing two days. Our room was so spacious and comfortable. We slept like babies both nights we were there. So much value for the price. Alice was a fabulous host and we will definitely be back.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Alice was a wonderful host!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay at Alice's place. The house was an older home and lovely decorated. It was very homey. We took advantage of the porch swing to enjoy the evening before turning in for the night. Alice communicated with us on all aspects of our stay from check-in info to where the coffee maker was located. I would definitely stay again.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed our visit in Mineral Wells and loved our time at Alice's place. It's a beautiful, historic home with really large bedrooms and is absolutely lovely. We had the entire upstairs to ourselves and had as much privacy as we liked. The house has a beautiful front porch to sit and relax with a cup of coffee or an after dinner drink. The house is in a historic neighborhood and is within walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants. Alice responded quickly to any questions we had and was warm and welcoming and just a wonderful host. We'll definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,You’re independent and easy in and out of the upstairs room and bathroom. Alice works late so it’s like you have home to yourself. And Shamus is the best dog ever!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alice was an amazing host ! She went way and beyond to take care of us during our weekend trip. Her house was immaculate and has so much characters ! Everything was described as mentioned. Shamus was her cute dog that kept us company while Alice was gone. 5 star rating for all categories and would love to stay there again!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Alice and the house was awesome! This house was historic and very clean and nice. Alice provided great local information for our stay. She was very respectful of our privacy but also joined us when with our invite for a few drinks on the relaxing wrap around porch. Kitchen amenities was top of the line along with dining room. Bed and bath were very nice also. It seemed like a great house to have not just stay the night, but maybe a venue for a gathering or a small elegant wedding."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,very neat spot . Will definitely be going back in the future. I had absolutely no complaints about the space or the stay . Bruce and Maria were very kind .
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful place inside and out. The place was super clean and had everything we needed. Liked that there was a notebook with everything the town has to offer. Even the guest book was helpful, with everyone’s personal experiences. You can tell how much they love and take pride in serving others with how attentive and sweet they are. We loved the Louie theme as well. So much attention to detail. Thank you for sharing your place with us. So glad we got to see Chapo the baby otter and T-Rex the turtle also. We will definitely be back!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The unit has everything you need plus extra touches like a private hot tub, bicycles for guest use, & large covered outdoor area. It is very clean, well thought out, and private. We cooked both indoors & outdoor on the grill and loved the countertop ice machine. Bruce was very nice and accommodating. We are in the area visiting family multiple times a year and are so happy to have found our home away from home. Bonus - We got to meet their baby otter, large tortoise, & farm cats. All-in-all it is an excellent choice for the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Helpful and incredibly serene. Repeat customer. Wonderful unique alternative and experience to other lodging in the area.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here after our wedding at Clark Gardens and had a wonderful stay! It's a perfect little getaway.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay with Bruce and Maria! We felt very comfortable, safe, and relaxed from the very beginning. The location was great, just far enough from others that it was silent at night and so incredibly peaceful. Bruce took the time to give us a tour of the property, telling us all about their business and their goals for the future. They provided us with everything we could ever need to know about the town, amazing recommendations for restaurants, activities, and attractions. We just loved every minute of our visit and are already planning for our next trip back!
Also… BABY OTTERS!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Surprisingly hip accomodations in an incredibly peaceful location. Shower looked akin to something in a $500/night chicago hotel. Many suggestions for food and entertainment in a well organized binder. Very gracious host.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came into town looking for a little quiet getaway, this place was super cute, clean and all the cute personal touches made it that perfect! We enjoyed the private patio and the hot tub was a perfect touch for a romantic atmosphere. Bruce and Maria were very responsive and the book was so informative we ended up checking out a few places they listed. Our only issue was we’d wished we could have stayed longer it was so quiet and beautiful."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, cozy home! Loved the decor, comfy bed and couch, soft sheets and towels. They had everything you need to make you feel comfortable and at home."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great stay

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My parents and I loved staying here. It was super clean and a great space. So nice! Everything looks new! Great air quality, too — Feels so clean when you walk in. Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very clean quiet and comfortable. Everything is new and nice. Kitchen and bathroom are brand new. Location is great, can easily walk to many bars and restaurants. Back yard is a cool place to hang out."
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay. This is an older home with nicely renovated kitchen and bathrooms. The layout is quaint, bringing back find memories of my grandmother's home. It was a very nice place for our family gathering. The kitchen is large and very functional.
The upstairs bathroom is nice but is only accessible through one of the bedrooms. That leaves the main bathroom available for all other guests. It worked out fine for us"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,How was larger than expected. Great space for our family. Host was patient with all my questions. Helpful and responsive. We needed a comfortable home base for our sons wedding and this was the perfect place for us.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were down there for a golf vacation and this house matched our requirements very well. We liked that it had 4 bedrooms. The living area was comfortable to lounge in after a long day. The kitchen was nice in that it had new appliances, as well as new cookwear for making breakfast each morning.
Very nice place to stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The house is just simply lovely and so are is the large yard. The fenced in back yard was so helpful to us as we were traveling with our pets. The house is very well maintained and the beds were comfortable with cozy linens. We even had a little mishap and had some resulting damage that we want to take care of and Michael is helping us with that, as well.
Thank you for giving us a space where we could be close to our family during a very hard time for us. Your space was exactly what we needed."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for our little family. We stayed there for a baseball tournament at rocker B. The house was very welcoming as soon as we walked thru the door. We’d definitely stay there again .
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The inside was clean and comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,5 stars all around! Highly recommended!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Michael's house is gorgeous on the inside. It is updated and feels new with antique touch. Just like home, it is spacious for a full family. Michael is very responsive and helpful when it comes to check-in. I would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling far from home as it is definitely worth staying."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great layout for families. Perfect for kids
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we had a great stay at this beautiful house. thank you!!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful, perfect location and we felt at home. Pictures and words can not explain how great this place is. We will stay here again and tell others about this place."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"House with some historic charm and modern updates. Very clean, very spacious for groups. The house had nice, new appliances but not a full stock of amenities so bring yours with you. Maybe also a fan for one of the upstairs bedrooms that lacks some ventilation. Some remark on the surrounding neighborhood- it’s not the most beautiful, but that didn’t bother us too much. Located minutes away from downtown and other town spots."
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,"Michael's place is charming. The entire house is decorated nicely, and thankfully without clutter. There is quite a bit of space for a group with a huge dining table.
On the downside, when we arrived the temperature in the house was only 58°, and we had to wear our coats for several hours while the downstairs warmed up. Unfortunately if you get the downstairs warm, the upstairs is almost unbearably hot.
I really liked the quality of the pots and pans and knives in the kitchen. There are some really basic things missing in the kitchen which you may want to bring if you are doing any amount of cooking - a colander, pot holders and kitchen towels, and all spices other than salt and pepper.
Overall a pleasant place to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,would stay again!
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"Excellent responsive owner, house is great had some mishaps on arrival but the host stayed in constant communication to rectify issues!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place for our family to stay the weekend. Loving the updates/remodeling that's being done. The beds were very comfortable. There was plenty of room to gather with our family.
2023-09-01,2,Stayed with a pet,"Yard was unmowed and weeds all around the house, gate to get into back yard and entry door was leaning and falling apart. Immediate issue with lock to get in. Host was responsive and friendly but still frustrating. AC wasn’t working the first day and it was almost 80 degrees in the house, host blamed previous residents. Rodents tore open our food packaging in the kitchen and left droppings in the upstairs room. The upstairs room also had a hole (possibly a floor register/air vent?) that was covered over by the installed carpet that my brother almost twisted his ankle in. Host gave a hollow apology and never offered any solutions to make things right. Unsanitary and dangerous until the rodents and floor vent are corrected. - took pictures of the issues as well - would not recommend this place right now"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a couple of families traveling for a baseball tournament and were really thankful to find MIcheal's place in Mineral Wells. It was affordable and gave us plenty of room to spread out. The updated charm of this vintage home was spectacular. I wish the location/neighborhood matched how nice the house was, but I am sure the town will eventually catch up to these updates. Our boys especially loved the game room and smart TVs. The only major things missing were some baking pans, toaster, and ice maker in the kitchen. Overall - I would recommend and would stay there again! Michael as a host was upbeat, responsive, and incredibly friendly and helpful!"
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"Lovely house, very clean, comfortable. It was extremely hot outside, so the A/C had some trouble keeping up, but got down to a cool temperature at night. The house was lovely, but the neighborhood is in pretty rough shape."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet home was very nicely decorated, comfortable, and clean. Felt like a home base for us during a funeral. Great for dogs with clean wood floors and fenced backyard. Owners have done some nice updating and appear to still be working on the renovation. Great value. Met all our needs. Thanks so much for hosting!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute house - looks just like the photos! Had everything we needed - and really tidy and cute inside. The neighborhood is not super appealing; however - we didn’t have a single issue. They reached out the morning of check in and answered any questions nearly instantly ! We’d for sure stay again !
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"It was a nice place and the host/hostess responded quickly. It just wasn't the right place for my group. I had 6 grandchildren with me. The only curtains in the house were sheer curtains in the bedrooms and mini-blinds for the room upstairs. Heavy lightning one night made for a wide-awake crew. I wasn't comfortable with so many bare windows. Couldn't shower downstairs - no window covering. The ceiling in the hallway had two holes - I'm assuming for air intake for the HVAC The A/C was very noisy and ran a lot, but didn't cool very well. Seemed a little dusty also. The upstairs got too warm.
I do appreciate the style and game table in the back and the internet. The washer and dryer are a plus as well. It stormed while we were there and the covered drive-up was nice to have. The grass did need to be mowed, but a nice large yard. Curtains and a better neighborhood would be 5 stars."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Clean place and is equipped with everything you need.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a charming house in a fun little town. We hiked, dug for fossils, explored the Main Street shops, and learned about Crazy Water. The house wasn’t located in a great neighborhood and had a few issues that week with the cleaning & yard service. But overall it was a good place. And the host was fair, kind, and very responsive."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,always a nice time
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house has PLENTY of space and is beautifully renovated. The rooms are well decorated and were clean. We did have an issue with the hot water but the host was VERY responsive. The issue was remedied quickly and led to a pleasant stay. I definitely recommend staying, especially if you have a large family. Plenty of rooms and beds for everyone!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Due to the hard freeze, there was no water in the home when we arrived. However, the host went out of their way to make sure we knew we had options if we wanted to check out. Unfortunately, we had to checkout. The host gave us a full refund. We will most definitely book with them again in the future!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,It was an awesome stay. Will come back!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time! The ONLY things I would change is a few more kitchen supplies,like a wine opener.bottle opener ect. Loved the house."
2022-11-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The inside of home is very nice and comfy bed. The street the home is on is very undesirable, my wife was scared too sleep due to suspicious activity we saw. The hot water heater for shower did not work, had to take cold showers. The bedrooms were warm but the air in living room and kitchen was freezing cold. There was nails, screws, and cigarette buds all over back yard where you had to go to enter home. We paid a little over $800 for this because the pictures of home were nice. The host needs to reevaluate the pricing as it is nice home but it’s in a very undesirable part of town. There was guy walking down street carrying a rifle for no particular reason. At top value I’d say it’s worth $90 a night but for what I paid i definitely did not expect to be in such a rough part of town."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cozy place, host responds quick!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stay, will definitely be back for the next Rocker B ranch baseball tournament."
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"This house in Mineral Wells is absolutely beautiful inside. It’s obvious that it has been fully remodeled recently. It had everything we needed and I would stay there again.
The yard needs work which detracts from the loveliness of the house. Also, even though Mineral Wells is a small town, there was a lot of traffic noise."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"wonderful place to stay, charming home and wonderfully stocked with snacks!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay in Mineral Wells. The location was easy although a bit noisy during peak traffic hours. Inside the home was beautiful and gleaming. Everything about the home showed pride. Leonardo quickly and impressively resolved a heating/cooling issue quite promptly. I took a spa treatment that was wonderful. We really enjoyed the Mexican restaurant across the road.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this house!
Extremely neat and clean, well stocked with dishes, towels, supplies and furniture and beds were very comfortable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful home! It was everything as described plus more! Leonardo was very responsive on communication! Overall a great stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was better than expected inside. We were there with our family for a wedding in town. We could walk to the little main street of the town.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"wonderful communication, I brought up a small drain issue, it was fixed within a few hours, and at our convenience.
checked in with us throughout to ensure we didn't need anything. the house was immaculate, and cozy. we were very happy with everything!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The house was charming and beautifully decorated. Everything was pristine. The snacks were a nice surprise. Close to downtown. Quaint little town. Friendly people. The Host were friendly and quickly responded.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great stay for a wedding weekend! Right by downtown in cute home that is clean and fun!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice, comfortable home. Home was stocked with basic necessities and welcoming snacks which were appreciated after a long drive."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A simply elegant outstanding 1930s Home. Beautifully redone, spotlessly clean and tasteful decorated made it feel very homey. As always, we enjoyed our stay in Mineral Wells and know we will be coming back to visit yet again. Our host was very accommodating. Looking for a weekend get away definitely check this BNB location and unique town out."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this house. Very clean. Quiet neighborhood, close to amenities. Owner was quick to respond and easy to work with. House had everything we needed. We would definitely rent this house again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing - close to everything. Host was super responsive to any question we had. When we come back, we will definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"We have done a girls trip to Mineral Wells for the past five years and this was, by far, our favorite place to stay. It was a great place to gather. We would definitely stay here again. Leonardo answered all of my messages very quickly and I really appreciated that."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,newly remodeled and close to downtown
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect for our family of four. We really enjoyed the entertainment room. Spending our downtime playing Ms. Pac-Man, Fooseball, and Jenga together with so much fun. The location is convenient to the shops and restaurants downtown, nature, and other sites to see in Mineral Wells.
Our host was great. During our stay we messaged Leonardo with a question, his response was quick and helpful."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Thank you so much for having myself and my crew stay while we were working nearby! We enjoyed your home and especially the video game and foosball table! We appreciate your hospitality and we will likely be back!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful host! We really enjoyed our stay. The house is beautiful and well designed to accommodate multiple guests. Beds are comfy and kitchen spacious (even though we didn’t use it). Whenever we had a question, even at odd hours, Leonardo was kind and quick to respond. This place is a gem!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place to stay!! Everything was gorgeous and so beautifully thought through.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful home that was super clean.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! We had an amazing time and loved the place. Super clean and pictures were very accurate.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was very short but the place was very nice. Im from mineral wells but needed a bigger place to lay my head for the night since I was traveling with family and this house met all of our needs. Looks newly renovated, very clean. Some minor issues with the slope of the floor preventing an interior door from closing, but cmon... the house is very old. Certainly no deal breaker there. House was very well kept. Bathrooms and showers were awesome and the kids loved the games offered within the house. Would stay again if needed to be in the area, for sure. I will say the price is a bit much for that area, but since the options are few and far between I totally get it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful historic home which has maintained its charm while possessing all the modern updates to make it a comfortable place to stay. Every amenity, including snacks, water bottles, and toiletries are provided. The beds were comfortable and we all slept soundly. The host was always quick to respond to texts. It was an easy walk to the downtown area where we enjoyed drinks and live music at a few different places. The next time we visit the area, this home is our first choice!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place!! Super cozy!!! Loved how there were snacks and waters in fridge. Would stay here again for sure!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the nicest AirBnB I’ve stayed at. The house looked newly renovated and was very clean. The host had snacks, coffee and even local “crazy” water set up for us when we got there. The house had everything we needed and more. I would highly recommend staying here. The check in was very easy. Leonardo is a great host and responded to questions quickly."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a perfect stay for double family’s, great space, lovely experience."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was very nice and cute my kids loved it so they want to move to the town lol
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This might be one of the best Airbnb homes we’ve ever stayed in!! It was super clean, spacious and literally had everything we needed! We will def be back to stay again! Leo, is a wonderful host!! Very responsive and flexible with check in and check out!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leonardo was a great host! Out of all the options in the area his looked like it best fit our needs best and was spacious for our group. He was quick to respond to guide us through both the check in and check out process. We loved all of the small details in the place from snacks and water to toiletries. We can’t wait to book again with Leonardo, thank you for making our Mineral Wells experience one we’ll never forget"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This home is beautiful! Well maintained and stocked! I would absolutely stay there again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Leonardo had all of the “extras” making this a great stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean! Felt better than home! Will book again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leonardo is such an amazing host, not to say how great his property is. I highly recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Mineral wells. I will definitely be back."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"They were responsive when we needed a code to get in the front door.
They had their home well stocked in the kitchen. They had many good games. The beds were comfortable and everything was lovely and well put together.
We were able to go hiking at the Mineral Wells state park, only a short drive away.
Only the front bedroom was a little noisy from the traffic going by.
The instructions for putting things in the washer were conflicting. One said to start the washer and the other only said to put the towels in it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place with fun games. Really clean too!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We are frequent AirBnB guests so we have many places to use for comparison. This house is the number one for having EVERYTHING and more to make your stay easy and comfortable. The house is arranged, decorated, and equipped to meet your every need. We really appreciated the fact that all the necessities were there but it was not over decorated to the point that there was no space for us to put our things. This has the best kitchen ever--All the appliances are top of the line and new; cookware, dishes, utensils, glassware were plentiful and in top condition. The host provided special touches like generous amounts of snacks, coffee pods, and water bottles. I was amazed to find cling wrap, baggies, foil, etc in the cabinet along with enough spices that you could make a meal. There was even extra toilet paper and paper towels! We did not have to buy anything extra. The host has provided a superior stay option for a reasonable price. Thank you Leo"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely wonderful stay! They thought of everything and it truly was a 5 star experience! Loved all the games and toys for the little ones and fun arcade games for all ages. Truly enjoyed every little detail and hope to be back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I came to Mineral Wells to cook and serve barbecue at a drag racing event found Leonardo’s home was available, when we pulled up the home was absolutely beautiful. We will definitely be coming back to stay at the home we can’t thank him enough for the hospitality and place to call home for the night. 10 out of 10 Recommend his home for a stay in Mineral Wells.
Thank you Leonardo
The Hotbox Barbecue"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,awesome house!!! very clean and well kept...⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved our stay at Leonardo’s place. It was beautiful, spacious and close to downtown. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed here for two nights and the home exceeded our expectations. It was very clean, comfortable, and cozy. We had so much fun playing games & a lot of things were within walking distance from us. The host made the check in & check out process very simple. He responded in a timely manner & was very friendly!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"This place is a must if you're in MW! It was not only very nice but also included so many fun games and such to play, every kitchen appliance and gadget you could ever need within the kitchen, fully stocked laundry room, pet toys and accessories, and it was centrally located. Leonardo was always around to help with anything that we needed - which wasn' t much because the place was stocked with so many snackies and k-cups and water and all the good stuff! They even decked out the place with Christmas decorations that made that it that much more home-y and cute. Would absolutely stay here again if we needed to!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,We had to stay at Leonardo’s place for an extended time while we were in-between houses. The place is perfect and located close to downtown. Leonardo is an awesome host and we appreciate him so much!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place is great for a big family
We came in town for a quinceañera, we rarely hung out there but the little we did it was very nice home. Felt comfy, very roomy, they had games for the kiddos to be entertained."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,Leo’s place is awesome! And he is an excellent host - very responsive and accommodating. The house is beautifully done and very cozy. We felt safe and comfortable here and we will be back again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a fantastic stay.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall nice little tiny home. The shower is a bit odd with a corner door and then it leaked water onto the floor during showers but just put down some towels and you'll be fine. Nice snacks and water provided, great AC and tight insulation so the room stayed super cool in the hot Texas sun. Driveway was a bit steep for our car so be careful that you pull in at an angle or you could scrape bottom if you have a lower big sedan like us. Overall good experience."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay and he is always accommodating. The place is warm and cozy, thank you for the late check in."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very beautiful place very close to downtown.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean, and perfect for our weekend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible find! This place exceeded all expectations, truly better than the pictures! The host's customer service was exceptional, and their attention to detail was remarkable. The space was not only beautiful but also incredibly clean and organized. It felt like a home away from home, equipped with everything you could possibly need. No need to rush to the store on your first day—everything you need is right there waiting for you upon arrival. A truly amazing experience! I truly would love to come back to this place. Thank you Leonardo for such attention to detail and care for the guest."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed 4 nights at Leonardo’s apartment and had no issues at all. His place is very efficient, nicely furnished, quiet, comfortable and was very close to the event I was attending. It was a close walk to downtown Mineral Wells. Leonardo had some nice amenities and a very complete kitchen. I would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was the perfect little place that we needed with a loaded kitchen for somone who likes to make their own food!
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Leonardo’s place is a solid find staying in Mineral Wells, its well laid out and has all the necessary amenities. Although the place is small, it has everything needed. Since I travel with a truck and trailer often, let’s talk parking because this is something I generally look for. There is plenty of room for one truck and one boat in the drive. Two would be a stretch, but the angle on the slope is steep so be mindful of the skeg on your motor and the drop on your hitch. My truck has leveling adjustments which I had to make because my hitch made ground contact."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Very quaint stay! Prefect for one person or a couple! Very cute loved the vibes!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"would stay again, comfortable and peaceful."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent service and very nice suite
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place had it all. The space is small. The size of a hotel room. However, the lay out, and all the amenities have been carefully planned and thought out. There are so many extras, snacks water, toiletries. The location was easy to find, and check in was a breeze. The place is extremely clean, and beautifully decorated. The A/C was cold, and the water was hot with a great shower. There is a big nice closet, with extra towels, and a blanket. The washer and dryer are top of the line and work wonderfully. The downtown area is very close, with places to eat, and shop.
Leonardo was amazing. He was very quick with his response to any question. I will be staying at this property again. The only thing that I had to figure out was where to plug in the hairdryer (which was provided), and my curling iron. There is not a plug in the bathroom, but just around the corner where the coffee pot sits, there is a plug that will reach."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place. I felt safe and had everything I needed.

Leonardo is very responsive."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay for a quick weekend trip! There were plenty of snacks and crazy water in the fridge and some toiletries in the bathroom for those little things you might forget. Leonardo was a super friendly and helpful host and the Airbnb was only about a 2 minute drive to the downtown area. Definitely recommend for your next weekend excursion to mineral wells!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have used this platform for rentals all over the United States in Europe. And I have never seen such an astute use of a small space. Everything was not only recently built and outfitted, but fit together perfectly with a great balance of space and utility. The style was nicely on trend without being heavy handed. And the kitchen was really well appointed with things to make and store food—as well as ready to eat snacks! The host was super responsive to every communication. I loved walking only a few blocks to downtown, and enjoyed the rocking chairs on the porch. Thanks!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Location was great and it was spotless.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfy place plenty of necessities
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we were very pleased, the only thing I would add, is the place is very small, if you have any problems with claustrophobia, I would not consider stayin. here"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this studio to all.
Pristine, well appointed, and the amenities were more then expected. Coffee, snacks, and Crazy bottled water were all provided. This was my first Airbnb experience, and it set the standard for which I'll judge all future Airbnb stays. Leonardo is a top notch, first class host"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed Leonardo's guest house very much. it is very cozy and beautiful. We would definitely recommend staying here.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovingly and thoughtfully furnished Tiny House. An absolute recommendation. Everything is thought of what you need for a pleasant stay. There was even coffee, snacks, etc. available. Our favorite place was the veranda to start the day comfortably with a nice coffee. Insider tip is the washing machine.... LG WashTower. I hope we get one in Germany...."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’m with the others, so cute! Small and very functional.
We dropped in for a last minute stay with our pickup and horse trailer. There was room to pull straight in and the road was wide enough to back out.
They even had a magnetic charger, microfiber washclothes to remove my makeup, creamer for coffee and a grab and go breakfast! Thanks for the cute place to stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our home away from home so cozy,comfy and everything we needed we had. We decided to celebrate our 27 anniversary but we were tired of motels and everything that comes with them that we never rested, from our stay here we are going home we’ll rested, thank you so very much we wish you well with your mini home and you’ll be seeing us alot in the future, Si dios quiere ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leo’s place was great! It was small but the space was utilized well. He has every possible thing you could need from extra towels to cooking supplies to snacks and coffee! The fixtures were all so high quality and the appliances were adorable and functional. Lighting is great, checkin was great, the bed was comfy! Nothing to complain about. This place was well worth the money and I’d definitely stay again if I needed a place in the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't express how amazing this place was! I requested an early check-in, which was accommodated without hassle! The place felt immediately welcoming and warm! The smallest of decorative touches went unnoticed. The host was very meticulous about cleanliness and had a variety of coffee and snacks available for the guests! There was even the famous Crazy water, 4 bottles in the refrigerator! The price for this place was well worth it. The host was very attentive to my needs! I loved that there were plenty of clean, fluffy towels for use, and the air conditioner could make an Eskimo cold! I highly recommend staying here!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This suite is so beautiful, cozy, comfy and immaculately clean. The location near downtown was perfect for my husband and I. We loved the little porch with rocking chairs and ceiling fans. Even in the middle of summer, there was a cool breeze in the morning and I enjoyed sitting out there and drinking coffee and listening to the birds. The only negative - and unfortunately it was a big one for us - is that the bed mattress is so hard it felt like we were sleeping on a boxspring. The pillows were hard too, so it was a painful combination. By our third night, we couldn’t sleep at all and left there in pain. If this would be fixed, we’d definitely be open to future stays at the suite. But as is, afraid not."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great option for a quick trip! Great location!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very accommodating and such a cute place!

We stayed in Leo’s studio for ten days and it surpassed our expectations! Leo must have his PhD in hospitality. Every detail of the décor was well thought out and the space was immaculate. Thank you, Leo! You are a superior host and all the extras you provided made us feel like a wanted guest in your home. We are very grateful and look forward to staying with you again. We love Mineral Wells!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leonardo's studio apartment was squeaky clean! It's small, but worked perfectly for us. We enjoyed sitting on the porch in the mornings and evenings. I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this place.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leonardo was very quick to respond. There was plenty of utensils to cook with and toiletries if needed. There were various spices and the closet hand hangers and plenty of space to put your things away. It was about a five minute drive away from everything in town so it was very convenient. He was flexible with our checkout time and provided everything you could need while away from home. I would highly recommend staying here!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful studio just a couple of blocks from Downtown Mineral Wells- right where we wanted to be. Extremely clean, gorgeous little space with all the amenities we needed. Plus, some local treats for us to enjoy! Instructions were clear and communication was great- very responsive and helpful! We definitely will look for Leonardo’s space when we visit Mineral Wells next!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tammye is the the absolute definition of a SUPER Hostess! She has thought of everything you might need for your stay at her Queen B cottage. The bedding and linens were comfortable and the cottage was supplied with snacks and drinks for our late arrival. To top it off, the following morning she brought us a fabulous homemade breakfast. She took the time to show us where to walk our pup in the pretty pasture with a stream next to the cabin. She and her husband gave us great advice on local services and made us feel at home. This is the kind of hospitality of yesteryear that I thought had long faded away. We will definitely stay again when in the area. Thank you, Tammye!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tammye's hospitality truly made our stay special from the moment we arrived. Her warm welcome made us feel right at home, and her attention to detail was evident in every aspect of our stay. The breakfast she prepared was good and hearty.
The place itself was a delight to stay in, with charming decor and cozy amenities that made our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Tammye had thought of everything to ensure her guests had a fantastic experience.

We also loved all her little dogs; they were so sweet and adorable! We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to mineral wells park comfortable bed friendly host we would go again
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ended up staying with Tammye on our way back north. Made an easy and familiar stay. She is so generous. Wine. Cookies. Expansive breakfast that even accompanies dates diet restrictions. Southern hospitality here, for sure. Good sleep. Lots of extras. Gracious host. Quiet location. Cabin is beside host’s home and on property with other family homes. Just FYI. Made us feel safe."

She is very generous and the breakfast is delicious and a lovely presentation. The linens and bedding all smelled so fresh. So nice to walk about the property. The sunset to the west was beautiful and having been a farm girl, it was a joy to have cows in the scene too. If we come this way again, we will be sure to stop. Mineral Wells is a quaint town too!"

The homemade breakfast every morning was delicious and Tammye provided everything in the room that one would need…. from dog supplies, umbrella, poncho, robe, snacks…. you name it, it was there! Her dogs were adorable and we felt at home. Out of 5 stars, I would give her 6!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Her place was awesome!!!!!! Nice fire pit. Nice outside area. The cabin sits next to a huge pasture. 10 out of 10 I’d recommend. I can’t wait to stay again. I wish we could’ve stayed for the whole weekend - one day wasn’t enough. If I hadn’t booked another place I would’ve paid for another night.
She gave great recommendations. Ended up visiting Rickhouse Brewery (they had great karaoke TBone and Jughead) and got pizza from Pizza Hut because everything was closed by the time we ended out. I loved the people we met, we explored the city a little before leaving back to Dallas. As a black woman we were super comfortable and treated well. Definitely great for all couples and we left our dog home to relax but he would’ve fit with us as well. Her dogs were so sweet. Even if the dark it was well lit! The homemade cookies were a nice touch. And she made us a hugggggge breakfast kind of sad I didn’t leave her a tip. This was the best experience we’ve ever had. I can’t say thank you enough!"

She also had delicious cookies that she had baked waiting for us.
We stayed 3 nights & were served a DELICIOUS breakfast every morning. And I mean very delicious!!
I have nothing but good things to say about Queen B."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tammye was by far the most hospitable hostess I have had! She was there to greet us with her cute chihuahua Frito and a welcoming smile. The cabin was very clean and had everything you would need for a stay. It was decorated with fun items and felt as cozy and warm as my grandma's. We were greeted in the morning with some cute cows right outside the door! The location was very quiet and only 5 minutes away from downtown where you can find great shops and restaurants. Tammye had a cozy fire pit ready when we returned from dinner and even offered up some S'mores! This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a peaceful, welcoming getaway for two. I would definitely recommend if you are in need of a getaway!"

The cottage was just as described: adorable, cozy, and perfectly stocked with everything we could want or need. Tammye surprised us with an INCREDIBLE custom cake that she baked just for our anniversary weekend! She was also so gracious and accommodating about my husband's gluten allergy, even though I only communicated with her about it the day before our arrival. She got him his own package of GF cookies and made sure his breakfast was completely gluten-free, including GF toast! And speaking of that breakfast - it was just as wonderful as everything else! We enjoyed our delicious homemade breakfast outside on the deck in the peaceful country atmosphere. We loved feeding the cows in the morning before breakfast and taking a leisurely walk around their beautiful property before checking out. I sincerely hope we can return for a longer stay!!!!!!!!!"

Can't wait to stay there again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Words can’t describe our stay! Tammye is the Host With the Most! She has thought of everything! Tammye cooked us a gourmet breakfast every morning on the patio under the Oak trees. Great A/C and spotless accommodations! We will recommend this place to everyone!

Tammye is the sweetest and kindest host ever! We will keep coming back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, Tammye is wonderful. She greeted us upon arrival, and she had homemade cookies waiting for us when we went inside. She also cooked and delivered breakfast to us each morning. She is an amazing cook. Consider yourself lucky if you ever get to try her homemade cinnamon rolls!
Now about the property - the cabin itself is so adorable. I loved all the tiny details she put into decorating the space. You can tell that Tammye really cares about her guests. It's also located in a very rural area, so we were able to enjoy the peace and quiet of the Texas country. We even got to feed the cows!
I highly recommend the Queen B cabin if you're traveling to the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,amazing place! we loved it! Thank you so much for allowing us to stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at the Queen B cabin was an absolute amazing experience! I had come into town to go to a benefit last minute and this was one of the only locations I could book and I AM SO GRATEFUL I DID! I was a little hesitant at first due to the home looking like a shed but was immediately blown away with how comfortable this place was. Check-in was too simple and the host met me out front to make sure I didn't need anything else and also asked what time I would like to have breakfast delivered. Knowing I was going to be out late I elected for a 10am delivery which was delivered right on time! This lady can COOK! I'm talking biscuits from scratch, fresh fruit, omelets, strawberry jam, crispy bacon, sausage, fresh coffee, and even mimosas! The bed was super comfortable and I had left my favorite pillow at home. No fear! It had an assortment of pillows on the bed and I was able to find the perfect one. I will DEFINITELY be returning. 10/10 recommend. I'm still thinking about that breakfast!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend and I stayed for a relaxing weekend and this cabin was very convenient to everything we did.
We where blown away by the breakfast was better than what we got at a restaurant.
There where so many great amenities best I have ever experienced in an Airbnb.
The cabin was so charming and the bed so comfy and well air conditioned.
The dogs are the sweetest if you are lucky enough to meet them.
I highly recommend this cabin and the host went out of her way to make sure our stay was enjoyable with recommendations and anything else we needed.
Can’t wait to go back since it’s the best Airbnb in Mineral Wells by far!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I booked this place for my husband and it was great! Location is near the town and east to get to. Tammye is very responsive and a great host.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where do I even start. First of all, this cute cottage looks much better in real life (imagine! It already looks fantastic on the photos!). It has so many extra touches - there is no way you would be happier staying at the hotel. I wish we stayed longer, we only stayed 1 night with my bf and my dog. We arrived late at night after 14 hours in a car and as soon as we opened the door it felt so welcoming and cozy, very well thought through decor and you have so many things to make you feel special and that bring simple joy - homemade cookies, jar with candies, cool drinks, toileteries, cute pillows, wine,..Tammye made a very special vegetarian breakfast for us as we dont eat meat and I wish I could post a picture for y'all - the rich homemade breakfast alone was worth the stay no matter where would she serve it (thank you sooo much!). Very peaceful, private and simply all you are looking for when you start your search with 'cozy cottage/nature/farm/.."". Southern hospitality at its best ❤️"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a fantastic stay with Tammye and Mike in the Queen B Cozy Guest Cabin. Everything you need to complete your stay, Tammye has meticulously thought of. Comfortable bed, great shower, and incredible homemade cookies await your arrival. Before our departure, Tammye created an incredible homemade gourmet breakfast.

The cabin itself is so cozy that both times we've stayed, we relaxed on the bed and ended up falling asleep. One of those perfect lazy afternoon naps that feel so good.
We got to enjoy Tammye's breakfast this stay and - OH MY GOODNESS- was it delicious!!!! It was like something you would expect to get at a boutique brunch restaurant!!
Our stay was truly wonderful and Mike and Tammye are the most friendly and wonderful people you could hope to meet. We plan to stay at the cabin anytime we're in the area and we HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone considering the Mineral Wells area!"

The Queen B is stocked with all the things one would need for a comfortable stay. Tammye’s fresh baked cookies are to die for! We wish we could have brought some home with us. Not only did we get to meet and have a nice conversation with Tammye and her husband, Mike but we also had the opportunity to meet and feed the cows on the property! We highly recommend staying at Tammye’s and being spoiled by her warm, thoughtful hospitality!!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This location stands alone in comparison to others. It is, simply put, the best I have experienced with Airbnb. The host was so nice and welcoming with every accommodation one could think of. I will recommend this location a thousand times and I hope to stay again. It was like a mini resort in the things that were offered."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We just LOVED our stay at this little cabin. It is extremely cozy and we felt right at home immediately.
Tammye and Mike are absolutely FANTASTIC hosts. They were so friendly and communicative. We had the pleasure of talking with them for a bit about the area and their property and it was refreshing just to have great conversation with good people!
I didn't even realize when I booked the stay that Tammye makes breakfast for her guests! We had to leave early in the morning because we were traveling and they didn't want to send us on our way without breakfast, so we woke up to a box of donuts and a couple of orange juices to take with us, along with a hand written note wishing safe travels.
This was a wonderful stay with wonderful hosts and we look forward to staying with them again soon!!! We absolutely highly recommend you stay here!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a short stay at Tammye’s cabin, but it was perfect. Tammye is one of the best communicators we’ve had and she is very welcoming and friendly. The cabin was very comfortable and Tammye made sure that the temperature was great prior to our arrival. She has snacks and delicious cookies ready and also lots of things available in case you forgot something. Would definitely stay there again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"If I could give this place 10/5 stars I would!!!! Tammye and Mike truly made our stay in Mineral Wells such a sweet and magical time! The area is so beautiful and peaceful, and all the details of the Airbnb so intentional and sweet, with every single thing you might possibly need stocked up! We came home to cookies and s’mores materials, and the next morning Tammye cooked us up a gourmet breakfast! The hospitality and kindness we were shown left us feeling absolutely refreshed and rejuvenated. ❤️"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tammye is an amazing host. This place is so cute and comfortable and exactly what we were hoping for. close to everything in mineral wells, but private and a pretty view. a very cozy setting with lots of little extras and a comfy bed.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tammye did an awesome job and went above and beyond as a host! Her and her husband Mike were very welcoming and hospitable. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay and could not have been happier! Thank you so much, Tammye!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stay at a lot of Airbnbs and my husband and I agreed that this is one of the very best we’ve been to! The Queen B was the PERFECT place for us to stop for a night on our big road trip! Tammye is so, so kind and accommodating! Everything was very clean, and she and Mike made sure we had everything we needed. When we arrived we were greeted by fresh baked cookies, and during our stay my daughter enjoyed feeding the cows! I highly recommend booking here. :)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying at The Queen B was a wonderful experience. Tammye was super nice and had us a delicious homemade cake for our Wedding Anniversary with a sweet card. She goes above and beyond what a hostess normally does. Her delicious breakfasts were delivered right to our door. We were pampered and it felt like him a away from home. Everything down to loving on her dogs to talking with her husband was a delightful time. We will definitely be coming back. The Queen B is our place to stay for sure! Thank you Tammye for everything.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Queen B was wonderful. Beautiful location, peaceful and so quite. Very comfortable with all the details.

She prepared the most beautiful fresh breakfast and delivered it personally. What a treat to stay at the Queen B 👑"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for 5 star southern hospitality, Tammye is the woman for you!! She made us feel right at home. They took care of us during the rough weather that blew through. And did I mention Tammye bakes? Best brunch hands down. I will truly miss my stay here, they were the utmost gracious hosts I've ever encountered."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at the queen B can be summarized as AMAZING. We were greeted with the friendliest host and a really great cozy space. Clear communications and help from the host as well as a great parking spot for vehicles. The space is great for two people looking for some time out of the city with a beautiful view. Highly recommend!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at the Queen B. From the excellent communication even before we arrived to the adorable cabin and the amazing breakfast delivered to our door - and everything in between - we felt cared for every step of the way. Everywhere you look in the cabin there’s yet another personal touch. She has thought of everything you may need to have a comfortable stay!
We will definitely return whenever the opportunity arises!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"From our first communication Tammye was a joy and very professional. She messaged clearly and kindly. My arrival time changed at the last minute and she was very accommodating and understanding. Tammye sprung into action after learning of my very late arrival by getting the room set up with adjusted temperature and left some snacks Incase I would be hungry. Her cottage is simply perfection. It is decorated so nicely and literally has EVERYTHING a weary traveler might not realize they need. Hahaha
The property is well maintained and feels safe. It’s quiet and although Tammye is just next door I was given the perfect amount of space to rest (in delicious cotton sheets…BONUS) Breakfast was absolutely Devine!!!Ohhhhh and when I left she packed the sweetest lunch bag for me. Stopping at Tammyes cottage was a big blessing and if I’m ever traveling that way again, I wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else but here."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our hosts were the kindest and most hospitable we’ve ever met through Airbnb! Double triple thumbs up! And hot made-to-order breakfast was generous and superb..,and delivered. Homemade cookies upon arrival…we ordered a box to take home for the freezer to eat on special occasions."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tammye is the best Airbnb hosts we've ever had. She introduced her lovely farm, cows, golf cart (yeah we tried it first time in whole life). We feed cows and it’s also our first time. She is so nice and friendly. The fire pit is very comfortable, and we had a bbq there. We enjoyed the home made cookies from Tammye and breakfast, also fruit. We were born and grow up out of the states, never try country side, but this time truly enjoy the life here. Feel super lucky to come here and see this amazing view. Absolutely we will come back again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"cabin was perfect size for 2 people. tammye had extra toiletries if you forgot something and provided plenty of snacks and bottled water. extremely sweet and helpful host! she had fresh home baked cookies waiting for us and had the cabin warmed up as well. every morning, she made us a well portioned breakfast which was amazing. each day, the breakfast was different as well. definitely recommend a stay here if you're in the area!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect with our stay and Tammye was such a gracious hostess. Breakfast was amazing as were the spiced toffee chocolate chip cookies. The snacks and toiletries were a nice touch as well as the open pasture to walk the dogs. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in the area.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Queen B and host Tammye (& Mike!) are AWESOME! Perfect place to just chill when you're not running around Mineral Wells and the surrounding communities. I know others have commented on the breakfast but it is the real deal. Best welcome cookie ever (it felt healthy but w chunks of chocolate chips) and breakfast to die for.
Above and beyond all expectations! The Queen B is a real treat and you won't find more gracious hosts in Mineral Wells.
Thank you!!!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tammye and Mike are the epitome of what Airbnb hosts should be! They greeted us kindly on arrival with freshly baked spiced toffee chocolate chip cookies, a gourmet Vanilla malt cake, with a Happy Anniversary banner on our cabin, and the sweetest notes accompanying our treats🥰 Mike had the fire pit ready to go for our trip, along with a smores kit. So many amenities and special touches in the Queen B, I could go on and on! Tammyes homemade breakfast was beyond amazing, nothing you would find elsewhere. Such a lovely and peaceful stay. We cannot wait to go back!!"

Tammye also prepared the most amazing breakfast!!!
We will definitely go back and highly recommend their place!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tammye is one of the best Airbnb hosts we’ve ever had. She is so kind and friendly and her place is so homey—full of touches that make you feel cared for. You can hear the birds in the morning and cows and sit out at the fire pit and look at the moon and it’s just lovely. But y’all. The breakfasts. I cannot stress enough how incredibly delicious they were. Tammye puts such love into them and seriously, some of the best baked goods you’ve ever had. Easy drive into Mineral Wells. We had a very restorative weekend. Highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tammye’s place is the perfect little country get away from the big city! The space is cozy for two people, and we were also traveling with our 2, 40+lb dogs. Tammye had thought of all the things you may need and then some. The small fridge, microwave, toaster oven, and coffee pot were convenient for our needs. Linens and bed were very comfortable and allowed for restful sleep. But the most WONDERFUL amenity to this cute cabin is Tammye’s OUTSTANDING personalized breakfast. We were greeted each morning with a delicious breakfast, with very thoughtful touches! Absolutely amazing! In addition to the space, personalized breakfast, and local recommendations, you can enjoy a peaceful stroll through the woods near the cow pasture! This was perfect for our dogs! Do yourself a favor….book this place now! You will not be disappointed!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tammye’s place was nothing short of amazing! From before we checked in, to the very end of our stay, Tammye had everything perfectly planned and made our stay so wonderful. The cottage is beautiful and had all the amenities including thoughtful snacks and drinks. And cookies upon arrival! We took the golf cart out and our dogs had the time of their lives! Tammye’s husband even made us a fire and Tammye was kind enough to provide s’mores as well. We enjoyed this amazing gem and will definitely return as soon as we can! Cannot recommend enough. 😊"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Could not have been a better stay! We felt right at home, Tammye greeted us and showed us everything we needed, gave local recommendations, was so helpful, and the place was not only comfy and cozy but super clean!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super host! This cabin was so special that I booked it for an extra day! Tammye and Mike are amazing!

Tammye made sure I had everything I could possibly need: coffee, snacks of all kinds, bathroom had EVERYTHING you might have forgotten. Great communication and the cabin was definitely something special! Great attention to detail made for such a relaxing stay! This adorable cabin is well-located close to Mineral Wells, Possum Kingdom and Palo Pinto lakes making it easy to get wherever you’re going for your weekend getaway! The cabin has so many wonderful things to look at that it just seems much bigger than it is! As if that weren’t enough, it comes with a fabulous home cooked breakfast! Do yourself a favor, book this one!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We drove through the night from Omaha, NE and we were able to check in a little early and get settled in! Very nice cozy and comfy home. Felt very nice and cool to arrive to after the long travel. Bedrooms were both beautiful and beds were nice and big and very comfy! Bathroom was very big and spacious the shower was amazing and nice and hot! Host was very nice and welcoming and came and checked in on us almost right away! He was very responsive to any message or questions we had! Definitely worth the money and recommend over a hotel stay!! If I ever come back to Texas I will definitely be booking this place again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,David was a great host and so helpful and communicative. Would certainly recommend staying there!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were very impressed with David’s place all the way from booking to checkout. We arrived to a clean, cool, welcoming space. David stopped by about an hour after we checked in to introduce himself and check to see if everything was as we expected and if we needed anything. The two beds were very comfortable. I slept in only one 😂, but I am taking the word of my friend , who slept in the other. The third of our group slept in the recliner, which she does often at her own home anyway, and she was very comfortable also. We had been hiking all day long and it was great opening the door to such a clean and welcoming home to rest and relax for the night!
Oh… I forgot to mention the shower and tub were amazing as well. Nothing special, but sparkling clean, with lots of hot water, and good water pressure!!! We had everything we needed for a perfect stay. We are hoping to return to the area to spend a little more time to explore. Hoping this place is available for our next adventure!"

The location was close to shopping, good restaurants, and many scenic sites. We highly recommend this location!"

We walked in and were immediately stunned by how pristine it was. They definitely made great use of the space. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURES. Guys, the view from the bedroom when waking up was glorious. Watching the sun rise was just the perfect end to our stay. ❤️

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Incredible getaway! So relaxing and peaceful. The bed was extremely comfortable, the view of the sunrise was spectacular. We will definitely be back to enjoy just spending time at at the Airbnb rather than fitting in other activities."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I are so obsessed with this little slice of heaven. It was the perfect place to stay for our friend’s out of town wedding. Darren was delightful to work with. He was quick to respond, very kind, and was available when we had questions. The cabin had so many little details that made it so comfortable and homey. We would love to go back! 11/10 honestly! We highly recommend going for the relaxing getaway and staying for that sunrise (you’ll see what I’m talking about).
Thank you for having us, Darren!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a get away. You could easily stay here the whole weekend and just relax. Very little internet connection, which was perfect to stay off phones and just relax! Darren also has some card games which were very fun! He provided coffee and popcorn, and just made it a nice weekend getaway. He was super responsive! The place was also super clean!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't thank Darren enough for being a great host. When I say the attention to detail was extremely thorough, the gravel was even raked neatly. Darren made sure that check in was a breeze and that everything was up to par during and after departure. The location was great for me, and exactly what I was looking for during my time in the area. Don't look anymore, just book your stay. Trust the reviews."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I choose to get away by myself and it was beautiful.
It helped me get a sense of self love and a deep appreciation for who I am.

I’m 100% coming back to this amazing home again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin is very serene. We stayed here on our wedding night.

Thank you Marcus for making a sad occasion give us joy. Me and my husband along with my sisters and their hubbys had a wonderful visit together. So much better than a hotel!

2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place is cute. Shower stays hot for a while. Bed is super soft, if you require a firm mattress tgis is not your bed. The kitchen was dirty. Dishes, microwave, and oven were dirty. Floor was unswept. I dont wear shoes in the house and I walked across the floor before I brought anything in, to use the bathroom, and my feet got dirty. Cute place overall and it is a private entrance. However, it is not private like I thought, it is right in front of her house. But I think I just misunderstood her description about the amount of privacy."

The space was just as depicted in the photos, offering a clean and cozy environment with all the necessary amenities. One thing to note the Airbnb is located in private property but completely secluded. My absolute favorite part of the experience was meeting Miss Lucy, the family dog, who greeted us with the cutest face and a wagging tail. On our last day, she even stopped by to wish us safe travels."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful little hideaway just far enough outside of town. Enjoyable, quiet and can watch the deer from the chairs out front.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was great! The area is rural and cute.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was wonderful! We really enjoyed ourselves and were quite comfortable with the amenities provided by our host. When we checked in the map did take us to the drive next door, but we could easily see the address on the mailbox the next driveway over and had no issues. The house was very nice and clean and has a mini split AC. It did rain while we were there and the building is metal so I can be loud, but the weather cleared up for us quickly. Everything was true to the listing. The host does live on site, but we had no problems with that. I will say the storm knocked out our power at about 10pm, and within 10 minutes it was back on. I don’t know how or why, but I am thankful. It was a little bit far from downtown, but not terrible, about 15 minutes. The house rules are simple and the house is very accommodating. Katelen was so friendly and I would definitely recommend this BnB. I would stay here again."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I had an amazing one night stay at Kari’s and just wish it had been longer! Kari was very responsive and friendly when I reached out. Her home was super clean, comfortable and peaceful. I felt at home the moment I drove up and it was hard to leave the next day! Kari and her family were kind, friendly and went over and above to make sure my stay was a good one! Kari even brought me dinner when she found out I was going to order from door dash! It’s quiet, peaceful and the perfect place to go to enjoy some down time. Everywaa better than described and there were honey touched that reflect that it’s really important to them for the people that stay in their home to have a super positive experience from start to finish. I’ll definitely be staying again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My girlfriend and I booked this for a weekend getaway from Dallas. We visited Granbury and Mineral wells and wanted something close by. We are thrilled to have booked this! Pics don’t do the property justice. Best Airbnb experience hands down. Our pups were welcome and have a gated area on the side. Bed was very comfortable and the overall space was clean! They had snacks, drinks, toiletries. It was a luxury experience for just a weekend getaway and we will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were in town for a wedding over New Year’s with our dogs. They loved the space as did we. It was peaceful and serene. The hosts were great and the treats in the place were fantastic. I already saved as a favorite so we can go back in the future. It’s hard to find a place to accommodate fur babies and this was perfect.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Would like to thank Kari for a wonderful stay, I stay in air b&b often and this place was over the top! Everything you could need and more with added touches that I have yet to experience at other Air b&b’s I’ve stayed. Super easy to communicate with and more than accommodating for us! Would love to be back."
