2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super unique place to stay! Great location for walking to restaurants, trails to bike, walk and run."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very unique. So peaceful! Very roomy! Love the tall ceilings!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eric and Cheryl’s place is very unique. We arrived late at night and the church big and overwhelming. Once inside it was absolutely beautiful and comfortable. We visited for a graduation and it was central to every direction we needed to go. The kitchen was wonderful and they allowed us to have a few people over to have cake to celebrate my daughter. The space was perfect before heading to dinner. The kitchen was fully stocked. Beds are very comfy.
I’d still rate this home a 5, but it was quite dirty. A lot of dust and cobwebs. The floors were very dirty and there was a load of bedding in the dryer. We had to use the washer and dryer while we were there because we have a small child that got very dirty, otherwise we wouldn’t have noticed the full dryer.
Hosts were quick to respond to everything except when I requested a credit of money paid for booking and canceling bc of an emergency. I was able to rebook and fulfill the reservation but they didn’t honor my request or follow up."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Eric and his wife were fantastic hosts. The place was truly incredible and exactly what we needed. This historic church is renowned in the community, and it holds special significance for my family, as they had worked on it during its time as the 'Hope House.' It was heartwarming to discover that many of our family members had contributed to the place when it served as the Hope House. The space was incredibly comfortable and perfectly suited for hosting a large family dinner. Every guest who joined us was astounded by the renovations and the effort put into restoring the place. We are sincerely grateful for this unforgettable experience."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a restful stay in Ottawa, a lovely small town in Kansas 20 miles from thriving Lawrence. The place is just a couple blocks from a sweet downtown and a few blocks from a beautiful bike path. The hosts were responsive to our many questions as we settled in. The master bedroom and bath were spacious and comfortable. Being converted from a church allowed for a church-size kitchen with plenty of counter space. We enjoyed walking along beautiful old homes in the tree-lined neighborhood, going to a farmer’s market for fresh local meat, eggs, and vegetables, hiking miles of shaded bike path, and feasting on home cooked meals. It was just the R&R we needed. We recommend this getaway, and we certainly will be back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved the peace and quiet of the place and the setting. It was a great escape from the hurry of life. It had all the modern amenities we needed for our trip and still maintained the charm and beauty of the historic building.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an absolutely awesome place to stay. The inside of this old church has been turned into a luxurious palace. Our family loved every bit of it.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely beautiful. They did an amazing job with turning thos church into a gorgeous place to stay. We stayed under a co-workers name then I extended the stay in my name and Eric was awesome about the transition. Thank you so much Eric!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So happy we found this unique property for our stay in Ottawa! This historic church was comfortable and close to shops and eateries on Main Street. It was quite the conversation started with anyone walking by that saw us coming and going.
As we visit Kansas often, this will definitely be our choice for future stays."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! Only stayed for one night but it was so cozy and perfect for what we needed!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The farmhouse was beautiful. The trail cut through the woods and farm was great for our family get out and explore! Lots to look at and lots of relaxing. The only downside was the squeaky bunk bed, our boys had a hard time getting to sleep if the other one moved a bit causing lots of noise. The only other issue (mostly for small kids) is the very hot furnace fireplaces that heat the house. To me they were very cool and worked great, our boys loved laying right in front and warming up! But for our 1 year old it was always a thought on our minds to make sure she was away from them. Overall the place was great and our family had a great time! We would rent again!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I originally was seeking to photograph sunflowers in bloom in Lara's fields. Was delighted to learn Lara has an airbnb right on her farm. Staying there took me back to my growing up on a farm in central Kansas.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely stay at this little Airbnb. Clean, cute, and the yard was so nice to hang out in. We played cornhole & ladderball; and made s’mores in the fire pit.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 6 ranging from 13 to 74 thoroughly enjoyed Eleanor's Farmhouse. Lara was quick to respond to my questions and provided local restaurant recommendations. The house was clean, tidy, and welcoming - Lara had even written our daughter a ""Good luck at Regionals"" (gymnastics) welcoming at the entrance! Talk about attention to detail! The accommodation was just as advertised. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked with everything we needed, and the appliances were in great working condition. We played games (provided), watched a DVD (many provided), and made smores around the firepit in the backyard. Everyone agreed the beds were cozy. We enjoyed walking the short path around the property. The garage was utilized for parking our vehicles when a sudden thunderstorm arose. We all relished the relaxation and togetherness the property provided! If ever needing to stay in the Topeka area again, we will definitely be back! Thank you Lara for being such an amazing host!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely retreat at Lara's house following our daughter's college tour at Kansas State. The house was clean and comfortable and very private. Everything was as Lara described. We enjoyed doing a puzzle together and playing the games provided on the large coffee table. The only downside is that it's very close to the highway, which Lara aptly disclosed, but that made time outside a little less peaceful than we'd hoped. Not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind. Overall, a great place to reconnect and relax."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Most beautiful and homey place weve stayed
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lara was fantastic! So kind, flexible, and communicative. Loved the personalized welcome note also. The house itself was very charming and it was so cool to have a trail to explore on. Definitely will be back if we are in the area again!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Me and my family have stayed here twice now and both have even excellent experiences. I think the best part by far is the outdoors. Nice fire pit and love what they have done with the lights around the trees. Was the perfect peaceful getaway that we needed. They have tons of outdoor games available that are perfect to play outdoors by the fire. The inside is just as amazing & is super homey. We can’t wait for the next time to stay here. I would highly recommend. Lara is very responsive & made check in so easy!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely home and property for our girls weekend. Comfy living space and bedrooms. Great outdoor space for relaxing in the evening.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful farmhouse with all the modern amenities needed for a country get away.

Lara was very welcoming and communicated in a professional and timely manner.
Cannot say enough good things! We highly recommend Eleanor’s Farmhouse and will be back!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for the great place to stay while we were back from Georgia for Christmas. It was nice being by ourselves for a few days! Loved the stoves and the house was much nicer than you would expect for an old farm house once you step inside. My wife and I loved it.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This beautiful farmhouse was exactly what my family needed for a Christmas weekend getaway. Lara is am amazing hostess! She has thought of everything you may need! Not only was the farmhouse beautifully decorated but it was so much larger than the pictures give it credit for!!! Definitely a must see in person. Plenty of safe parking and easy check in and out. We felt right at home. My mom and son and I played games, watched Christmas movies, made s’mores at the fire pit, took walks and did crafts. No phones! (except for pictures) That was my favorite thing of all. We truly got to enjoy each other’s company. We cannot thank Eleanor’s and Lara enough for a perfect time."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just a lovely Oasis. It was closer to the highway than I thought it would be, which was weird at first but honestly wasn't very noticable during our stay. The house is so welcoming, Lara had water and ice in the fridge and snacks and spices ready. The leather couches in the living room are so comfy and the entertainment center is loaded with DVDs and games. The kitchen was easy to navigate.
I highly recommend driving South to Lyndon and visiting the Chapters bookstore and the coffee shop up the street. It added to our experience to have great food choices near the house. We ate at Buzzards Pizza and Cilantros.

It provides a great time to sit back and relax by the camp fire or take a walk around the property. The shower was warm and well pressured. Lara was quick to communicate with any questions we had. I would recommend a stay here and spend another night if I am back in town.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lara was communicative and very helpful while planning my trip and was flexible with some last minutes changes.

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Eleanors! We arrived late at the house and Lara had turned on the furnaces and lights around the house so we wouldn’t walk into a cold, dark, unknown house and when we walked in there was a sign welcoming our family. We all thought that was an awesome gesture! The house was cute and cozy. We felt safe and at home there. Lara was so easy to communicate with and respected our privacy. The family games provided were a nice added touch. The lighted fire pit area was awesome. My family enjoyed walking the trails around the property. There were no houses on either side of the Eleanors so you had complete privacy. We would definitely stay here again if in the area and would recommend to everyone to stay there!"

Eleanor's has everything you need to uncoil from the stressors of life. This was one of the most comfortable airbnb's I've had the pleasure of staying in. This says a lot, because I only stay in homes when I travel. I love the airbnb experience... I highly recommend Eleanor's to couples, families and all weary travelers. Peace and comfort resides at Eleanor's. Thank you..."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lara's space was the perfect respite on my long car journey cross country.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Heidi was amazing. We had to cancel another airbnb the day before our get together and Heidi was incredibly understanding and proactive about our last second booking. She made sure the place was clean, we had everything we needed for our stay, gave clear instructions, and she was extremely kind throughout. The space was absolutely breathtaking. We made good use of the fire pits and smores sticks. The house was so comfortable and luxurious, and the property was just gorgeous. Most of us went on individual walks on some of the trails. It was very serene. This stay was everything we needed and to think it all came together last second is just mind boggling. We are so lucky to have found Heidi and we will absolutely be back at some point."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,This was an amazing stay at a beautiful home! My friends and I had so much fun together and we’re blessed to have such a lovely home to celebrate the new year together in. Heidi was more than amazing and helpful! ❤️
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"The entire stay exceeded expectations! We used it for a leadership retreat. The setting is perfect for getting away and enjoying creation and yet provides all the amenities that are important for spending a weekend as a small group or a larger group. The outdoor amenities (fire pit, outdoor games, seating, land, trails…) only add to this delightful location. It is clean, quality furnishings, plenty of space. The owner was exceptionally responsive, proactive, and increased our confidence in our decision before we arrived. I HIGHLY recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place is truly magical! From the moment you pull into the property you feel the most amazing energy, it’s so peaceful! Heidi’s attention to detail creates a space so warm and inviting where you can unwind and relax. We hosted our Fall Women’s Wellness Retreat here and we all had such a beautiful experience. Thank you Heidi & StoneCreek Crew, we can’t wait to come back!"

Heidi was amazing at answering questions ahead of time and making sure that our stay was everything we hoped for! She was so prompt in her responses when we reached out to her even while we were at the house!
We were meeting as a family of 16 for the weekend of our Mom's Celebration of Life. It was wonderful for gathering together with enough space for all of us to be together and enough room to spread out if we need a break from close proximity. Beautiful decor that wasn't too overwhelming!
Plenty of hot water and water pressure. Large kitchen. Great extra touches, such as soaps and shampoos, plenty of linens, extra bed options, a beautifully written welcome note with lovely gifts for our group to take home and goodies to use during our stay.
She has a wonderful gift of hospitality and wants her guests to feel welcome! Five Star!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, stylish place with everything you need and is close to shops/downtown and biking trails! The WiFi is just slightly slow but not enough to mess with your trip - and the water gets nice and HOT 🥵. For the value you cannot beat this place in Ottawa!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you love antiques and quaint, historical towns, this is your place to be. Lovely decor and all the comforts of home. It is well maintained. Being pet friendly is a plus because there are great sidewalks to walk through the neighborhoods. Local mom and pop restaurants are interspersed on main street with antique stores and coffee shops. I booked this stay on my way from Texas to Minnesota but now I am thinking that Ottawa may be one of my get aways now as well. Very good accommodations."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great quick stay at John’s place. Check in was easy and the size and comfort of the place made it a great value. Would definitely stay again if I’m ever passing through Ottawa. Great location to the downtown area as well. Following the last review, I wanted to provide a cockroach update. We did see multiple roaches outside the house when we arrived at night, likely due to the summer humidity. The house was spotless with the exception of one roach we saw in the kitchen. We did not see it the next morning, nor did we see any outside the front door. Otherwise the place was perfect. Even given the minor issue, I would stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,John’s place was very cool! The theme was carried out well! We stopped for one night passing through. Things were close by if you needed anything. Very clean. Very comfy bed.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Retro it is! What a great suite, the Peacock. Fun and fabulous furnishings that are comfortable and accommodating. The stay at John’s properties are easy from checking in to checking out. Centrally located in Ottawa, close to trails, parks, restaurants and the beautiful courthouse square!"
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"John's ""Peacock Place"" worked out perfectly for us and our pooch! It's very well equipped, clean, and updated! I appreciated John's quick response to any questions that I had. This is a great location and very quiet neighborhood! Excellent walking score - Corner Market is a great place to grab a coffee and sit outside! We'll definitely revisit next time we're in Ottawa!"
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space with fun decor in a small town with so much to do. Were it not for a few issues, this would be my favorite AirBnB so far. John is responsive and offered a partial refund as soon as I made him aware of the problem. I don't doubt he will take care of it, but until then I felt future renters should be aware.
The issues I encountered were bugs. Lots of bugs. I arrived after dark and to my dismay the grass in front of the apartment was infested with roaches. I had never seen such a thing but a Google search identified them as lawn roaches. We saw them that night and any other time we were out after dark. We also had to outmaneuver a few roaches to prevent them from running in as we entered the front door. We encountered 3 roaches inside the apartment as well. The entire place is SPOTLESS - sparkly clean - so I can only assume they are managing to sneak in from their home in the lawn. I also saw a brown recluse crawl out from under the washing machine.
As soon as this problem is eliminated, John's place will be the perfect place to stay. The decor is on point, plenty of plates and cutlery available, a Keurig with a generous amount of coffee provided, and plenty of towels. The vintage fridge and stove/oven are so fun and work perfectly. There are vintage games and a record player in the living room.
Ottawa is a small town with lots to offer. There was live music and food trucks in the park, coffee shops, a decent variety of restaurants. We had dinner at Luigi's which was outstanding. Right next door is a music store where I got an incredible deal on an electric violin, and got invited to their weekly jam (alas, it is a 10 hour drive from where I live 😄). What a great community! I found myself daydreaming of moving there."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so cute and retro! I really enjoyed my stay and my communication with John was always fast and respectful. Will definitely rebook!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value for the price!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very clean and comfortable stay! The vintage look is gorgeous! The bed was super comfortable. Just a couple blocks to walk to get some food, movie or shop. We would stay again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"an amazing place to stay in Kansas with a nearby fantastic bike trail and coffee spot (Mug Shot). awesome decor and art, the coolest kitchen appliances you'll ever see, and an all around awesome spot. was in for a bike race but I hope to be back to stay and to see the area more"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and has everything you’d need!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is nice John always does a good job, pays attention to detail all his places are retro old school and everything that he has works."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,You will love all the color and texture you will find here. Every thing is comfortable and so interesting! Lots of retro amenities… just wait until you see the stove. You really do have to find the Mug Shot coffee shop for muffins and a great cup of joe. You wont be sorry you stayed at John’s house!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most amazing Air B & B’s!! Not only were the accommodations absolutely beautiful, our place had everything we needed to feel like we were at home. Our place was walking distance to the town. & our hosts John & Carol were two of the nicest people. We definitely will be staying here in the future, can’t wait to plan our next trip to Ottawa."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was in such a great location to everything downtown. Walkable to coffee shops, a brewery, boutiques etc. The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom was modern (yet had a cute retro feel) and spacious. It being dog friendly was perfect for us. We just crated them if we ventured out on our own. The TV has all the streaming apps you could imagine. Parking is directly out front and there is a grassy area in the back for pet potty breaks. If we come back to Ottawa we will definitely stay here again."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Liked the stay. If you want to stay in a 70’s nostalgic place this is the place. Reminded me of high school years but very comfortable
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend the Peacock Place to stay when in Ottawa. We attended events in Lawrence and it is an easy close drive. The new renovation is a really feel good space!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would absolutely stay here again!! Beautifully private, friendly animals, and fresh eggs each morning! We met Ty a couple times during our stay and he was so incredibly kind and accommodating."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second time here & would highly recommend! It's a great little getaway from Kansas City & a pretty easy drive too. Ty & Marcie are excellent hosts - they have truly thought of everything! Wood left for us, corn hole set up outside, frosty mugs in the freezer, etc.
The space is SO cozy & always extremely clean. The backyard space is large & private, the fire pit & stars are epic & it's a quick drive or short-ish walk down the gravel road over to the lake, boat ramp & hiking trails.
My brother & I had a much-needed 'chill zone' weekend out at the farm & left better than we came. Will DEFINITELY be back!
Can't forget June & Petunia...they're a treat & LOVE their special, donkey-approved treats - especially strawberries! Apples & carrots were a hit too.
Stop looking & start booking :)"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home, the animals were very sweet. The place felt safe and clean. Loved our stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great stay. love the animals, very quite and nice bonfire!! I would recommend for a peaceful get away!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic, relaxing stay at Ty's house in the country. We were lucky to be surrounded by really pretty snow and enjoyed meeting the sweet donkeys through the fence. We found everything we needed as far as cooking utensils, blankets, towels, etc and spent our time playing games, reading and cooking. There are lots of nice touches, great thorough directions and we are ready to come back when the weather is a bit warmer! Thanks Ty and Marcie!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ty was the best most helpful and kind Host I have ever experienced. We experienced 8” of snow during or stay and lost electricity and was snowbound for a day due to impassable roads with my two wheel drive truck. Ty brought firewood and started us a fire to keep warm. Ty and Marcie went grocery shopping for us so we had food. When we got stuck in snow Ty was up early in freezing snow pulling me out so I could go to work. They took care of us as if we were family! Oh yes! The house was very comfortable and clean!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ty's place was exactly what we needed! We were in the area to celebrate a belated Christmas with several of our children and grandchildren. They all stayed at our daughter's large house, but we ""older"" people wanted our ""own"" space. Ty's place was perfect for that. It was located half a mile from our daughter's home, in a beautiful location, peaceful and quiet. It was perfect for us! Ty's place was exactly like they said in the ad. They provided everything we could need and more! The only thing that saddened us was that we didn't get to see the mules. We had brought apples to let the grandkids feed them. I am assuming this was because of the cold, wet weather and the mules were probably in the barn. Ty has no control over the weather! So we will try again this summer! This is a place we will return to! Thank you Ty and Marcie for making our stay exactly what we needed!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ty is a great host , made our stay great though a difficult time"

Ty and Marcie's instructions are very clear, and everything is well stocked and easy to find. Beds are very comfortable and quiet, ac works great. Beautiful nights by the fire pit with plenty of wood right on hand. The donkeys and chickens are friendly and fun to feed, and Mango the dog is a sweetheart. If you are a fellow birdwatcher, morning coffee at the picnic table is a treat, too. Bring bug spray for night time outside though, especially after a heavy rain. Overall 5+/5. Thanks to Ty and Marcie for providing this gem. Hope to stay again one day when we are back in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful time at Ty and Marcie’s place. There were 4 adults and 3 kids staying there and there was plenty of room in the two bedrooms. Ty was extremely responsive and always answered any questions immediately. The house had everything we needed, Wi-Fi worked great, had all the essentials. Kids had a great time feeding the donkeys and chickens. Ty arranged firewood and had it covered so it was dry. Everything went really well and I would highly recommend this property. Will definitely be back for another stay."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is very special!

This place has everything you need to enjoy a nice getaway. I had never heard of this part of Kansas before and I enjoyed my first trip to Pomona Lake. I will definitely be booking here again and Thank you Ty and Marcie for everything. I appreciate how clean and organized your place is. Not to mention the friendly animals out front. I look forward to coming back someday!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is amazing! We were able to book in on short notice and were blown away by this cozy and adorable farmhouse. My family was able to unwind and relax; even get to visit and enjoy the animals who also live there. June and Petunia are the cutest donkeys I've ever soon, alongside the numerous chickens and a sweet dog named Mango.

The attention to detail in the decor is crazy. Vintage magazines, an 8Track tape player and a stove/oven that is almost a work of art. John was very responsive and flexible. The place was well appointed and comfortable. The location is just a block off of Ottawa’s Main Street and walkable to many restaurants and services. Great place!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an awesome place to stay. The location was perfect, ""downtown Ottawa"". The design, attention to details, cleanliness, just a fun place. It looked like Disney had gone in and their ""imagineers"" created a perfect hotel room from the late 50's early 60's. We loved it, our family loved it, and our friends who stopped by loved it as well."

The unit was very clean and we felt completely safe in the neighborhood too."

I had such an uplifting time staying here overnight, enjoying the original decor, the bright colors and the fun books, games, posters and memorabilia. I wish I could have stayed longer! John and Carol were great hosts and provided a few things I needed, as well as being immediately responsive. I would definitely recommend syncing your own music to the Bluetooth speakers—the sound is awesome. This AirBnB is well worth the visit to Ottowa!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was an amazing place that has collected articles over many years to take you back to you’re own, perhaps your eclectic aunt or even a hip granny’s 1970’s home! I promise I thought I’d find a Silver Christmas Tree in a closet while there!
Definitely look forward to returning to visit our son and stay in one of the other Airbnb’s John offers! What a great stay!
Way to go Sherbet Suite!"

My Insurance is already handling the damage I caused, which obviously is not my normal behavior ever before. I never even got to my next AB&B where I was supposed meet my kids."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far the best Airbnb experience we've had. My wife and I have done many short Kansas trips / Airbnb. The ""Orange"" room which is what my wife calls the ""Sherbert"" is perfect in all ways. Central location, walk to restaurants, first floor, quiet neighborhood, and parking 12' from the front door. Matching chairs aside the 1960's Bluetooth-equipped stereo console with our Spotify 1960's playlist is pure time travel. Splash on a little Tabu or Brut prior to your downtown walk."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sherbet Suite was fantastic! I throughly enjoyed my stay. John and Carol are wonderful hosts and fast to respond to any questions. The apartment is well equipped and immaculately clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Close parking is a big plus as well as the availability of laundry facilities. John and Carol have impeccable taste and the space is appointed with just the right amount of kitsch. The photos don't really do the space justice. The vintage turntable, radio, collectibles and mid century furniture add to the style and appeal. Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,John is a great host
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Cool digs in Ottawa! Easy location, walking distance to restaurants and Mug Shot coffee. Would definitely stay again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Best check in description I’ve ever had. And rest of it was great also!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Oh my gosh! Words can't describe how cool this place is. Kind of a 1960's Retro decor with total attention to detail. We have stayed in many Airbnb's and my wife and I firmly say this is the best one yet. So close to all the best restaurants in Ottawa's historic town. Really....It's like a 3-minute walk to Pizza, Mexican and Italian. Not your normal restaurants either. All are top-rated establishments and fairly priced. Don't hesitate to stay at the Sherbet Suite one block from all the action downtown. The space has retro furniture and a very relaxing atmosphere we were sad to leave. And the 1960's big wood stereo console really kicked it, and it had a Bluetooth device that immediately connected to our Spotify. We will be back."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"John was a great host! My family and I enjoyed our stay, and would stay there again. It was very clean and comfortable. He has done a great job with the decor!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is my second time staying here. My husband and I love the mid-century decor and science-fiction artifacts. My personal favorite feature, though, is the very-modern, extra-large square shower head!!
Check-in and check out were both a breeze. Communication is good. If the need arises we will be back. Thanks again, John, for a wonderful stay."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re a fan of 1960s retro Decour, stay in the sherbet sweet! The hosts have decorated this old apartment in a meticulous re-creation of a 1960s pad. Lots of quirky accessories to examine, including a limited edition Buck Rogers Ray Gun. We also really appreciated the Barbarella posters from the Jane Fonda movie. Great color scheme.
Be forewarned, there is a fair amount of noise from the HVAC system, which is in the center of the apartment, so it’s very hard to escape from the noise of the blower motor."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to spend a weekend. Amazing 70s theme super cool clean and everything is well maintained.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, sparkling clean!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing experience. What a magical place. When you open the door, you’re transported into a different world. The fireplaces, the unique furniture and decor, the books and magazines, even the retro cook books give hours of getting lost exploring. The bed is incredibly comfortable, the rainfall shower will comfortably shower any person. The amount of outlets was so appreciated. The ability to connect my music playlist to the retro radio was awesome. The dishes, the almond milk in the fridge, the abundance of coffee. I loved it all and will now be a regular. You can tell this place is more than just a money maker. It took some heart and soul to create it. The location is outstanding! Walking distance to restaurants and the best coffee I have had in years. Mug Shot Coffee Shop. I can’t wait to return!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest little place! I needed a getaway so that I could get some work done, and it was just what I needed. Quiet, clean, easy check-in, and all the amenities in a stylish space."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I arrived there was some construction going on at the condo next door so I was a bit worried that there would be construction noise. But there was none the entire week, hopefully, they will get it finished up soon. The apartment was well appointed and the 70s groove was awesome. It was perfect for me alone, and there was room for my wife and daughter if I did bring them. The kitchen had everything one would need to cook in (which I did for the week). My only regret is that I didn't have time to go and explore the area with my Nikon and some of John's photography tips.
Thank you for a wonderful stay John."

2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Sherbet Suite! The style and flare John has added was perfect for us!

We found it to be clean and exactly as described and we really loved all the decor. 2 blocks to Mug Shot coffee (enter on Walnut not Main like google maps shows) and also close to restaurants and Not Lost Brewery is a must! Try a flight (4 beer samples), you won’t be disappointed. The place is right on Walnut, which has a bike lane so easy access to trails and the local disc golf courses. We will definitely stay here again when we are back in Ottawa."

Completely better than I expected and for good pricing. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved the place it had its own style that throws you in a bit of a time machine. The whole place was styled and it certainly felt very comfortable even being so far away from home. John was very hospitable throughout the whole stay and made it very easy for check in and check out. Ottawa itself is a beautiful small town and the place was right in downtown ottawa, very easy to go shopping by foot and explore the town. I completely recommend staying here, I will definitely be booking again next time I’m in Ottawa."

The owner was just as amazing very helpful and knowledgeable of the surrounding area. And was very quick to respond if there was questions or concerns.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stunning location up on a secluded hill. As mentioned, the driveway was on the steep side but we managed easy enough with a Tahoe pulling a 4 hole dog trailer. Plenty of room to pull around and park in the driveway.
The view was gorgeous, especially at 5am as the sun was coming up.
Well maintained outside - grass was short so our pups had a massive area to romp after the 8 hr drive up.
Inside was incredibly clean - floors, counters, furniture, bedrooms. Beds were comfy and the a/c kept the house nice and cool. Washer & dryer worked great, even had a couple detergent options.
Location was perfect for us. 35 minutes from our event and 20 minutes to town.
We will absolutely be coming back the next dog event we have up this way!"

The views out the kitchen window watching the sunrise was my favorite, along with the wood burning fireplace in the lower level. Our golden retriever had the time of his life running the property and swimming in the (freezing cold) pond!

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Kania's place is located within 15 minutes of anywhere in town. The neighborhood is peaceful and getting to and from the home was quick and easy. The home itself was much larger inside than what it appears on the outside, yet it still felt very cozy and relaxing inside. The home is full of character and charm. My wife and Aunt loved the decor and aesthetics of the home. We also loved the added amenities such as toothbrushes and razors in case you forgot your own. For those who enjoy snacking, it was great to have snacks provided especially if you have late night cravings! We were also quite impressed with the lot size given that it's an older neighborhood in a small town. There was plenty of space to hangout and have a good time out on the massive deck or in the large yard. This is especially great if you have multiple guests or kids who want to run around. We would highly recommend Kania's place to anyone staying in town and would definitely choose it again if we're in the area!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kanias house was amazing!! She has put so much thought and detail into every inch of the house. We were greeted by fresh flowers from her yard. They were beautiful. We were traveling during a storm. Kania reached out to me to let me know they were on tornado watch and let me know there was emergency lighting at the house. We didn’t need it. But she was very very helpful and made us feel at ease. I can’t recommend this house enough. It had been my favorite airbnb to stay in. Every detail was perfect.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Over the last 4 years, I’ve stayed in most of the Airbnb’s in Ottawa and I must say I have not had any bad experiences! Some were better than others, but this house is truly special! Beautifully restored, extremely clean, very peaceful. I highly recommend staying here. From the personal note left for us to the wonderful kitchen to make a nice meal in, we truly enjoyed our stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My friends and 3 month old son stayed here. The back yard and deck was our favorite part!! Kitchen and bedrooms were the perfect size. Kania was great, she always messaged me back within in hour if we ever needed anything ! I would definitely look into staying in this awesome historic home !"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay in a wonderfully restored historic home. Wine on the front porch was a great way to end the day. Modern and spacious kitchen. Awesome mattresses and bedding. Well designed upstairs bath. Big back yard that we didn’t take advantage of.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful historical house! Our beds were comfortable, the house was extremely clean, the kitchen was well-equipped with all of the cooking essentials (and more!), the back deck was a nice place to hang on a lovely spring day - we enjoyed our stay very much and would return again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Your home is lovely. Well cared for. My sister and her hubby loved it. I was unfortunate enough to fall during the night on the Thursday before we left home. Broke my right hip that required surgery. Rest assured next trip I will be there. Thank you for being so gracious.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are very honored to stay at this beautiful historic house.
The house is gracefully restored. We felt the Christmas spirit as soon as we stepped inside. We will stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Kania's house in Ottawa was LOVELY!
We stayed over Thanksgiving with our adult children and a grandbaby while visiting family in Kansas! It was perfect for us!
Tons of space! Beautifully decorated! Homey feeling! Quiet neighborhood!
The bedroom with the sitting room off the side was perfect for a baby in a playpen! Anything you could need (bathroom essentials, snacks, coffee bar, kitchen essentials, usb port for charging phones, first aid kit) is in this house because Kania has thought of everything! Especially if you have an appreciation of historical houses you will be blown away by the amazing details of this home!
We will definitely be back again! Thanks for a great stay Kania!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a nice quiet neighborhood close to the OU campus.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Why am I leaving another review for this house, because I stayed again. The house is beautiful. All the amenities are great for a short or long stay. If you forgot something, I'm sure Kania has thought about it and already has it for you. The fresh eggs and adorable homemade cookies. What? Incredible. I actually tried to book it another night, but I was too slow and someone else nabbed it up. You will love staying here."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We would recommend this place . It was just the two of us but a great place for a family !
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in the area for my son's wedding, and this place was a perfect place to meet up with our daughter and other son from out of state. we had lots of work to do for the wedding, cooking and helping set up as it was on a ranch. I called the host beforehand so they would be prepared for family dropping by and lots of coming and going to and from wedding prep etc... they were very understanding. They were very friendly and shared info with us about their place. And best of all it was quiet and beautiful there. Will be recommending to any needing a place near there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,One of my favorite Airbnb’s. We have a big family and Terry made us feel right at home. 10/10
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place. The view was great. Beds comfortable.
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Good location !
2024-04-01,2,Stayed one night,Terry's place was okay. If everything had gone well it would have been perfect. However when we arrived the floors were soaked. I contacted Terry and he came over there and told me it had just rained. The rooms stunk and we had to always keep our shoes on. There was multiple leaks which caused all of this.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Hangar was the perfect place for family to gather to spend a wedding weekend in the neighboring small town of Williamsburg. The decorations were very impressive, the beds were comfortable, and the living room was very inviting with leather furniture, a nice dining room table, and a desk. Everything you could ever need for a weekend stay was provided. The Hanger is in a beautiful, safe, private area. The photos don't do it justice, it was much bigger than I had anticipated. We would love to stay there again any time we return to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for 7 of us! Plenty of space, everything you need for a comfortable stay. My kids loved the snack basket! My husband and I loved that it was quiet and private. Beautiful property!"

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place. We were in town for a wedding so my family stayed here instead of a hotel which was a good choice. great relaxing setting, plenty of room and amenities. The host had a lot of nice touches and place was unique (hangar cabin) and clean. if in the area or passing through we recommend this place for sure. Also kitchen came in handy as we helped prepare a couple of dishes. (stove was a bit smaller than usual, but worked well for our needs)."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our first stay at the hangar while traveling through the area. The location was great, right off the highway. The home was very comfortable and thoughtfully furnished. It was super quiet and peaceful. The only downside was that we had to leave early in the morning to continue our travels, so we didn't have more time to enjoy it. :-)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great find! We were in the area for a marathon, Terrys place was perfect for our needs and our budget. Ottawa is a neat old town!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was GREAT! It was comfortable and the decor was wonderful and unique. We especially enjoyed the maps of the area and the bird eye view of the place. And being from Texas we loved the butcher diagrams of the pig and cow. I would recommend this place for anyone whether it be for 1 day or a week vacation. We ate at Smoked Creation and that was great. This was a nice break in our trip from Texas to Illinois for vacation! Terry was more than accommodating, he was super! Have a great day!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay! Clean and plenty of room to spread out. Will definitely stay again if we need a place to stay up that way in the future.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Scott's listing was a very peaceful and private location. The private lake was scenic with plentiful fish. Everything was very clean upon arrival and Scott was more than happy to help out with anything when asked.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at Tallgrass Lodge and would definitely love to stay every time we are in the area! We spent a few peaceful and relaxing days fishing and hanging out with family and am excited to try some metal detecting near the civil war sites!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family and I stayed here for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This gem was very clean, had all the amenities a person needs while away from home. The owners were very friendly and a pleasure to interact with. Lots of character with country charm and soft comfy beds."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely perfect in every way!! Will definitely be staying again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The typical guests are most likely hunters, but it worked very well for us.
It is very private, with Scott's house 250 meters away the only other occupied structure on the farm.
We needed a place on relatively short notice for a KU football game, not too far distant from Lawrence (16 miles), and could also allow us to leave our dog unattended on game day. Turns out that Scott has an excellent chain link dog enclosure with insulated dog house at the lodge.
The kitchen and laundry room are what I would call fully equipped, with detergents, cleaning products kitchen utensils, herbs and spices; it was all there.
The welcome gift of a jar of clover honey from the farm's own apiary sweetened the deal."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great place to stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tallgrass is a very quiet and peaceful rustic location away from everything. The lodge is perfectly set within the farm fields surrounded by all the sights and sounds of nature. Our family was visiting University of Kansas for parents weekend and found a diamond in the rough. The lodge is perfect, extremely clean, modern and comfortable with plenty of room. Scott is great, very attentive, friendly and watchful especially when a hail storm went through. A favorite was the delicious clover honey that was harvested that day we got there! The perfect ending to parents weekend was being able to go fishing with our son at dusk on the Lake located on the property. Absolutely beautiful and was even able capture a picture of a bald eagle perched in a tree. Doesn’t get any better!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Lodge was great and a Scott the host was so awesome! Super clean and had almost all amenities one would need - we couldn't find any real knives but we made do. The property was beautiful and there was enough space for parking 4 large vehicles.
On the second night, we arrived to find a camp fire set up for us by the host and some extra wood and some Cornhole boards, which we made good use of.
We might have errantly been expecting a little more privacy - didn't realize the property was on the same grounds as the host, but we didn't experience any problems.
All in all, beautiful space, inside and out! Do recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for the price especially!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Diane’s stay was beautiful! Had some confusion with the lock on the door but that was my fault (and due to us being extremely exhausted haha) instructions were clear and easy!
Would recommend this stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I appreciated Diane’s proactive communication in reaching out to say hello and sending us another personal message day of check-in. The place was very clean and as described. As someone else said, “would stay here again - better than a hotel.” :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a cool place! We had a great time in Diane´s apartment which was converted from the old Town Hall in Ottawa, KS. This is a pretty little town with very friendly people. Can´t beat the location, value, and amentities at Diane´s!"

Very comfortable bed, spacious living room to sprawl out, full size kitchen (if I want to cook). So easy to find, quiet neighborhood and quiet building. See you in December Diane."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We will definitely be back.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space itself was great overall, the only downside is that you can hear everything going on outside or in the building as the walls seem to be extremely thin."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came into town for a wedding and this was a great location since it was only a couple blocks away! Very quiet and lots of space. Easy parking. Loved how close it was to Main Street. Right down the street from a great coffee place too! Was a way better option than a hotel, glad I stayed here."

2023-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house. Clean and nicely decorated. It is nice place to stay with no kids. Based on description and price, we thought it was a little bigger. Also, the heat only blows well in the small bedroom, And a little in the living room. So if you have any doors shut to the other rooms, they get cold fast. Especially, the back bedroom. The small bedroom door did not fully shut either.
Other than those few things, it’s a nice little place. And the host is very friendly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the second time we have stayed at the Hickory House. Lou had it decorated so nice for Christmas. It made wrapping gifts all the more fun!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Hickory House was perfect for our visit to watch our great niece in the Spotlight Dance production of the Nutcracker and as an added bonus we welcomed our newborn great nephew while we were there. A wonderful place to stay. Thank you, Lou!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Cute 2 bd 1 ba house in quiet neighborhood. Super comfy queen-sized beds. High gentle rain showerhead great for our tall people. Lou had it well stocked. Games, iron and board, garment steamer (didn't use but nice), dishes, pots, tea kettle, keurig And regular coffee maker, 3 kinds of coffee (the filters are in the fridge), several types of tea, toaster, appliances, lots of towels, lots of blankets, kleenex, books, baskets with: snacks shampoos, etc. etc. etc. Good heating system. The house was nicely decorated cute lamps, quilts, fab wood table, and seasonal decorations. Even had seasonal coffee available. Downsides:
Creepy back play room, we closed the curtains and ignored it.
Floors were very creaky. Bedrooms had doors for privacy, but you could still hear someone walking in main room. Felt uncomfortable moving around if someone went to sleep early.
Pin required for tv services: hulu, netflix, espn, etc, so couldn't use.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lou is an excellent hostess. We met her upon arrival. She was friendly and made us feel welcome. Our family loves history; the Hickory house is full of nostalgia and tidbits of history everywhere. My kids enjoyed playing eye-spy with the pieces of local and family history and items that we guessed were probably hand-made. There were so many thoughtful touches that made this place a charming place to stay.

Lou’s easy, friendly and quick communications, self check-in and comfortable home made our short stay so nice. The home itself is super cute with fun decor, comfortable beds and relaxing environment. There’s nothing you’ll be in want of…she even had snacks laid out on the table. If we had more time we would have taken a walk downtown to eat out. Ottawa looks like a nice town with many dining options and has a laid back vibe. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Lou’s house. It was a cozy, comfy place. Lou’s decor was fun and nostalgic. The bed and pillows were so comfortable. I was thrilled to find that she has feather pillows, which is a must for me. Everything you could possibly need was at my fingertips. And I loved how close the house was to downtown Ottawa and the park. I felt right at home at Lou’s Hickory House (love the name)! Thanks Lou!!"

Would definitely recommend for 1-2 couples and up to 3 children (if one could be in a pack n play)."

2021-07-01,3,Group trip,The stay met our needs while visiting Ottawa KS. It's a cute home and town. There was some back and forth with the owner after we departed the house that was somewhat confusing and unpleasant. Perhaps a phone call would have been more productive than messaging. I tried to call the owner but was unable to connect.

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is a WONDERFUL place to curl up with family!
While it's true that traveling always accompanies a sense of adventure and the wonder in discovery of new things, one fact is unavoidable: Staying in someone else's house--or even a hotel--never feels like home.
However, the hosts of The Hickory House have gone so far above and beyond expectations, familiar is nearer than it typically is in a VRBO setting. Listing everything would require pages and pages of accolades, but we'll relate some highlights here. This lovely home is stocked with just about everything you can possibly need--not only for a place to sleep and shower, but even for gatherings as well.
All the quotidian, expected accoutrements are easily present: hand soap, sanitizer, extra toilet paper, coffee, tea, creamer, sugar. But we also found a glut of additions which easily go overlooked when not provided.
Our mattress was clearly not a third hand-me-down from your cousin's guest room, guaranteed to leave you in pain the next day: we slept quite comfortably in the room that is most likely not considered the master bedroom (we selected it to be in the front of the house).
We didn't cook while we were here, but the basics are at our disposal as well, with a teakettle, plenty of dishes, pans, casserole dishes, cooking oil, a few basic spices, aluminum foil, blender, toaster, microwave, and three coffee makers--small/large standard drips and a Keurig. A fire extinguisher in the kitchen illustrates so well how thoroughly everything is planned.
One of the first things we noticed was the dining table, quaintly set in a welcoming arrangement. There was a basket of snacks and a stack of local restaurant menus and pamphlets describing local attractions. We unfortunately didn't get a photo--it was lovely before we ate lunch, displacing everything.
The house was clearly built in the early 20th century, and it retains all the charm from that time. However, there are just enough modern upgrades to make the stay practical. A remodeled shower and toilet top the list, because really... quaint is beautiful until you're actually using that Sears catalog for ""other"" progress and missing technological progress.
Other contemporary essentials include
5GHz (and 2.4) WiFi
and this reporter's favorite: a *wired* connection, for when additional security is needed (e.g. banking or remote work)
digital thermostat, super easy to use
A flat screen TV, probably 45"" (though we never turned it on)
power strips, outlet expanders, and extension cords (those old houses don't have many outlets--but the Hickory House has you covered)
A few unexpected things we found as pleasant surprises:
a coat tree just inside the door
folding chairs
umbrellas
about a million towels
plenty of drawers and dresser space
a flashlight
feminine products
basic medical, e.g. Tums, Tylenol, Ibuprofen, band-aids, allergy pills
zip lock sandwich bags
extra face masks
This is a beautiful slice of nostalgic Americana and an ideal place to relax and unwind or base family activities around OU. We can comfortably and confidently recommend The Hickory House to anyone who plans to stay in the Ottawa area.
Enjoy!"

There are two Rails to Trails there and easy to get on because of the Hickory House's location. We did 95 miles while there for four days.
