Getting in was easy and the house had everything we needed for a few people. The master bed was very comfortable and the wifi was great as well.

2022-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"It‚Äôs a good place to stay. It looks big in pictures but wasn‚Äôt as big as I thought. A really cute place, great space and had all that we needed except space and a large living room. Really enjoyed staying here. If it‚Äôs extremely cold the floor is very cold and it takes the heater time to catch up but the house will normally be a great temperature. We just happened to be there when it was extremely cold outside. We were thankful to find the extra blankets that were provided.
It‚Äôs easy to get to, is close to everything you need in town and has a really cool sun room and big back yard with a fire pit to sit around. I would easily stay here again and probably will."

2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,The master bed was broken down and was sagging in the middle. There was not hot water in the master shower. There was water coming up around the wax seal in both bathrooms that flooded the master bedroom that we had to clean during the middleof the the night and raw sewage coming up in the showers. We were offered a place to go take showers and we were brought more clean towels since we used the ones we had to clean the floors. This happened the night before Thanksgiving so no plumber was available. Owner was responsive to messages. Home was nice other than those problems. We stay in Tulia about once a year and we would consider renting from her again.

We were looking for a place for 4 adults and three kids and this place was perfect. The place looked exactly as advertised. It also had everything we needed.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was the perfect place for 4 of us to stay for a few days while we went with Dust Devil Outfitters for cranes and geese. This is an older home with crooked walls and cracked cielings, but has been cleaned nicely and repainted. For the price it can't be beat, especially the proximity to where we were hunting. Highly recommend if you need a place to crash on your trip."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were extremely helpful, responsive, and friendly. you won't find better hosts. the place is clean and very nice. I highly recommend this place 10/10 would stay again"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,I had to book this place at the last minute because the host of another place I had reserved for 7 months cancelled on my shortly before my arrival. Shawna was great to deal with.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb was lovely to stay at, clean, comfortable, and quiet. We received instructions that we would get instructions on how to find the home, but did not get those ahead of time. We were traveling across the state, so we had to unfortunately call the host late at night when we couldn't find the home, but they were very helpful then. For anyone renting this Airbnb in the future, there are two streets with the same name in the same new home subdivision, so if you don't find the first time around, the rest of the street is further down, after an undeveloped field."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a very quiet stay and the home was very clean and new. Would stay again!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice place to stay. Worked out good for us as we were working right outside of Shallowater. If we are back in the area we will be booking with Garrott again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My mom and I visited Shallowater for our family reunion and staying here was one of the highlights of our trip! We had everything we needed close by and we were able to relax and enjoy our stay there! The plan is to have the reunion in Shallowater again next year and we will definitely do our best to book here again!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We needed a place close to who we visited in Shallowater. Shallowater has limited restaurants so plan around that. Lysha's food truck food in town is very very good but she is not open every day. The locations was quiet. Very rarely do you get a two car garage and we used the space to work on our project. The house is practically new. 15 minutes from West Lubbock. We will probably stay there again in the not too distant future.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great to find a place in Shallowater.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Garrott's place was exactly what we needed. We came to town for my son's graduation at Texas Tech and needed a house for our family. All of the restuarnts were booked so we brought my son's grill over and cooked out. Garrott's place had all of the kitchen supplies we needed. The house was very clean and the neighborhood was very quite. Overall our stay was wonderful.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfectly clean house. Beds were very comfortable. Everything was new and the house was a relaxing overnight stay for our 2 day drive. We would absolutely stay here again. Not many establishments nearby (just one Sonic) as this is a new neighborhood so if you don‚Äôt like Sonic plan ahead for meals.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house that we used as a home base while we were visiting family all around the area. Would've been 5‚≠êÔ∏è, but the workmanship on the inside just wasn't quite right. Shower was beautiful!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay. Although it has fewer amenities than other places, this rental was well worth it, and it truly was cozy. Well done, Omar!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was very peaceful and quiet.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Omar‚Äôs place was very clean and had all the amenities needed for my stay. Would book again with Omar if my travels take me back to Plainview.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I recommend this home if you‚Äôre looking to have a nice private clean place to stay. The neighborhood was alittle different but nobody bothered us. This home is clean and comfy
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great Place !
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Good: The home was very clean with a newly remodeled kitchen and bathroom with new appliances and a full size washer and dryer. Shower was excellent. The beds were comfortable and offered a great nights rest. I selected this home based on the wheel chair accessibility which allowed for my daughter (paraplegic) to visit. She was able to access the home and maneuver though the front door (a big plus), but the bathroom door was too narrow for her wheel chair.
The Bad: The home is located in an older section of Plainview and much of the neighborhood is on the run down side. There were loose dogs running the neighborhood including a Pit who spent most of his time on the front porch. Omar has invested in the remodel but the house lacks any decorating. A lamp on the bedside tables and some wall decor would go a long ways in making the functional house a little more homey."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Omar‚Äôs place was great! A home away from home. It had everything we needed. I liked he didn‚Äôt have crazy checkout rules, etc. Home was a little older so maybe that is why it was so cold. That is my only complaint, which is more of a me problem, but I felt like the home wasn‚Äôt getting warm. Other than that.. I would definitely stay if Omar allowed!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Place was very clean, quiet and overall comfy and very convenient for our stay. Was in town for Graduation, and Omar‚Äôs home is ideally located only a 5 min drive from the university. I do have to mention however, it was very cold and although the centralized heater worked great, unless kept on the home would loose heat quickly. Then again, I‚Äôm easily cold so it could very well just be my opinion."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first stay at an air bnb was really nice, everyone that came by to visit loved it, I will stay again I, highly recommend this location super accommodating."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2023-08-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"The neighborhood is peaceful. What you would expect in Plainview. House is close to everything.
Not very appealing to be in the house or come in. Curbside is not attractive.
The house is old, tried to update but there are some issues that need fixing.
There was a leak in kitchen my husband had to fix it. The house smelled very bad, smells like mold. We had to leave the windows open and spray to help with the smell. The flooring is falling apart, not done well, I think the mold smell may be coming from under the flooring. Lots of bugs and cockroaches.
Theres nowhere to put your stuff in the bedrooms, no closet or dresser.
The one closet in one bedroom had a dirty smelly mop & used as a utility closet.
There‚Äôs some work to be done to the house and I think once that is done it will be a better stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Will come back.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great home, very clean and good space. Would definitely stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Omar was super helpful and responsive! Home was nice and will definitely book again when in the area!
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, the pictures match where you‚Äôre staying. There‚Äôs pros & cons.
Pros: good location, good size house, easy check-in, comfortable pretty standard home.
Cons:
1) there‚Äôs lots of flies/gnats and other insects INSIDE the house and the host does provide fly swatters and bug spray, but me personally, that‚Äôs an inconvenience.
2) We got there at night and the area is SUPER DARK. No street light, so we passed it twice before finally seeing the house.
3) this is the biggest con to me. The host doesn‚Äôt state on his post ‚Äúno pets‚Äù. I have a service animal, so naturally he goes with me. Instead of the host reaching out to me personally about my animal, he complained very quickly to AirBNB and their support team messaged me. It was a whole mess and the whole weekend I felt uneasy on if I had to look elsewhere or not. I personally felt like he should of just messaged me to discuss. And then to say at the end he is thinking about welcoming pets, I felt annoyed. I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely stay here the next time we're in Plainviw -- my parents are buried there and I was born and raised there, so we will be back. The place was perfectly clean, orand it's very nice (full kitchen +that washer and dryer) and spacious. If Omar reverses the refrigerator doors so that they open to the left (please, for our next visit to üòÅ), the place will be pretty much perfect!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,great place to stay close to everything in plainview
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice remodel on inside
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Visited Tulia for nephews graduation. Close to the football field and school. We walked to graduation versus driving. Few minutes away from my families favorite restaurant. Small town hospitality. An hour drive to Amarillo airport or less depending on how you drive. Kymberly was great at communicating the check-in and check-out process along with a minor issue with the stove. Great host. Will definitely book again in the future.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cozy place to stay. Would definitely recommend. The host was great! Very responsive and accommodating
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice house, beautifully decorated in all rooms. The location was perfect for us, very quiet all around. Kitchen was fully loaded with pots and pans and dishes. We made our own breakfast and sometimes dinner. There were five of us females, so sharing one bathroom was a challenge but we made it work. The beds were great, but a little high for my shorter siblings (a stepping stool would have been nice). The house was great and so was the owner when we contacted her. We would definitely stay there again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre coming across this lovely home, go ahead and book. It is a great place to stay in Tulia. Beds are super comfortable, plenty of bath towels and seating space. Reclining couches were a plus!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is wonderful and full of family history. It is decorated in a way that shows off the vintage style of the cottage. You feel like your at grandma's house!!! Will stay here again during our travels. I hope all families treat this place with respect and take care of the cottage and it's history. You would not eat on the vintage china in the corner cabinet!! Don't let the kids eat on the carpet in the good living room, put them in the family room. Treat it with respect it is a gem.."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the cleanest and nicest places we have ever stayed, it is top notch. Super clean, great amenities, very responsive host and the place had a great comfy feel to it. We had to use the heat and air conditioning while we were in Plainview and they worked great. Great neighborhood, quiet, peaceful and within minutes of shopping and food."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Me and my kiddos enjoyed our stay. Instructions were provided for every step. List of restaurant near. Things to do. I believe Dora went above and beyond to make her guest feel comfortable by every little detail and thought that was put in!

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and cute place, with good amenities. Dora was a friendly and very responsive host, and the place fit the description and photos. We enjoyed our stay. The only downside for me was all of the constantly barking and howling dogs in the neighborhood. They detracted from what would otherwise have been a very peaceful and quiet neighborhood. Since I am very sensitive to noise, I suspect that this wouldn't bother most people."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stay was good no problems
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We needed a place for overnight for 4 adults and 3 kids. It worked for one night for adaptable people. I would highly recommend for a family of 5.

I would highly recommend this Airbnb.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pictures don‚Äôt do justice, beautiful peaceful place"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This hidden gem was such a pleasure to stay in! This was the perfect location for our adventures in the Caprock Canyon region. This guest home is remote, quiet and private. The sunrises and sunsets are similar to watercolor paintings - amazing visuals! The stars are indescribable and awe-inspiring. The wrap around porch is an awesome touch and we likely would've used it if it hadn't been a windy 40 degree night during our stay. The inside of the home is nothing short luxurious. You immediately feel comfortable and taken care of upon entry. The hosts were very thoughtful in the design and amenities of this place. We didn't need for anything. Enjoy the bath - it's excellent! I would recommend grocery shopping prior to arrival to ensure you have what you need - the restaurant scene in Nazareth and surrounding is nonexistent. Lol. The history behind the hosts, the land and the guest home are so amazing. Thank you for sharing your slice of heaven with us! If you're passing through-Book it!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There really aren‚Äôt enough words to describe how amazing this place is. It‚Äôs absolutely stunning. Gina and Ryan thought of everything and the detail in every room is awesome. It was super clean, peaceful and private. And as amazing as the Casita is, Gina and Ryan are even more amazing. They are so responsive to answer any and every question we had and are so friendly. They are everything you could hope for in a host. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Thanks Gina and Ryan for everything."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay for a short anniversary weekend getaway. The place was lovely and clean. The kitchen was well appointed and had all the pots and pans we needed to cook with while we were there.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very neat little place for a getaway, private, peaceful, away from the road. The house was amazing, better than than the pictures. Definitely want to go back during the summer sometime and hopefully a little longer than one night."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Obsessed with this little place! We stopped here after 12 hours of driving and it was so exactly what we needed after a drive. Peaceful, clean, and was like being at home. The hosts were super friendly, responsive and even left cinnamon roles for us. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First of all this was not like staying at an airbnb property. This was like staying at your best friends house. There are so many things that they provide in the casita. I won't go through the list but take my word for it. Because I'm a airbnb host myself. The history behind the family and property are worth the visit and stay on its own. coming from Dallas we stopped at Caprock and spent the day. We stayed at the cabin 4 nights and went to Palo Duro for 3 days. Then stopped at Caprock again on our way back to Dallas. But we did stay the night in Childress on the way back. They you for the wonderful stay and will join you again next time we are in the area. cheers
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous place to stay. The sunrises and sunsets are amazing. If you're looking for a place to escape the hustle of the big city, this is the place. You'll be glad you booked the Casita. The Dobmeier's are excellent hosts. Very quick to respond and very accommodating. If you're thinking about booking the Casita, just do it."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place! All of the details and personal touches on this home are perfect. Made use of the speaker system and enjoyed sitting outside relaxing. The tub and shower were so nice, especially after a long day of hiking. If we are ever in this area again, we will definitely book this home!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don‚Äôt know where to start. When I saw the pictures of the listing and read all of the great reviews, I instantly booked. It was even more beautiful than I was expecting. Each time I thought ‚Äúthey thought of everything‚Äù another nice surprise awaited. It was so quiet and the furnishings were gorgeous. I cant lie; the saddle was the deciding factor as it incorporated my love for horses. The hosts were very responsive and everything was as described plus some. Ladies - that bathtub is to die for. The sunset was a nice bonus. We were able to chat with the owner‚Äôs uncle while there. He was the nicest man and my husband thoroughly enjoyed learning the history of the casita and he was so impressed with the workmanship. Thank you Ryan and Gina for making our 30th anniversary trip so special."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievable views of the Texas sunset. If you are looking for a place to stay in the country, this is the place! The interior design is just beautiful. Of course, the southern hospitality was superb."

We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The -D- Casita was a luxury stay in the country! Newly renovated with top notch finishes throughout. A lot of love, care, and attention went into every detail of the space. The casita is stocked with all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The property is located down a country road and is surrounded by open farm land. The casita has a porch that wraps around the entire space and is a great place to relax, unwind, and enjoy. The casita made the perfect getaway! It is located about an hour away from state and private parks. It was a great base location to explore the area. Gina and Ryan were the best hosts! They were thoughtful, kind, communicated quickly, and created a memorable exceptional experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lindsey answered all my questions quickly and our stay was very nice. Quiet, clean , restful, and close to shopping and eating places.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfection location to access stores, museums, restaurants. Apartment is well stocked with everything needed for staying at this location. Bed is extremely comfortable and spacious. We stayed in Unit 4 which is a corner unit and its perfectly quite. This apartment made our stay very comfortable and enjoyable while in Plainview."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good stay. The house is spacious & well furnished. The game room in the basement was a plus for the grandkids, but we were never able to get the TV in that room to work. There's a TV in the living room with no remote to go with it, luckily the remote to the non working TV was used. Apryll was nice enough to bring out an iron/ironing board after we checked in. She also was very accommodating in allowing us to have a small dinner to celebrate our grandson's graduation.
There was one big negative during our stay, but it did make it rather uncomfortable... the whole house was full of dust & cobwebs, especially around & under the beds, and it smelled musty, like it hadn't been aired out or cleaned in some time. I think the cleaning staff needs to pay more attention to those cleaning details as the dust caused alot of throat dryness & irritation to all of us staying in the house. I'm guessing the house had not been rented in some time. House shdve been cleaned before check in."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place. close enough to Lubbock for a quick day trip.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,My family and I came into town for a funeral‚Ä¶ We are originally from Tulia and Apryll‚Äôs house made us feel as if we were back home. The house was spacious and had everything we needed.

The spacious living room/ dining & kitchen/ game area were perfect. The back yard was large and ideal for the two yard games we brought. The pool table and foosball table in the game room offered enjoyable, competitive entertainment. We cooked burgers on the grill one evening and a spaghetti dinner another evening, and were able to all come together at the large (eight seats) dining room table. The house was spotlessly clean, had plenty of quality large bath towels, and nice bed linens. We visit Tulia two to three times a year, and will definitely stay here every time."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice house with kitchen and game room (with a pool table!). Would be a great value for multiple families traveling together--as one person, I had my pick of the three bedrooms. Clean, comfortable, and very nicely decorated.
Also, I didn't have much time to look around Tulia before getting on the road, but the local donut shop is worth a stop. Friendly people and tasty food and coffee."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Apryll's place is just as beautiful as the pictures suggest. She was super responsive and friendly!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"it is a small town. for added amenities, can travel to Plainview; yet neighborhood was quiet and safe/
house is unusual and a bit dated. Heating and cooling are fine but a bit room by room - what I expected.
the space a large and can accommodate multiple persons."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for our anniversary & completely loved the place! It felt very cozy & welcoming! It is a themed saloon, but it is not over the top! They really nailed the decor! We loved lounging in the hammocks while watching the sunset or soaking in the hot tub while cloud watching. We even had a golf hole-in-one competition lol. The scenery was beautiful & we even got visited by a little bunny. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in the canyon area! We will be coming back!! ü©µ"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We cannot say enough good things about this amazing stay!
As tenured airbnbers this was our absolute favorite place!
So impressed with all the details throughout the house that kept it on theme without making it cheesy.
The hot tub under the stars was fantastic and breathtaking.
The location was gorgeous, serene, and secluded without having to drive too far outside of a major city.
We had fun playing the provided mini golf, laying out in the hammocks, rocking in the chairs on the wrap around upper deck porch, and gathering around fire pit. There was also a grill and a tent provided, that we unfortunately didn‚Äôt have time to use. Ches provided so many amenities that it was easy to stay-in and vacation there without just making it a landing spot after driving to other destinations on our getaway.
Ches was the perfect host, was excellent at prompt communication, and you could tell he wanted to make sure all his guest have the best time at his ‚ÄúSaloon‚Äù.
We already want to be back!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Chelsey's place for my parents as they were planning a hiking getaway to the two nearby state parks. Spoiler alert: they loved it! Chelsey was so kind to let me book for them and allow me to pass communications onto them. They loved their stay and had the best time. On their behalf (and mine), we highly recommend booking Chelsey's saloon if you're in the area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay! The saloon was great, and Chelsey was an amazing host. West Texas is crafted by Gods hand, one of the most beautiful. Maybe better than Southeast Texas."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Saloon house is even better in person. It‚Äôs private and quiet and perfect for a couple‚Äôs getaway. We loved the hammocks, fire pit, hot tub, mini golf and peaceful balcony. We saw a beautiful show of stars at night too. Highly recommend!"

Hope to stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This little gem has to be one of our most favorite Airbnb stays yet. It doesn‚Äôt get any more peaceful or relaxing than this.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Sunset Saloon was wonderful! It is such a charming and unique place, and we loved the theme and attention to detail. Very clean, plenty of amenities, nicely built and very well maintained. Chesley has thought of everything to make guests feel comfortable and at home. This place has so much to offer. The outdoor space is just as charming and was so peaceful and quiet, which is what we were looking for. We enjoyed laying in the hammocks, the hot tub and we were able to grill while we were there. The property is just as described, but even more lovely in person! Chesley was an amazing host! Welcoming, great with communication and he provided clear instructions for everything.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place. Great for visiting Palo Duro Canyon. About a 30 minute drive. Definitely recommend.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chesley's Happy Saloon tiny home was just as promised. It was very thoughtfully decorated in a Western theme and had lots of amenities to make the stay comfortable and relaxing. The skylight above the bed where one can look at the stars, along with the cozy electric fireplace in the loft bedroom, lends to a contemplative ambience. The outdoor fire pit would be great for making S'mores with the kids. Too bad I didn't have them with me, but hopefully on another trip. The tiny home is in a quiet area where the stars are your company. It makes for a great stay! I hope to make another stay there. Chesley is a great host! He communicates well, is responsive, and obviously takes great care of his place. He was a pleasure to deal with."

Things were very clean & very cute. Would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family desperately needed a peaceful relaxing getaway. We hiked the Palo Duro, ate in Canyon then drove a short distance to Happy. It was PERFECT!

Me and my husband were talking and after this was the best built tiny home we‚Äôve ever stayed in. Lots of character with attention to detail for everything! We will be back for another gateway in the future. Our favorite part was spending time in the hot tub while staring up at stars!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute saloon loved up to its name. All of the outdoor seating was nice to enjoy, the hammocks, the porch swings. The hot top was a lovely bonus! There was Netflix on TV and hot water in the shower. They were ever accommodating when I asked to check in early. If you want a place with character, this is it!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an incredible place! We loved soaking in the hot tub watching the sunset. Utterly magical! The bed is comfy and kitchen is well stocked! We‚Äôll definitely stay again when we road trip through the area!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect. We were looking for a place to relax and unwind and thats exactly what we got out of the saloon. We enjoyed listening to the birds chirping and the cows. This is a great place to get away and reboot. The porch swing and rocking chairs were great for relaxing with a cup of coffee. The star gazing from the hot tub was absolutely wonderful. We will be staying again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is like no other‚Äîin the very best way! Beautiful, comfortable, so unique and wonderful. Host was perfect and we really enjoyed every bit of our stay. Thanks for sharing your little piece of wonderful."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a wonderful and relaxing time. The saloon is beautiful and comfortable all at the same time. We thoroughly enjoyed our time spent there. Chesley is a wonderful host and kept in contact and explained things very well. I love the introduction book, it keeps everything organized in one place. The bed was extremely comfortable. We both slept like babies. I am already planning our next visit."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a surprise ‚Äústaycation‚Äù (not too far from home) for my husband for us to have a getaway from all the stressors we‚Äôve had lately. How to even fit into words how much we loved this place will be a challenge. Ches‚Äôs place was amazing and more than I had even imagined! His attention to detail around the place as well as with the reservation and stay its self was phenomenal. My husband and I throughly enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and even wrote a song together while there (musicians). We have already started planning to come back when it‚Äôs warmer and we can utilize more of the outdoor amenities besides just the amazing hot tub. I‚Äôve also started sending the link to the Sunset Saloon to other friends in this area as well as those farther away that have started a ‚Äúwish list‚Äù of unique Airbnb locations they want to visit. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay; from the location, amenities, cleanliness and responsiveness of the host than what received at the saloon!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I loved our stay at the sunset saloon! It was just the most well put together, cute Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in and Ches was very helpful any time we needed to reach out to him."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is one of a kind in the heart of Texas. Very unique and truly a gem! If you get the opportunity to stay here I highly recommend it. Super clean and beat expectations. Would return. Host is really cool and friendly. Lots of details went into this property making it feel like the real Wild West! I thought I was in a movie. It was awesome!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are a lot of things that could have been my favorites at this place - privacy, comfy bed, great WiFi, clean space, interesting outdoor activities, but watching the Texas sunset from the hot tub takes the cake. I won‚Äôt forget it. Loved this place."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Saloon was a surprise for my birthday and it was everything we could have hoped for! Ches was super helpful in moments where I had a question and quick to reply. The Saloon is nice and secluded, peaceful and so beautiful. Between the sunrise, the sunset, and the stars‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt have wished for anything better! Lovely stay and super easy to feel comfortable!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun and unique place. The saloon was very clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed. It‚Äôs a great place for watching the sunset and star gazing. Chesley communicated well both before and during our stay. Would definitely recommend to friends!

A great experience"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"beautiful, nicely furnished, comfortable lots of extras. we will be back"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a fantastic experience for our family. We didn‚Äôt tell our children the theme of the location beforehand and they thought it was so fun. We loved looking at the stars from the hot tub (even though it was freezing out). We were careful to not slip on ice. We loved the decor. We loved the tasty snacks available.
We also loved Ches‚Äôs hospitality.
Hopefully we can return again one day!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The perfect place for my husband and I to have a one night getaway while still being so close to our family in Amarillo. We always try to find unique places to stay when we travel, and the saloon did not disappoint.
I was especially impressed with the cleanliness of the house and the amenities provided. This was easily one of my favorite Airbnbs I‚Äôve stayed in. 1000% will come back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Must say that this place was the best we‚Äôve stayed so far! The wife and I spent our one year anniversary there and I have to say we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better spot. If you are looking for a quiet, peaceful, away from everything, and relaxing place, then the Sunset Saloon is the place for you."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"100% recommend. This is a whimsical experience you can only have in Texas. I was never a fan of Texas, but the Sunset Saloon changed my mind. Thank you, Chelsey for sharing your masterpiece with us. We will be back soon!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Chesley was such a great host, and his place was perfect for an overnight stay! We‚Äôve already talked about coming back and staying longer. I can honestly say this is the best Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed at ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely the best cozy happy place I have been too. They style is what made me rent it then it was our mini honeymoon and best place ever for it. we will be back forsure
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed 2 nights. The Hosts were super nice and friendly! Very helpful and Easy to communicate with and had the cabin spotless when I arrived! This was the most unique place I‚Äôve stayed in on Airbnb. It was such an awesome theme and set up and vibe! The views from the balcony are one of a kind ! Bed was comfortable! I didn‚Äôt get to use the hot tub due to the weather but it Had everything I needed and more! Location is Completely secluded and peaceful away from it all but still only 15 min to the nearest grocery store! Don‚Äôt miss out on staying here if you‚Äôre in the area!! 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool saloon in a private but easy to find area! There is a house somewhat nearby but you still get plenty of privacy. There is a very sweet big dog to greet you when you arrive! Palo Duro not too far away is also worth a trip!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best Air BNB that I have ever stayed at. My husband and I just got married and decided to go here for our ‚Äúmini-moon.‚Äù It was such a great decision. The bathroom was spotless, everything you could need or might have forgotten was somewhere in the kitchen.
The country western aesthetic is so much cuter in person and the pictures already look great. We definitely want to come back and stay again. It was so peaceful and at night you can see rabbits on the property. The stars were also crazy beautiful out there because of the lack of light pollution.
So peaceful and warm. 10/10 stay for sure and I‚Äôm recommending to everyone. I hardly ever write long reviews but this was worth it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our time at this home! It was so cold and windy one night but we decided to give the hot tub a go and it was perfect!! Didn‚Äôt even notice the cold or wind, the hot tub was a wonderful addition to the experience. Every detail of the home decor was much appreciated. We plan to go back several times a yearüòä"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for three nights to discover the surroundings and especially Palo Duro State Park (35 min drive). The place is beautiful and super picturesque, perfect for really exploring North Texas. We loved it! The host is super responsive and the place has plenty to take care of and relax."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I used the saloon as a ‚Äúhome base‚Äù to hiking the state parks nearby. I didn‚Äôt tell them about the uniqueness beforehand and pulling up to it, they were so surprised!
Everything was clean, tidy, and even better than I thought it would be. We had up to 50mph wind gusts two days/nights, so it wasn‚Äôt ideal for being outside, but once the wind died down, we hung out on the patio and it was great.
Coffee in the morning watching the sunrise and a glass of wine at night watching the sunset and seeing the stars was a peaceful break I needed. My kids have asked to make this actually trip."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful scenery , calm and peacfull"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the decor from the outside, through the house to the backyard. House was clean. The bed is very comfortable. Took note of the carpentry details. Beautiful! We sat in the rockers on the balcony and amazed at the stars. Truly enjoyed. Hope to return."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an awesome place to come and unwind!! Chesley was super easy to work with, and the sunset saloon was everything we were expecting...rustic western decor, comfy and squeaky clean, and so many comfy amenities! Thanks, Chesley!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Sunset Saloon is easily one of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve ever experienced. Chesley takes time to think of all kinds of ways to make your stay as comfortable, enjoyable, and unique as possible. This was my second stay, and I can‚Äôt wait to head back.
The Sunset Saloon is an absolute gem!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very enjoyable and offered great views from the balcony. The saloon was very clean and was more spacious than what we expected.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ches' tiny home is like stepping into an alternate reality, where the charm and hospitality that we see in old west movies is married to all of the modern comforts like wifi and air conditioning. Ches has put so much love into building an amazing experience for his guests, and I don't think it's possible to feel anything but delight in this place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay off the beaten path. Very comfortable space for 2 people. It‚Äôs like you in the middle of nowhere, great experience!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing experience. We brought our telescope and spent the night looking at the moon, Jupiter, and Saturn. I have never seen the sky light up with so many stars.
Chesley was one of the best host I have ever had. He is extremely accommodating and you can tell the love that he put into this place.
I would recommend this place to everyone.
All I can say is WOW!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We decided to stop here on our way home from Colorado, rather than driving 13 hours straight. I‚Äôm so ‚Äúhappy‚Äù we found this place on Airbnb! It might be the cutest little house we have stayed in on our entire two week trip! We loved it so much, and may have to return for a longer stay sometime! The views for miles were spectacular! Thanks for a wonderful stay! ~Violet & Ian"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent our ""minimoon"" here, and the Sunset Saloon was the perfect place to unplug and relax! You can really tell that this place was built and designed intricately. The interior really gave a saloon-like feel, and was incredibly clean! We spent much of our time taking advantage of the beautiful outdoor space. We grilled, played yard games, and enjoyed the scenic views. The saloon is perfect for watching sunrises, sunsets, and the stars! The host was responsive and friendly, and we would absolutely love to stay here again! Such a perfect place to get away!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was great! Quite, peaceful, we really enjoyed the hammocks."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Girls trip 3 generation....Everybody totally enjoy ages 15 to 70!!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place really is a gem. Appropriately named, the Sunset Saloon delivers gorgeous sunsets in the evenings, and allowed us to really unwind and enjoy the peace of being in the country. Ches put a lot of love and thought into all the details and we were very comfortable throughout."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place. Wish we had stayed more than one night. There were a few house flies that got into the place when we opened the doors and were a very minor nuisance, but not during the night. Probably inevitable given the rural location and in no way detracted from an amazing stay. Ches has succeeded in creating an extremely comfortable, fun, unique AirBnB with the additional benefit of nice outside spaces to relax. 100% recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was the perfect weekend getaway! The place was so cute and peaceful ! I highly recommend spending a weekend at the Sunset Saloon! Chelsey is an amazing host.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the Sunset Saloon and Chesley: what a combo!
It‚Äôs just a beautifully unique AirBnB with the best touches and amenities. I cannot wait to go back. I‚Äôm pretty sure I smiled the whole time I was there; probably even in my sleep. The place just made me Happy! (wiiink).
And Chesley belongs in the AirBnB Hall of Fame: responsive, thoughtful, proactive, and just incredibly kind.
I will be back for sure!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"That was the most beautiful airbnb we have ever been to. We had western saloon in the middle of nowhere for ourselves. Also, it is the best place for stargazing and sunset watchers. There is a fireplace and minigolf. The owner responds very quickly (like under one minute). We will come back for sure to the greatest place in the greatest state of all."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a brilliant place. Genuinely a highlight of our Texas road trip.
The location is amazing, feels like a remote outpost of humanity while you‚Äôre there but is actually very accessible (and find-able).
Interiors and exteriors are exactly as creative and delightful as they appear in the photos, we promise you will not be disappointed by a single thing. Chesley is a rapid-fire responder to all correspondence and a very helpful host. Thanks again for having us, we‚Äôll be back one day! :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt recommend the Sunset Saloon enough! It was such a nice weekend away. Ches was extremely accommodating and made us feel so welcome. The saloon is perfect for a relaxing, peaceful weekend. Everything was incredible and we will certainly be back!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just left. I‚Äôm ready to go back. Man I have no words‚Ä¶. I love Chesley‚Äôs place! Totally unique and restful experience. It was good for the soul. Ches was a fantastic host‚Ä¶. lots of little extras that made his hosting stand out. The Salon was really clean as well.
I‚Äôm planning a trip back, just because I have to. Lol. Thanks for a great stay! üëä"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was absolutely awesome place to the detail to stay and Chesley was awesome to deal with. Definitely coming back. Thank you
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want a truly unique experience, choose this home!
The place is in beautiful surroundings and the decor is really complete. Never have I been so impressed with a place to stay.
We had some amazing nature experiences around sunset.
The host had gone above and beyond to make us feel at home and we didn't want to go from there at all.
We hope to have the opportunity to live here another time."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Sunset Saloon was incredible! We appreciated the attention to detail put in to the decor and considerations of the provided amenities. Ches was very responsive and helpful! This place is a must, and we‚Äôll be coming back for sure!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Saloon was so cute! It's an adorable tiny house with so many thoughtful personal touches. It was private and peaceful and felt very cozy and romantic. We were able to relax and enjoy being away from the city. I would definitely recommend this place.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was hands down the coolest Airbnb I‚Äôve been to. We had such a fun time at the saloon and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings that allowed us to relax during our long trip. The space was super clean and beautifully put together. We couldn‚Äôt have stayed anywhere better. Highly recommend this Airbnb.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,awesome place and awesome experience
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Sunset Saloon is very cool! Very peaceful place to relax and getaway. The only downside is it is farther from Palo Duro state park and Amarillo than we thought based off the listing. Palo duro is about a 35/40 minute drive and depending on where in Amarillo you‚Äôre going it‚Äôs 45 minutes. Not a deal breaker but was farther than we were hoping from Palo Duro. Otherwise the stay was great, lots of little wildlife around and beautiful view of the stars on a clear night. Ches was super helpful and quick to answer any questions!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The sunset saloon served as a peaceful, unique getaway. Chesley brought the western charm to life with every thought out decorative and practical detail. We enjoyed the snacks, games, and views from the balcony! Definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolute gem! - one of the best AirBnB experiences we‚Äôve ever had! 100% worth the drive being a little outside Amarillo. You will appreciate the seclusion and quiet under the stars at night. I couldn‚Äôt believe Ches had only been hosting for a month. His place was more refined and thoughtful than most AirBnBs. I hope this place gets features in the magazine because it is clearly a work of love for the host and his attention to detail pervades the experience. We are absolutely coming back and I am recommending it to everyone.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great find! We really enjoyed our overnight stay at this unique place. we have stayed in many locations, but this was by far one of our favorites! We are hoping to come back at some point and enjoy a couple of relaxing days here. Loved it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a low key place to unwind, one that has everything you need to relax then I highly suggest this place. We barely turned on the TV, the entertainment is in the scenery and in the very special oasis that Chesley has created here. WOWzie."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Sunset Saloon was an unforgettable experience.

Chesley's exceptional hospitality was the cherry on top, as they consistently went the extra mile to ensure our comfort.
Nestled in a peaceful location, the tiny home provided a perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The upper-level patio became a sanctuary for stargazing, enhancing the charm of this unique getaway. Strongly recommend this unique Airbnb for a truly memorable escape."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was private, quiet, and miles out of the panhandle plains. Beautiful views! The complimentary snacks was a plus. Very comfortable to stay and lodge for a few days. Really takes you away from the world for a bit. Definitely will come back in the near future."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My daughters and I enjoyed our stay. Her house was perfect for our needs.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A delightful home located incredibly close to Wayland Baptist University. It was the perfect ""home"" base for us as we dropped off our son to begin his freshman year at WBU. Shelby was very responsive and the home was very clean and comfortable!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were thankful to find this two bedroom, one bath home in Plainview.
Definitely better than staying in a hotel room.
The house was quite clean, which we appreciated very much.
Everything we needed was provided, just took a little searching sometimes.
The Wi-Fi worked well and the workspace was handy.
Shelby had alerted us a couple of days ahead of time that her current refrigerator had stopped working, so we really appreciated the effort she made to get a brand new refrigerator set up before we arrived.
As others have commented, while we felt comfortable staying in Shelby‚Äôs home, it was a little awkward being there with all of her personal belongings in the house.
We made Shelby aware of a few issues with ceiling fixtures, but were able to work around them.
Sadly, we never were able to unlock the back door so we could enjoy the patio and yard. The afternoon prior to our departure, a friend of Shelby‚Äôs came by to help with the ceiling fixtures and explained that Shelby has been waiting for a replacement back door and we could have accessed the backyard by going through the garage and utility room.
The location was excellent and provided easy access to all of the events we attended in Plainview.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay! Very convenient to anything in Plainview. Full kitchen, coffee provided and so much better than the local hotels. Comfy beds and super cute touches all around the house. There is even a nice backyard area if you need a spot to relax! Pictures don't do it justice, you won't be disappointed."

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Shelby's place was a perfect location for us as we visited Plainview. Beds are so comfortable and Shelby was so easy to work with. This was the first time we have stayed somewhere where it was obvious someone lived there regularly, so I felt a bit odd feeling like I was in someone else's space, especially when cooking in the kitchen. I felt a bit like I was snooping as I opened cupboards to locate items needed to make a meal. That is all on me, not Shelby or the place. It was clean and comfortable. Loved the backyard, although the neighborhood kids weren't all that friendly as they threw sticks at my grandkids. Again, not Shelby or the houses fault. I would still recommend her place if your coming through Plainview."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed this wonderful, clean & restful home. I would recommend it & look forward to staying there again. Thank you Shelby."

Very easy to find and very clean"
2018-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shelby‚Äôs place is centrally located, very clean, and has a great backyard!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Shelby‚Äôs house in order to visit with our great friend in Plainview and it was wonderful to be able to host him there for TV watching, visiting and eating. This is the first airbnb house we‚Äôve been in where ALL of the owners‚Äô things are still in the house, so we were surprised but after figuring out how to plug in our chargers for phones and computers, we were very comfortable and enjoyed her knickknacks and pictures along the wall. It made it very homey. There were three recliners in the living room which made it even more comfortable. And she left so many things in the kitchen to use!‚Äîshe said help yourself ‚Äì although I hesitated to, I did use some of the spices. She has a Keurig coffee machine and said to use the coffee pods, but I didn‚Äôt like to use up her ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù coffee, so I just set up our own regular coffee pot that we had in our van, as we use a lot of coffee. Checking in was easy, she stopped by one day to check on the air conditioner (and actually knew our friend so that was great!), the back porch (pictured) was so nice to sit on, the internet was fast and the cable TV was great and we slept well. There is a carport and also lots of parking along the street. It was easy to stay here and I recommend it for anyone who likes comfort!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute cottage style home. Very clean and homey. Plenty of amenities. Not in Lubbock, it's in Plainview."

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first time staying in a house in Plainview, as opposed to a hotel. It was so nice to have a little extra space and have a kitchen."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a cozy 2 bedroom / 1 bathroom house on a busy street. It was easy to communicate with Shelby. Check-in and -out was seemless. This was a better option for our family than staying in a hotel.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would recommend anyone to stay here.
2017-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay here during our recent visit to Lubbock.
Home was comfortable and met all our needs. Unable to enjoy the backyard, which was beautiful, due to rain. The kids did enjoy the brick path and were calling it the ""yellow brick road.""
Shelby was easy to communicate with prior and during our stay.
We would definitely recommend this home if we ever need to travel this way again.
Great little house~great home"

2017-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Shelby's place. I think it could have been a little more renter-ready, there was a lot of dust and lots of light bulbs out. The bed was also uncomfortably soft and hard on the back. But Shelby was very helpful and accommodating and I'd take her house over a hotel room any day."

2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private house in a residential neighborhood located about an hour from Palo Duro Canyon. Grocery stores and restaurants located within a couple of miles. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was fully equipped, the bathroom was a bit small and didn't have a lock, but was fine. The backyard was great - nice and spacious, fully fenced in, with a nice back porch for drinking your morning coffee. Shelby was a very responsive and helpful host. Great experience overall!"

,,,Beds are way smaller than what they look in pictures. Very dirty kitchen. We ran out of toilet paper.
