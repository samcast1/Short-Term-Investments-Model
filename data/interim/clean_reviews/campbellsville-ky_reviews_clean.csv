2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Graceland airbnb is an excellent choice! The place is very modern looking and is in a great location. You are sure to fall in love with it the second you walk in. Amenities provided are excellent. It's close to the lake as well as eating areas, and close to the main street. Sharon and Jason were great at communicating and accomodating our stay with an earlier check in time and grace time to check out. If we decide to visit again, this will most certainly be a top choice. You will not be dissapointed."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Graceland was amazing. I came to visit my daughter, along with her godmother, and this apartment was spectacular. I think the person that enjoyed it the most was my 3 year old daughter. Graceland is cozy, complete with washer and dryer + the king sized bed felt like sleeping on clouds.
I love the location because it’s close to Downtown Campbellsville. It was very convenient for the trip. Having a little back porch was great for sunrises and watching my child play with rocks.
Would definitely return to this location for my next trip."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Graceland is a perfect place to stay when visiting Campbellsville and/or surrounding areas. The apartment is newly renovated with lovely decor and all kinds of thoughtful touches. It’s very clean and all the appliances are new, so it really feels like being at home. There are other apartments in the same block and 3 more blocks nearby so if you wish to be somewhere really secluded then this is not the place for you, but the neighbours didn’t bother us at all (no noise or anything). We loved seeing the deer out back in the mornings & evenings! We can wholeheartedly recommend staying here, and will definitely stay here again next time we’re in Campbellsville :-)"

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"S&J’s house was as previously reviewed and described. Clean, stylish and comfortable. The Green River Lake is 5-7 minutes away and Campbellsville is 5 min in other direction. Plenty of choices to eat out and 2 Krogers only a couple miles apart. Not sure why."

We walked in and were legitimately wowed. I’d say give this more than just a fair look in your lodging search. Choose this."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a great experience! This was such a cozy space and we just really enjoyed our stay.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is absolutely stunning! All high-end finishes and completely spotless! Check in was a breeze. A simple text and a code gets you into the house. Once you’re in you have a fully furnished condo with a washer and dryer WITH laundry detergent, a full kitchen (including ALL cooking utensils) WITH a Keurig for morning coffee along WITH a variety of coffee to choose from, bottle water in the fridge, not to mention a variety of snacks! The TV’s, cable, Netflix, WiFi, etc., is all spot on! There is a nice big TV in the living room and a nice cozy spot to watch tv in the bedroom as well. Cable, Netflix, and WiFi is all provided. If you forget your toothpaste, deodorant, soap, etc., don’t worry, they got that covered too!!!! These guys do an excellent job at what they do and their condo is 100% gorgeous and most importantly to me, it was clean!!!!! I can’t say it enough. It was spotless clean! I’m on the road about three quarters of the year due to work and the night I stayed here was the closest I’ve felt to being in my own home in years! Lastly, I’ll mention that I am an OCD clean freak. This place was perfect! Thank you Sharon and Jason!
P.s. I forgot to mention, but the king size bed is really comfy as well!!! Job well done!"

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Cabin for our trip. We had 3 couples and we felt very comfortable. Within a Hour to most of the distilleries on the bourbon trail. We also went to Keeneland HorseTrack, about 1.5 hours away. Nice hot tub and gas grill on the back decks.
Would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we had a great stay in the cabin for our softball tournament would stay again for sure.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful cabin, quiet, loved sitting in the hottub! We were in town visiting for a wedding so it was nice to have all the cabins close together. Went into town one of the days, not much nightlife there so be prepared for that. I would say bring board games, books, and other things to occupy your time if you’re going to be there more than two days. Wish this cabin had a fire pit like the other one… would have been nice to sit by the fire in the evening."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time in your beautiful rental. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful place to stay. The cabin was new and furnishings were new. Everything was very clean and it was well stocked. The beds were super comfy.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very nice, beautiful location and a very nice, open floor plan. The furniture was really cool in the lounging areas and the house was clean. My only disappointment and I knew this going in, so I really shouldn’t hold it against the house … the bed sizes. With such a beautiful home and so much going for it, having king beds would push this house over the top. The queens are okay, but I would not go back based on my addiction to having a roomy sleeping area. I’m not a supersized person, but do like to sprawl out and sleep better with some room. King beds and I go back and rate 10 stars!"

My family and I had a great time looking for a place to rest and this cabin met our expectations a quiet place the cabin with everything needed very clean decorated overall everything perfect . Thank you Elam, excellent host 🙏"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was as expected and was clean when we arrived. The only issues was that we had no cell service and the wifi was extremely slow, but other than that we had a great stay!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was peaceful and enjoyable. The house was clean and the kitchen had a handful of items we were able to use. I wish the poor WiFi connection was mentioned before we booked or got to the house since we had issues using it at night when we were relaxing at the house. Overall, Elam was easy to work with and the cabin worked out for our stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay! It was the perfect spot for a quiet and low key bachelorette party. It was also super close to downtown restaurants. The hot tub was a huge perk and we loved it! The cabin itself was clean and comfortable. Plenty of space for the 7 of us. Elam was also very understanding and accommodating and responded very quickly which was greatly appreciated. It was a super cute cabin and someplace that is definitely worth another trip when it is warmer so the area around the cabin can be enjoyed as well!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin in the woods near Green River. No rear neighbors! No traffic! A serene & beautiful getaway for anyone looking to take a break!

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very beautiful house. So so peaceful & relaxing! Thank you for allowing use to use your home.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We celebrated new years at cabin #5 and it was incredible! Even though it is in a row of cabins it still felt private and secluded on the back decks/ in the hot tub. We had a great time!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was absolutely beautiful and like new— 10/10. It’s even prettier than in the pictures. We loved the cozy fireplace and stunning firebox. All smart TVs in every room were a hit with the kids! The WiFi reception was great in our experience. It’s very nice how every sleeping space is gorgeous— in other cabins there’s only one nice bedroom and the others are spartan. Not the case here. We had a very pleasant and easy experience renting this cabin from start to finish ❤️
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Elam was amazing! We had two things happen and both were fixed within 15 minutes. Quick and friendly responses with easy solutions!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful cabin, all about family."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My booking was very last minute maybe 2 hours prior to check-in. I was using the space for a dinner for my father’s birthday then we all stayed the evening. We cooked in the kitchen and served 8 guest, made breakfast the following day and never wanted/needed something that wasn’t there. Everything went like a story book. The cabin in the woods was very clean, and was perfect for my family! Elam was extremely responsive and really made it an easy experience. I WILL RENT AGAIN. It was a few dollars more than my budget but once I arrived and seen the cabin I knew it was money well spent! 🤌🏼"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cabin! We have already booked it again for during the holidays! A couple of things I would have liked to know before I came
1. It's not as private as we thought. It is one of 4 cabins on the same stretch. You can see other people's cars and lights from their cabins when you go out. (Not a big deal, but I thought it was alone in the woods.)
2. The kitchen is Completely stocked! I had all the cookware I needed for all the baking I did, and I did alot! Also it had grill tools, and coffee, and paper towels, trash bags, laundry detergent, and really everything we needed to have a great stay!
3. The sewer did seem to have an issue everyday we were there, in that when we walked outside, there was a very strong sewer smell. This was not pleasant. Also the front door had the handle coming loose, and when we checked it, it was missing a screw. This was a safety concern for us, but I'm sure they'll fix it.
All in all, we were very happy with our stay!!!"

We loved the spacious back deck with wooded views and a distant peak of the water."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cabin with plenty of space for a big family (we were 6 adults plus 1 toddler). We especially loved how comfy the beds were and the fact that every bedroom had a separate bathroom!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Place was fantastic. Just as described. However, if you are going to fish and have a boat behind your vehicle, this location is hard to get in and out of. The turn around in front of the house is too narrow to turn around with trailer and the easiest way is to back down the long drive from the main road."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place is secluded and very quiet. Looks and smell new. Climate control worked great . It was very clean. Would have like to have more hooks or selves in the bedrooms or bathroom to hang or just put our language on and not on the floor. Since we only stayed one night and had to leave we never got the chance to explore the surrounding nature has to offer on a long walk. Plenty of space to move around. We would love to come back for a longer stay and would recommend it to friends and family. Thanks for your hospitality.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gina's house is really beautiful. The Airbnb photos do not highlight the beauty of the house. We loved it!!! There was so much peace around that it made you want to stay longer. In addition, she welcomed us with several additional things that always help when we arrive, the very large rooms, the huge and comfortable beds and everything very clean. Thank you very much, the place is simply beautiful, very cozy, congratulations for having a place like this!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gina’s place was great. We were visiting Campbellsville to watch a sibling play college baseball and having a house that was not even 10 minutes away from the college was super helpful considering we have two children with us. The town where everything is located like grocery stores and restaurants weren’t too far either. It was a quiet little neighborhood. I am hoping that Gina’s place is available when we come back for graduation.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious home, fully equipped in a very nice, peaceful neighborhood. Close enough to stores and restaurants to travel and get what you need. Met our needs for a weekend wedding trip with our Kentucky family."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great the hot tub was great but I feel like there was so much suds on it and dirt was going on the sides I feel like it needed to be drained and refilled Jets run cleaned reset It was almost like soap powder was in it that someone wore a bathing suit in that had too much detergent in it
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnbs we’ve stayed in! The lake is beautiful and only 5 minutes away. Hiking trails within the park.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location with great arrangements for two couples. Very new, clean, and cute. We saw deer and wild turkeys in yard, cooked on grill both nights, and enjoyed the large hot tub. Spent a day at Mammoth Cave, and time at Limestone Branch. Both are reasonable drives. Bring something warm for your feet as the floor is cold but clean. A couple of pods are provided for dishwasher, but none for washing machine so bring your own if you think you might use it. The kitchen and cook- and bakeware were in great shape and useful variety. We hope to return and definitely recommend this home."

The space was perfect for our stay and had everything we needed to make meals there and was a home away from home! The beds were comfy, I enjoyed the sunrise with a cup of coffee and relaxing in the hot tub every morning.
Jt was always keeping us in the loop when needed and was always quick to get back with us.
We explored several areas in KY and the house was about an hour from Mammoth caves, Etown, and Bardstown. We went to red river gorge as well and that was about a 2 hour drive from the house too.
I cannot recommend this place enough and we will definitely be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely amazing! The owners are very responsive and the space is just delightful. Plenty of room for everyone and very clean and up to date. Top quality. Definitely put this on your list of places to go. Hope to visit again soon.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is beautiful. It was absolutely spotless which is definitely something everyone wants when going away from home. I can only explain this house, by saying this is your home away from home but better! The views are amazing. Its super quiet and private.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was so quaint and charming. It felt like we were in the pages of a magazine with how chic and nice everything looked inside. The house was well stocked with plenty of pots, pans, dishes, towels, toilet paper. The bed linens and throw blankets were cozy. The atmosphere was peaceful. We lacked nothing all weekend. In the beginning, we had an issue with the hot tub and JT and Felecia were so quick to respond. She had it back up and working just beautifully in under 15 minutes. We really enjoyed sitting in the hot tub and watching the horse and pony prancing in the nearby field."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little house. Our family of 5 loved being able to cook in and play intense rounds of Monopoly. We also did a lot of hiking and exploring in the area. Visited Lincoln’s birthplace and Mammoth Caves NP.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was really great. Very clean and new on the inside. Beds were comfortable and the house is well stocked with almost everything you could need.

We stayed here and made the hour drive to Mammoth Cave one day.
Make sure to check out Brothers restaurant in town!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning is no exaggeration. The area is quiet, peaceful and great for a getaway. Ours was only for a couple of days but we wanted to stay longer. The scenery, breeze & hot tub offer a perfect spot to unplug and unwind."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I cannot say enough positive about this experience. The house was absolutely amazing and so beautifully decorated. Location was perfect and peaceful.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was warm, cozy and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed our stay and the hot tub was wonderful.

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were so pleased with our stay! The photos are extremely accurate and the location is beautiful. You wake up to the gorgeous hilly views of Kentucky as well as some friendly cows and horses. We have family that live locally in Campbellsville and Greensburg, and it was great to have our own space while visiting. All the appliances are new and there are more than enough kitchen supplies for cooking. The wifi worked great and the convenience of being able to log into our Disney+, Netflix, etc on the TVs was a huge plus with our kids. JT was wonderful with communication and we were able to come a day earlier than we planned with no issues. We highly recommend JT as a host while staying in Kentucky."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay for the weekend! The home was just beautiful. The hot tub was very relaxing, and the view of the stars was perfect! 😍 We will definitely be coming back again. Thanks JT and Felecia for creating a beautiful space!"

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we got there, my family and I felt like we had stepped into an HGTV home!
Directions and Check-in with the lockbox were super easy!
The place was extremely clean and stocked with everything we needed for the two days.
I cooked four meals while there, and they had everything we needed to make it a success. The electric pellet grill was super easy to use for lunch and dinner.
The wifi worked perfectly with the home's 3 TVs, our three cell phones, and my husband's computer.
My daughter appreciated the bowl of snacks--she loved the cheez-its and cookies!
The animals in the back barn were too cute and a bonus to watch!
The hot tub was perfectly relaxing!
The location was perfect if you are trying to go to Green River Lake! We were minutes away from exploring nature, and the Civil War driving tour. Downtown has some super cute shops my daughter and I enjoyed. Plus, the architecture was beautiful to observe.
We did have one issue, but it was handled quickly. It gave us a chance to meet and talk with JT! Super nice guy! He even told us about the new house he was building next door, which was even bigger--another beautiful property that I cannot wait to check out if we travel with more people!
Overall, JT and his wife created a beautiful home with an awesome design of each room which had everything my family of three needed for a relaxing mini-getaway! Space to spread out, great blankets and pillows to get super cozy, a great kitchen for cooking, a wonderful hot tub, and a great location.
Cannot wait to come back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our weekend stay. The house felt brand new and was exceptionally clean. The Wi-Fi was strong and the hot tub was spacious. While the place is not totally remote (as another reviewer mentioned, it is near the road and two homes are within view) it still felt very private and provided the country getaway we were hoping for."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay!! Possibly the best AirBNB we have ever stayed at!! Every little detail thought about and well done! Quiet comfortable place to stay!!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with a great floor plan for families or couples. We had a very comfortable stay! Only thing I would say is the house is right on the road and beside another house and in front of a working barn. It wasn’t quite as private as we thought but still a lovely setting. Super close to the lake!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible place!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolutely beautiful home in a quiet setting. From the initial reservation throughout the day we left, the communication with JT was great. The check-in/check-out process was quick and easy. To say the farmhouse was immaculate is an understatement. They have thought of everything...great linens, comfortable bedding, well stocked kitchen (down to the snacks)...to make you feel right at home. While this trip was only my husband and I, this would be perfect place for a small family or two couples to enjoy the weekend. My only regret is that I can't rate it higher than five stars! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be able to visit this sweet place again in the future.
JT: Thank you again for your hospitality and for sharing your beautiful farmhouse with us."

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our time at the barn house. Lots of interesting things inside. The tub was nice.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I were there for 2 weeks and LOVED IT!! We had problems finding the place but we reached out to Cherie and she talked us in. The barnhouse was just what we were looking for! It's rustic, private and the indoor decor is fabulous. We loved sitting on the back porch at night and listening to the symphony of bullfrogs and other critters. The porches are covered so even though it rained we were still able to be outside. The bed was very comfortable and the furniture just begs to be relaxed on. They have taken a lot of time to provide for a stay of any length and were a phone call away if there was something that we couldn't find or needed. I would definitely recommend a stay at the Barnhouse! Cherie and Tim are wonderful, caring and attentive hosts to commended on all that they do for their guests!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was absolutely perfect! So many amenities and so very peaceful! Perfect for an R and R trip!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came here for our honeymoon and we found exactly what we were looking for. A whole week of peace and quiet with space to lounge around and sun to soak up.

Thank you so much for hosting us.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing place. Great host. loved how quiet and cozy and relaxing this place was. awesome amenities including shower and bath. best sleep I've had in a long time. my wife and I spent our 1 year anniversary here and couldn't have been happier.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfectly located between all the sight-seeing we did for the couple days we were there. The location was very quiet, peaceful and just far enough off the beaten path to make for the ideal spot to relax. All the amenities (walk in rain shower, huge tub with heat lamp, etc.) were awesome and made it difficult to venture out during the day. As for all the detailed intricacies throughout the inside of this cabin it was amazingly spotless inside. This location is an absolute must stay if we plan another trip to this bourbon trail area in the future."

We will definitely go back when the weather is a little warmer
Thank you"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had a great time at the Bourbon Barnhouse. This is truly a unique place and its evident a lot of work went into creating it. I was very impressed with their attention to detail and exclaimed, ""they thought of everything"" multiple times during our stay. It's a great place to relax and unplug for a bit and we hope to return again soon."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent vacation!!! Love the architecture, very rustic yet very modern! Very quiet and peaceful. we did not leave the driveway for 4 days! Has everything you need plus ! You must spend time on the hammock and the luxurios tub. Cannot wait to go back!!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful and peaceful time.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I would definitely come
back again. We would probably come
back in late summer or early fall next time. This cabin is close to the Green River Reservoir and all of the activities that come with it. Our stay was during the winter and much of the outdoor stuff was closed for the season. Overall, its proximity to several small towns and the bourbon trail made its location optimal for us."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing and caring hosts, made sure there were very clear check-in instructions. They were proactive and made sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. it had a lot of nice touches. it has a cool but cozy vibe with added benefits like like end tub. It was really peaceful, and upstairs hammock was quite enjoyable. it's a great place, great host, great style, and comfortable. what more can you ask for?"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our third time back to thisAirBNB and let me tell you we love it!!! we have never gone back to the same AirBNB we always pick something different. The stay was amazing as always. We stayed in and enjoyed the peace and quite from the busy city we live in. Absolutelylove the soaker tub and the shower. Cheri and Tim have thought of everything you may need on your stay. Grocery store is about 20 minutes away.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely beautiful. Our first night we got in late, and it was freezing, but the following 2 nights we used the wood stove and it was heaven! Very clean, rustic, quiet, and away from civilization! We enjoyed our little getaway!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so unique, cozy and peaceful. My husband and I have made a tradition of getting away the long weekend after Thanksgiving to recoup and relax. The Barn house did not disappoint! The kitchen and bathrooms were clean and well stocked. The bed very comfortable and cozy. Cherie is very detailed on the decor and the place so welcoming and beautiful. We enjoyed it so much we're already planning on booking it for our anniversary!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite and most unique stay we've had to date. This place is hand-built and GORGEOUS. They've got it all, plus some... just bring yourself and some food. The toughest decisions you'll be making is whether to use the huge tub or the huge shower. You won't want to leave!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love Tim and Cherie’s place! It is so peaceful and quiet. A wonderful place to unwind. They were very communicative and great hosts!

Jim & Sue"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a beautiful place, and it has sooooo much character. The cedar smell is AMAZING! There is no need to drive to TN to see the colors fall has to offer this time of the year. We just set on the porch with our coffee and rocked our time away, ""it's where we willingly wasted our time.""
Thank you for offering your little nest for a couple of birds like us."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing. Very cozy, private, and tucked away. Loved sitting outside and watching the deer with our morning coffee. The hosts were great, will definitely return!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend getaway for my 4 year anniversary. It was clean, easy to access, great instructions/information from the host. Easy to contact them if needed. Great place with great price."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found the place to be a great getaway for our honeymoon. We were able to reconnect as a couple and get the downtime we needed from our busy lives. The bed and pillows were super comfortable and made sleeping there easy. The stairs were a bit steeper than we thought, but we were still able to get up them. We would also recommend wearing shower shoes in the downstairs shower, which can be rough on some people's feet, but the shower felt great."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this place the space is beautiful and peaceful it does not disappoint.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This very unique barnhouse was a great place to stay for our annual trip to Campbellsville, KY! The house was spacious and clean and the hosts thought of every detail in providing a peaceful and relaxing getaway for their guests. Cherie was kind and responsive and went out of her way to recommend local places to eat. We will definitely return."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! Better than the pictures, very peaceful! Everyday there was wildlife walking about the property, a doe and her dawn stayed close by for a very long period of time, making it clear they felt safe, so fun to watch them and decompress!!
The bed was super comfortable, the bath was very relaxing and I loved that they included candles and bubble bath! They created the perfect stage for a peaceful and romantic getaway!
We felt the price was great for what they offered. When they say it’s only for A couple (two people) they were legit because it’s open concept to the max, which we loved!
Definitely follow their directions, someone mentioned that g-maps leads you astray and we confirmed that Apple Maps does as well. The phone maps will want you to turn sooner but be patient the road to turn on (492? I think) isn’t much farther up the road!
The hosts were super kind and responsive, once again, we couldn’t have asked for a better experience!! Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great relaxing time, would definitely stay here again. Tim and Cherie was super helpful in helping us find the location. Everything as described was as is."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little spot is really nice if you like nature. The barn was amazing. All the hard work this family put in this was stunning. The bathrooms are fantastic. One side note of you have sensitive feet wear swim shoes in shower. It’s a beautiful rock floor. The tub upstairs so relaxing. The bed absolutely the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The quilts you snuggle with and the big comfy pillows. Took two naps while I was there. The huge bean bag is so comfortable to read in. Definitely worth every penny!! Cherie you were great Thank you!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we came to this area to ride backroads on our motorcycle! And we did! The barn house is really awesome, she decorates really cool, they supply everything even coffee! we sat outside every morning and nite listening to nature.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The barnhouse was the perfect home away from home during our trip to Kentucky. Its absolutely stunning inside- and the outside was so peaceful and relaxing listening to the wildlife.
Tim and Cherie went out of their way when a storm left us without internet, and my teenager thought the world was coming to an end! it was very thoughtful and beyond expectation ❤️ if I wasn't so far away I wouldn't hesitate staying here again!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim and Cherie’s place was just like the pictures. My husband really appreciated the homage to bourbon as that was the reason for our visit to Kentucky. The property was quiet and we enjoyed watching the wildlife from the porch in the evenings when we returned from each day of distillery tours and tastings.
They were very responsive when we had a couple of questions pop up so it was very easy, communication wise.
Thank you both for being such gracious hosts!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Truly enjoyed my 8 night stay at the Bourbon Barnhouse! Many amenities in the cabin including in the kitchen and bathrooms. Couldn't have asked for anything more!! Comfortable to say the least. Tim and Cherie have thought of everything when they designed and decorated the cabin. A wonderful natural surrounding with a few small animals in the outside environment. Will definitely be staying here again when I return to this area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for country side for a getaway

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far the most relaxed my husband and I have felt in AWHILE. The woodwork is stunning, the bathtub and shower are awesome, and the bed was SO comfortable. Photos do not do this place justice. It is truly serene and unique. We highly recommend Ponchos Mexican Restaurant and seeing anything and everything Abraham Lincoln related, you're so close!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay and doing the bourbon trail.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"ROMANTIC, RESTFUL GETAWAY!
We truly appreciated the thoughtfulness Tim&Cherie put into this property. It is obvious they thought through everything involved here! The location is just what we hoped for — on backroads and secluded. We had plenty of room outside; on the 3 covered areas; and plenty of restful spots within the cabin.
The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals and snacks! Stocked with coffee as well. It’s rare to find an Airbnb with such well-stocked cooking supplies, utensils etc.
BEAUTIFUL woodworking, tiling, shower, tub etc. pictures do not serve it justice.
We also loved the touch of a Bluetooth speaker so we could subtly play music throughout our time.
Tim&Cheri, we’re very responsive hosts. Proactive as well. I felt so comfortable and welcomed by them.
This truly is a hidden gem!!
We loved it so much.. we already booked in Sept!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exactly what I was looking for! Nice and quiet. It’s a very unique place and I enjoyed every bit of it! The hosts were amazing and checked up on us to see if we needed anything. I would recommend this place 100%.
Considering booking it again in the future"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very unique stay, loved seeing the pictures of how it was built and walking around to admire the handiwork."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a unique place to stay that has everything you need, you found it! This cabin has so many special touches, from the well-appointed kitchen, a wonderful soaking tub, wood burning stove, and hand crafted furniture.
We had some difficulty finding it at first, but Cherie was great, and even drove out to meet us by the main road so we could follow her back to the cabin. Our hosts went above and beyond to make sure that we had a comfortable stay. They even went out and purchased a toaster oven when the oven quit working.
The only thing I would want people to know is that the stairs are very steep in case mobility is an issue.
We will definitely be returning!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly as described. A remote romantic getaway. We kept just staring at the trusses and wonder at how he built that structure. Lots of cute and thoughtful detail/decorations.
The windstorm blew out power but with some candles and the indoor fireplace heater, we enjoyed the evening regardless and it made it more fun. It was no fault of the Airbnb. Power was out in several states.
Because we didn’t have power at first, we didn’t see/read the notebook so make sure to do that, useful info on all the crazy electrical switches."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! It was very peaceful and quiet. Great location within 20 minutes of several towns. I loved all the small touches throughout, it really elevated the experience."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying in this little barn house! You could see the hard work and dedication that they put into making this an amazing place just when you walk in. The layout was awesome and the bath tub was a-maz-ing!! Husband really liked the bean bag chair. We definitely recommend this as place and would love to come back :)
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing, unique place to stay in a very peaceful environment! Loved our stay here and gave us inspiration for what we want our home to feel like in the future!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great getaway for our honeymoon! Especially after the chaotic holidays nice to reset and just relax. Will definitely be booking again in the future.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed a peaceful getaway here! We did choose to drive to some distilleries that were about 45-50 minutes away but the drive to them was pleasant and scenic. Just what we wanted for our weekend.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. You can really tell that they put a lot of thought this place they built. The kitchen had everything you needed to cook. The bathrooms were amazing. The space was comfy and cozy. Cherie was quick to respond to anything we needed. We will be coming back again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tim & Cherie’s place was exactly what we wanted and surpassed all expectations. We stayed during the winter snow storm over Christmas weekend and we were cozy and warm inside. Every detail was thought of and they were extremely attentive and thoughtful, even bringing over an extra wine-bottle opener after dark when we couldn’t find the one in their kitchen. It was beautiful to go out and walk around the property which we did in -9 degree weather on Christmas Day. Couldn’t have asked for better hosts or a better place to spend Christmas! 10/10 recommend to a friend! Thank you Altmans!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Extremely clean, beautifully decorated, all the amenities you could need. We had an amazing time here. It was cozy, romantic, secluded, peaceful and overall just fantastic! We will definitely be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Please keep in mind that you will have zero (o) reception getting to the cabin so you can have all your directions pre-loaded on your smartphone or have a map handy. Once you get into the cabin, the WiFi password is actually the manufacturer's password that is etched into the side of the router. The instructions say something like underneath the black-tiered box, which was not 100% accurate. Other than that, be prepared for stillness and quiet. Very peaceful dwelling decorated with hunting gear and bourbon decor. As a bourbon enthusiast, I was right at home."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great getaway! Quiet and peaceful.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we enjoyed our stay. It was quiet and cozy.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I could not say how much I loved our stay in the Barnhouse. The barn was exactly as described and pictured. The amenities were more than I could asked for. I loved discovering all the cool features of the Barnhouse such as the bluetooth sound bar. My favorite part of the Barn would be the Americana decoration found throughout. We definitely are planning a return.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A stay at Tim and Cherie's place is a one of a kind experience. I loved all the small details that went into building and decorating this place. Definitely a work of love! Thank you for sharing with others.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent time here. Very relaxing and fun. We went hiking, cave exploring, corn hole, made a fire, and more for our anniversary trip. The owners were extremely friends and responded to us fast to make this happen. You can tell how much love and passion they put i to this cabin. We will be back as much as we can! Thank you guys!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our anniversary escape to the Bourbon Barn. The bed was super comfy, the ginormous bean bag was the perfect nap space, and the kitchen had everything we needed aside from the groceries ;)
Sparkling clean!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet, fun, quirky & unique is how I would describe the Bourbon Barn. Our stay there was the best!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The barn house is truly unique and we were in awe of the craftsmanship and overall design inside. The owners provide just about anything you may need. The location is pretty remote and you will lose cell service. Make sure to have all the information you need on hand (accessible without cell or internet service). Nice place to get away to, just make sure you come prepared."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful stay. Only 30 minutes from the Makers Mark distillery, and makes for a perfect overnight stay with an incredible view and beautiful furnishings. I highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is beyond beautiful! A definite recommended couple's getaway. We will be staying again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here while visiting some of the bourbon distilleries for 3 days. They were about 35 mins from here but would not have changed a thing. This place had so much charm. It was very comfortable and had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable. Checking in was a breeze. Sitting outside we saw a family of deer. I would recommend staying here to everyone. There is nothing around for miles and miles for stores or restaurants so plan well.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim and Cherie's place is perfect for a quiet getaway. Their place is quiet and very clean. Great accommodations. Linens and bedding were very nice. Corn hole boards are a nice touch. We used them nightly. They had everything we needed.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all… this place is HUGE. I was here on a business trip and it’s about 35 mins away from the makers mark campus and the roads are not busy nearby so it is very peaceful. I loved all of the details built into this property. The instruction manual made all my questions immediately answered. I would have used the kitchen if my stay was longer for sure because there’s not a ton of restaurants nearby, they do list what is though. Love how different both bathrooms are, I can see a couple staying here for sure or a small family. If you see this available, BOOK IT!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! The barn house is so peaceful! Cell service is very spotty in the area so plan for that when you come. The home does have wifi but you quickly lose service the moment you go towards the end of the driveway. We jotted down directions when we were home so we made sure we weren’t driving lost. The stairs inside are steep! If you have trouble stepping up a good height, you will want to set up a bed on the lower level. Bring all the passwords to your different platforms for the tv. There is not Netflix or any service logged in for you. If you want to watch a show. The barn house is super cute and the shower is huge!!! Check in was very easy and with some navigation, food options aren’t too far away. The quiet was very welcomed from our normal noisy city life. As you get closer to the house the road changes to look like it is a one way. Don’t be fooled. They just didn’t put the line down the middle of the lane and it is very much a 2 way street. The hosts are very nice and the manual inside was very informative! The bed was also comfortable as well. Bring an eye mask if you want it super dark to sleep. There is a dim light left on al the time upstairs so you don’t fall down the stairs in an emergency. We will be back!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim and Cherie's cabin was the perfect getaway for our anniversary! Everything about this cabin was unique and one of a kind. There were plenty of towels and cookware. The shower and tub were phenomenal! I highly recommend a stay here!!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed the serenity at the Peaceful Getaway for our anniversary weekend. The interior is truly a masterpiece - one of a kind. The walk in shower was amazing, as well as the bathroom upstairs with the soaking tub. It has everything you need to feel at home. We mostly had music playing on the bluetooth speaker the whole time just to disconnect from the norm. We hope to come back again! Thank you, Tim and Cherie, for sharing this wonderful place with others! May the Lord richly bless you!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the nicest and cleanest places we have stayed in. Had absolutely everything we needed. Was a little off of the beaten path. But we absolutely loved our stay! Would definitely come back!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing, only stayed 2 days but didn’t want to leave.
So peaceful but close to a town for provisions. We loved sitting out on the porch listening to the wildlife and sitting at the bar with a bourbon.
It had everything you needed to cook a meal and lots of little extras to make our stay really special.
Huge comfortable bed, amazing bathrooms.. You could feel the love that went into building this place 10/10"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can not say enough about this awesome ""barn"". My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and every day/evening we would find something different we loved about it. The decor and use of materials in this place are absolutely brilliant. Whether by design or not. The lower level shower is to die for. Pictures do not do it justice at all. I could go on and on about the how completely unique this ""barn"" is. Communication with Tim & Cherie was spot on. Very fast response time. Will definitely be back to stay again. Looking forward to see the progress on the outside.
Do yourself a favor, reserve and enjoy this ""barn"".
Thank you Tim & Cherie for an amazing getaway from the day to day routine!!qv"

If you love the great outdoors this place is for you."

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was excellent
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,We needed someplace very last minute and Amanda was super responsive and accommodating. Her house was very clean and the beds were so comfortable! We were spending the holiday weekend as a family and the space made us feel like we were at home. Super easy instructions also! We will definitely stay with her again for another trip and hopefully for a longer stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a place to stay to spend time with family. Great kitchen, living room comfortable, no clutter, easy to understand instructions.
We’ll be back."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This will always be a return stay for us while visiting family! The home is comfortable and clean. Short distance to stores and other amenities. The neighborhood is peaceful and safe. The beds are comfortable. The shower has good pressure and is hot. We always cook meals in the home and the back patio is a nice touch.
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice quite neighborhood. The kitchen is beautiful except for the vent cover on the floor that falls into the hole if you step on it wrong. There are really no decorations to speak of; everything is very plain. Great for Minimalist. Hardwood floors. The art work is located in closets and not hung, these would help absorb the house noise. There are no rugs to absorb sounds in the house and so the house is very noisy. Door knob to one room doesn't work at keeping the doors shut, one door is very difficult to close. There is sparse cooking utensils (3 wooden spoons) bring a spatula, can opener and cork screw if you think you will need one. Bring nightlights if you get up at night. The grill is a VERY nice touch.
The house is easy to find with a nice drive. Most people would not be able to walk to the downtown shopping and restaurants from this house."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Will return

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For the money, this was the perfect place for my group. We were in town for a class reunion. The location was perfect! Very close to downtown where we went to eat and went to the Bourbon Boutique Bar. It’s also conveniently located to Swan’s Landing where the reunion took place. The back patio was great and there’s more than enough room inside to hang out. Thanks so much, Amanda, for the great hospitality!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing stay with wonderful host! Will stay again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We LOVED this place. Being originally from the area, our family has out grown staying with local family so this was a perfect size and location for us all from out of town. It seems like a recent remodel with new appliances and furniture , and maybe a few things are still in the works, but it was VERY clean and had everything we needed. The host messaged the day of arrival and said they were bringing by a grill and they did. A brand new gas grill. The pool table was great, too. Beds and pillows were comfortable and plenty of linens. The absolute only downside was with hardwood/vinyl flooring and with no throw rugs or area rugs every door open or close and step seemed to echo. And no kitchen or bath rugs. But compared to all the upsides, it wasn’t even that big of deal. Cleaning supplies were readily available for any spot cleaning we needed to do from our group. The huge back yard had several rabbits jumping through several times daily that were fun to watch. Really was a great place. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quiet neighborhood. House is very clean and minimal. Very calming. There wasn’t a grill when we stayed so don’t come prepared with ribeye steaks or anything you don’t want to cook in the stove. Stop by the peddlers mall if you’re looking to kill time in an afternoon!

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The house was very clean as it is a new location. The house was very comfortable. Amanda was very kind and helpful every turn. New marble countertops and a strong shower. If you can't make a big step, it may not be for you. However, the entry was secure and the cameras gave a sense of security Friendly neighbors, too.
If you have a chance, this place is the one. I booked it for my next two trips."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was PERFECT! My friends and I were visiting in Campbellsville for a lake weekend and had 8 people staying at the house and felt we had more than enough room. We also appreciated utulizing the grill. It's so close to the lake and having a washer/ dryer in the house was perfect for cleaning up each night. Very spacious and comfortable for the 8 people who stayed there. We're already talking about renting it again in the future!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this gem in Campbellsville! Would have loved to stay longer, but it was already reserved. Ben was incredibly communicative and helpful. Will try to book this listing again for next year's Jets Over Kentucky!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I had such a wonderful stay with Ronnie and Della. When I say they had the place spotless when I arrived, I mean it. not only was everything fresh and clean, but they even left me snacks to enjoy during my stay.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Della is very friendly and allowed us access to her beautiful backyard.We noticed on the list of amenities that their was a grill present but when we got there one was not available. We did ask Della about it and she was so kind to explain it had not been used very often by her guest so she got rid of it. The apartment is very quiet and peaceful , although we were out most of the time for a local conference we attended it was a perfect place to crash. Della was also generous in giving us tasty tomatoes from her garden before we exited back home. Thank you Della for your kindness."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Della is the sweetest host ever. Friendly and responsive. Gives privacy but is immediately available for questions or problems. I’d stay again in a heartbeat!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment. The pictures are accurate. The space was super clean. Parking was convenient. You have to go up a flight of stairs to get to the room. The stairs were wide and stable. The host prefers you park right next to those stairs. There is a very faint cigarette smell, most pronounced near the entrance, for people who are sensitive to such things. The hosts are easy to talk to if you approach them but will leave you alone otherwise. The little porch outside the apartment at the top of the stairs was charming. All in all, I enjoyed my stay and I highly recommend this place."

The are really friendly,helpful, caring and amazing people. I still speak to them and miss them. If I ever visit Kentucky I will definitely stay at their home and nowhere else.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This attic apartment was perfect for our two night stay in Campbellsville. We were close to the lake where we keep our boat. We also discovered a beautiful, paved trail in town that runs along Pittman Creek. What a peaceful path to enjoy."

Definitely recommend."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was extremely clean and very tidy. Bed was super comfortable and the area is quiet. Would fully recommend to anyone!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ronnie and Della’s space accommodates two people, possibly three if you set up an air mattress. There is plenty of space for parking. You walk up wooden stairs to a small deck area with two chairs where you enter your apartment. The key pad was easy to use. There is an AC unit that works well if it is warm. My husband and I opened the window in the bathroom and slept with the ceiling fan on one night and were comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious. It was nice having a refrigerator and freezer as I had brought snacks with me and things to heat up for breakfast. The yard is beautiful, although we didn’t have time to enjoy it. Della said hello to us one evening after dinner and she was very kind and welcoming.
The apartment is very close to the square where there is a great coffee shop that serves light breakfast and a cute bookstore. I definitely recommend Brothers Restaurant for great BBQ.
The only thing I would say is the pillows weren’t super comfortable, so be mindful of that and bring your own. Also, if you are sensitive to noise at night use a sound machine as you will hear cars and trucks driving by. But I slept just fine."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I spent the weekend in Campbellsville and had a great time. There is a lot to explore including the US army corps of engineers nature museum at Green River Lake (great for kids) and nearer to downtown, the Trace Pittman Greenway walking trail both of which I highly recommend. The downtown area is really cute, be sure to visit Harden coffee and Sweetwater bookshop. The last Druthers in KY is also located downtown. Multiple people told us the best food in town is the BBQ place but we didn't have a chance to try it. The airbnb was great, very quiet and clean. The perfect place to crash after a day of exploring. The hosts are also extremely nice."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Quiet, comfortable, clean place! Della was the most wonderful host. So kind and easy communication. ❤️ Will definitely be staying again while I’m working down there."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Best AirBnb ever!! We have stayed at many AirBnb’s and this has been our favorite. Cute upper level suite with it’s own balcony. Large bathroom; large shower with a great shower head!! The most comfortable queen size bed!! Small dinette, perfect for two! Our Hosts went above and beyond to make us feel absolutely comfortable and at home. Gas grill available just outside. Full size refrigerator in the unit. Private parking spot. We were invited to enjoy their beautiful garden spaces, and even went for a tour with their Granddaughter via golf cart. Campbellsville is a beautiful area with everything a short walk or drive. Ask about our host’s favorite Mexican restaurant. It was fabulous!! Our Hosts, Ronnie & Della, made us feel like family! We had a major car repair during our trip, and they helped us to get to the repair shop and to the rental car business. We had an absolutely perfect time at this location. We cannot recommend this AirBnb highly enough!! Thank you, Della and Ronnie!!!"

Of all the Airbnb I have stayed in ......this was by far the best!!!...It goes at the top of the favorites list!!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"great communication, home was immaculate, extremely comfortable and well kept. Katie had left a few goodies on the kitchen counter that was a pleasant surprise.

Not only is the house and it's history beyond beautiful and fascinating but the surroundings are just breathtaking. While we planned for a short stay and minimal time spent in the home itself, we immediately fell in love with the home and surrounding property. We enjoyed much of our time outside on the provided furnishings as well as picnicking under the larger trees and watching the neighboring livestock. The home itself was beautiful and incredibly well-stocked, making us feel right at home. We cannot wait to return to this stay and are already planning a trip back to Camblesville in the near future!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an unfortunate accident on our way. Half of my family made it while the other half was at the hospital. I explained the situation just in case we could not make check list needs. When the rest of us got released from hospital we asked to have an extra night stay and she graciously agreed and discounted it some for us. Our stay went nothing how we planned nor imagined but the house was perfect and just as it was supposed to be.
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"Mikayla was very responsive and always helpful. The property is beautiful and offers a lot of space for large parties. The cons: steep stairs and stairs in unexpected places - making it a little dangerous for elderly and toddlers. The kitchen could use some more amenities, including coffee supplies and more plates, cups, etc. Lebanon Avenue is very noisy, especially at night, with the emergency vehicles driving down the road to the hospital."

We all enjoyed the upstairs living room and pool table. All in all it was a great place for the family to come together and visit, much better than staying at a hotel."
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our stay very much. We were in town for a nearby wedding and the location was great with plenty of room for all eight of us. We enjoyed the pool table, the kitchen island to gather around to eat, drink, & socialize, & we enjoyed seeing the lightening bugs on the front porch. An added bonus was meeting Lee & Anne, the next door neighbors, who were extremely pleasant and even checked on us to see if we needed anything from the grocery store. True Southern hospitality. Thanks again for sharing your place with us."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We came to Campbellsville to celebrate our son's wedding.

Staying here made this occasion even more special! Thank you, Mikayla!!"
2023-05-01,2.0,Group trip,Upstairs AC was not working when we arrived. Someone came the next morning to look at it but did nothing. They said another contractor would come but that never happened. No updates were given after that. We had to sleep with the windows open for the entire trip which in turn was hard to sleep due to the traffic on the road in front of the house. The downstairs air worked but the majority of the bedrooms were upstairs.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was clean, beds were comfortable, plenty of space for everyone. It was really nice having a 2 car garage. That was an added bonus we didn't expect. The keypad to lock and unlock the door was so convenient and it was nice to not have to keep up with a key. We really enjoyed our stay, wish it could have been longer.

The hosts provide a lot of coffee pods with the Keurig machine and snacks. We did not used the stove because meals were provided at the event we attended. Loved having a washer and dryer!

2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,What a great place to stay! We stayed for the Fourth of July and were able to see all of the fireworks over the tree tops from the driveway. My kids loved playing with the neighbor kids and burning off all of their energy in the small field next to the Airbnb. Beware of the drainage ditch!!! My son took a tumble into it in the dark and we got lucky it wasn’t worse than it was. The Airbnb was perfectly spacious for my 11 month old to crawl around in and having Netflix already on the tv made entertaining her while I needed to get ready a breeze. Mom hack: I could fit a standard sized pack and play in the half bath off the left bedroom! I popped her baby monitor on the sink next to her and was able to give her a quiet place to sleep at night without having to tiptoe around. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone needing a place to stay with small kids!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Absolutely amazing place, just right outside of town, and a really great place to just have some peace and quiet! Killer price, killer set up, highly recommend reserving this spot!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is very accurate according to the description. They were great hosts who communicated quickly and helped us get checked in even though it was quite late, which we really appreciated! Our gps took us down the street so we had a minor issue finding the correct location :) they helped us with that which was great. The space is nice and clean, but one thing to note if you have allergies or asthma, it did have a strong musty odor (perhaps the previous tenant was a smoker). We opened the windows and that helped a little but still has a very strong musty smell. Not the biggest issue but for sensitive people it may be problematic."
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Its clean and comfortable. Better mattresses than I expected. Amenities are good with cable and internet service and Keurig with gourmet coffee. Unit is simple but everything functioned well and was in a quiet setting. I would stay there again when on a fishing trip t to the area.

2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very diligent hosts and exceeded my expectations for my first time staying in an Airbnb
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed spending time with my daughter in their lovely abode. It was spacious enough for her to roam around, the beds were exquisite and made getting a good night’s rest even more enjoyable. The kitchen and living room being not too far from each other mean being able to see my daughter play while keeping an eye on the food. She really enjoyed the snacks the most. The house was very clean and they set very clear expectations for their guests. I will definitely be booking again for a return trip to Campbellsville."
,,,"The furniture in the house is low quality; my pregnant friend fell from the sofa as its leg broke while she was sitting on it. The host seemed not worried at all when I told her about the accident at home, and didn’t even apologise for this serious accident. This home is remodelled only to make money out of it. Nobody has lived in this house as their own home, and therefore, it lacks the basic necessary items in home. When I asked the host about sugar, butter/ oil, dish cleaning sponge, etc., she asked me to buy from convenience stores. The listing said that the place has firewood, but she didn’t provide any until asked. When I asked for the lighter, she again turned me to the convenience store. We had to make multiple visits to convenience stores with a 4 month old baby. She also said that I’m needy and pointing out these things to take money from her. Overall, the host doesn’t care about the guests."
