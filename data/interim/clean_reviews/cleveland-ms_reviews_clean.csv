2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"While this place was a great deal for the area, there are several things that could make this space much better. The place was what I like to call “surface clean”.. all the visible items were clean but all the rest not so much. Ceiling fans and baseboards needed dusting, the plates all needed to be rewashed, and the dog smell was the worst. If you have a pet allergy this is not the space for you. Additionally, the outside space while very nice lacked privacy. There was not much separation from the main house, this could cause some privacy issues but we experienced none."

This little place is the perfect size for one or two people, is clean and comfortable, and is located in a beautiful and safe neighborhood that is convenient to all that Cleveland has to offer. It is also pet friendly, which is a plus for us. As the neighborhood is excellent, if you are a walker, it is the perfect place to get in your steps (mornings here are quiet and gorgeous). If you want to see some of Cleveland’s sights, it’s a quick drive to the Grammy Museum, downtown, the college, and most any other great spot. The guesthouse has the feel of a little cottage and is well appointed. When we didn’t go out to one of Cleveland’s great restaurants, we could easily prepare meals here. The linens were soft and luxurious, and the bed was super comfy. If you want a comfortable, cozy, elegant, yet laid-back stay, this is the place.

I spent a good part of my day at a flea market called ""moonstruck""....there was so much to look at and i loved it all...The owner and his daughter were very friendly.
The space itself is perfect for a couple. We brought our dog along and she managed fine while we were out around town. We never saw the owners of the house, but we did meet their dogs. :)

All the furniture was unbelievably comfortable; I couldn't wait to go to bed just so I could snuggle up under the covers on the memory foam mattress! The closet was large enough for me to hang up my dresses. The kitchen was more than adequate for a short stay. Microwave, fridge, oven, and sink. Check-in was SO easy and I could come and go as I pleased very easily. Since it's a guest house I could also have things delivered. There is plenty of driveway parking. The living room is cozy and has blankets and a TV with a Roku device (the bedroom has one as well). There is a separate AC system so I could turn the heat on or off as I liked. Bathroom was cute and had decent amenities; there is a hotel-style hairdryer in the closet and a removable shower head in the shower. Everything was clean!

This little guest house was perfect for us: private, separate from the main house entirely, had all the amenities we needed, and was super comfortable for our stay. The Grammy Museum and Delta State are very nearby; we did touristy things and didn't take of advantage of the offer to drive around in Shelby's golf cart, but the surrounding neighborhood was a beautiful, safe place to just walk and take in the fall air. Shelby added personal touches to our stay; you can tell she cared that we were comfortable from the moment we stepped in the door. I wish her all the best and hope to stay there again!"

2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a nice and spacious home but there are a lot of unlisted rules such as do not leave the TV on all night, do not lie on the couch, do not stand in the front of the house with alcoholic beverages, or step on her grass, and etc. The other major issue is that she has cameras inside of her home which was not specified in the description and is a major invasion of privacy."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This is Like My Home Away From Home!!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We rented this Beautiful property when we traveled to the Delta for a funeral. This house was absolutely perfect for my family. It was spacious, well equipped, and immaculately clean. The size and set up allowed us to be together, but also to have personal space. There was plenty of space for parking and lots of outdoor seating as well. The home was stocked with extras that are not always available in an Airbnb-toiletries, extra paper products. Perhaps the most amazing part of this stay was the kindness, communication, and understanding of the host. Even when I messaged late one night, she responded promptly and answered my question. This was not a vacation for us, but this home and host made a trying time a little easier for my family and we are grateful for that."

My family and I traveled down from Chicago as a large group to attend a funeral just North in Clarksdale. The home turned out to be the perfect fit for us all! Even I was taken by surprise upon entry! BEAUTIFUL home! Great location within town, extremely spacious & clean and it has all the amenities any number of people could need. It was truly a home away from home, just be respectful of the household and their rules and you will love your stay here! I'd like to give a moment of appreciation to Tashandra, the host, who was so so very attentive, kind and gracious from the moment I first contacted her regarding our interest in staying until the time that we made our way back home. I can't thank her enough for her superb hospitality especially during a time when we needed it the most. Her character alone made it all worth it! My family and I are definitely looking forward to staying here again! ❤"

We were so excited to have a space big enough for all of us to stay together while enjoying our yearly homecoming meet up. The check-in/out process was easy and the hostess responded quickly even when we locked ourselves out in the early hours of the morning. You will have a great stay as long as you respect her space.

We did have to go out and purchase a Roku to watch the college games on Saturday, due to the home only having a antenna, which was the one draw back to the place, but we will look to book this place every time we come down for a game!! Thanks Again!!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home is exactly the way it’s posted. Everything was great, from the check in until check out. The home is clean, it’s provided with everything listed and more. We stayed there because our family reunion was in indianola which is very close."

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful than what words can express. This was my first Airbnb experience and I was skeptical. My name isTarnesha Wright of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I’m here to tell you that this is true. The home is even better than the pictures. The hotels down there will cost more than the house. Everything that we needed was right there. Safe, clean, cozy and affordable are just a few characteristics that I can give you! Communication from the owner was also A-1"

2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay in the home was amazing.!
The house is well decorated and served us well as a place that offered great sleeping accommodations and a place of comfort and fellowship for many family members after formal activities of our family reunion. Although we did not exercise pool privileges the pool area is beautiful and served as private get away area for small groups of the family who had not seen each other in years to reconnect. Some of us used the area as a quiet area to reflect and meditate.
The layout of the house. is smart and included several private spaces that allowed multiple couples to experience their own private quarters while creating large beautiful space for family fellowship. The master bedroom is huge and fit for any king and/or queen.
The workout room offers equipment for anyone who wills to work off the calories from all the tasty southern food.
My family found the house to be well organized and beautiful, yet comfortable and a great value."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was wonderful! Our stay was better than expected and it was so much better than all of our family members staying in separate hotel rooms. Great visit!

I would highly recommend this home."

2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and awesome host. The house was everything we could have asked for and more. We visited Cleveland due to DYB World Series.

2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful.
The small upstairs gym even inspired me to work out for about ten minutes! The pool is just right. The decor is elegant with inspirational posters and original art. Surprising little details everywhere. Silk flowers. Glass sculpture. Plenty of soft pillows. New televisions in every room! Elegant dining room. Cozy kitchen eating area. Quiet neighborhood. We were a few minutes away from the University, restaurants and boutique shopping.
Our hosts welcomed us and offered directions and suggestions for our stay that were helpful. I don't know how one could ask for anything more."

We always feel like we are right at home. It was very accommodating for our family needs. The only problems we had were none of the electrical outlets in the Master’s Suite were working and would suggest better cleaning by housekeeping. Matt was responsive to my concerns. I would love to continue to enjoy this home for any future needs."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, we loved this place! Such an amazing time, we’ll be back for sure! The location really surprised us, and we loved it, highly recommend this to anyone visiting the Cleveland area. This was a comfortable stay and an incredible house. Thank you, Matt."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As a former resident of Cleveland, I really enjoy coming back to visit and bringing my grandchildren to camp at DSU. We could not ask for a better location and the house is very flexible. I can invite friends over to visit in one space while the kids are occupied in other spaces of the house. The kitchen is well stocked with plenty of dishes ---we were only missing a large pot for cooking pasta. It is a lovely setting and is ideal for entertaining. Matt is quick to respond to any question we had and was helpful to me in making minor adjustments to check in/out times."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Was a great stay, but the lawn needed some attention and the mosquitoes very vicious. My family enjoyed the house!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our son got married in Cleveland so this was our central
Location. It was big enough to spread out and do wedding prep without getting crowded! It was so welcoming and homey..i was actually sad to leave because we had very little down time to just sit and take it all in! It was a perfect home away from
Home for a Delta wedding/gathering! Would most definitely stay there again!! Until next time ❤️"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Matt is an excellent host and this home is great for a Cleveland experience with a group of 6-8 people. There are 2 bedrooms down and 5 individual beds/spaces in a large shared room upstairs. So it’s great for a situation where adults want to stay downstairs in privacy and let kids all stay upstairs. Or a guys trip where several people can stay in a shared common space upstairs. The den and living area and kitchen are perfect for a large group to meet and spend time together. Plenty of parking and walkable to everything in downtown Cleveland and Delta State University.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I absolutely loved this place!!! It felt like a home away from home. Very spacious inside and outside. Great place for the family to gather. Everyone was impressed with the choice of this home for our stay in Cleveland. The privacy of the upstairs single beds exceeded my expectations. It was like having your own individual room, loved it!!! I appreciate Matt so much for hosting us in his absolutely warm and beautiful home!!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed spending the time between Christmas and New Year’s here. There was plenty of room for family to spread out and enjoy the multiple living areas and eating areas. The beds were comfortable and the linens were nice. The kitchen was big enough for all of us.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This house is fabulous. Very nice area and private. House is well supplied and very cozy and comfortable. Matt was very responsive to my questions and very accommodating to my requests. Highly recommend this place.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great we only had a problem wil water running under the sink area in kitchen and a problem with the sink in the upstair bedroom. The manager responded to both issues. The area was very nice and quite. We loved it and we will definitely go back there again.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Lots of room. Very clean. Private location. Owner very attentive and reachable when needed. Definitely looking forward to future stays when wanna get away from it all!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Griz-Acre is located on an acre of land with a spacious house, and yard in the most desirable place to be in Cleveland. It is close to everywhere you might want to go. I was here with a group of artist, but I can imagine it being a great family space with plenty of room to gather.
It is different in that the two main downstair rooms, (one room King Bed with bath, and one room with Queen bed and bath in the hall) and single beds upstairs (some in their own private nooks) can house a large number of people, not including spacious sofas in a large family room with a 1/2 bathroom. The house is ready for company and it is very comfortable. I just left today but know I will go back again. It is very clean and the beds were comfortable, sheets and towels were top rate. It has more room than you can possibly need. Our group loved it and we will return."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For this to be my first Air BnB experience, absolutely phenomenal. The home is immaculate! Great location with short rides to eateries and venues."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, spacious house that was very relaxing for this 2 families get away! We had 4 adults and 8 children ages 3-10, and we had plenty of space and privacy for everyone.

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"House is lovely with a beautifully landscaped backyard! Plenty of space for a large group and in a prime location in town. Was cheaper and cozier than booking a bunch of hotel rooms for everyone in my group. Thanks, Matt!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home and location for any occasion. The interior is gorgeous and spacious. The host was very accommodating and quick to respond to any of my questions.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is perfect for wedding parties in Cleveland. There are not many places to stay that sleep so many people and it was right down the road from our venue.

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Big house. lots room, very clean. beautiful outdoor scenery. highly recommend"
2022-04-01,2.0,Group trip,"The house had not been cleaned in a while, which was evident in the amount of dead bugs that we around the house and some residual trash under some of the couches. There were also some live bugs found in the house that we had to kill. I made several attempts to contact them about the door latch because the door did not close. Even after you sent someone to ""fix"" it, the door was open when we arrived back to the house that evening - showing that they were unable to close it themselves. We had to use a chair to keep the back door closed for the entirety of our stay. Coming down to Mississippi for a funeral was already stressful, but a further burden was placed on us by having to deal with anxiety around the possibility of someone being in the house when we returned or that someone may have gotten into the home during our time away and stealing our things or other things in the house (which is absolutely beautiful and full of antique pieces). Also, with the exception of the back door, all other doors to the house were locked and we found no key to open them. I believe this is a fire safety violation due to a lack of egress. I understand that you are busy like the rest of us, but your limited response to us around such an important issue was disconcerting."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay.

The house itself was beautiful! And we can’t rave enough about the view! There were extra linens and towels provided which was extremely appreciated. Also the kitchen was well stocked! If you have a big group w many different ‘wants’ on their list…this is the one!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is huge. It has a lot of quirky features that make it very interesting. It served its purpose for us being smack dab in the middle of Cleveland. We enjoyed our stay, and if we ever go back to Cleveland, we will be staying there again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Matt was extremely responsive and quick to accommodate special request. Thank you
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Matt for being responsive & overly accommodating. The property was beautiful & safe. We will definitely use it again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Matt was great to work with and house worked perfect for our needs. Much better bang for your buck than anything else nearby.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice place recommend it
2024-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"House was excellent. Took 1 star off due to lack of kitchen items. Kitchen was very sparse - no coffee mugs (but had a Keurig), limited silverware (only 1 butter knife, no steak knives, maybe 5 forks and spoons, no toaster, very few pots/pans, no strainer or cutting board). We like to use Airbnb rather than hotels so we don’t have to go out to eat.
Other than the lack of kitchen items the house was perfect and would highly recommend. Great location. Plenty of space. I would definitely stay there again.
The only other thing to note (I wouldn’t take a star off for it…just an fyi), one bathroom only has a bathtub (no shower). The other bathroom does have a shower."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I loved it!! It was nice and clean and everything looked just like the photos. It was just the right side for me and my family. I would definitely stay here again if and when I'm in the area..if the timing is right.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great folks great place!
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house needs a lot of maintenance work. Hole in wall in dining room. Doors don't open and close properly. Oven didn’t work. Spent money to cook for 7 people, and after 2 hours in the oven, it was still frozen . I had to have food delivered costing over $120. The jacuzzi tub would not hold water for long. The refrigerator was nasty from liquids leaking in the door. I had to wipe down the outside handles and door because it was dirty from food and fingerprints. The gas fireplace didn't work. There was a dirty k-cup in the coffee maker. The cups in the cupboard were dirty. Had to buy paper towels. There were no extra blankets, and the ones on the bed were very thin. The washing machine kept showing door open and wouldn't finish the load of laundry. It could be a very nice place but needs a lot of maintenance work."
2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,This is a great place to stay! Spacious and in a nice neighborhood.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Thanks Don for providing a great place to stay and always being responsive. Thanks for adding to our great weekend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very nice home, and amazing hosts! Definitely recommend staying here and we look forward to future stays."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved meeting Lars and the gorgeous home! His land is so beautiful and peaceful, and we even took a dip in the pool, and met the animals. Already booked another stay. What a gem!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s always a pleasure to stay in one of Lars’s cottages. Beautiful property, great pool, friendly host, and centrally located to all of the best of the Mississippi Delta. We could easily stay for several weeks. Lars goes above and beyond as host to make sure you have everything you need - he even brought us a grill. He is responsive to questions. We hope to visit regularly!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Came to the area with our family and enjoyed staying ‘on the farm’ as that is what we are used too. The children loved the swimming pool and we all enjoyed walking all the beautiful trails. Lars was a terrific host and would stay here again. One thing to note which probably wouldn’t affect the majority of people staying, but we love to cook our own meals and there wasn’t a lot of amenities in the kitchen, but we made do."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, and would stay there again. We loved the screened porch and swings. The beds were very comfortable and the room A/C's worked great. Baths were nice also. We enjoyed seeing the horses the morning that we were to leave. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and hope to be back next year. Thank you."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and enjoyable. I was working from out of town and had a trailer and he offered me a place to park it without extra charge.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The most beautiful cabin in a serene setting. I drove in late from out of town and Lars made sure I made it safely. We had issues with the gate to the property and Lars was immediately available to assist! We loved staying here and hope to be back very soon!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cottage and location. Lars is a wonderful host! Wish we could have stayed longer!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great spot to get away and relax!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun little cottage on the farm. Woke up to horses grazing in the pasture. And had to keep my wife from playing with the pig. Great stay.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Thank you everything was great.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I loved our stay at Sycamore! Our trip was planned around attending a class at the Viking Cooking School in Greenwood, but we all agreed the time we spent at the cottage was equally enjoyable!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful property that is so peaceful and secluded. Very spacious, well decorated home with plenty of space. Had all of the amenities listed and then some. Lars was extremely helpful and responsive. He gave very clear instructions of how to navigate the property to give us the best experience possible."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lars was great! Amazing setting. Very peaceful and quiet! Looked just like the photos!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lars was a great host! Very friendly and easy to talk to! He gave us a tour of his lovely property and we learned the history of his family farm.
I must say the photos do not do it justice. The land is very peaceful and picturesque. We enjoyed the quiet and listening to the cicadas. We also enjoyed the rain on the tin roof while swinging on the screened in porch.
The space is just beautiful and very clean. We loved the decor and cozy beds.
The pool was so nice too! Lars even provided us with beach towels! It was cool to watch the horses while we swam!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to visit again. This place is a real gem. Best kept secret in my opinion!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lars was a wonderful host. The Sycamore Cottage was just what we needed for our party of 6 - comfortable to sleep and hang out, but centrally located for us to tour around The Delta. The setting was lovely, and we were able to enjoy the pool a few times as well. The favorite spot was the screened porch, and we had to take turns lounging on the bed swings. That was the spot for morning coffee, reading a good book, afternoon naps, and evening chats."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lars' farm in Sunflower County was absolutely AMAZING! The cottage we stayed in was stunning--it belongs on the cover of Architectural Digest! The views of the surrounding farm were beautiful and it was so quiet and peaceful. We spent most days sitting on the front and back porches enjoying the view and sitting by the pool watching the horses stroll by. Lars was so friendly and welcoming, he even gave us a tour of his farm. We would highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the Delta."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lars is a fantastic host. Highlights of the house include two renovated bathrooms, a screened-in porch, and bucolic surroundings. Don't miss the opportunity to stay here!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was out in the 'country' Quiet, remote. Was lovely to wake up to the birds chirping outside. Enjoyed sitting on the porch on the bed swings and just enjoy the serenity. The cottage was exactly as in the pictures. Good place to step away and just get some R & R. It was about 20-30 minute drive to get into town (depending on where you needed to go)."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house and the location! It was perfect for us! The ONLY issue we had was locating the driveway at night. Could be marked a little better. But other than that, it was great!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Highly recommended.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a wonderful location and home. Highly recommend
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From start to finish, Lars was a fantastic host. He was always responsive in communication, met us when we checked in to make sure we found everything ok, and was wonderful with our kids when they wanted to ride the horses. The house itself was perfect, with an idyllic setting and beautiful finishes inside. We stayed two nights, and would have loved to stay longer. Whenever we are back in the Delta, we will absolutely be staying here!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the second time we’ve stayed with Lars and look forward to coming back again! The property and the cottage are gorgeous and beautifully appointed. Lars is an awesome guy and extremely helpful and responsive to any questions. My husband and I both work remotely (on Zoom and FaceTime) and had no trouble at all. The beds are very comfortable with wonderful bedding. We enjoyed spending time on both porches in the mornings with our coffee and in the evening with a whiskey. If you’re looking for a beautiful spot in the Delta, this is the one! Thank you, Lars! See you soon!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I've stayed at Lars and it was just as fantastic as the first time. It is the coziest, most peaceful cottage; the furnishings, art and amenities are perfectly curated. It is quiet and comforting, and you can sit on the porch on either side of the house and stargaze or see the animals (horses and one giant pig) grazing on the land. It is the best the Delta has to offer ;), and both Lars and his wife are friendly, responsive and always helpful."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Even nicer than the pictures. Wonderful place, amazing porches! Great location in the heart of the Delta, easy drive to places we wanted to visit. Great host. We will definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing long weekend stay at Lars' place in Shaw. This is the real Delta and it's always a pleasure to visit with Lars, who's conversant in everything from farming (natch) to Faulkner. Will be back next year to relax and visit. Can't recommend highly enough."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best stop for anyone wanting to see and experience the Delta
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"this place represents everything that is great about Airbnb. the house was unique. Their sense of style and originality was first rate. best of all however, and something that is missing from so many airbnbs, was the personal touch and connection. Lars was a great host personally, showing us around the farm and telling the history of the place. this is what traveling is all about."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. Such a cute quiet little cottage. About 7 miles from the nearest store and gas station.
The kids enjoyed the horse back riding and the pool. The pool is across the field right in the side yard of the other cottage. My favorite was the bed swings. Also the regular beds are some of the most comfortable ones I've ever slept on. Perfect weekend getaway spot for adults but our kids enjoyed it too."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Lars’s was a great host. He had every thing set when we arrived making it very easy for us.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My kids and I enjoyed this little getaway out of the city! The beds were super comfy and the modern showers were fantastic. We cooled off in the swimming pool, and Lars helped us arrange horseback riding and a tour of the crop farm with his daughter. My kids loved seeing the horses roam around and the two farm dogs, River and Levi. We ventured into Leland and found the Birthplace of Kermit The Frog Museum, as well as a Railroad Museum with the most incredible model train system we've ever seen. It was a perfect weekend trip for relaxation and family time!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely the greatest little place to get away from it all. I live nearby and rented this cottage for my mother and adult children to stay at while they were in the Delta for a funeral. It was quiet and peaceful and completely surrounded by some of the best parts of the MS Delta. We wish we had had more time to enjoy it. They said it was their favorite AirBnB experience and they want to do it again the next time they come.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were delighted by our stay at Sycamore Cottage. Cay and Lars are gracious and welcoming hosts. The accommodations were charming and comfortable in a well appointed repurposed and renovated old Sunday school building. (The rest of the chapel is on the property.) We loved the comfy beds, beautiful art and decor, and huge porch swings, not to mention the beautiful views of horses on this farm. We look forward to returning and seeing our new friends again:-)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! The cabin was exactly as pictures and peaceful, beautiful and cozy. We bumped into Lars and he couldn’t have been more gracious. This is a wonderful place to stay for peace and quiet. We even met some of the horses!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home. Very relaxing and peaceful. Love the front porch.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet place with great porch .
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay all around. Just what we were looking for. Very peaceful & cozy.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is not hyperbole when I say this is hands down the best Airbnb experience we have ever had. The cottage and the property itself are truly a dream. Not only that, the hosts are so warm and welcoming and some of the kindest people you’ll meet. We watched beautiful sunrises and sunsets from the porch, and man can you see some starry skies at night! It’s located smack dab in the middle of all of the biggest Blues Trail sites, but is worth a trip just on its own. We cannot wait to come back."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This property & the owners are wonderful. I felt safe traveling with my kids alone. Would love to return someday!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family visited the farm for a few days and had a great time! It's very clean, the water was hot, and the kids loved the swinging beds in the porch. The beds in the bedrooms were very comfortable. On our second day, it snowed and looked beautiful Lars was always there when we needed something or just to talk, but was not intrusive at all. Thanks for our great vacation in the Delta!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We always love staying at Brandon's place, and he is a wonderful host!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We have stayed in the home several times. It’s in a perfect location and always top notch in condition! Brandon is responsive and was flexible with our needs. Will be back!!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed 4 days to go to Juke Joint Fest in Clarksdale and because it's so many days I cook. There was one usable pan in the kitchen and nothing else to cook with that was not chipped. I always bring food but my years on Airbnb, and kitchens there is always salt, pepper, oil of some sort, sponge in the kitchen. I had to go buy stuff. I believe after this review that Brandon will add some small stuff to the kitchen.
The bed was very comfortable, the house was clean. Easy parking in the back to take stuff in and out and the house was neat."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here! It was perfect for my family! Great location too! Would definitely recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So charming, and only 1/4 mile walking distance to the DSU Natatorium. Brandon was a terrific host, this adorable home was clean, had all the amenities we needed (washer/dryer, AC, covered patio, kitchen, TV, wi-fi)
Most importantly… the beds were super comfy! Mine felt like a tempurpedic. Loved having 2 bathrooms and staying in a home vs a hotel. I felt safe and the neighbors next door were super nice, as well. You can’t go wrong here!
My only suggestion is to offer an outdoor grill. We had beautiful weather and we love to grill. Thanks for the great stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Brandon’s place is great. He communicates well and if you have any cause or concern he is quick to respond and handle any mishaps that happen. I would recommend him to anyone.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at this property and, once again, we were not disappointed. This listing is the perfect space for our family of 4 with 2 college kids. Everyone had their own space. The beds were so comfortable! We especially enjoyed the kitchen amenities. We made tacos at night and enjoyed coffee in the mornings. The TV and WiFi were also enjoyed by all of us. Brandon provided timely and relevant communication before and during our stay. Couldn’t ask for anything more. We will definitely book this listing with Brandon again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place has a great retro vibe with super comfy beds. Brandon was very communicative before and during our stay. We enjoyed our stay and would return.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Thanks so much for our welcoming stay. Host was very responsive and helpful. Will definitely recommend to others!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Brandon's. We were very pleased with our accommodations both times. We feel at home while staying there. It is in a very quiet neighborhood, and it's easy to get to the main streets of town. Last time there was a problem with the TV during severe weather and Brandon came to fix it. This time everything went well. We hope to arrange to stay at his place again the next time we are in Cleveland."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love Brandon as a host and continue to choose his place time and time again! Wonderful home away from home for our family of 6! Brandon is very responsive and helpful! 100% recommend!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place in a great location. Very quiet and peaceful. Really appreciated the off street parking.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Brandon's place. It was exactly as described and so was just what we hoped it would be. Cosy during single degree temperatures of Xmas 2022. In a quiet neighborhood while just blocks from downtown and other restaurants. On edge of Delta State University. Brandon was a most responsive host. His place is very comfortable, and we would stay again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We always feel at home here. It was our second stay. If it was available each time it would always be our first choice. The beds and pillows are amazing. The character is priceless. Hope to return every year. My husband is from here and we usually stay a week. So much better then a hotel.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our accommodations were ideal, the shops and local attractions were very warm and welcoming. However, we found the local restaurants could use some improvement in service and availability!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was exactly as advertised . We have zero complaints. Next time we stay in Cleveland, we’ll try to get this place again!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great trip! The house was close to campus and very clean! And Brandon was an awesome host! Will definitely book again! 5 ⭐️
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is in a perfect location for attending events at Delta State. Brandon was very quick to respond to any question I had. The kitchen is well equipped, which made preparing meals for 4 children much easier. We arrived on a rainy afternoon and a covered carport connected to the house was a lifesaver. A washer and dryer in the house also made life much easier, as we had wet swim suits and towels almost every day. An added bonus to the house is Brandon's art work."
2021-07-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was quirky and pleasant but we were disappointed with a few things. There was a solid layer of dust on many surfaces, the base boards, doors, vents and blinds all had dirt and grim. It was stated in the house description that coffee was provided but there was no coffee to be found in the house but two coffee makers which was quite frustrating to wake up to. Over all we were expecting the house to be a bit more updated and taken by surprise by the dated poorly working faucets and disruptively noisy air conditioner. The kitchen tap would only provide warm to hot water and the faucet handle was very loose. There are a few more things we could nit pick but over all the house was not as expected."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house for a couple of small family!
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent communication, easy check-in, nice space. Would rent again"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was our second time staying at Brandon's place. There was plenty of room for the four of us. Very close to the Delta State Campus, places to eat, and places to visit. If the place is open the next time we visit Cleveland, we would love to stay again."

2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"We rented the house so that 4 people that live in different states could come together and hang out and cook some amazing meals!! We really enjoyed our time there!! Very cute little house, I definitely recommend this place! We did not even use the third bedroom with the bunk beds. Would be great for 2 couples with a couple kids for sure!! Nice neighborhood and close to stores and some landmark things to see!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful old home. The art on the walls was a nice touch, there was plenty of furniture and it had all the amenities of any normal home. The bedrooms are spacious and the beds are very comfy. The house was also very clean."

2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon was a great host who went over and beyond to meet a special request to have the furniture rearranged, which was greatly appreciated. The furniture arrangement and room decor was perfect for most areas of the house, which offered a real comfortable feel to the whole place. Overall, it was a cozy place that worked well for our annual festival visit. We'll certainly keep Bubby's Bungalow in mind for future visits."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bubby’s Bungalow is in a perfect location near Delta State University and includes an attention to detail that makes it a special place.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Holy cow…this place is perfect! First of all, the communication with the host is second to none. I was traveling solo on this trip to Cleveland but the Rail Car would be great for a couple or even a small family. It was a somewhat rainy/dreary weekend but the screened in porch was awesome for morning coffee and I could see it being a cool place to unwind in the evening as well.
Amenities were great. Roku TV, WiFi, coffee maker, and comfy accommodations. I have enjoyed this place so much it makes we want to take a shot and start my own tiny house in my hometown for guest visiting the area.
Location is so close to DSU which is a bonus for me as I was in town to broadcast baseball games against DSU (Go Tigers…U West Alabama). Actually, I’m typically here 2-3 times a year to broadcast other sports and this will be my go-to from now on.
There is nothing not to like about this place. Seriously, stop reading this review and book the place before you miss out!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately, the house was not ready yet and only accidentally online. Amy took care of it immediately and apologized 1000x and offered her help. No problem at all. We would have loved to be the first guests:)"

2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here one night while on a road trip. Upon first glance, it was exactly what we were looking for. The location of the place is great and it really could be a nice little option if you’re passing through. Susan was easy to communicate with during check in and check out . Unfortunately, within the first hour of staying there, we saw three cockroaches, one which was on the bed. This kind of freaked us out and we did not sleep well. Another reason we did not sleep well is that the mattress was caving in- in the center of the bed - and was just about as uncomfortable as it could possibly be. My husband ended up going out to the couch for the second half of the night. For these reasons, we were glad that we had only just one night here."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place on a quiet street! Susan is very accommodating and kind - I enjoyed my stay!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lar's place was just a little piece of heaven. I came to visit family and also to have some time to reflect and write. It was just perfect. Lars was flexible and communicative and I appreciate his efforts to make my stay perfect.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The word bucolic came to mind when I drove up to the Peacock Cottage.
For me this was like stepping back in time. I grew up in the Mississippi Delta not so many miles from Peacock in the Delta. The Delta has changed so much from my 1960s childhood, so much of the land has been cleared of trees to make room for crops, so much of the crop land leveled to facilitate irrigation, YET this farm has been kept pristine, as I said, for me, literally like walking back in time.
The host, Lars, a quintessential Delta character, was a perfect host.
Oh yea, I was traveling solo, without my dogs, and Lars even arranged for the family Bernedoodle to greet me at my door each morning. Then there are also horses, pigs etc. which may come up to the back fence, just beyond the cottage, to speak.
The stay was more than a stay, it was an experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful and well kept place to visit, excellent accommodations!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at this fantastic little jewel smack dab in the delta.
There is a peace to be felt and I’m grateful to get the chance go experience it again. I could have stayed a couple of days longer but left feeling rested. Rejuvenated.
Thanks for sharing your place with us."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time to the Delta to visit family and the.cottage was the absolutely the highlight. The location was perfect to go to the surrounding towns to get to a few attractions like the BB King museum. But the farm itself was the best place to be. Lars was warm and receptive. The cottage is cute and comfy. The porches allowed for coffee and breakfast in the mornings and every morning the puppers, Levi and River came to saw hi. There are beautiful horses and sheep and a huge piggy Lucky. Archie took us horseback riding through the farm and even showed us his carriage horses. We loved our stay at the Peacock and will be back soon."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a lovely stay, playing tennis, swimming, and walking around the beautiful property!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you are planning a trip to the Mississippi Delta I would highly recommend Peacock in the delta.

I relaxed in the pool & listened to the cicadas & all my anxiety just drifted away. I couldn’t have stayed in a more beautiful & perfect setting. Thanks for sharing your beautiful piece of the MS Delta Lars!!! You are so blessed to live in such a gorgeous part of this planet, and I appreciate your hospitality! If I do this event again, I know where I’m staying again!!! ❤️"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed out stay at Peacock in the Delta! It was so peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed having the swimming pool right outside our cabin door, and loved walking the property to visit the beautiful chapel. I would love to come back in the fall when it isn't so hot. Lars was so helpful and friendly as were the two dogs who greeted us when we arrived. Great little getaway spot off the beaten path."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had such a great experience at this beautiful home!!! We definitely will be coming back many times!🩷

Hands down, highly recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There's a lot to love about the Peacock cottage - too much to list. Highlights were the beds and quality bedding, porches, views, swimming pool, and cypress trees. We met Lars and he was super friendly and interesting. I would love to come back when we have more time, as there was much more to see and do on the farm than our brief visit allowed. We were in the Delta to visit civil rights and music history sites, and we did get lessons in those that we will never forget."

We were passing through while doing the Mississippi Blues Trail which Lars had lots of knowledge of. We would love to stay again for longer someday! Highly recommended!"

I really can't articulate in words how much we enjoy this lovely little place."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful and beautiful place in the Delta!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for a weekend getaway! The cottage was absolutely beautiful & had everything we needed.

Lars was such a great host & made sure we had everything we needed. We are already planning our next visit!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was a perfect place for my husband and I to rest and relax while we dropped our son off at Delta State! I highly recommend staying here for that perfect getaway we all need.

Levi and River are so friendly and the hosts were kind and helpful!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fabulous 2 night stay in this charismatic cozy cabin. It was comfortable and we particularly enjoyed sitting on the porch for breakfast and in the evening. We BBQ’d both nights and would have used the fire pit had it been a little cooler. As to be expected in the Delta, bug spray is advisable. We loved the dogs Levi and River - they became constant companions.
We really enjoyed chatting to Lars who showed us around the farm and was really interesting to speak to. The cabin is in an ideal location for exploring the many Blues attractions in the surrounding area, and of course the Kermit Museum in Leland. Highly recommend."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The coolest place. Feels like you’ve stepped into a fairytale story book. Archie took us for a horse ride and the dog - Levi, is just the sweetest boy. We loved our stay and can’t wait to come back."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars was such an excellent host and the cabin was gorgeous. I can’t speak highly enough for why, if you’re in the delta, you should stay here. This is a hidden gem, no doubt. The weather got the better of our fishing trip, but Lars’ cabin made up for the rainy weather. Excellent communication, great price, great location for a delta visit. You can’t beat it."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our family stay at the cottage! Our two little ones especially enjoyed the puppies greeting them each morning in addition to seeing the horses each day! The cottage is centrally located to a number of things to do in the area as well as a number of good restaurants (NOLA and Blue Biscuit were our favorites). Lars even was kind enough to take us on a tour of their family farm which our girls really enjoyed! We’ll definitely stay here again if we ever make it back to the area!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Peacock in the Delta Cottage is the perfect place for a your Mississippi Blues Trail tour headquarters or for a quiet, serene getaway. The setting is maybe the most relaxing place you'll ever visit and the location is smack in the middle of the Mississippi Blues scene. The cottage is elegant with a lean toward history. It is clean, we'll kept, well appointed, and romantic. A big plus is all the animals on the farm (especially Levi the dog). Without a doubt, this is the best AirBnb we've ever experienced."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend this cozy little cottage for a get away from everything kinda wknd
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great vantage point for seeing the Mississippi Delta. Staying on a cotton farm made history come alive with the privacy of a charming guest house to ponder the experience.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy cabin. Not too far off the beaten path. Beautiful surroundings. Would definitely stay there again.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend at the Peacock. Highly recommend this property for a farm stay getaway.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great hospitality and unique southern experience
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a good stay
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in the delta. Loved the cottage, and it was very comfortable and well-appointed. Enjoyed the fire pit, the porches, the hammock, and the dogs. I hope to be back with friends!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful piece of land, warm cottage & amazing animals! A perfect retreat for anyone looking for some peace and quiet! Can't recommend highly enough!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The little cabin was the perfect place for me to stay while visiting the Delta. I could easily go places from there and then return to the quiet cabin to reflect.
I really appreciated the art work and the selections of books, they made me feel at home."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cabin made for the perfect relaxing weekend for our little family! We loved exploring the grounds and lounging on the screened in porch.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cottage.
Wonderful hosts.
Thank you for everything"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of those gems that you’re tempted to keep to yourself…the Peacock in the Delta is something really special. But like most good things in life, they’re better when shared. The cottage, the setting, the people, the animals- absolutely idyllic. We truly didn’t want to leave. If you enjoy horses, ask Lars (an awesome human and impeccable host) to set you up with Archie (also an amazing guy) for a ride around the property. You won’t regret choosing this little slice of heaven!!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely clean house, exactly as represented. Host responded quickly and efficiently to a small problem that we had and was easy to communicate with! We were in the Delta to visit family and enjoyed driving the back roads."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit to Lars' cottage and it won't be my last! I arrived feeling stressed and weary and left feeling peaceful and rejuvenated (even with some work thrown in during my visit!). I did a little walking with Lars' dogs around the property, but it was a warm weekend, so I mostly just hung out on the screened porch or in the hammock. I was visiting by myself this time and felt totally safe. It's the perfect place for a getaway either with a friend or partner or on your own! I brought all the food I needed for my time there and never left the property. Ahhhh!!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed this Delta gem! Beautiful property and the Peacock cottage is wonderfully upscale while retaining a rustic feel. Lars went above and beyond to give us a great visit! Thank you!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an absolutely AMAZING stay! Me and my family needed to get away from our busy lives in a busy city and this was just what was needed. Every aspect of this stay was 5 stars from Lars communication, hospitality, and the charm of the cottage and property. The small touches such as providing coffee, sugar, and cream was great. Lars even allowed for my entire family to go horse back riding which was the most amazing experience. My 4 year old has not stopped talking about this trip yet and fell in love with Lars dog Rider. We will be back later this year and would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone. Lars, Kay, and Louisa treated us like family. This is absolutely a hidden gem!!! 5/5 stars (would give more if we could)."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful and peaceful place! Truly a little slice of paradise tucked away in the Mississippi Delta. This was our second time to stay at Peacock Cottage and I've already booked our next stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to getaway for a weekend… the cottage was perfect and Lars was super nice and helpful!!! We look forward to getting another chance in the future to stay at the Peacock!!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly charming cottage! This is JUST what we needed for a peaceful kids free girls weekend!! There are no pictures that can do this farm justice. No road noise, just nature at its finest. The cottage did tend to stay a little on the warm side bc of all the windows but all those windows also provided stunning views!
We were fortunate enough to have a small rain shower right at lunch & we loved picnicking on the screened in porch. It was perfect!
Every morning we enjoyed coffee & Bible study time on the porch and then walked right out the door to the pool. It was fabulous!
Levi, (the bernadoodle) was super friendly
and was the perfect tour companion as we walked around the property.
Lars was gracious and available but not overbearing. The cottage was closer to their home than I had realized but we still had plenty of privacy.
We brought most of our own groceries but did enjoy a delicious meal at NOLA and at lost pizza.
If you want to sleep in you might want to bring a sleep mask because the cottage does have lots of natural light ☺️
We look forward to returning in cooler temps to take advantage of the fire pit! Our time went too quickly and we look forward to coming again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay on the farm. We really got to relax and enjoy the country. We loved the tennis court and the pool. River and Levi were a big hit with our daughter! We went on a horse ride with Lars and thats was just so fun. I really reccomend this place for a realxing country stay !
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our last trip before our son starts school! He says his favorite things were swimming and of course riding the horses! Lars was so patient with him (he’s 4) & so kind! Can’t recommend this place enough!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved everything about this property. The nature, the cozy cottage, the pool, the location…..it was the perfect recipe for a relaxing getaway.
There are many things to do within an hours drive, but I also spend some days walking the grounds, reading on the porch.
I would stay here again and hope to!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lars is a wonderful host! Quick to respond and making sure we had everything we needed!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the activities, and I got to talk about sustainable agriculture too."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tranquil. Comfy. One of a kind. Perfect.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second time to visit the Peacock. We just love it! It's definitely One of our favorite Airbnb's! The cottage is just so cozy and perfect. The view is incredible. The pool is so relaxing. Lars has thought of everything to make your stay so nice and stress free. Lars is a wonderful host. He's very easy to communicate with and very quick on responses. If you book here, you will not be disappointed! It truly is a gem!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will be greeted by River & Levy two of the sweetest dogs. Lars is very kind & accommodating. He is a great host and quick to respond to anything you may need. We loved the cottage, so comfortable. It was just what we needed for a quick getaway. The pool was relaxing and refreshing. You couldn’t ask for more from a host. We also really enjoyed the two porches, very comfortable. We had a great time, beautiful property!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a true gem! Can’t recommend it enough. The cottage is cute, comfy, and well equipped. Lars is a great host and graciously took time to show us around and make sure we were comfortable. Peacock Inn is really well situated to visit a lot of the interesting spots in the Delta. We loved it here and would definitely return!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we can't say enough about this treasure in the delta. the host was so welcoming. the farm stay was lovely in every respect. we especially adored the front porch with the fan. the beds are to die for. The setting though is what really sets this Airbnb apart. don't pass up an opportunity to stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay at Lar’s and Cay’s Peacock Cottage! It’s beautiful! Stayed with my husband and our two boys 8 and 13. The boys were kept busy playing tennis, basketball, swimming and exploring the farm. The pool was cool and refreshing! We spent time in the local towns visiting the pottery shops, restaurants and stopped by the Winterville Mounds all which we enjoyed. Lars and his family are gracious hosts!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cottage at Peacock in the Delta is absolutely charming! To be honest, I can’t remember the last time I called something charming. To be clear the cottage is small (one room attached to a full bathroom & a kitchenette but there’s a screened in porch and an open porch out back) but it had everything I needed for an 8 day stay in the Delta. Lars’ is an awesome host. You won’t regret booking a stay here."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was absolutely magical! The farm and landscape are stunning and just what we needed. The cottage is cozy and beautifully decorated. Lars was a fantastic host, and we were grateful to learn more about his family’s land and get a tour. I would come back and visit in a heartbeat!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful peaceful place!
Very beautifully done, quiet little cottage. All the necessities we needed for a peaceful weekend. We had a great time just sitting on the porches sipping coffee."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely charming cottage! The pics and descriptions are spot on-- I wish we could've spent a few more days there to take full advantage of all that was offered, but we are already planning a return with our kids.
The cottage is bright and lovingly decorated, the scenery is gorgeous, Lars, Cay, and their family are extremely kind and gracious, and their doggies are adorable! My husband chose well, we will be going back (not soon enough!).
- Doe's Eat Place, get the filet!
-Betty's Place-- oh my goodness, amazing BBQ!
- The Carriage House-- get yourself a candle and tell Alice the Brownlees sent you!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A little piece of Delta paradise..great hospitality, idyllic landscape, beautiful & comfortable cottage. Perfect spot to spend a slow, relaxing weekend. We came with our two children, 8 & 10, and we all had the best time exploring the farm, relaxing on the porches, playing tennis, swimming, horseback riding, playing with the sweetest pups, and riding in Mr. Lar’s truck around the farm. We hope we can return soon!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a repeat customer, which should say a lot. If you're looking for a quiet getaway, in a unique and interesting area, this is your spot. Lars is an amazing host, and the farm is a beautiful and peaceful place. I'll be back again."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is *amazing* - I'm really not going to do justice to how beautiful, relaxing, and gracious a place this is. We've stayed in many, many Airbnb's, nearly all of them good to great, and this one is our family favorite. The cottage is even more beautiful in person, and those beds, whoa, we slept like babies. The land is just gorgeous. What really makes this place, though, much as with any place, is the people: our hosts were so gracious and welcoming that we just immediately felt at ease. There's much to do onsite and it's a great base for exploring the delta, but the best thing is to just sit on one of the two porches and do nothing at all :) (really). Highly recommend.
Ps: Great shower. Kitchen has everything you'd need. Yard with fire pit is another bonus."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A charming cottage in an idyllic setting! We can’t wait to come back!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. The photos do not do it justice!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If I'm ever back in the area I'll be staying here again.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great find! Cant wait to visit again!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. I was surprised by how well the cabin kept warm when the temperatures were cold. Very nice place with everything you need for a weekend stay
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars was extremely accommodating & River (the pup) was the best tour guide of the property! A beautiful space with rustic, country views."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is comfortable with great views of the farm. The land itself is beautiful, and the host is exactly who you want to hang out with when you’re in the Delta. Lars knows tons of history of the land and can tell you all about the Delta, farming, hunting, horses, and Southern writers and artists. A true Southern renaissance man."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is magical! The cabin may be small, but I can't think of a thing that would improve it. My husband and I enjoyed a short getaway, but I could also imagine coming here for a solo retreat or even a cozy stay with the kids. (Though they're about to list a new, larger cabin on the same property, so we'd probably stay there if they came.) The weather in mid-November was unseasonably warm, so we got to play games on the screened porch and read on the front porch that overlooks the horse pasture. We took long walks around the property and saw deer and an owl. Even Lars' and Cay's dogs were hospitable, welcoming us as soon as we pulled up and accompanying us on our walks.
You could certainly stay on the property your whole visit without getting bored. There's tennis, basketball, horseback riding, and even a lovely pool in season. But we took a drive to Cleveland one night and ate dinner on the patio at Hey Joe's (which felt safe because of the open air, even during Covid) and then took a long stroll through the impressive downtown Christmas light display. The next day, we drove over to Greenville for a catfish sandwich at Gino's (thanks to the recommendation of a previous reviewer!), a peaceful walk through the Greenville Cypress Preserve, a drive to Warfield Point Park to see the Mississippi River, and finally a stop by Winterville Mounds to see some of the largest remaining mounds constructed by indigenous people a thousand years ago.
All in all, it was a fantastic getaway and I'm trying to figure out how soon I can get back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you guys so much for such a wonderful weekend! The farm, the cabin, and the hospitality where everything we hoped for. The cabin was so comfortable and had everything we needed for our weekend stay. Thank you for allowing us to walk all over your farm and meet all of the animals—our kids haven’t stopped talking about the old mama horse and keep naming every pig after Lucky. Lars was quick to respond and very accommodating with any request we had. We can’t wait to be back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the perfect get away spot. It is so relaxing and clean. I enjoyed getting up with the sunrise and drinking coffee and knitting on the back porch. You are close enough to Cleveland and Marigold to enjoy other spots in the Delta. But, you could easily stay there and never leave. We enjoyed the pool and just sitting outdoors by the fire. If you want to get away and unwind this is the spot. Read a book, play a game, nap or whatever you enjoy! We plan to return. The cottage is plenty spacious. The decorative touches are thoughtful, and everything is very comfortable and cozy! The host is kind and responsive and provides good communication. Book a stay here and be prepared to fall in love and return’"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a very peaceful getaway at the cottage. Sweet place with lots of windows and light. Two great porches — one screened-in. Coffee on the porch in the morning was lovely. Lots of bird watching. We would stay here again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a BEAUTIFUL place and the host is amazing!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this quiet, quaint cottage that provided beautiful views of the sunrise and the feel of complete escape from the hustle and bustle of life. Coffee on the porch each morning was our favorite!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars’ place is a secluded, beautiful and peaceful place in a unique part of the country. While Lars and family are nearby, the space feels entirely yours, but Lars is quick to respond to messages if needed. We spent mornings on the back porch enjoying the early sun and evenings having dinner on the screened front porch, and of course enjoyed the pool and tennis courts. Be sure to ask for Archie’s number for horseback riding around the property, he’s got a wealth of knowledge and plenty of good jokes to share. Nearby are several good restaurants and bars (with safe distancing during pandemic), including Hey Joe’s in Cleveland which seems to have the most affordable craft beer in the world and Gino’s, a drive through with one of the best catfish sandwich I’ve ever had. We can’t wait to come back."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our birthdays. It was wonderful! It's so quiet, so peaceful, and just a great place to unwind for a few days. We loved the pool and sitting on the back porch taking in the view. If you book here, you won't regret it!! The host made check-in super easy and was very quick with responses.
We hope to get back soon for another stay!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at the cottage. We took our children with us. We swam, played board games, grilled, reads books and just enjoyed being away from it all. This is definitely a special place to stay. It is beautiful, cozy and a real home away from home. We hope to visit again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cottage is just as special as shown in the photos. Great experience for our first Airbnb. Lars communication made it easy. Very comfortable and good location for touring the Delta.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The farm is a little slice of heaven, and the cabin and the grounds are even more beautiful than the photos. Cay and Lars are gracious, wonderful hosts. We are sure we will be back soon, as we can’t imagine staying anywhere else in the Delta.
Thank you so much for a fantastic stay."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super relaxing getaway! Would be the perfect artist retreat, small family weekend, or romantic weekend."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. Just the quiet getaway we needed.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful couple, Lars and Cay, thank you for letting me stay your beautiful property. I was very impressed with your way of life. For me, Lars is a man of independence, intellectual and full of curiosity and challenge, like Clint Eastwood. At the same time, Cay is a thoughtful, bright lady with a philosophical mindset like Susan Sontag. And both of them have warm hospitality.
My gut feeling is saying that this experience in the Tennessee Delta will bring me something unforeseen to my future life. I will return here someday. Let's keep diving ""into the unknown"" until then!"
2020-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,A quaint cottage with plenty of nature to enjoy!!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay and it was as great as I remembered it. Nothing quite like waking up to see the horses running around in the adjacent field. I hope to come back soon.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for peace, serenity and inspiration, this place is waiting for you...
Lisa Belenchia"

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The perfect retreat for solace and relaxation! Thoughtful touches abound throughout. You will not be disappointed!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I rented out Lars’s cottage with the hope that I’d have a relaxing and quiet getaway by myself, and I was not disappointed. Everything about the cottage was just right. The space was beautiful, and everything you need for a weekend getaway is all included. I hope to return in the near future!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place with beautiful views of nature!
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"HIDDEN TREASURE!
This place is amazing!

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay in a really secluded spot
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very relaxing cabin!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic spot to relax and enjoy the Delta! Small cozy cabin with an awesome setup for full relaxation. We brought four 4-year-olds and it’s still a trip they’re talking about ... from finding frogs, to the splashing in the pool, to running around the tennis courts, and the horseback riding ... it’s a trip they won’t soon forget. Lars was a fantastic host! Informative and helpful, but not intrusive at all.
Definitely recommend this spot for a nice relaxing trip to the delta. We hope to be back!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a piece of Mississippi paradise! Awesome place for unplugging!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My first visit was so good, I brought my family back for a relaxing weekend. Just as good the second time as it was the first. Lots of space to lounge around and relax in the pool."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Soo beautiful , tranquil , Peaceful & perfect ! Everything about this delta property was just amazing !! Loved it !! The land is lush and to die for ! The cabin is cozy and charming ! Thank y’all for having us !"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This vacation exceeded all my expectations! Such a beautiful setting and the cottage is beyond explanation – clean and artfully decorated to fit its surroundings perfectly. We traveled with a 3 and 1.5 year old and the pool was a big hit! Lars even took us around to see Lucky the pig, horses, chickens, and his beautiful farm. We’ll be returning ASAP for another quiet and relaxing weekend!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quite cottage in the woods u have found it!!! Safe and secluded, miles from the main towns. We loved our stay the cottage was cute, cozy and well stocked with everything u may need pulse it has a swimming pool!!!! My husband and I enjoyed ourselves the first night just unhooking from the world. The second night our kids joined us and we had an afternoon of swimming. We ended the night with beautiful thunderstorms across the Delta, which are some of God’s greatest masterpieces. We sat on the screened in porch listening to the rain and went to bed to the sights and sound of the thunderstorm thru the wallnof windows inside the cabin. Perfect weekend get away. U will not be sorry to book “the peacock”"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"From the bucolic view to the art, books , porches and comfy beds the cottage is one of the most charming Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. Very clean, just as pictured and great communication from Lars."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place on earth to relax and enjoy the beautiful nature and farm. They thought of everything in the cabin. We really enjoyed the farm, the horses, pig and swimming pool. We even stayed for 2 more nights than planned because we were already homesick. :) Spend a night or 2 here, you will love it!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at Lars' place twice. We stayed 2 nights longer because it was so beautiful and wonderful to be there!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage and surrounding area are unbelievably tranquil and we will be returning again soon. Lars was so accommodating, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was sparkling clean.
Note to out-of-towners/folks unfamiliar with the Mississippi Delta region: there are LOTS of LARGE BUGS, especially at dusk. We stayed in the beginning of June, so other times of the year it isn’t usually as “busy”, but don’t be surprised by lots of insects! That being said, Lars had some bug spray and a porch that was screened in which definitely helps."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is one of the most incredible places I've stayed using Airbnb. Such a calm and peaceful space. It's the perfect retreat and I was completely blown away by Lar's hospitality. I can't rave enough about what a dream the cabin and farm are and can't wait to come back for a longer stay.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We truly enjoyed the lodging and hospitality we received. The home was very comfortable and met all of our needs. We'll definitely share this treasure with others. Our only hesitancy was the entrance to the property. The brush leading to the property was a little overwhelming (I'm sure due to the amount rain that has fallen), but once we got beyond the brush, we felt as if we'd reached a small paradise."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an absolute dream. So incredibly peaceful and comfortable. The property was absolutely beautiful and really made you forget about the rest of the world. The cottage was very well decorated and well equipped with a little kitchen. Only thing I would note is that the cottage is just right across the yard from the owners house, so you are not completely secluded, but it didn’t bother us at all."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful host and wonderful place ❤️. Hopefully will return for a girls weekend to enjoy the pool and tennis court.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful cottage - perfect place to stay in the Delta! We will be back!
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay. The outdoors view was great and there was much to explore. The sunrise was amazing that morning we were leaving. It made me feel really good to be out in the country again.
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very special place in the middle of nowhere. The small house is located on a farm next to the owners house. It has a bed- / livingroom, a bathroom and a small kitchen. There is also a terrace were you can just sit down and relax a bit. As two sides of the house are nearly complete made out of windows, it gives you a very special feeling in the night. You feel like you are a part of the nature sourounding the house. Lars is a very nice guy who gives you a warm welcome. We recommend this airbnb and would come back everytime."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The MS Delta is such a unique place to visit. This was a great location and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I look forward to coming back!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was such a GREAT cozy place to stay
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Your hosts Lars and Kay are the definition of southern hospitality. Beautiful cottage and land that is a complete experience!
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars is an amazing host.
2019-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,The Delta Cottage was better than expected! Everything was so clean and very comfortable. I did stay in the cold winter/rainy month but I stayed warm with the nice linens and the heater in the bathroom helped a lot . The horses and wildlife are beautiful and super cool to watch and appreciate. I didn’t ride because of busy work schedule but I will certainly come back to take them up on it! Archie was super nice and helpful as well. Kitchenette is small but efficient and while I don’t read much the selection made me want to. There wasn’t any storage for clothes like dressers or closets but I found the hooks on the bathroom door and the front hanger hook very helpful. Luggage racks came in handy too! All in all I recommend anyone to come stay I was happy and very pleased with my stay!
2019-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome location, wish there was a lock on the door as you leave, if there’s been a rain your vehicle will get dirty and a you may have to trek a little way to the cottage, the heater wasn’t working properly so it got really cold, Lars gave Us a free night because of it, I would go again because it is a very Vibey place!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing place to stay if you're looking for a memorable and authentic Mississippi Delta experience. Incredible sight to wake up to... looking out over acres of picture perfect farmland. The accommodation is super cosy, friendly hosts... couldn't recommend it highly enough."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful place with a great host. If you try to make a big dinner, you may have difficulty in the very small kitchen. Live simple and eat simple... will be a good idea."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,By far the best place I've stayed so far
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin is picturesque. The windows are wonderful, the decoration in the cabin is eclectic and oh so pretty, and everything was clean! If you’ll be in the delta (anywhere from Cleveland, MS to Greenville, MS) I highly recommend!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A Transcendental experience in the Delta. Perfect in every way. Thanks Lars!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and cozy cabin
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quaint, charming, quiet place to get away, this is the perfect place."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Future travelers can expect very good hospitality, clean, quiet and comfortable."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re thinking about staying at Lars’ place then don’t hesitate, just go ahead and book it now! We had the most brilliant stay and are so sad that it could only be for just the one night.
The cottage is so peaceful with only the sound of wildlife all around. It’s beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking at all of the books on the bookshelves. The photos do not do this place justice!
Lars is such a great host and very kindly took us on a tour of the farm in the morning. We feel very lucky to have spent some time here and will be recommending it to friends if and when they pass through. One of our best air bnb experiences for sure.
Thank you so much Lars, we really hope we can come back one day.
James and Ester"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a special and uncommon place, do yourself a favor and book some time here."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Southern charm with solitude and character 💜 great place to relax and decompress from the hustle and bustle of everyday life ! You won’t be disappointed !
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peacock Cottage is such a beautiful place in the middle of one of our favorite places - the MS Delta. Clean, inviting and peaceful- with little touches that just say welcome all throughout!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lars' place is just as perfect as you would expect. My partner and I were looking for a quiet weekend away from the city and we found just that. Lars met us as we pulled up the driveway, was friendly and respectful from the start. The cabin is perfect for a few days away; it has a small kitchen with range, sink, mini-fridge, microwave, and a few pots/pans/utensils. The bathroom had clean towels and a new bar of soap, bath/shower, and a few board games in the closet. The linens were clean and the cabin itself was fresh and tidy. We watched the sun rise from the SW facing porch, strolled around Lars' cotton fields, swam in the pool, and enjoyed the night from the screened in porch. The cabin is full of windows so you feel outside even when the mosquitoes push you in. We saw thousands of stars and the Milky Way, and even on hot days, the nights were cool and breezy. If you're looking for a safe, quiet place to hide out in the Mississippi Delta, I couldn't recommend Lars' cottage more."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lars’ place was a wonderful respite on my way down to Texas from New Jersey. He was so gracious during the entire process as I had to arrive late and leave so early. I’m so sad I didn’t get to see the property during the day light— from what I could see it felt like a magical lush forest accompanied by the summer songs of crickets. So peaceful! The cottage itself was clean, cozy and the books were incredible selections. Like another reviewer said on here, I would definitely come back to spend some quality solo time to write.
Thanks again Lars for your hospitality and flexibility with my travel plans! Can’t wait to come back for the full experience!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you want a place to get away from a too busy world , this is the place. Very quaint, secluded , and peaceful . If you don’t like this place , I doubt that you would be happy anywhere!!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Magical location!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best place we have ever stayed in. The cottage is beautiful, set in a picturesque farm."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very special place. Worth a detour to spend a night at this gem of a place. Lars was an excellent host. Highly recommend!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars and his wife Cay created a little piece paradise- everything was perfect! Lars' warm welcome and constant attention to make our stay something unique made our stop in the Mississippi Delta a unique experience! We'll be back again. Katty Michel and Loïck
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The best of Airbnb!! Just returned from my second trip to the Delta Cottage in Shaw. Such a great experience!! Lars is an incredible host, and the Delta Cottage has so many thoughtful touches on a beautiful property in the Delta. Great for writing, reading, and quiet."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once we arrived, we viewed staying at the Peackock as a once in a lifetime experience. The pictures and descriptions do not do this place justice. Lars is such a great host and gave us a lot of information about surrounding areas and also the history of his wonderful farm. He took us in his 4 wheel drive and showed us buildings on his property that have true historical value, including a 1860 crop sharers store. That's the sort of building that you'd normally only see roped off on a tour.
Lars wife Cay gave me flowers on my birthday - a lovely gesture. Finn lived up to his celebrity status! Full of character and mischievousness.
The cabin was delightful and very clean with all the home comforts you need. The pool was a very welcome addition as it is very hot in June and we loved looking out to the fields whilst swimming in the cool water.
Cannot recommend this accommodation highly enough. We wish we could have stayed a lot longer."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful hidden jewel was just what I needed, it was centrally located to many small southern towns, restaurants, music and museums. Not enough time though, I do suggest at least a week to go to all the local hangouts for music, festivals, food and museums. They are within 30-40 miles from the cottage in the woods. The pool was great after a hot day riding with the top down. It was so quiet and peaceful . Just absolutely breathtaking scenery. Just needed more time. I will definitely be back and soon... Loved the dog Finn, he was a great companion. Lars was a fantastic host. Thank you!
Mary Kaye"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely cabin with a beautiful view. When I arrived, everything was neat and homey. Adorable decorations and the home, pool, and tennis court looked like it just belonged where it was at. The horses weren’t out when I got there. But, Archie, a helper, took me to see them my second day. Truly wonderful experience that left me feeling refreshed. Exactly as expected, with a few surprises like 2 rainbows, butterflies swimming around the pool, and lovely hydrangeas growing out front."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A utterly beguiling cottage in the heart of the Delta. The accommodations were lovely and the decor was whimsical and delightful. Our host was very communicative and helpful.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exceeded our expectations. Quiet and relaxing setting with a very hospitable host. Could not have asked for anything more.
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host. Very relaxing get away. Wish we could have stayed longer.
Loved relaxing by the pool during the day and watching the fire flies in the evening."
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Delta Cottage is a nicely hidden spot not far from Indianola and the B.B. King museum, for the real Blues lovers. However, keep in mind about a number of things:
- ask Lars in advance the access code to the gate, otherwise you cannot enter the property (and it takes an hour for you to get in, as we had);
- the pool is sometimes not usable, we were there at the end of May and there was unfortunately no water in it (while we had explicitly chosen the Delta Cottage because of the pool);
- it has windows all around, not all of which can be blinded, so that means you will be up very early;
- and bring all the food and drinks (water and for your breakfast on the porch, among other things) yourself."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully aesthetic little cabin, surrounded by meadows and interesting landscaping. Quiet. Could’ve hung out and read here for a week.
Lars was a thoughtful, attentive, and engaging host. A highlight of our visit.
Appreciated the good coffee that was provided in the morning, since it’s far from commercial areas."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay. Lars was very responsive. The location was convenient to a number of towns and was remote enough that I felt away from it all. I hope to be back!
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while in the area for a baseball tournament that was being held at Delta State University, which is less than 20 minutes away. This small cottage on the farm for my husband and me was just perfect. It was so peaceful and beautiful there, and much better than being stuck in a hotel room. Being on the farm surrounded by the horses, Lucky the pig, Finn the farm dog, and the croaking of the frogs was so relaxing. The kitchen is small, but is well equipped with everything we needed. We would eat breakfast each morning on the screen porch while listening to the sounds of nature around us. The cabin is very clean and nicely decorated, with a rustic touch. Lars was not there when we arrived, but he contacted us to make sure we had directions and everything we needed when we checked in. During our stay, Lars gave us a tour of the farm and told us about his future plans for growth, including a baseball field. We brought our bikes, and went riding on the farm trails one morning. His house is next door in case you need anything, but far enough away so you have privacy at the cottage. Staying here was definitely one of the highlights of our trip."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars’s place is amazing! It is way better than even the pictures show. It has a ton a great touches and is very well thought out. We even got to pet some horses that walked up in front of the cabin in the morning! Truly a one of a kind Airbnb experience!
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique place with a friendly host. Would be a little hard to find after dark but worth finding for its Peace, view, quiet, and nature all around. One of the best places we have happened upon on AirBnB!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"""And we all shine on"" - John Lennon The stars. Oh, how I loved the stars! This is a lovely getaway with plenty to do within a short drive. Clean with tons of touches and a great little library. Lars is a kind and attentive host, as is Fin. Thank you for sharing this space this with us."
2018-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The best kitchen amenities: an iron skillet & nesting Pyrex colored ceramic bowls!
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the most special place we've ever stayed at and we can't wait to go back. Lars wasn't their to receive us, but the communication was impeccable."
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I was surprised to arrive and find Lars working on the gate to his property. Rather than a typical check-in it was an interesting way to begin a month long journey. The cottage is perfect for a retreat or a brief respite on a journey. I spent a month there and immensely enjoyed the experience. The setting is unusual for it is not simply perfectly flat fields, sculpted and maintained for farming. It is a farm with gently rolling hills (for the Mississippi Delta), pasture, cultivated fields, and woodland. The cottage looks out on a pasture that is a peaceful and serene setting. Lars and Cay Ely are outstanding hosts and make your visit to Peacock a wonderful experience."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a little gem and the perfect way to escape the hustle and bustle! Situated between Indianola and Cleveland, it provided a great, central location for access to sites like th Grammy Museum and B.B. King Museum. The porch was the perfect spot for a cup of coffee and a beautiful Delta sunrise. Lars was just delightful. We will definitely be back!"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place— tucked in the Delta down a gravel drive about 1/4 mile. A darling light filled one room cabin with a front and back porch, gliders and comfy couches on both. Inside you have a seating area with two good size leather chairs, a little writing desk, a small kitchen and two perfectly appointed beds—and I am a sucker for a nice bed. Crisp sheets, down comforter, an easy-to-read-by light ... right up against giant windows displaying a magnificent thunderstorm. I woke the next morning to horses playfully scampering in the field, cardinals scratching at the ground, a fog lifting— or maybe not lifting. So the weather wasn’t perfect, but the stay was delightful. This place was on my radar by recommendation of a friend, but we booked at the last minute when we decided we didn’t want to drive any further that day. Lars responded immediately and got there to meet us right away. ( He actually lives right there but wasn’t home at the time.)
And as soon as we loaded the car to leave he appeared to see us off.
We weren’t there at a time for tennis or swimming, but yes! Both are right out your door.
A wonderfully peaceful respite. A few days here and I’m thinking I’d find myself writing the next southern novel... I would stay again."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Mississippi Delta cottage is a magical little spot with a gorgeous view of fields where horses roam. The cottage is comfortable and there are lovely thoughtful touches throughout. It would be an absolute dream in warmer weather with a pool and tennis court just outside as well as two porches to take in the view. Lars is an outstanding host and took us and our kids on a rip roaring tour of the farm which involved a swamp tour, picking pecans and turnip greens, petting horses and the pet pig and all round fun. Lars and family are lovely and generous and left us with a strong desire to come back as soon as we possibly can."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin and setting were perfect for a quick getaway.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the dreamiest place in the world. I really wish I had more time there. Would love to go back in the warmer months. Lars and his family were so sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. The house was perfect and everything was so thoughtfully designed.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lars 's place is a great place for a getaway. The scenery is nice and the cottage is excellent with a lot of extra touches. We enjoyed our one night stay.
2017-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a gorgeous, rural cabin, and it is absolutely worth the drive. We loved our stay and hope to be back."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The pictures of this BNB don't do it any justice. The view is breath taking! The horses are amazing and Lars' dog was very welcoming! The cabin is clean and has a great personality. Would love to stay again.
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you’re thinking of renting this cottage, do it. One of the magical places I’ve been. My children loved it. We will be back!"
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to get away from a busy life. Makes you stop and realize there is more to life. Enjoyed the sunsets and sunrises. Will never get over Gods beauty. Blessed to experience this
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A nice place in the heart of a thriving farm in Delta...
It was very clean, well maintained, and equipped with everything you need for your stay, and the host, Lars, generously gave us a tour around his farm and explained his business and its story."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place to stay! I wish I was able to stay longer.
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved it and so did our 1yr old little girl. The cottage was clean, and cozy. It was exactly what us city folks needed."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a bit of William Faulkner. ...
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful respite on our vacation. When Lars tells you you will want to stay for at least two nights, he is telling the truth! It was such a tranquil spot, the horses were lovely, and FINN is the friendliest dog. We truly enjoyed our stay, once it cooled off. It was a HOT day to begin with."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for an out of the way perfectly appointed accommodation this is the place for you. As a bonus you'll meet Finn - the cutest little Jack Russel terrier. Sit on your back porch and gaze out on the ""back 40"" and watch the horses cavort. You're 15 minutes from Indianola or Cleveland. The kitchen is small but functional, the beds HUGE. Lars wasn't there the first couple of days of our stay but the minor start up problems we had were solved quickly by text and once he came back Lars took us on a tour of the farm and explained his plans for developing the property. Very ambitious but that's the kind of guy he is. Rest assured that if you book you will have a stay to remember."

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The condo was clean and it was a nice area to relax. We enjoyed our stay, but the condo needs a few repairs and upgrades. Also, we didn’t like that we had to park on the street but it wasn’t very busy on that weekend so it all worked out."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful quiet apartment. We enjoyed our stay very much .
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Perfect for attending a swim meet at DSU. Clean, affordable, and comfortable."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is legit! Building is easy to find and get into and the location is the best in the delta. Our favorite spot to stay in Cleveland, especially during the “Cleveland Christmas light” time!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Matt's Place was great aside from the Stairs... Elevators was broken.
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,We would of gave and excellent sorry had the elevator had been working.
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place for someone who does not mind walking up several flights of stairs and finding parking as there is no designated parking and the tenants of the business left stickies on my car asking me not to park in public parking spots. There are also several condo restrictions, i.e. quiet hours from 10 pm to 10 am; the 1 day the elevator did work, it didn't work from 10 pm - 10 am. It was not ideal walking up 4 flights of stairs several times a day for two individuals in their late fifties with one with knee issues. Had we known everything upfront, we would have considered other options. The elevator still did not work on the last day requiring us to use the stairs to carry our luggage out."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice place. Would stay again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Just suit all we needed!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! As described. Matt was great to deal with.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,To much work getting in and out gate
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great apartment right off of cotton row! It had easy access and had a great view of downtown.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Matt was very responsive when I asked for things. I would definitely come back. The two bathrooms for two rooms was a good way to keep things private as we had four people.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"I have only stayed in AirBnBs in Europe previously. This was my first US experience. It may be usual in the US but there was no ‘welcome pack’ with some basic foodstuffs, nor non-perishable foodstuffs from previous clients. Fridge was totally empty. In Europe you would find commonly used items like cooking oil etc.
However, on a more positive note, when I enquired re. extension on 10am checkout, Matt was very accommodating which was much appreciated.
Netflix on the TV, which was great.
Condo was very comfortable for 2 people- it might be a bit tight for 4 as there is one armchair & one couch in sitting room area.
Location downtown was super 😊"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very secure area. Clean and nice/comfy furniture. In “downtown” area of this small town, very pleasant"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and decent place. As described! The elevator was pretty unreliable and the door didn’t open a couple of times but that is obviously no fault of Matt’s
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice location. Elevator was old and slow. Furniture old and dated but the beds was very comfortable
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and clean

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay, peace and quiet, and a place of comfortability then book this Airbnb you at the right spot! We enjoyed ourselves felt like we are we're at our own homes and was able to get in and out and feel comfortable! You can't go wrong staying here!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time at the unit. Great comfortable place in a great location.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great place nice & clean comfy .. located in heart of everything .. Walking distance to restaurants.. ice cream shop right next door .. Easy check in process. Enjoyed my stay Thanks Matt
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location of your planning to stay in Cleveland, MS. This place was very clean and local to everything! I will be checking for availability for future trips."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Downtown Cleveland is very nice. Joes Burger was one of my favorite places to eat. The walking path right out front of the building is very nice and a great walk.
The apartment is nice and quite but kind of bland without the decorations that a lot of the Airbnb’s I have stayed at. The building is older so remember to walk soft.
Kitchen has everything you need and so did the bathrooms. If you are staying for a length of time you might want to use a rolling cart to carry your stuff up to the apartment for the distance from parking to the apartment is not that far but everyone likes to save some trips.
Local cable was great too!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This unit is just as advertised. Secure, clean, and comfortable. It’s the Best location in town."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great AirBnB! Best location in town. Everything was clean and so comfortable. 10/10 would recommend!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place and host would stay again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed this property! Matt was a great communicator.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in one of Matt's AirBnB's before, and as always, we felt very comfortable and found the apartment clean, roomy, and overall a wonderful place to stay. Matt was very flexible and accommodating, as well. We love the historic downtown with plenty of cute and local shops. You MUST visit Zoe's Coffee Shop and The Delta Christian Bookstore nearby."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for quick access to downtown. Cozy and comfortable. Matt was a great host. This is the second condo of his my mom has stayed in and we highly recommend.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was a very nice place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AirBnB will only let me write a review if I leave stars. So, I fibbed with some of the stars, but only because my travel plans changed, and I did not go to Cleveland. My experiences with Matt, though, were all very positive. Communicates quickly and professionally. Understood my situation. I may return to Cleveland soon; if so, I will try to book Matt's place again."
,,,We where in town for a surprise Birthday party and was very late due to the water being turned off and we had to go to another place to take showers and get dressed
,,,Do not stay here- the host will accuse you of eating her food. She yelled at me on the phone that I ate her ribeye steaks which is impossible as I don't eat beef. We brought our own food but mostly ate at our family reunion. Look out of a crazy host.
,,,"Do not book!
There is no elevator and the apartment is on the 4th floor. The stairs look like something from a horror film, they are old, dusty and had trash everywhere. They handwrote the floor numbers on each door with a pencil. The building looks abandoned and very unsafe. You must enter the back door, but to get to the back door you need to walk through the gated parking lot that you cannot park in. Parking for Air BNB guess is on the street and unsafe.
Do not book!"
,,,"This is a very lovely unit if you want to reside in the library or a retirement community. This isn't a place for young and energetic people,especially with children as any type of noise would be an issue for some. Great place to write a novel and ponder about life."
