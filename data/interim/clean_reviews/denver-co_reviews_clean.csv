2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying here. Gorgeous forrest surroundings but not so remote that things are hard or far to get to. We visited CO to see a concert at Red Rocks and this was a 20-ish min drive to the venue which we were fine with for the chance to stay in a unique and gorgeous spot in the woods. The host was incredibly friendly too! Great stay all around.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very relaxing stay at the dome! It snowed nearly the whole time we were there and it was so cozy and nice. The sauna was amazing and the hosts were kind enough to preheat it for us before we arrived. Overall, a lovely retreat from the city."

My boyfriend and I were welcomed with clear arrival instructions and the hosts had the sauna heating up for us in advance at our request. Such a cute, cozy, romantic spot to spend the evening!

The fireplace and space heaters made the dome cozy in no time and the unique amenities like the sauna and compost toilet were a breeze to figure out.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was the perfect stop on my road trip into the mountains. An incredibly adorable glamping experience! It's pretty close to the Red Rocks and was a beautiful place to rest after the show before moving on to my next stop!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This little glamping tent was the perfect getaway to feel like you're camping, but in style! Surrounded by trees and the prettiest views through the see-through windows all around the tent we had the most serene, peaceful stay! Perfect location if you're needing a place to stay near Red Rocks and don't want your typical hotel."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and myself chose this place for a girls' weekend staycation. It was easy to find and in a beautiful location (only 2 minutes away from Maxwell Falls trailhead!) Incredibly peaceful and serene. Perfect for our retreat from society!
Johnny & Dana were highly communicative and got back to me within minutes of any inquiries.
I thought having the owners close to us would be a bit weird, but it ended up not even being a thing! It was restfully quiet outside. The amenities were exactly what we needed, and Johnny & Dana even set up an extra mattress so we wouldn't have to sleep together in bed! The sheets, pillows, and comforters were amazingly warm, and the radiant heaters were the right amount of heat for the cool fall evenings.
The internet speed was perfect for streaming Netflix. All in all, a beautiful property that I wish I could go to every month!! :) Thank you so much, Johnny & Dana, for allow us into your space to escape and decompress from the stressors of society"

A must try !"

The host‚Äôs home was closer than expected, but that‚Äôs my fault‚Ä¶I read it in their description but I‚Äôm not very good at gauging distance. And at the end of the day, it wasn‚Äôt an issue. Overall, perfect little getaway with my partner."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a magical spot! Dana and Johnny have done such a wonderful job with the dome. It was such a unique stay, and everything in there was put together so beautifully. Very clean and tidy. It was equipped with pretty much everything you would need. You felt very tucked away and cozy. Staring at the stars through the dome at night was dreamy. It's very close to a few beautiful hikes, and we fell in love with the area and town. Had a very nice dinner out and loved exploring Conifer, Evergreen, and surrounding area. We would definitely come back."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My mini-Aussie + I stayed for a week and were ready to move in for good. This place is an absolute dream to shut your mind off and become one with nature again. Including all the hiking possibilities, it‚Äôs not only your mental health that will improve during your stay.
The dome provides everything that you need and is exactly as shown in the images. I was lucky enough to experience the dome/skylight during a day of rain and thunderstorms! Even though I could have used my iPad to watch movies, I never had the desire to do so.
No rain? There‚Äôs still a creek running by the dome which provides a soothing sound while enjoying the hammock & the sun, or while using the provided grill to prepare dinner.
The hosts are incredibly friendly (as well as their dog) and welcoming. Even when I needed a tire gage, they did not hesitate to come through for me. They also provided me with spots where to hike, as well as get groceries and such.
My puppers & I will definitely coming back soon. Thanks!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly, HIGHLY, recommend this wonderful getaway! Definitely want to stay again. Was a very peaceful glamping experience and great for anyone who would like to camp but maybe doesn‚Äôt have the equipment or doesn‚Äôt want to go all into the camping experience."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an absolutely amazing experience! I‚Äôm very thankful I had the chance to stay in such a beautiful and unique place! The owners are incredibly friendly and helpful and I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to disconnect and be surrounded by nature. It honestly was incredible and I would 100% do it again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was every bit what we expected and more. Peaceful, beautiful, clean, and all the amenities we needed. Thank you for an awesome stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful stay! Beautiful setting, wonderfully clean, peaceful with the sound of the stream running running by.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay! definitly one of the best clamping experiences I've ever had. the stars were amazing.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Jeff‚Äôs teepee and we had the best time. It was easy to find and had everything we needed.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay, responsive hosts, exactly what you hope for from an AirBnB. Thank you guys!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place
Secluded and peaceful
Easy to get into and the bedding smelled freshly washed.
The rain prevented us from staying the full night since we couldn‚Äôt heat the place up with the gas put inside the tent. But overall, we would love to come back and enjoy it during the summer! Horses and beautiful views all around!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a unique and fun spot! Just as pictured and peaceful. Even though temps dropped down to 50 overnight it stayed surprisingly comfortable inside!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, would recommend this place to anyone!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at this location. While a storm prevented us from being able to use the outdoor fire pit we were able to hang out on the hammock for a while before retreating inside. It was very cozy and the indoor fire pit was easy to use and kept us warm. It was comfortable and clean and very peaceful with the occasional sounds from the horses or roosters nearby. We definitely enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a perfect pick for a last minute overnight getaway to celebrate my wife and I‚Äôs 18th wedding anniversary. The campsite was clean, ready and exactly what we were looking for. This was definitely a hidden gem only 45 min from home. We will be back for sure!
As a bonus, I woke up early to hear the faint sounds of lions roaring in the distance. Yes, I forgot it would be close to the wild animal sanctuary in Keensburg. I felt like we were literally waking in Africa this morning. We had a good laugh and yes actual went to the sanctuary the next day to see who was calling! Just added a little more excitement to our TeePee glamping experience! Thank you Ted and Erica for everything!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described. It even rained heavy on and off and it was honestly even better! The sound of the rain inside the teepee is magical.
I was worried about airplane/highway/work on the ranch noise being an issue but it was not at all. Perfect getaway. Would 10000% recommend and have already shared the unit listing with friends. Thank you for a perfect night."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Teds place was adorable and a great little get away from the city! Nothing will beat the sitting around watching the stars all night.
2023-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"The place was beautiful and very relaxing. We were prepared for bugs & outdoors, not a big deal for us. We love the outdoors!
The winds were VERY high that night which caused issues with the tent. It wasn't tied down enough so began to lift and move from winds. We had checked weather before booking but didn't say about winds. Ended up sleeping in our car.
If you book, just make sure to check the weather.
Otherwise definitely recommend staying for the experience and how beautiful creation is at the place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really great experience, I'd like to come back. Beautiful location and a lovely teepee. During my one night there was an awesome thunderstorm but I was perfectly dry and warm in the bed.
A word of advice to travelers: the mosquitoes can get inside at night time, though they weren't too bad. Also, planes can pass quite close even in the middle of the night so light sleepers might want to bring earplugs."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for the experience.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cute little teepee! Bring bug spray

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was awesome with the tepee. I would definitely stay here again. I do feel the cleaning fee is a bit high for only changing linens but otherwise a great place to stay
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a wonderful weekend get away near Denver! Great way to escape! Very peaceful and relaxing and had everything listed
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful space. So cozy and peaceful. The whole area that you‚Äôre given is everything you need to disconnect.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My 10 year and I came a night while visiting some friends. It was a great experience to sleep in a teepee. It was very clean, and the bathroom was spotless. My only wish is that there was another one, so my husband and older son could share in the fun."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, easy to find, and exactly as described. Don't forget your bug spray!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the most unique experiences I‚Äôve ever done. It was so cool to stay in a tepee! The rain against the teepee made it all worth it despite the weather, along with an amazing lightning show after a sunset. Dozens of horses to pet nearby and it felt very welcoming. You get all sorts of nature sounds and a camping feel with grilling and a fire."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Deko ranch is located not far from Denver, but you‚Äôd never know it. We were surprised at how quickly the bustle of the city faded away, giving way to vast farmland, beautiful homes, lots of cows, and the last stretch of the drive was even on a dirt road (but well graded, easy for any vehicle). The ranch has easy signage pointing us to the teepee. We didn‚Äôt see the hosts, but the privacy was nice. We had our own little access to the creek, fire pit, hammock, and picnic table. The weather was perfect, even when it started raining after sunset. The patter of droplets on the canvas was so peaceful and we drifted off to sleep in the cozy bed."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay at the tee pee! Highly recommended. The hosts were extremely gracious and quick to respond! They have thought of everything. BBQ, hammock, outdoor fire pit, indoor fire pit was the best addition, very clean bathroom with lights for night, tiki torches! We loved visiting the horses and enjoyed the stars. It is in the flight path of DIA so we did get some airplane traffic all night but did not deter our stay! The teepee is decorated so cute! Quick trip from Denver, it made for a perfect quick get away!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Teepee had all the necessary to make the best of the experience. The gas grill was nice to cook dinner at sunset, surrounded by horses and cows. Great glamping experience!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Erica was amazing! S√∫per communicative from the moment we got there! Exactly as advertised, they literally have all of the essentials for you (just basic stuff though, like a grill, plenty of wood for the fire, the cleanest porta potty I‚Äôve ever been in AND you can wash your hands in a tiny built in sink) we did bring coolers with drinks and food. But overall it was a perfect dreamy romantic getaway. definitely booking again in the future ‚ù£Ô∏è"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great quiet getaway.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted has an incredible property. You drive directly through the barn seeing all the horses and cows. We strolled through the barn area at sunset to say hi to the horses before coming back to start a fire and cook dinner. The teepee was spotless and cool at night. You will want some warm clothes late at night/early morning. Although it didn‚Äôt matter to us, the creek is very dirty and smelly. We discovered this after our dog tried to jump in. Overall, the stay was absolutely perfect!
We will be coming back. Thank you Ted!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at the TP! We brought two pack n plays for our kids to sleep in and it fit them both perfectly. Great place for a day trip or a quick get away. The horses on the property were very friendly and the hosts were kind enough to let our kids pet them (several times).
There was a porter potty behind the TP which was very clean and convenient. No outlets of course so if you need a charger bring a portable one!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A slice of country heaven! This place is pure tranquility and nostalgic. I will absolutely be coming again.
Thanks for the opportunity to unplug!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was my second stay and I really enjoy it. You are definitely living in Indian country with some upgrades :-). The bed was soft and the indoor fire ring kept the teepee warm on a chilly night. I will definitely stay again.

Ted and Erica have created such a comfortable stay that you don‚Äôt even realize that you‚Äôre ‚Äúcamping‚Äù. You have everything you need and more.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fun place to stay! The location was great, very quiet and secluded. It‚Äôs far enough away from owners home that you don‚Äôt feel too close. Loved hearing the animals and lounging on the comfy bed. They had a very clean portapotty behind the tipi so there‚Äôs not a long walk to the barn bathroom. Super fun!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tipi was a super cool spot! It ended up being too warm for us to stay and would have been nice to have a fan of some kind. We knew we were signing up for ""glamping"" though! In the cooler months this would be an amazing and cozy spot! The hosts were great to communicate with and very understanding."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place! Wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fun experience for one night.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very unique and peaceful experience here. Comfortable bed, lots of amenities inside, and so cool to see the horses nearby on the property. We came in the summer so the little stream nearby wasn't really moving at all, but it was still a very relaxing atmosphere."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Teepee! It was great waking up with the horses and the birds. I would recommend staying at the Teepee!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great!!!! It‚Äôs not enough space for 4 ( was 2 adults and 2 kids) but if it 2 persons it very comfortable. Thank you
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything as advertised the perfect peaceful getaway!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful. You are nowhere near anyone else camping or glamping. Loved the baby bull!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magical glamping experience! Very peaceful and private atmosphere by the creek.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted‚Äôs place was great! It was 100 degrees when during our stay so if you‚Äôre staying in the summer, a battery operated fan might be nice to bring! Great location. Near stores, gas stations, restaurants, liquor store etc. stars were beautiful at night."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous property & only 15 minutes to Barr Lake and Brighton. Sunrises and sets were our favorite parts. Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The teepee is set apart from the ranch so is very private, and looks amazing. The interior is as shown in the pictures - very instagramable! We didn't have enough firewood so Ted very kindly brought us more as well as extra gas for the inside fire. Having a campfire in the middle of nowhere was great, and we really enjoyed seeing the animals on the ranch.
The only downside of the teepee is that it has lots of places for bugs to get in - through the roof, the door, the floor etc, so we had loads of flies inside in the evening and in the morning we were woken up by mosquitoes buzzing around our heads. If you can mitigate the flies or they don't bother you then this is the perfect getaway :)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the greatest Airbnb we have ever stayed at!!!! It is so incredibly cool, Ted is super cool, and so are his animals. They had some baby cows when we stayed, as well as miniature horses. Can‚Äôt describe how fun it was to stay here. 1000/10"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute little getaway spot close to Denver.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The teepee was really comfy inside and stayed surprisingly warm even on a colder, rainy night. The location on the farm is very serene and we would've definitely taken advantage of sitting around and enjoying it more if the weather had been drier. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others looking for a peaceful getaway that's only a short drive from Denver."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The reviews are true! Great place. Bring a battery operated fan if your staying during a hot week though.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great relaxing weekend away!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a fun and unique place to stay. We went to the Wild Animal Sanctuary which is just a few minutes from the teepee and had a great time seeing all the animals! We enjoyed the outdoor firepit and star gazing as well!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I would recommend bringing a fly swat and a lighter for the amenities and the flys that are present during the day

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute place. Thanks!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As advertised. Fun way to spend a night.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This ranch is simply beautiful. The teepee is very comfortable, and was almost like staying in a hotel. Expect your the only one there, very secluded. Our first time ‚Äúglamping‚Äù and we highly recommend it!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted, Erica and DeKo Ranch are such a delight. The unique stay creates a great experience but the little details and touches the hosts gave to the space, along with the location are extremely special!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A true gem that allows you to truly escape - friendly hosts, elegant teepee, serene setting."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to ""glamp,"" exactly as described!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love this property. The owners are super nice and accommodating. The animals are so cute, especially the cat! Loved sausage! I definitely hope to come back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely fantastic! Our kids loved it and loved exploring the property. The teepee was plenty big for a family of four.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a perfect get away. There are not amenities provided than you would expect. Bathrooms were very clean and felt even more open and relaxing than in the pictures. I would say to follow their directions to a T, as the GPS is not great at getting you there."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful experience! Cannot recommend this AirBnB enough. Very clean and comfortable and they even added a portapotty right behind the teepee so you dont have to wall to the barn. Potty was very clean no odor at all.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great getaway place to stay! So beautiful and very clean!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Farm is a on cute! Loved all the animals.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted‚Äôs place was magical! What a fun way to get away from it all! We saw horses, cows, turtles, frogs, and so many different types of birds! It was very cool to be so close to nature without sacrificing comfort! The teepee was very comfortable and everything we needed was provided - even pre-cut fire wood! I‚Äôd highly recommend staying here!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was very unique than any other airbnbs. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very easy to get to. I was hoping we would get then sooner than we did but still I loved it. I didn‚Äôt know my phone wouldn‚Äôt have a signal so the only thing I wanted to ask for was the bbq lighter so I could light the gas heater in the tee-pee but I‚Äôm sure they would have responded if I could have gotten through.
My boyfriend and I sat outside to eat dinner and watch the sunset where I asked him to marry me and he said ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù
After dinner it got much colder and super windy. So we decided to head into the tee-pee. Luckily we were told to pack for the weather so I brought 2 comforters and a blanket. As we played Yahtzee we could hear the wind picking up but we were surprised we couldn‚Äôt feel a thing. By the time we woke up sleeping to the sounds of nature had been so relaxing but quite chilly in the morning so it was smart for us to bring the extra blankets. Thank you Ted for an overall really successful and perfectly enjoyable night.
Next time we will definitely have to stay a few nights instead of just one. üòä"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a fun, memorable experience this was! We very much enjoyed our night in the tepee. There were many little thoughtful touches-- from the twinkle lights to the extra sleeping bags. It DID get chilly overnight! We went in mid-October, so be prepared with warm clothes. Top notch destination for a little getaway!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice teepee behind horse stables to get away from the city and relax.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You absolutely must see this. The tepee is beautiful and incredible. A very unique experience that I‚Äôm glad is offered. Ted is great. Fast communication and very helpful. The animals on the ranch are cool to see as well.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique and beautiful experience! The teepee is charming, with all kinds of little special touches (candles, cards, fire pit, twinkle lights). Comfy bed.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very unique experience! The space was quite large and stylishly decorated. Easy to find and pretty quiet (some plane noise at night but not bad). The port a potty was super clean. It was a cold night and got a little chilly once we turned off the gas fire pit but we had extra blankets with us. Beautiful sunset over the Rockies in the distance!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful open space farm with lovely horses roaming around
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The teepee was amazing! Ted did a great job in providing driving directions and directions for how to operate everything in the teepee. My only complaint is that we only stayed there for one night!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The definition of peace & serenity. Sunrises at this farm are unrivaled. The creek, horses, and fresh air add to the calm presence of the stay.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ted's place is amazing. The perfect way to spend a night outdoors without the hassle of having to pack up and set up your own camping gear! My wife and I spent our 4th anniversary here and love it. The Teepee is wonderfully cozy, the bed is comfortable, bbq grill worked great, etc. etc. Highly recommend!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a fun experience!!!! This place is in the cutest ranch with horses and more! The teepe is so much bigger than I thought and the fire inside was amazing! We loved staying here and the experience itself was great!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This teepee was so amazing to stay in. It was so quaint, clean, cozy, quite, peaceful, absolutely amazing!!! I love the location being out in the country with access to the mountains. The farm is beautiful, the horses are so sweet! My four year old LOVED it! I wish we were in town longer but we will be back for sure! The hosts were so informative and hospitable. There weren‚Äôt any issue with bugs, the porta-potty was nice and clean with hand sanitizer. The location was great! Not far from the airport, about 40 minutes from Boulder and 30 from Denver! I highly recommend!!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Better than expected! Great hospitality-went above and beyond. We enjoyed playing horseshoe and uno! The fire pit inside was super cozy.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautifully decorated teepee! The inside fire was nice at night to warm up!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hands-down the most unique Airbnb I've ever had the chance to stay at. The teepee was warm, cozy, and comfortable. We had everything we needed to enjoy a relaxing stay and unplug for a little while. The ranch itself is beautiful and it was a joy to walk around and see all the animals."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was something straight out of a novel! The teepee was better than expected with beautiful stylish touches. It was pretty amazing our stay that we encountered a Summer Snow Storm and the tepee and surrounding area was covered in a blanket of white snow and made everything that much more beautiful! Just like a winter wonderland. I highly recommend this place for a fun and different stay.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Secluded, peaceful and romantic. We loved it!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a unique experience you will never forget. If you have binoculars or a telescope bring it with. The stars a plentiful at night. The bed was clean and comfortable and there were plenty of lanterns/lights inside the teepee. Highly recommend this experience if you want to camp in style.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my second time here and I plan to come back again in the future!!!! Such a fun and unique experience.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a great night out of the city in the tee pee! Highly recommended
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This. Place. Is. So. Cute. Situated in the middle of a horse ranch you are in for an eclectic retreat away from the hustle and bustle. We celebrated our third wedding anniversary here and couldn‚Äôt have been happier. We spent the day playing horseshoes (provided by the host), drinking wine, and walking around the property. At night we used the grill that was provided to make a fancy dinner under the stars. The bed was super comfy and the fire pit was cozy. We loved our getaway and will absolutely be returning!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Ted's tipi was beautiful and unforgettable. We couldn't get over how perfect and minimal the structure was. Then, just a short walk away from the tipi are horses. A few things to keep in mind, and it's nitpicking at this point, is that there were a lot of flies that found their way into the tipi during our stay. Also, no service so make sure to get your messages sent before you arrive. But that comes with the territory so no worries if you're prepared. If you're looking for a unique and picturesque stay, look no further. This is the place!"
2020-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the teepee. Even with fire ban in effect there was plenty to do and the location has a lot to offer! Definitely fun and memorable.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and comfortable place. The bed was wonderful and the bathroom was beautiful.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very enjoyable stay and would recommend, thank you so much!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of our very favorite Airbnb stays. The basement apt is really welcoming, nicely outfitted and decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable. The location is perfect for a Denver stay. There wasn't anywhere we wanted to venture that was more than 30 minutes from our Airbnb. Our trip was very brief but we will be visiting Denver again and we will surely book this Airbnb again."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great location. The host was not super responsive. Every message he sent seemed automated. I did not love that there was no way to lock the door to the unit (beyond the shared access door) when I was not present.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding location, plenty of privacy, very clean, very comfortable bed. would highly reccomend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very cute and comfortable place. the location was perfect for me and the hosts were wonderful.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable accommodations for two people. Great king bed. Nice having two T.V.s. Only suggestion - my husband would like a toaster. Thanks
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall good stay , friendly and responsive host ! We definitely stay again if I go back that way"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Easy to find. Quick communication. Nice quieter area but still close to Denver excitement. Walk at sloans lake was nice too!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phillip's place is a great spot to stay while in Denver! The pictures on the site don't do it justice--it feels so new and bright and clean for a basement apartment. It was a perfect, cozy spot to come back to after a day of exploring Denver and the mountains. I would highly recommend it!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phillips place was just as described and what we needed for our two night stay. From the bathroom, living area and bedroom, everything was immaculate. Phillip did advise they adopted a puppy recently and to be aware of noise but we had zero issues and didn‚Äôt even hear him above us.
My husband and I really enjoyed how close the Airbnb was to local restaurants and breweries. Phillip provided a very nice list of locations nearby too. We walked as much as we could and tried local spots nearby. Rise and Shine Kitchen is a must visit and only 3 minute walk from the Airbnb!
The only heads up I would give if you‚Äôre considering this spot is the bathroom shower ceiling is quite low. Both my husband and I are tall and didn‚Äôt have an issue as we had a few inches of headspace to spare. I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre over 6‚Äô3‚Äù, it might be too low."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place. perfect for a small group looking for a good spot near Denver.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice. Close to the city and attractions, food, etc."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, great location and wonderful experience all around!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We converted our basement into an AirBnB apartment and selected Phillip + Cortney's place, in part, to see how they did theirs. We were very impressed. It's thoughtfully designed and much larger than pictured, with divisions between rooms for multiple guests. The bed is so comfortable I'm still dreaming about it and we bathed in the cozy jacuzzi tub every day. Noise from upstairs puppy is inevitable but rare. Earplugs are provided and only necessary if trying to sleep during late afternoon.
Along with exceptionally clean digs, ample storage + great lighting (lamps! dimmers!), the hosts offer great local suggestions, fun board games, and an intuitive code for easy check-in + late-night returns. Phillip even texted a discounted ride-share option for New Year's Eve, although getting in/out of central city was easy and parking was always accessible. We especially enjoyed the walkable neighborhood of attractive homes + gardens and nearby Sloans Lake. We hope to stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite stays we have had in Denver! We definitely plan to look for this place again! With the size, ease of checking in/out, the location, and great hosts this place is worth its value!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! Both the bedroom and living room have doors on them which really helped make the place feel multi-functional and comfortable. The king bed is very comfortable and the kitchenette was stocked with coffee and games! We would love to return.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here! We drove into town early and Phillip was kind enough to let us check in 1.5 hours early, it was extremely helpful and gave us time to have a nap after a long drive. The place is cozy, clean, and inviting. They have a cute pup we loved giving pets to, she was very well behaved and we didn‚Äôt hear her bark. I would recommend this place to anyone! Thanks for letting us stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location and spacious basement apartment.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I had an absolutely wonderful time on our trip to the area and this apartment was definitely a highlight! It's located in a lovely neighborhood. Our stay was so peaceful and we felt very safe and at ease in the space. We only had one minor hiccup with heating that took our host less than a couple minutes to respond to and fix even though it was evening when we'd reached out. We were so impressed with every bit of our stay and the hosts and can't recommend them highly enough!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at the location. It was clean and spacious. Perfect and close place to stay for a weekend spent close to the Downtown region of Denver. I would highly recommend staying there. P.S. They have a very sweet puppy!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect stay. There were box fans at our disposal which was AMAZING for me cause I gotta have that white noise! Nice entertainment area with plenty of board games to choose from. The bed was actually comfortable which I always find so hard to find staying with airbnbs, so that was a huge plus! Loved the bathroom and the little window to let in the cool air when taking a nice hot bath after hiking all day. It was great y‚Äôall."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Was perfect for me and my wife. Close to our family members we visited.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful stay at Phillip‚Äôs basement Airbnb! The space was very nicely designed and decorated, the entire apartment was roomy and clean, the bed was VERY comfortable, and the apartment was filled with lots of thoughtful extras (like a selection of extra chargers, a cooling tower for the bedroom [in case you want your room extra chilly], night lights, games, etc.). I would definitely seek out Phillip‚Äôs house again if I find myself visiting Denver in the future. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to stay here, I also recommend the Rise and Shine Biscuit brunch spot around the corner and Edgewater Pizza a few blocks away‚Ä¶YUM!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful neighborhood! The basement was easily accessible , the bed was super comfy after a long night, and the bathroom was glorious! The kitchenette was very handy! Host has great communication!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Philips place was great. Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. Thanks for hosting!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my 2nd time staying at Phillips place . I felt right at home and everything that you need is included. He has a great place and I would recommend it to everyone.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay clean.comfy and good location will stay there again
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved my stay at Phillip's place. It felt like walking int home away from home. The space is completely separate and private. The bedroom is massive and the king bed was so comfy! The bathroom is super chic and all the amenities and toiletries available were an added bonus! The kitchenette wasn't used much, but it is well-equipped. Love the separate living room area with a big TV and multiple couches. Tons of games to choose from if you have time to enjoy them! It's a great base to come home to and pretty easy/quick access to downtown Denver (it took maybe 15min to get to Union Station in the morning) and 20-25min to/from Red Rocks. Would absolutely stay here again!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive host. The basement apartment accommodated a tall individual and held up nicely during one of the largest rain/thunderstorms Denver has received in years.
The decor provided an atmosphere comfortable enough to stay inside, and the location was close enough to walk to public transportation or a few local spots. The layout was great for individuals and would work well for small groups as the space is pleasantly divided up."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay, and we highly recommend it! The space was huge, with everything accurately represented. It was also very clean and welcoming when we arrived. Arrival was easy, and the host checked in during our stay to make sure everything was going smoothly. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this Airbnb."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cleanest Airbnb I've ever stayed in, to the point that I felt comfortable taking a bath (it has jets!). There were two different controls for the temperature (bedroom and living room); I like to sleep with it really cold, so it was great to be able to adjust the settings for just that room. The place is incredibly spacious‚Äîmore so than the pictures make it seem.
Phillip and Cortney were super responsive‚Äîwhen a smoke alarm battery started to chirp, they had it fixed and replaced within 15 minutes of me letting them know.
One note for light sleepers is that this is a basement apartment and there isn't much soundproofing. I could hear phones vibrate from text messages and music from the upstairs living room (which seems to be right above the bedroom). I was traveling by myself and was happy to put in my AirPods, but couples who don't want a lot of background noise might want to keep this in mind.
Would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! The basement apt. was gorgeous and very clean. It‚Äôs obvious that Phillip & Cortney put a lot of thought into the space! The neighborhood was quiet, and it was an easy drive into downtown Denver. If I travel to the Denver area again, this place would be my first choice. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great spot! Super spacious and looked very modern/stylish. One thing is that the 4-5 stairs down to the basement are steep but there is a hand rail. The jacuzzi bathtub was the best feature of the place!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The bed was good and the shower great.
The only problem I had in getting in was in how to open the gate, and I was able to figure it out rather quickly. Just lift the gate slightly as you open it and there is no problem. The house was easy to find, just a block off a Main Street.
Stores are less than a mile away, and there is bus service both north and south and cross town.
I would stay there again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phillip was a great host and the rental was wonderful. The bed was absolutely amazing and the whole place was immaculate and super comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space and location was perfect and matched the listing. Had privacy but also appreciated the quick responses when I had questions or updates. Bed was so comfortable and the water pressure was amazing! Highly recommend and would definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phillip's place was extremely nice, comfortable, and spacious - more than you might think from the photos. It had all the amenities we could have wanted, including coffee machine, white noise machine, games, extra blankets, toiletries... And a whole separate living area with kitchenette and sofas in addition to the spacious bedroom. Everything was pristine and beautifully finished. Phillip was very clear and friendly in communication. 5 stars! Thank you Phillip!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phillip was super nice and his place was fabulous! We were impressed by how clean and spacious it was. It felt like a hotel room but better!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phillip was a wonderful host, the space was big and location was great! They provide earplugs which is super thoughtful but just be aware if you‚Äôre a light sleeper, since you‚Äôre in a basement there can be noise upstairs. Wasn‚Äôt a problem for us though! Thanks so much for having us!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent value and close to everything we needed! Easy access to highways, shopping, recreation. Don't be turned off by it being in the basement, once you open the door it's an entirely unique space. High quality furnishings, including a comfy bed! Don't skip this one because it doesn't look out onto the mountains."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I had a wonderful time at this location. The house is very close to the city and makes it very easy to get in and out.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Phillip is a great host and knows what would people need when on vacation. We found all the drawers stocked with everything we needed -though we were carrying our things already. There were lot of board games to keep the kids busy.
Only downside was the lack of central a/c or proper ventilation. Though there are sufficient fans and a cooler available which works best when there is proper ventilation.
All in all we had a nice stay."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice location, with walkability around the lake and to food/drink establishments. It was kind of warm down in the basement at night despite outdoor temps in the 60s. This was surprising considering basements are usually cooler. The hosts had a couple fans out which helped."

The check in process is super easy and having a private entry makes it so much better than other basement Airbnbs. The king bed is a major differentiator and the bathroom is absolutely gorgeous. Phillip is extremely communicative and responsive. Would recommend 100%.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was good, pretty much exactly as described by the hosts in the listing. Very clean and a great location. You can hear the foot traffic from above but I believe this was mentioned in the listing. The dog barked just a couple times when we went in and out of the place. I would recommend it!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay in the perfect location! The hosts were very accommodating and i would definitely stay here again! 10/10
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The guests are very friendly, the heating works very well, sometimes it is hot :D.
it is very well located, there are many restaurants and shops nearby. the lake park is very nice. Several buses pass nearby and to take the road from there it does not take more than 10 min. super recommended.
greetings from Puerto Vallarta and Aguascalientes Mexico"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for a Broncos weekend, and lots of things to do in the neighborhood. Sloan‚Äôs Lake is a great park to wander in, and it‚Äôs easy to get into the city from here. The apartment is very well kept up, clean and comfortable. Phillip is a great host, continually checking to see how he can be of help. Highly recommend this place!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Plenty of street parking in front of the home. We didn't have any issues with an suv with a 5x8 uhaul trailer. Phillip was quick to respond to questions and welcoming. The basement was as described and pictured, furniture was comfortable. There is a little bit of a lip on the entry step that each of us tripped over at least once; but that was the only issue and a small one (keep in mind my family is very accident prone and most people probably won't have issues with that). I would definitely stay here again."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this apartment was great! comfortable, cozy, great hospitality, amenities. the king size bed and jacuzzi tub were highlights of my stay after days of packing for a move. it was great to have a coffee maker, fridge, microwave and dishes. being near sloans lake is fantastic. be sure to catch the sunrises/ sunsets. the nearby edgewater public market is a great place to grab food or drinks. Ruperts on the edge by the lake is a favorite breakfast place. would recommend staying here!"

Even though this is a basement space, it in no way feels like a basement. It is bright, very roomy and updated in a very attractive way. It is close to many excellent places to eat and exercise. The neighborhood is quite and feels very safe. The location is quite convenient to downtown with easy access to the major routes through Denver. We cannot recommend it more highly."

In addition, it was very quiet. Highly recommend Phillip's place. Would come and stay the next time we return to the Denver area."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of four stayed a couple of nights at Phillip's place in July. We found the place comfortable and convenient to plenty of restaurants and activities in the nearby community. Nice coffee place around the block and the public market a few blocks away was pretty cool. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for a short stay. The location is near downtown Denver - we took a ride share into the city for a baseball game and it was quick and easy. I can easily recommend Phillip's place to anyone that doesn't need a full kitchen for their stay and aren't exceedingly tall (the shower ceiling would be difficult for anyone over about 6'2"")."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Roomy basement apartment with everything you need. Great location near the lake. Would stay there again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phillip's rental was spacious and clean.

We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is all about the details. Filtered water in the mini fridge, a nice coffee bar setup, a microwave, a tv in both the living room and the bedroom, and a private entrance. Plus, the location is perfect if you don‚Äôt want to drive or take an uber. We were able to walk to the park, several restaurants and bars all within 15 to 20 mins. We also liked that it was private and stocked with plenty of towels and extra blankets since some days were colder than others while we were there. Best part was the tub. It made for a relaxing evening. Would absolutely recommend this place if you like the coziness & amenities of a hotel while still feeling like a local."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Phillip's place has just about everything you can hope for in amenities and more! I loved each of the thoughtful touches and they had everything you could think of, even down to the little things. There were fans in the event the room got a little warm, board games, throw blankets, extra towels, coffee, the roku, and just about everything else in between. The place was much larger than we expected, and I can't emphasize enough how clean it was. Especially in these times, cleanliness was super important to me, and Phillip definitely delivered. Phillip's place was conveniently located in Wheat Ridge and an earshot from everywhere in Denver by car. We frequented a number of the restaurants/ shopping and cafes in the surrounding areas (Tennyson St, The Bardo Coffee House, Pizzeria Locale, Denver Biscuit Company - just to name a few that we really enjoyed) and the best part was that they were all a short drive away from Phillip's place. I highly recommend staying at Phillip's place, and am very happy to say that I will definitely be back if I were in Denver again. Thank you so much Phillip and Cortney!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Phillip is an exceptional host. Was visiting Denver for 3 days and found this to be the perfect home base.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this cabin was absolutely wonderful. I had searched for hours to find just the right place that would be cute and cozy with fun touches, not like a boring hotel room. I wanted something that was somewhat remote in the mountains but also not too far away from restaurants. Because it was just my husband and I this time, we didn't need anything too large, but I wanted more than just one room. This absolutely met all that criteria. The cabin looked exactly like the photos. I loved it from the moment we walked in. It was so relaxing to sit in the hot tub, and my husband and I even laid on the stargazing net even though it had just been snowing. What a gem of a cabin. I definitely want to come back!
The hosts were super responsive and very friendly in messaging. This just added to our ideal experience.
If you are searching for a relaxing getaway with your partner or small group (there's room for 6), look no further. This place is perfect!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked the A-Frame as a little romantic getaway to get out of the city for a couple nights, and it was PERFECTION. The house itself is so cozy, private, has incredible views, and we felt super relaxed and content the entire stay. The stargazing net is such a unique feature of the house and it was so perfect bundling up with hot chocolate, laying out on the net, and looking up at the stars. We truly can't wait to be back! This would be the perfect spot for a couples getaway too and we can't wait to come back with friends."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an adorable place to stay. At first when we pulled up and saw that it was on the property of another home we were worried, but in the end we felt that we had a lot of privacy. The owners had built a very attractive wall out of logs and it was lovely, if not secluded. Myson was very responsive to the issues that cropped up. There was a huge power failure in the area due to wind storms, but when i texted at 3 am they responded immediately, and got up to turn on a generator. It was a really lovely place if you want to go camping, but with a serious upgrade. Wed love to come stay again!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We could not have asked for a better place. It was just what we needed to get away from everything. We actually got to see a fox. It was like glamping under the stars
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the 2nd location that we stayed at with Mysen. He's a great host, and this stay was BEAUTIFUL. Highly recommend ‚Äì just make sure you have a 4WD car to get up the mountain."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mysen saved our lives when our stay at the Dome turned into a weather emergency. The maintenance crew did their absolute best clearing out 4-5 feet of snow. And when two different snow plows got stuck while trying to clear the road, Mysen kept us safe and well-fed with food and an extended stay.
Being unable to do much except stay indoors, we appreciated that the Dome was both cozy and warm. Even during an unprecedented snowstorm, electricity and Internet access were never an issue, and communication was exceptional. We would certainly stay at a Mysen property again‚Äîwith better weather, of course!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing, it is just as described , if you are looking for peace and quiet , and relaxed this is the place!

We loved it and the host was very communicative. 10/10 recommend"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful stay! We arrived in the middle of a snow storm and enjoyed every bit of our mountain getaway. Everything was easy to find and easy to use! Our pup enjoyed playing in the snow around the property. We enjoyed the hot tub even while it was snowing. Very secluded and romantic!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved it here! It allowed us to enjoy the beautiful winter woods while still being warm and comfortable. The hot tub was very comfortable and we spent most of our time in it. The Big Dipper was perfectly framed in the skylight for most of the night. We would definitely come back sometime!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our weekend getaway at Mysen's dome/igloo experience. We were looking for a bit of an ""unplugged"" weekend away from the city and immersed in nature and this was everything we wanted. The dome ""windows"" and skylights made it feel like a true ""glamping"" experience, while the gas heater, beautiful bathroom, and cute little kitchenette gave us all of the comforts of modern living. The ground of the property were beautiful, and the hot tub allowed us to be out in nature while staying warm while we enjoyed our morning coffee. Great trails nearby and the cutest little town of Evergreen to enjoy local restaurants or shops to browse. The only ""issue"" we had during our stay was of our own accord with the gas heater and Mysen was immediately responsive and extremely helpful in getting it resolved for us. We will recommend this place to all of our friends and hope to return. P.S. - Check out his other listings as well - they are all so dreamy!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt speak too much about the dome because unfortunately there was an issue with the heater upon our arrival. But Mysen as a host was absolutely amazing. Super accommodating, got us into another one of his properties right away, and the trip and entire experience was perfect. We‚Äôd love to try another dome experience one day & would stay at another one of Mysen‚Äôs properties. Some things are just beyond your control but he did everything possible to make it right for us. Absolutely recommend!"

with my family. Great location, cozy interior, good communication with owner.
A very restful stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really cool coffee making stuff and they left fresh beans. The shower is super cool. It's a cute, peaceful and private spot. The hot tub was perfect. Only about 20 min to Evergreen. We went to Black Hat Cattle in Kittredge and they had amazing steaks, highly recommend.
The beds are a bit more firm then we normally like but there was a ton of pillows and blankets.
The last mile or so is dirt roads that get steep at times, I'd highly recommend a 4wd car especially in the winter."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay, and only wish we could have stayed longer! Thoughtful touches, extremely clean, well appointed, easy to find. 10/10 would book here again."

Mysens place is perfect for a relaxing getaway with everything you need to enjoy your stay. The views from this place are absolutely amazing I cannot recommend this place enough. Also, there‚Äôs a jacuzzi in the back which was very enjoyable with the snow coming down. I definitely would return here again and again! It‚Äôs not too far from town which has a Safeway and few other stores. The inside is super cozy and a comfortable, you‚Äôll feel right at home but with a different experience. I can‚Äôt wait to comeback!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here! Unique and fun. Comfortable bed and loved the pour over coffee! Mysen was responsive and helpful. The road getting there was pretty steep at some points, 4 wheel drive is necessary in the winter."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great atmosphere. Will definitely come back
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great weekend! This little dome looks exactly like the pictures! It was so comfortable and served as a great home base for us to adventure and hike! We came home each day from long hikes and soaked in the hot tub! You may be in a mountain ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù but you sure feel alone! Thanks to Ernest and Mysen for always being so quick to respond with any question we had!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just finished up our second visit and are still completely in Love with this place!! We got the pleasure of meeting the host and designer of this lovely property, they showed us some of the new changes and upgrades they‚Äôve made as well as hand deliverrd some soap when we ran out.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay here was absolutely incredible! The location was perfect for a quick little night away. The dome itself was so clean and beautiful and of course the views outside were stunning. We even got lucky enough to see a moose while spending time outside! This was definitely the most peaceful little getaway I‚Äôve ever had. We would absolutely come stay again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect!! My husband and I were looking for a nice, quiet weekend together to reconnect, and this was it!!!! We arrived around 7pm and the bistro lights were on and the heat was turned on for us, which was a very nice touch since it was cold and rainy. The dome was everything they described it would be. The only complaint I have would be the proximity to other homes. Thankfully no one was in them but if there were people there, it wouldn‚Äôt have felt so private. But other than that, it was exceptional!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back. Definitely, highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is exactly as shown. It is quiet, and secluded with nice touches like a small hot tub and a cozy heater. Would love to be able to go back."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I had a wonderful time during our overnight getaway at this dome. We loved relaxing in nature and waking up to the sun shining through the ceiling. We even saw a moose in the road on our way there. Definitely recommend this little oasis!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely awesome place!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I arrived right before a rain storm, and had a few minutes to enjoy the chairs on the porch; so much so that i brought one inside to sit in while I waited the rain out. I wanted to spend the night celebrating all that Colorado has brought to me over the past 20 years when I came to visit my Mom, and get ready to return to Buffalo to continue to host my Mom. The quiet, gentle flow of the space allowed me to take the evening as it came.
The hot tub was welcome, and so peaceful as tiny bits of raindrops dropped.
Waking up to sunshine through the ceiling was amazing, and I enjoyed the space during my yoga practice.
I would have definitely enjoyed spending the day enjoying the outside offerings. I will definitely return when I get the chance!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay at Mysen‚Äôs place for a girls trip! We had a problem with the hot tub heating up and he answered me very quickly and sent someone over right away to fix it. While we waited for it to heat back up, he set us up with a s‚Äômores kit at the fire pit. The location is absolutely beautiful and the dome was so clean and modern!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well if you've read all the other reviews you really don't need to see any more. Just lock it in and get this place! My wife and I had it for 2 nights for my 50th birthday and it was a great experience! The inside was just like the pictures, I don't know why these things aren't all over the place! It is perfect for 2 people, and maybe a child, I don't think I would want to have 4 adults inside but it would be doable.
We went to a show at Red Rocks the 2nd night, it was about 40 minute drive to red rocks which wasn't too bad. The grounds were clean and inviting, the host even let us try out their new sauna! the fire pit was an added bonus.
The host was very fast at responding to our questions and gave us tips for red rocks. I've been showing everyone we know videos of the place and now everyone wants to go!
Evergreen was a fun little mountain town to explore and wasn't overly expensive.
Thanks for a memorable and relaxing birthday experience! Hope to see you again soon!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely incredible experience! I cannot recommend the glamping dome enough. It is the perfect place to observe nature and unplug. Truly beautiful scenery and wildlife. The host made it a luxurious stay with a modern and cozy feel. There is no need to leave the dome but if you want to explore the area you can head into downtown Evergreen for some great restraunts, a bakery, a cafe and various other boutique/antique shops. We cannot wait to stay again in the near future!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was fantastic! The yurt was beautifully decorated, pristine and so unique, such a fun experience. I highly recommend taking a mini private vacation among the aspens."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely WONDERFUL!! I can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve been so relaxed. Everything was just like the photos, things were labeled, neat and easy to understand.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely fantastic find. The Dome is on such beautiful and peaceful property and the inside is both luxurious and ‚Äúcampy‚Äù at the same time.
The fire pit, grill, hot tub and grounds make such a great addition to an already stellar stay.
We got the added benefit of a crazy thunderstorm while we were there which was a great experience and plenty of deer were running through the property fairly close you.
Plus the Starlink internet made it very easy to work from.
All in all a great stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts are incredibly responsive, kind & welcoming. They left us a handwritten welcome note and chilled delicious lemonade, which was extremely thoughtful. The glamping dome is exactly as the pictures portray and the interior was done extremely well and gives a very cozy vibe. The beds were comfortable. It was a really unique & fun stay for me and my daughter. I think it would be a perfect stay for a couple looking to get away and have alone time. The location is a little more remote than I expected and the terrain up the mountain was a little rough. I would recommend buying/bringing all your grocery and items needed prior to arrival, as it‚Äôs about a 20 minute drive up/down the mountain."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot recommend this stay enough. We (a couple) chose this location for our seven year anniversary, and we were delighted. The space is gorgeous and private. And I have never seen stars like at Mysen's dome. Truly a spectacular and unique experience all around."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Glamping Dome in Evergreen is a perfect weekend getaway and not too far from the Denver metro area. The hosts were responsive, and the place is exactly how it looks the pictures. It's not hard to find even though it's remote. We even saw some elk! Great hikes close by in JeffCo open space, only about 10 min drive. Downtown Evergreen is only about 20 mins too. We had a great weekend and would recommend staying here!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mysen's place is awesome. It is beautiful inside out and very well taken care of. Mysen is an amazing host who pays attention to details and takes suggestions seriously. I had a wonderful time and will definitely recommend enjoying this luxury glamping place.

The dome was super welcoming and made me feel at home. I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough. Although I personally think it‚Äôs best for couples. It makes for a super romantic get away. I can‚Äôt wait to come back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was simply amazing. A combination of high end private accommodations and camping. Beautiful wildlife every morning and evening outside the floor to ceiling window. And it had all the extra touches - all you need to do is make a quick stop at the grocery store before you arrive to get your favorite food. The surprisingly soundproof bathroom with rain shower shower-head was extra surprise. I stayed with my 11 year old son, and it could not have been more perfect, although it would also be a great couples location. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Escape to an enchanting glamping dome in Evergreen, Colorado, nestled among picturesque aspen groves.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The staff was really professional and responsive to all of our questions.
They were also helpful when needed so i am really impressed by the great hospitality of the team at Aloft.
The amenities were great and overall it was a really happy experience for us at this property!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at aloft, we loved playing pool and using the hot tub! Would absolutely stay here again :)"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was peaceful and clean and comfortable. All five stars. Great stay and rest.
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,This stay is pretty ordinary. Pool and hot tub were not available. Not much besides a place to sleep. As well as paying incidentals before you can get your room keys
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The hotel room had cool modern designs and the most comfortable mattress and pillows! It was admittedly a lot more cozy than we anticipated. Not much room or furniture available to comfortably enjoy a sit down meal in, but we ate out so that didn't bother us. So grateful that they were pet-friendly and so understanding about having dogs. The location really made this hotel stay worthwhile. Just a parkinglot away to restaurants, a shopping center/mall and a movie theater."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Only tiny issue I had was that it did not state I needed to be 21 to check in, I did have to work through that but the staff were accommodating and friendly!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful rooms! The location is great; very easy to walk to restaurants and shops.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Unique hotel room with fun decorations. Great location to tons of shopping and eating options.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my stay, it was perfect and there were such great amenities. The place is also surrounded by great restaurant choices and plenty of things to do! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,the location is excellent. they were very accurate with what they described...
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gorgeous room. Spectacular service in the lobby and at the bar. Great place to stay.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, friendly staff, walking distance to restaurants, paint and sip spot and many shopping locations."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Aloft is a great location, a lot of restaurants, and stores near by. Even got a movie theater right next door. Fast access to the freeway as well. Enjoyed my stay"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We rented this to have a hot tub and it wasn‚Äôt working but was till listed
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super modern! We enjoyed our stay. Very clean and we enjoyed the amenities. Only con was breakfast wasn‚Äôt continental.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful environment and lots to do around the hotel
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great space for our purposes this trip. Parking and check-in were easy, even with a large truck. The free luggage cars are the best I've encountered. Literally in a shopping center, so super convenient if that's what you're looking for!
The hot tub was a big reason I chose this property, and it was broken for our entire stay. Not really any one person's fault, but unfortunate all the same. Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see ""Complimentary Breakfast"" on the listing, though come to find out they are referring only to coffee and mini doughnuts. A bit of a letdown to say the least... They do have other options available for purchase.
All in all, the quality is good for the price."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"cute hotel with unconventional, but charming, decor. the people at the front desk were really helpful and kind."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay here again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved it! Definitely would recommend
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing room. Very upbeat and stylish. Check in was easy . Bar and live band ! Quiet rooms. Will definitely book again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely place
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Jason and Chelsea were very communicative and their home is gorgeous. We would love to stay there again. It was perfect for our elopement and worth the views
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin and location! Every moment you spend in the house, you'll be immersed in the sensation of being part of the nature around you.
Other than the occasional airplane or household appliance, the only sound you hear while standing near an open window, hanging out on the deck, or relaxing in the bathtub, is wind rustling the conifers and bird song.
There's very little light pollution in the area, and virtually none in the backyard, so on a clear night the entire sky seems sprinkled with stars.
We saw small groups of foraging deer throughout the neighborhood (as well as the backyard) on multiple occasions. It snowed halfway through our trip, and we caught little rabbits making trails over the snow. And beautiful blue birds, as well as various sparrows, were a constant companion during the day.
It's also great that it's only ~20 mins to make it down to the highway and maybe ~45 mins to the outskirts of Denver.
Our hosts were wonderful and responsive to all our needs."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at this property. Jason and Chelsea were very responsive and accommodating. Rules and instructions were very clear for the whole property and check in/check out was super simple. Plenty of in house entertainment was available (games, ping pong, TVs, Wifi, hot tub, beautiful outdoor space). With the king, 2 queens, bunk beds, and multiple comfortable couches this large house sleeps 8-10 very comfortably especially if it is couples sharing the beds. The king/master bedroom was incredible.
We had no problems getting to the property in mid April even after a full day of snow but with the dirt/gravel road it might be more difficult in the Nov-March snowy months.
If the rules, description, and pictures align to what you are looking for then I highly recommend this property and give it a full 5 stars. My only negative is that the cleaning fee and Airbnb processing fees aren't very friendly to single night stays so I highly recommend staying multiple nights."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The place is just amazing with great views.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"House and surrounding scenery were absolutely beautiful. Owners were extremely responsive and even gave us warning due to extreme winds, we may lose power. When we did lose power and water, they were very understanding and flexible about expectations of kitchen cleaning when leaving the airbnb.
Absolutely would stay again, Bailey was such a gem off the beaten path."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an overall great stay in a very peaceful location with incredible views. The house is very well laid out for a large group to enjoy themselves. There is a great yard to explore and it's situated on a very scenic road.
However, the house needs some maintenance and wasn't as clean as we would have expected. Sheets and beds were very clean, but there was food and trash from previous guests throughout the house. Furniture has heavy signs of wear and tear. We were also disappointed that the hot tub was low on water and dirty so we couldn't use it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful stay with incredible views. Just an absolutely beautiful home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is by far the most beautiful view from a home we have ever seen. It is the most perfect home to visit in the winter with the cozy fireplace, hot tub, and sauna. One of our favorite details is how family-friendly it is. There is plenty of entertainment for the kids. We were stuck inside due to a massive snowstorm and our entire family was able to find amusement throughout the home/property. If you have a bigger group, rent their unattached garage/home also! It is adorable. Jason and Chelsea also allowed us to have our ""micro-wedding"" here and it just turned out absolutely perfect. My only recommendation for guests is that you absolutely need 4WD if you visit this mountain in the winter or during a heavy snowfall. There are shovels on site to help you as well. Thank you so much to Jason and Chelsea for your communication throughout our stay and accommodating us throughout the storm!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Grateful for the opportunity to stay at this Beautiful home. The owners kept open communication throughout my entire stay. It was a delight to be able to see a family of deer graze on the property every morning. Weddings are an additional cost that must be sent separately from the Airbnb costs so be mindful of that additional expense. 4WD is definitely necessary especially during the winter, on arrival we did have to plow the entire porch approx 3 inches due to the snow from the previous day. Had a great time with lasting memories & beautiful views. Thank you Jason & Chelsea for allowing us to enjoy your home, it was a wonderful experience."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a marvelous stay! With 5 adults, a toddler, and 3 dogs we had tons of space to be together or retreat to our own areas. The views and comfort of this home can‚Äôt be beat. We had snowball fights on the deck and fun playing ping pong. We relaxed in the hot tub and made wonderful use of the beautiful kitchen. We saw deer and stellar jays through the windows and my mom even heard a mountain lion! The little dog run was a HUGE bonus that we weren‚Äôt expecting that allowed us to safely let the dogs out at night without going into the snow with them. We would definitely love to visit again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home with even better views
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a beautiful location and made for a great escape for our mom‚Äôs trip!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay. A lot of open space and the area was clean. Host responded fast. Definitely recommend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was a DREAM! We celebrated my 30th birthday and we barely left the house. From the views, to the decor, and the amenities.. it was truly incredible. Wish I could give this place another 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs!!!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This is such a beautiful home! We loved every second of being there. The hosts were very responsive and we are already planning our next trip back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is hands down the most beautiful Airbnb I have ever stayed in. When we arrived the first night, the view brought tears to my eyes at how vast the mountains looked. This place was the perfect weekend to reconnect with friends, eat wonderful food, and focus on being present. Thank you to the hosts for all that you do!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely LOVED staying here this place was breathtaking
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was amazing. It had plenty of space and the views were incredible. We arrived right after it snowed so getting to the house was slightly difficult without it being plowed but we all had 4x4 to get us up the hill. During our stay, we unfortunately found mice dropping in the lower kitchen cabinets. We had to pre-wash some of the pans and a mixing bowl to cook some of our meals. The rest of the stay was great. The hot tub was perfect and the sauna was a nice touch. Overall a great stay and comfortable home. If the mice problem was taken care of, I would definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"It‚Äôs a beautiful home but very poorly maintained. Lights were out in the master closet, the dishwasher doesn‚Äôt clean dishes so they were all dirty (put away with food stuck to them), no dish soap either. No trash can in master bathroom for feminine products. Mice droppings in the cabinets and sponge tray on the counter. There was no firewood, and the grill we counted on was out of propane. They only allow 2 bags of trash to be left, but the dumpster was no where to be found, so we drove back to Denver with our stinky trash. The games were all missing pieces and unplayable. The tv and tennis table are located in the lower level but that never heats up. The hot tub was low on water, and absolutely filthy with a layer of film on top. The skimmer was broken and half was thrown over the deck. My daughter got a splinter on her stomach from the dining room table.
It is quiet. The home has beautiful potential, but not what you expect for paying $2000 for a 2.5 day stay. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"10/10 would recommend and be back! We would come back in the summer to see how it is in warmer weather.
100% need 4WD in the winter. The views are absolutely stunning and the place is great. The photos are exactly what you‚Äôll get.
The sauna and hot tub were great and well maintained. The gym in the garage was perfect for lifting while on vacation.
I see why people would want to get married here!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is the spot for people looking to stay in the mountains, even in January this place and the surroundings were beautiful, albeit a bit frosty. The hosts were responsive to our concerns and all the amenities are as described."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs place was truly beautiful and we had such a good time while we were there. Everything was as described and check in and check out was easy and uncomplicated, which is so appreciated!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a beautiful place with a waohhhhh view!
Incl sauna‚Ä¶. Hot tub‚Ä¶ table tennis‚Ä¶ huge fireplace‚Ä¶.
We felt great and had a super time ‚Äûup there in the Rocky Mountains‚Äú!
And‚Ä¶. We were lucky having white Christmas!
‚Ä¶Which made an even better experience!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Dream mountain getaway. My husband, two kids and dog had a wonderful stay. There was even a Christmas tree up so my daughter and I made ornaments ‚ò∫Ô∏èüéÑJason and Chelsea were very responsive and the house was exactly as described. The views were incredible and home is cozy. Can‚Äôt wait to recommend this to other friends and family, and come back again soon!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"WOW!! No words to describe this beautiful home. The pictures don't compare to actually seeing it in person! The house is also fully stocked in almost anything and everything you may need for your everyday use, especially in the kitchen. They were also nice enough to allow me to do a very intimate photoshoot with my little family. Jason was always responsive to all of our needs/questions and super polite. I would def book with them again and have recommended the listing to all my friends after them seeing my beautiful videos/pics on social media. Thank you guys again! DROP DEAD GORGEOUS HOME!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was absolutely stunning! Couldn‚Äôt have been happier with the views (seriously the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice). It was very clean and so cute on the inside, very well decorated! Jason and Chelsea were very responsive with any questions that we had. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone. We will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As a lot of reviews mention the pictures just do not do justice . The views are breathtaking and you will never want to leave . There are so much wild life and the deer will walk right up to your back deck ! The host was beyond accommodating and answered every question quickly . This is THE spot for any type of get away , whether it be for something special or just a peaceful get away . We most definitely plan on coming back as we never wanted to leave to begin with !! Thank you for sharing your home with my family and I !"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house! Great for a relaxing stay! Plenty of room to spread out. Comfortable beds and couches and truly gorgeous views!
2023-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"The views were stunning! They did not disappoint. We loved the big living and dining area with mountain views. The only thing is that it could use some updates. There are a few minor fixes needed like the room with the bunk bed had a broken sliding door, and one of the kitchen drawers kept wanting to roll out and fall. We had a really hard time finding extra blankets and I would suggest having some extra blankets and towels, especially for the winter season. The room with the bunk beds had one thin layer of a throw. Since the house is way up in the mountains with no stores nearby, I would say having extra linens and toiletries is helpful for the amount we are paying for the house. We loved the hot tub, it fit seven of us comfortably. We found everything we needed to make dinner, the house came well equipped with everything you would need to make a meal. Jason and Chelsea were responsive any time I had a question. The property itself is private and peaceful. We had a great time!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Very grateful for the host letting us stay in this beautiful home with breathtaking views.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. Simply wow. The views are drop dead gorgeous. The pictures do not do justice. This stay was amazing!! There are so many things to do inside the home and the views keep you entertained for hours. The place was clean and lovely. There are some slightly things broken around the house but it wasn‚Äôt major. The road up was a little wet and slick in spots, but had no trouble getting there. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay and I highly recommend."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this lovely home! We were very cozy - they even left us some wood for the fireplace. :) It was exactly as described, and such a gorgeous home with beautiful sunlight and views."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The listing on this home does not do it justice. It‚Äôs even bigger in person, the views are incredible, and the hosts were super responsive and friendly. The home has pretty much everything you‚Äôll need as far as appliances and cookware. It felt was cozy and the couches were amazing. Our family can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Gorgeous home with a beautiful view!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Spectacular view and premium accommodations. The home design is very well integrated into the surrounding environment and accommodating for a large group, or multiple families. The home lends itself to a magnificent mountain getaway and inside out experience. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a unique mountain getaway!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is stunning, beautiful scenery & location. Breathtaking views from every room in the home. Be prepared vehicle wise to go quite a distance on a dirt road, and ensure you have necessary groceries & gas because in-town trips take some time & planning, but we loved the quaint town & small town feel. Jason & Chelsea are very responsive and communicate thoroughly. We would definitely visit again if back in Bailey, Colorado"
2023-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"First, the home and the views are absolutely stunning, beautifully furnished and 10x better than the photos. For the right event/purpose, I would definitely stay again. However, while the hosts were very responsive (which I definitely appreciated), the list of house rules I received the night before were much more intense/restrictive than I picked up on when booking the place, which caused me and my guests quite a bit of stress and some rejuggling needed. For a home of that size, the parking was limited, as was the number of people allowed on premises. Additionally, the hosts are unwilling to make any accommodations for guests, such as early/late checkout, blow-up mattresses, or any type of special discounts (we are active duty military), which was a bit frustrating considering how expensive the stay is; I would have hoped for a bit more flexibility.
Overall, if you are a small group looking for a peaceful getaway, I truly couldn't recommend it more. But beware of large groups!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a gorgeous house, location, and vibe! The house is so spacious, well laid out, and nicely furnished! Beautiful kitchen, with everything you may need. Huge living and dining areas. Decks are amazing! Sunsets are breathtaking! We highly recommended Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs place!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a beautiful house! Would come again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was absolutely beautiful! We had a small wedding here (10 people) and it was gorgeous. The house was clean, very spacious, and in a peaceful neighborhood. We had a couple requests from the hosts and they responded very quickly. The house and views are even more beautiful than the pictures."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"nice place, clean, great views"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredible house with beautiful views all around. We saw wildlife of many varieties, clear night skies, and had space for cooking out and relaxing. If you're looking to get away from the stress of everyday life for a few days, this spot is perfect!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Easy to find the location and self check in was easy. They could not accommodate early check in or late check out. We went for one night to have a night outdoors under the stars. It was a wonderful experience and would definitely come back again. Thank you for sharing your home.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Gorgeous mountain home - even more beautiful than the listed photos! The perfect girls weekend peaceful escape! Can‚Äôt wait to come back again ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay in Bailey! This house fit 8 friends comfortably! The view was beautiful and we specifically loved the hot tub!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a wonderful and beautiful AirBnb. We stayed with my immediate family and there was ample space inside and out. It was beautifully decorated and just a wonderful place to spend time. The views were breathtaking and we saw a lot of wildlife. We will definitely come back!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Place was amazing, great views and amenities. Watch out for the hummingbirds they like to come in."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful place and a wonderful stay also amazing view just beautiful all around.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had the most relaxing girls weekend here and the views were unreal. The house is super spacious and so cute too. We went to the Aspen Creek winery and had to make a stop at the Coney Island hot dog stand. Overall loved this stay and definitely want to come back!
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall the house was as listed and beautiful. Left some things behind and asked for them to be shipped, even offered to pay for shipping and never received any of them back nor a response back checking in on said items. The house shows list of seating outside and there was barely any. Especially, with a large party. A cleaning fee of $350 was charged and the house wasn‚Äôt very clean, but overall the house was amazing."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is amazing and the views breath-taking. It is a quiet, beautiful get away. There were only seven of us celebrating a big birthday and we all slept comfortably. The master suite is wonderful, large, and also with a great view. A great place to be in the mountains and be able to drive to hiking trails on Guanella pass. When we needed more soap, the hosts were very responsive and soap was delivered. The kitchen amenities need to be upgraded. So if you want to cook I would suggest bringing some from home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and house and deck are amazing!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"A beautiful home!! AMAZING views from the living room/kitchen. House is just as listed in description. Lots of room for a group of people to stay, lots of special memories made. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I had a fantastic stay here. The house was absolutely beautiful, down to every last decoration. The views from the deck were phenomenal. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice! The kitchen was large enough for us to comfortably cook a big meal for all 8 of us and eat it at the dining table together. Everyone said their beds were also really comfy and they slept great!
There are only two areas of improvement that I could recommend. Firstly, I think the recent rains have caused some damage to the dirt driveway that could make it difficult to get up to the house. We luckily had 4WD, but would be good to warn people in case their cars aren‚Äôt so good with terrain. Secondly, we arrived on time for check-in, but the cleaners were still working until 4:15 and asked us to wait outside. Not a big deal since the house was impeccably clean when we were allowed in, just would have made check in smoother if they were finished on time.
Thank you Jason and Chelsea for a lovely stay!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We had never visited Colorado. The mountain views and hikes available from the house were excellent. It is an amazing house.
2023-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"This is a magnificent place. Besides the stunning views, the house itself is very beautiful, and we are big fans of the interior design of the house. The cookware doesn't match the rest of the house though, as there are chipped plates and tarnished silverware. There were not enough basic supplies such as shampoo and body wash when we arrived, but the host quickly got additional supplies to us after we asked. One final thing to note is that the host is very wary of weddings hosted at their place, no matter how small the wedding might be. If you plan to have your wedding there, I recommend that you let the host know as soon as possible to avoid potential disruptions to your plan."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was amazing! The photos are incredible but still don't do it justice. We were all blown away both by the house itself and the views you get to enjoy the entire time you're there. Jason And Chelsea did a great job communicating and making us feel welcome and comfortable. We loved every part of our time at this place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this stay was absolutely stunning.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jason and Chelsea's home was very comfortable for our family. The view was amazing to wake up to. We enjoyed being able to all sit at the large dining table to have meals together. Beautiful home.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great home in the mountains with a beautiful view! Excellent layout with large rooms.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"What an incredible location! The deck was just wonderful. We couldn‚Äôt find the deck chairs that are in the photos, but the chairs from the dining room worked in a pinch. The living space is extremely comfortable and everyone in our group commented on how great the beds were. Extremely comfortable location. The kitchen had plenty of cookware and serving dishes. We didn‚Äôt use the hot tub, so can‚Äôt comment on that. Lovely stay with these very responsive hosts."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with incredible views! The hosts were very responsive when we needed something and we had no issues while we were there.
Some stains on bedding, chipped plates, etc. but to be expected with a rental. Not really a complaint but a heads up. Overall, the house was very clean."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a gorgeous space! Pics do not do it justice. Great hosts, great property. Absolutely can‚Äôt wait to return!"
2023-04-01,2.0,Group trip,"Unfortunately, I would not book this location again, and I feel the price was much too high given the condition. The nice things about this place are that the views are incredibly, it is very peaceful, and the house is very spacious with tons of decks. However, the owners are completely unflexible about check in/out times, which caused issues for us coming in from another state for a concert. We couldn't arrive until much, much later, and we had trouble finding the house because it isn't marked with numbers. They sent us a huge list of rules to follow emphasizing maintaining the property in pristine condition, then we get into the place to find it quite dirty. Showers clogged with hair, old moldy coffee grounds in the machine, smears on the mirrors, overall cabinet kitchen condition chipped and damaged and old - needing repairs or updates, not perfect like the pictures show. We paid over 2800$ for 3 nights, including a cleaning fee. Reaching word limit, so can't continue."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay for a girls trip. The host was responsive in great timing when we needed assistance. Beautiful home and property, would ABSOLUTELY come back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is everything you see and more!! It‚Äôs views are incredible, lots of thoughtful spaces inside, and a great place for family!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a fabulous time, the house itself is so beautiful‚Ä¶ and the views are breathtaking!!! It has a ton of space, very clean, had the basic essentials & an easy check in/out process
Would definitely come back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My family and I had the best time at Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs beautiful house. It‚Äôs even better than the pictures and we wish we had stayed longer. Thank you so much for opening your lovely home to us!
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful home!!
This issues I had were that the Jacuzzi was not well kept
We had to put in a new chorine filter
And try to get out all the sand and debris in the Jacuzzi.
There was no refill of toilet paper in any of the bathrooms and I thought for the price of this home it would have been better stocked!
Only had tin foil no Plato‚Äôs wrap or plastic Tupperware to store left overs
The olive oil was out of two bottle
No sugar for coffee
Ext‚Ä¶the silverware is all tarnished
My hope is that the next stay for others will be better."
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was our second time staying here, and look forward to staying again in the future! House is beautiful with stunning views and plenty of space to spread out."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"An absolutely beautiful place. It seemed even bigger than the photos. We enjoyed seeing lots of deer, a fox, and even a mountain lion down the road. Stunning views and very comfortable."
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful views!! Jason and Chelsea were great hosts. We will definitely be staying here again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful location!!! Breathtaking views. None of us wanted to leave today haha! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!!
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was literally breathtaking! The pictures make the house look amazing and being there in real life was even better! We felt like we were living in a dream house!
We went during a snow storm so driving there was a little harder but that has nothing to do with the host just Mother Nature!
We even had some visitors, DEER!! It was a beautiful site!
Chelsea and Jason responded fast when I messaged them!
We cannot wait to come back.
10 out of 10 recommend"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Couldn‚Äôt find a better view. Truly a dream. Will be back as soon as we can!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall experience was wonderful. A few comments to note on our experience:
Pros: Views were amazing! Love the great room especially. Beautifully decorated and appointed overall. Master retreat was a retreat indeed: pretty bath, sitting area, and bedroom. Hot tub was wonderful! Plenty of blankets, bedding, games to enjoy, etc. Also, plenty of places for a family to spend time being together but also cute places and nooks to have separate places for all to enjoy too!
Cons: We had to wait for over an hour to check in as cleaning crew was still finishing up. And, cleaning could have been a bit better overall. Some scratches, stains, and pantry should have been cleared and cleaned out imo. Some of the lights didn‚Äôt work upon arrival. Coffee maker didn‚Äôt work which was a bummer! Kind of a bad first expression (especially since our family had just been on a 13 hr trip to arrive on time and was anxious to get settled in; instead we had to sit in our car another hour)
Overall, great place!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house as well is spectacular, the rooms, the kitchen, the living room, the balconies, the jaccuzi, the sauna, the views, everything is incredible. BUT, if your plans are skiing, snowmobile tours, even eating in restaurants, the truth is that it is not the right location, the closest restaurant is 25 min away and snow activities 1 hour and 20 min to Echo mountain"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is magical!! Jason and Chelsea were very responsive and we would 110% visit their home again. The views were breathtaking and the home was so spacious.
The master bathroom has an amazing bath tub for a soak at the end of the day after hiking.
I have no hesitations in recommending this place.
The sauna and hot tub are perfect additions too. We also loved the downstairs cough/tv area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Incredible place to stay. Very quiet and stunning views. Easy in between location of Denver and Breckinridge. Only negative we could give is the cookware/silverware could use updating.
2023-01-01,4.0,Group trip,"This place has an absolutely gorgeous view and provided the perfect setting for our family reunion. Very spacious with cool amenities like a hot tub, ping pong table, and sauna. The hosts were very helpful and responsive as well.
It was lacking some essentials (dishwasher pods, enough toilet paper, paper towels, etc) and was a bit dusty/dirty in places (including the hot tub). There was also a lingering fireplace smell throughout the downstairs.
Otherwise, though, we had a very lovely stay and would definitely recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved our stay, such a great view and stunning house! We will be back!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"The views are amazing and the house is large and beautiful. The prime location is private and the views are unobstructed. The open living concept was very conducive for our family. The beds are very comfortable. The amenities such as hot tub, sauna, game table and t.v. room exceeded expectations. It was very nice to have toilet paper, toiletries and laundry pods provided for us as we were visiting from out of state. The kitchen was well equipped regarding dishes, utensils and cookware. It would have been nice to have cleaner cabinet interiors and better organization. There was no foil, baggies or storage containers provided. Overall, we would definitely stay at this location again. We had a great time!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs place was great! Quiet, beautiful and enough space for everyone to relax. Would recommend and come back again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Thank you, we spent an amazing time at your place! Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was amazing, the views were breathtaking. The home had lots of activities that one can do, very kid friendly. Jason and Chelsea were responsive when questions were asked. Would recommend coming in a 4 wheel drive vehicle if snow is forecasted in the area. Highly recommended place overall !!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We spent a wonderful Christmas at Jason and Chelsea's Airbnb. As soon as we arrived, our group scattered and ran excitedly around the house oohing and aahing as we explored each of the rooms. The views were a dream--our guests woke up early each morning to catch gorgeous sunrises on the deck. We cooked together all weekend in the kitchen and had all the tools we needed to produce fabulous feasts. The furniture was stylish, cozy, and comfortable and it was clear that the hosts have poured so much care into making it so. Our stay was such a treat and I hope to return again in the future!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,what an awesome place. We were lucky to be able to stay at such an amazing find.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was absolutely beautiful and peaceful. Jason and Chelsea were super responsive to any questions that we had! Highly recommend this place.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The views from the house were beautiful, though I do believe the house itself could use a lot of maintenance and upkeep. Some amenities were not in working condition, and a few rooms were not as clean as expected. Though I thoroughly enjoyed my time with my family, I would book somewhere else next time."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our stay at this beautiful home! We took a trip with some friends and our littles, and everyone loved it. The views are breathtaking, the home was great for our larger group, and the beds were so comfy!
We spent our days watching the sun come up, making brunch, playing games, taking in the amazing views, sitting by the fire, and playing games. Five stars, hands down!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jason and Chelsea were great hosts and the home was perfect for our group! The views were amazing, amenities were great and the hosts communication was quick and helpful! Would definitely stay there again!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful spot. unfortunately the house was not cleaned prior to check in. we had to wash the bed linens before we could sleep the first night. host made no attempt to rectify the situation despite charging a high cleaning fee.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely breathtaking views. This house is so much bigger and better in person. The house/decor is stunning and it‚Äôs a very peaceful getaway. I cannot wait to come back! This is a beautiful spot for all seasons.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,BOOK THIS PLACE!! It‚Äôs too gorgeous to pass up! My wife and I held our tiny elopement ceremony here and it was the most magical experience in the world! The view is fantastic and the natural light is wonderful. The place is decorated beautifully and we loved our time here!
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,The views were unmatched!!! Absolutely perfect stay for a night with friends or family!! The layout of the house was perfect and there were so many activities to do in the house! Couldn‚Äôt recommend staying here more.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"So lovely!! ‚ù§Ô∏è The views are absolutely stunning, the home is gorgeous with great attention to the little details of making it feel homey and have everything we could need for our stay! The sauna & hot tub were great perks after taking some day hikes nearby, and then ending the night gazing up enjoying the stars!
We booked this home for my husbands 40th birthday and it was PERFECT - especially since we could bring our fur babies with us! We are already planning a trip to come back and stay longer for our next stay! Jason & Chelsea have a beautiful home, and they were so helpful and very quick to respond! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2022-11-01,4.0,Group trip,Overall a great and awesome place to stay! Jason and Chelsea are super responsive. I would say the price for one night compare to staying 2 or 3 nights is significantly higher.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow wow WOW!
This place is 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è five stars!
Any amenity you may need or want this place has it!
Being from Florida I wanted to experience the mountains of colorado and I wanted to wake up to VIEWS and this place has exactly that! Views from every window! I mean literally every morning we woke up to deer just grazing around as the sun came over the mountain peaks. It was pure magic. Plenty of room for you and your loved ones! Outdoor shower!!!! How freaking cool is that!?
It is secluded and has lots of privacy and property which is great for a family or friends vacay! Everything was ridiculously clean while also feeling very lived in and loved. Like stay in a big cozy mountain mansion!
Denver is only an hour away but honestly you won‚Äôt even want to leave the house because of how beautiful it is!
Our host was amazing! Always readily available for any questions we had and so helpful in suggesting things to do and places to go!
Seriously there‚Äôs no reason to look further, this is the Colorado home you dream of! Enjoy! And thank you so much to our host for not only creating such a gorgeous space but for sharing it with us‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was EXQUISITE! Beautiful views from every angle, sunrise to sundown. Not too far from town, but far enough to experience complete silence. Wildlife was also very active; an amazing thing to watch."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was GREAT. I was doing my proposal here. View was amazing. Way more than enough room to house my family. Home was clean and amazing. Such a great place to get everyone together and enjoy a great, breathtaking view. Would totally come here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"House sits up way at the top of the road. Beautiful views and great sunrise and sunset on master suite porch. Tons of great amenities that worked great - hot tub, sauna and game room. Enough bathroom showers and beds for everyone for a group of 8! Great spot! Would like to book again in the future!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolute dream to stay here in the mountains. Views and the house are all incredible!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place with amazing views. We enjoyed gazing at the stars at night, and tea on the balcony in the morning. Full kitchen with condiments too. Some parts need more maintenance. Overall we loved our time there."
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,What a beautiful location! This is a great place to get some amazing mountain views not too far from the city. We really appreciated Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs responsiveness and could tell they really cared about our experience here. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a quick getaway!
2022-10-01,3.0,Group trip,"This place is beyond beautiful. The views made our group speechless. However we did have issues with wifi, we were essentially off the grid the whole weekend. We could‚Äôve used more blankets, and garbage bags as well. We only had two garbage bags for 16 people. We ended up buying some so make sure we left the space spotless. Our check in time was pushed back as the place was not ready for us upon arrival and cleaning was still being done. We traveled 1 1/2hrs and luckily it was still decently sunny to keep us warm while we waited to check in. Over all beautiful place for a intimate wedding ceremony, but some issues with functionality of the place."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was very spacious with stunning views of the mountains! My husband and his eloped right in the back yard and it was everything we could have imagined. We encountered a few housekeeping issues (nothing we couldn‚Äôt quick clean ourselves) when we first arrived, however, the hosts were very responsive and took some money off for the inconvenience. The space is also perfect for children! Plenty of toys/games in the basement to keep them occupied for hours. The cabin is also very close to multiple different trails. I would recommend checking this place out!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"If solitude and spectacular views are what you're after, then look no further than this beautiful cabin. Although rather tucked away from any conveniences or restaurants, we were looking to get away, so we had no problem with how remote the property is. We were a small group, but this would be a great cabin for a much larger group with lots of activities to keep everyone occupied. Did I mention the views?"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our girls trip of 7 loved our stay here! We were able to enjoy several local spots like Aspen Peak Cellars & Mad Jack‚Äôs Brewery. We had no trouble cooking up some meals in the house (but did have to pick up a few spices for our meals - chili and enchiladas ‚Äî groceries were picked up from Safeway in Conifer on our way to the house from Denver). We saw lots of deer in the neighborhood, including while we were sitting in the hottub. While it was nice to sit in the hottub and look out to the mountains, the tub was due for a cleaning so we didn‚Äôt get much use out of it unfortunately. We enjoyed a hike just a short drive away in Pine and enjoyed the quaintness of the town of Bailey. Also, I‚Äôm not a disc golfer but did notice a course very close to the house in case you‚Äôre into it! The house was clean and absolutely beautiful, with a queen bedroom/ bunkbed bedroom/bathroom in the basement and master bedroom/queen bedroom/3 bathrooms upstairs on the main. This was a great place for our friends to reunite and we would stay here again if we ever found ourselves back in the area!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason and Chelsea have an amazing get-away cabin in the woods! Such a beautiful cabin that I was able to use with my whole bridal party for getting ready in. Absolutely BREATHTAKING views. Jason and Chelsea had quick responses and worked with us on our big day.
If you are looking into this cabin --heads up-- due to fire safety and regulations there can only be 4 cars on the property at a time. Totally understandable and nothing against Jason or Chelsea, it was just very inconvenient when the main house and guest house sleep 16 total. It seems very unrealistic to house that many people and only be allowed 4 cars.
We unfortunately had to rent another airbnb down the road that let us park our cars there and taxi our wedding party back and forth.
The only other recommendation I would have is that the toiletries and paper goods are restocked- (Toilet paper and paper towels.) The master bedroom and the bedroom downstairs only had a half roll of toilet paper when we arrived. We could not find extras anywhere, same with the paper towels. There were no paper towels in the kitchen and we couldn't find any to restock.
Other than those few points, everything else was amazing and we appreciate Jason and Chelsea opening up their home to us to stay in on our big day. We have such great memories there and the getting ready pictures turned out beautiful!
Thank you both so much again for opening your beautiful home to us and working with us with great communication ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,My family had a wonderful stay at this beautiful home. The decor is adorable and the views off the deck are even better in person. We enjoyed sunrise walks around the neighborhood and stargazing at night (the star visibility was INSANE). Perfect place to stay for our wedding weekend!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful stay!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the stay.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a MUST STAY!!! Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs home is just as beautiful as the pictures and that doesn‚Äôt even include the breathtaking VIEWS of beautiful Bailey, Colorado. We stayed with a group of six friends and had plenty of room in the home. Jason and Chelsea were very communicative and answered promptly for any questions we had. As many reviews suggest, you‚Äôll want to stay-in and enjoy everything the home has to offer. We loved waking up for sunrises, headed to the local Winery one day, and went hiking at Staunton State Park. 10/10 recommend!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Group trip,"Such a great stay! The views are unbeatable. The hot tub was the cherry on top! Cleanliness could be improved and was a bummer not having some kitchen essentials (tin foil, Saran Wrap, baggys) but overall would highly recommend!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We got married here with all of our family. It was the most incredible home and we are already so excited to go back soon! The views are even kore beautiful in person. Jason was great with communication and was a great host.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing place, Beautiful views. Would stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason and Chelsea were fantastic hosts. We had a great time, and the property is more beautiful than we could have imagined. Everything went well, and would stay here again any time the opportunity came about"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful house and great views!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The listing is as advertised--a view that can't be beat and a quiet place to relax and take in the scenery. We especially liked having coffee on the deck and watching the deer pass by.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is good for the soul!! Stunning views from almost every window and all three decks allow you to take in the peace of the mountains. The owners have put a lot of thought and time into decorating their home...it was absolutely beautiful. The kids loved playing ping pong and we enjoyed some family time with the board games. The hot tub in the evenings was also a fave! The owners were great...reaching out to make sure that we arrived and got settled in okay and again to check and see if everything was going okay and asking if we needed anything. We had a great time and loved this place. We got a brief visit from a little fox and a mama deer and her two little ones were napping under the bottom deck on the morning of our departure. Thanks for the memories and family time your home gave us!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,It was a wonderful stay and the views are beautiful. Jason and Chelsea are great hosts.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location for a family gathering. The views from the deck are phenomenal! It was great to gather around the supersized dining table. We'll savor the memory of our kids laughing around the ping pong table.
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Great views and worth every penny. Beds are comfortable and kitchen is well equipped. Highly recommend you have lunch at the winery nearby. Great food and outside dining by the creek.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place. The views are stunning. The house, equally so. We enjoyed every single second! And the hosts are awesome! Definitely book this place and stay as long as you can!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very beautiful location and property. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again if our travels take us back to Bailey.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing location with breathtaking views. Close to great hiking and parks. A lot of space. Hosts were very responsive.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Truly a view of Heaven. Great space for nice dinner for large family!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fabulous house and locaton. The views were amazing.
The only drawback was descriptions says it sleeps 10 but only if those 10 share beds. Our 4 grandchildren didn't want to share so 2 ended up sleeping on couch and army cot."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a cute place
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home and decks, responsive hosts! Excellent stay all around!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"You can‚Äôt beat the views! Get what you need before you get to Bailey as there is very little in town and once you‚Äôre up the mountain, you‚Äôll want to stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic location, beautiful decor‚Ä¶we would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stunning home with views that go on forever. They've gone out of their way to make sure everything you could need is available. You'll never want to leave the main living room and deck!
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home, great views! Even better in person!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, hard to beat. The views are insane!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason and Chelsea's home was stunning. It snowed over a foot while I was recently there for my friend's wedding in Bailey, and although it wasn't the weather we were expecting, it was gorgeous! They stocked the house with helpful items, which were helpful for me because I traveled a long way and forgot a couple of things (make up remover wipes, shampoo, etc),. One note, which I did know about beforehand thankfully, was to have a 4wd vehicle because of the dirt roads that turn muddy with the snow/rain. To reiterate, I would highly recommend staying here to anyone interested!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful view, lovely furnishings inside. Felt like a perfect break from our regular life in OK. We used to live in TN and missed our mountains, this spot did not disappoint. We're already recruiting friends for our next trip back! Only thing to know before going is that nobody delivers to that entire area (which is not a negative comment on the experience, just a heads up to anyone booking here) so if there's going to be iffy weather make sure to get a grocery run in! We loved the stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our friends trip. We were very comfortable with 7 adults and 2 babies. We loved the view, decks, and hot tubs. Well equipped for cooking meals. Great experience overall!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jason and Chelsea accommodated our girls weekend on short notice, which was greatly appreciated! We loved looking at the scenic views from the hot tub. The bedrooms were serene. We had a great time!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house is truly a magical place that was perfect for a gathering of family and friends. The pictures don't do it justice - the space is actually BIGGER in reality than how the listing makes it appear. The view from the porch, hot tub, and living room is as outstanding as all the reviews make it sound. Inside, the house is just as gorgeous and very well equipped. We had 14 total guests (we also had the adjacent cabin booked out) and the kitchen and dining table in the main house accommodated the entire party very well. Our group had an amazing time staying in and enjoying some quality time together - between pingpong in the lower level, a legit sauna, olympic weight rack in the garage, and the aforementioned hot tub with vista, there was plenty to enjoy without ever having to leave the property. Process-wise this is also a very easy Airbnb - check in and check out were very straight forward and Jason and Chelsea were very responsive to any questions. I really can't recommend this place enough. We are already thinking about returning for future family events."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfectly remote with enough indoor/outdoor space to really get away. Well equipped and mountain cozy.
Highly recommend"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is absolutely gorgeous and the setting in the mountains is breathtaking.
The house was clean, with plenty of towels, etc... The kitchen is modern and very clean.
Sitting in the hot tub, you look out over the mountains, it is gorgeous. I would very much recommend this property. Lovely to walk around the area or very short drive to hiking and mountain biking trails that are second to none. We will be back."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cabin was absolutely more gorgeous in real life than any of the photos could have conveyed. The view was breathtaking!
I had a small and intimate group of women with me for an embodiment getaway, and we did meditation and yoga outside on the deck in the sunshine with the most perfect Mountain View ever! One of the women brought her massage table and set it up in the master bedroom next to the huge windows which created the ultimate vibe for the sessions. I took some ‚Äúembodied reclamation‚Äù photos of each woman in front of the windows in the great room on the wood floor, and outside with the outdoor shower‚Äîthere are so many perfect places in this cabin for quiet moments of respite, personal reflection, community and fellowship over meals, chatting in the hot tub over cups of wine, movies downstairs, lunch on the deck, sunbathing on the balcony‚Ä¶I honestly can‚Äôt describe well enough how much we enjoyed our stay. We were well communicated with and left to our privacy. I‚Äôm so grateful we were entrusted with this home, you won‚Äôt regret booking! Trust me when I say the photos don‚Äôt do it justice!"
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The view is amazing. Sitting in the hot tub while looking at that view is really a highlight. The home was well equipped with all kinds of things needed for a great stay. The fireplace and that living room view are hard to beat.
There was remnants of past animals who had stayed at the home, so if you are sensitive to animal dander, this could be tricky for you.
The big beautiful windows are also big doors which means if there are high wind warnings (which there were) those window doors rattle quite a bit and made for a pretty sleepless night."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The views from this home are breathtaking! We came out for a girls trip and found ourselves on the deck hanging out in the sun all day. Jason & Chelsea reached out to check-in and make sure we were all set and were quick to answer any questions. We had a great time and only an hour drive back to Denver!
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was one of the best Airbnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed in. The home was incredibly comfortable and the view was breathtaking.
Jason and Chelsea were very accommodating and communicative. We had no issues and loved our stay and will definitely be back.
Would 100% recommend this home to anyone looking for a quiet mountain retreat."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Incredible recommendation to get away.
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"House was clean and the host was really flexible ,house has the best view , i would recommend to anyone !!!( definitely my next stay will be here )"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We rented out this Airbnb for a girl's weekend vacation. We had about 7 girls all flying in from different locations and the host was flexible with Check-out times to allow for all of us more time before our different departure times!
When we first arrived, we loved the gorgeous view and the huge amount of space that the Airbnb provided. The Master Bedroom is stunning and has the best sunlight beams in the early mornings overlooking the valley.
We loved the open floor plan, kitchen had everything we needed and the hot tub!
The only major concerns that we had were that when went to look around of the condition of the house we found some minor cleaning errors that we commented to the hosts about being that some of the key lights do not turn on, stains in the bedrooms and one of the bathrooms not being as cleaned as we would have liked.
Also, we did have a strange ""spooky"" encounter when we went up to the children's play loft and tried to turn on the light but it didn't turn on. However, two of the girls saw that in the later part of the night they noticed the same light had turned on without anyone one of us going up there.
Just thought, it was a bit spooky and unexpected.
Overall, we really liked the stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This place offers the best of Colorado! Great spot with beautiful views!
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,We really enjoyed our stay! Jason and Chelsea were very responsive and gave us clear information and check in instructions. The house is beautiful and so is the view! There was some snow on the ground so we were grateful to have 4WD on the drive up the hill but it was really no problem. Would highly recommend a weekend away here!
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had such a wonderful time in such a beautiful place! This rental was perfect, the views were incredible. The pictures are great but seeing it in person was amazing. The deck space is huge and so many amazing views. It was super quiet and the neighbors were not close at all.

2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs home was everything and more that we could have dreamed up for a mountain getaway. It has views that are breathtaking and hosts that truly want to provide a wonderful experience. They never missed an opportunity to reach out and help when asked. Everyone that has seen pictures has already asked for the information to book! Wonderful home. Wonderful hosts. Wonderful experience.
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cabin is worth every penny! The views are rad, and the air up here is super fresh! Very spacious and beautiful. Thoughtfully designed and cozy! The fireplace is great and the cabin has everything you need for a peaceful stay. 100% recommended!!"

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This Airbnb was simply amazing! It was the perfect size for our entire family of 8 people and could fit a few more! It had something to do for all ages. It was very homey, beautifully decorated, comfortable and quiet. It had every amenity you would need. The views were absolutely beautiful! The hosts were very responsive to all of our questions (as it was our first time staying at an Airbnb) , which reduced our anxiety tremendously. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful, cozy house with a view to match! Jason and Chelsea made the whole process simple and enjoyable!!"
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The view is amazing! We‚Äôre local to the Denver area and had a lovely stay. The views are great and the beds very comfortable.
We stayed with some friends and had three infants between us. The noise did not carry between bedrooms which was great!
If you‚Äôre planning on staying here as a mountain hang (we didn‚Äôt plan on leaving much), make sure to bring everything you want for cooking. There is a good selection of spices but definitely bring your own tea and coffee. As of our stay there weren‚Äôt Kleenex provided and with dry mountain air I‚Äôd recommend bringing a box."
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This property is absolutely stunning. All the views are breathtaking. The hosts were responsive and accommodating. However, we thought that they were quite excessive about cleaning requests despite there being a hefty cleaning fee. Otherwise, this property suited all of needs and some. We enjoyed the fireplace, hot tub and scenic views! We would love to visit this area more and this stay is at the top of our list."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house far exceeded our expectations - big mountain views from everywhere in the house, and beautiful decor. We loved watching the sunset from the deck with deer grazing in the yard and soaking up exquisite views from the hot tub."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was beautiful!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was amazing! Beautiful inside and out. Fantastic views. Our entire group loved it. My 5 year old asked if we could move in. Haha. Definitely would like to come back!
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"My partner and I rented both properties for our wedding! We could not have asked for better hosts and location, the pictures do not do it justice! We felt so loved in the spaces and the attention to detail was top notch! We only wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer to take in that view for just another day! We look forward to returning with kids some day to show them where we said, ‚ÄúI do‚Äù!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Okay, please believe all of the reviews that say the pictures don't do this house justice. It is stunning! And comfortable and just such a great place to rest and relax. The house was very clean, greatly decorated and well stocked with most cooking essentials and there's a Safeway store not too far that has whatever else you might need. Jason and Chelsea are also really responsive and accommodating hosts. Overall one of the best airbnb's I've stayed at and I can't wait to be back."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful!! Everything about our stay was perfect! We didn‚Äôt get a chance to see this place covered in snow but it was still amazing . From the cleanliness to the VIEWS üòç‚ô•Ô∏è. It gets pretty chilly at night so the fire place with some hot chocolate definitely hit the spot. The hot tub was best spot to watch the sun set! The master bedroom was the perfect spot to watch the sunrise. Definitely recommending this home to all of my friends & family! I will definitely be booking again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place to stay! The views are to die for. Whole family had a great time.
2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying here. The location was gorgeous and my entire family was able to spend the holiday together comfortably. The views from inside and outside of the home are breathtaking. And Bailey is such a cute, small town. My one complaint was the spotty internet connection. My dad wasn‚Äôt able to get a strong enough connection to work remotely and we couldn‚Äôt stream the thanksgiving football games. If unplugging is your goal then this is a great option, otherwise you might want to plan ahead to use a personal hotspot."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely stunning place. The other reviews are right, the photos don't do justice to just how amazing this place is. Everything was very well thought out from a fully stocked kitchen to games and more. We will definitely be back time and time again. Thank you!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jason & Chelsea‚Äôs home was absolutely wonderful for our family to celebrate an early Thanksgiving! The views were amazing and it was unbelievably cozy!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home is beyond as advertised and we could not have been more satisfied. If you are considering this home for a remote mountain getaway with epic views, do it."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Such a welcoming home with incredible VIEWS day and night! 11/10 would recommend.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs place was phenomenal. Our family was so comfortable and enjoyed every second. Pictures could never do this place justice, it‚Äôs stunning!
A phenomenal getaway in the beautiful mountains."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was the most enjoyable experience I‚Äôve had in an Airbnb. It was the most lovely and comfortable home. Decorated to perfection and enough space where we could enjoy the views, our families and special moments. More than we could ever expect and asked for. I would love to stay longer. Our hosts were communicative and lots of wonderful extras such as plenty of firewood. Special touches throughout the house made it A wonderful stay."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home is lovelier than the pictures and the views are truly breathtaking. We traveled to CO (some flew some drove) to attend a family wedding in nearby Pine. We rented both homes (four nights) for the privacy and space and my extended family of eleven (ages 20-59) had such a wonderful time we ended up not leaving except to attend the wedding. We brought kitchen essentials from home to prepare meals but most of which was not really needed because the kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, glasses, cups, pots, pans, utensils, can opener, regular coffee pot, even an Instant Pot. With a large group the paper products we brought really cut out most of the dish washing and zip loc bags for leftovers came in handy. The white linens and towels were clean and fresh like a very nice hotel. There were enough towels for everyone but we brought extra beach towels for the hot tub which came in handy. Everyone enjoyed the clean relaxing hot tub, beautiful views and quite conversations. There was cooking, conversations, board games, relaxing, reading, lots of taking in the spectacular views from inside and the expansive decks outside, a little exploring the outdoors, and I don‚Äôt recall the TVs being on or the cell phones being used much except to take pictures. It was amazing to look out the window and be in the tree tops, watch the sun rise and set and see the birds soar on the wind currents. The last stretch of the road to get to the property was not paved but we had clear weather and none of the vehicles had an issue (FWD small car, pickup, AWD Subaru, SUV). An AWD/4WD vehicle would be highly recommended in snow and rain. We reached out to the hosts with a few questions and they were very responsive to our needs. Overall it was a wonderful place to stay and really added to everyone having a truly enjoyable experience."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location is absolutely stunning! There was plenty of room for our family and plenty for the kids to do as well during the trip. The hot tub was a big hit especially since you are overlooking the mountains. We would definitely go here again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful views with tons of deer in the neighborhood. The home was perfect for gathering our family before a special weekend. The kids loved the climbing wall and swing in the basement. An entertainers kitchen made it easy to cook and stay in conversations. Although we didn‚Äôt have time to enjoy the hot tub or gym set up, that was nice to have! Lots of parking available too. Adorable little neighbor dog loved to stop by and hang out too! Only negative was that overall cleanliness could improve (although we are super picky especially during these times), otherwise a 5 star stay!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"You will not be disappointed with this one! Jason and Chelsea have really made sure to spoil their customers. Spectacular views, fancy linens, beautiful kitchen with over the top housewares and appliances, the carpeted areas feel like your walking on a cloud, the little touches with decor is soothing to the eye. This place will make your stay with a large family, ‚ÄúEasy like Sunday morning‚Äù Wishing I could spend Christmas there! Owners are quick to respond."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,I can honestly say this is the most beautiful home I‚Äôve ever stepped into. The views are unreal and the house itself is also gorgeous. We would love to come back here!

2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The pictures do not do this home justice! Not only is the interior decorated perfectly, the views from three different decks cannot be beat. I‚Äôd highly recommend this place!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jason and Chelsea‚Äôs house is amazing, with a gorgeous view. It is full of amenities and entertainment, especially small thoughtful additions like children‚Äôs books in one of the bedrooms. We loved cooking meals in the well-stocked kitchen and soaking in the hot tub overlooking the mountains during a rainy afternoon. Wish we had stayed long enough to build a fire! A few small improvements would make this place absolutely perfect (providing soap and shampoo, dusting the fans, fixing a leaking shower head), but overall, we loved the house and would happily stay again."
2021-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"This cabin retreat is more dreamy than the photos! With plenty of views from every room, you never want to leave. It has lots of decor and storage areas but most are empty- could use some extra blankets in places for 9th and 10th guests that sleep on the cots/couches, but comfortably sleeps 8 guests. Would definitely stay here again for a longer stay, 3 nights were too short to enjoy all it has to offer- gym, sauna, hot tub, and numerous eating areas."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Prepare to have some breathtaking views and the perfect home to gather family to have some fun and relaxation!
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The name and description of this house is exactly as listed. Stunning views everywhere and space for everyone to have their own private retreat - wow factors at every turn!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heather‚Äôs little bungalow was the perfect basecamp for our week in Denver, and we were truly sad to leave! Easy parking. Clear entry instructions. Super quiet neighborhood within a half-mile walk to groceries, liquor store, and some incredible restaurants and breweries.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Heather was a very responsive host! My friend and I felt right at home in this quiet neighborhood.

We appreciated the location - near enough to downtown Denver for exploring, yet outside of the busyness of the city and still in an urban environment. The space was cozy, comfortable, quiet and well-stocked. We were surrounded by a lovely neighborhood and homes, great walking, lakes, restaurants, grocery, etc. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in Denver!"

Heather had toys, a high chair and pack n play, so it made travel much easier for us. The home is super clean and comfortable and the location is perfect. check in was super easy, and Heather was easily reachable. She proactively checked on us via message to make sure we settled in well.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Staying here was great! It's a really nice area and there's plenty of spots you can walk to. Would definitely look at staying here again during my next visit!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time I've stayed at Heather's place. It is located in the perfect location for visiting some of my friends in the Denver area. The free parking and private entrance was a perk. Check-in and check-out was very easy and the Airbnb was well stocked. One thing to call out though is that the listing advertises a pull-out sofa bed as the second bed. It was the broken the first trip I visited and we let the host know; however, a year later, the listing advertised the second bed again and it was still broken. Not having a second bed as advertised is the only thing preventing me from rebooking this Airbnb again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, efficient, comfortable, private space, well-equipped kitchen. Excellent restaurants within walking distance.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay in Denver. The host was so accommodating and everything was easy to get to. It's a great location. outside of the city enough to feel like we had our own space but close enough to everything where it didn't feel like we were too far from anything. The Safeway down the street was awesome. We walked there and got some groceries and made food back at the house. It truly felt like a home away from home. Definitely going to try and come back here in the future if I ever find myself in Denver again.

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is very clean and pretty well situated in relation to Tennyson street. There is easy keypad access and it is well stocked with kitchen supplies.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is perfectly clean, quiet and private. It looks like brand new construction and decor. The hosts are nice enough to leave kitchen items like oil, butter, PB, coffee, etc.
The location is the best with a 2 block walk to a lively pond/park/walking trail. Two blocks in the other direction are several good restaurants: Ginger Pig, Bill‚Äôs Inn and also a grocery.
In less than a mile walk is the vibrant neighborhood of Tennyson St boutiques, restaurants, bars.
Its a quick Uber to downtown, Rockies baseball or Broncos football. And the airport is a 20min Uber if traffic is OK.
Everything is comfortable and well thought out in the house. The outdoor space is small, but that is typical of a tight neighborhood. There‚Äôs lots of light in the house and new windows open easily so we enjoyed the fall air.
Directions for entering are well explained and all the neighbors were quiet and polite. I actually really enjoyed being in a sweet village atmosphere as home base and Ubering in to the big city for events.
Also - having a designated free parking space - a BIG plus!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sarsha and her husband are sharing this lovely well kept back house. Everything was organized and clearly instructed for us in their big binder along with places to eat and sights to see. This binder has loads of amazing suggestions. All the places I went to visit or eat were all bangers!
I also had a rental car so I was wondering how parking was but it was so easy because there is a spot right by the unit with plenty of space.
Everything felt homey and cozy. If you choose to stay here you will feel at home. Any questions we had, Sarsha was quick to answer or was in the binder, which made everything less stressful. She is warm and welcoming and so so so approachable! Definitely would recommend!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a perfect stay at this airbnb. It's a mother in-law suite in the owner's backyard, but you would never know with how they nicely created barriers with tall fencing, and frosted windows on the side of the house facing the owner's home. Felt very private. It's very clean, bright, and decorated really well. Plenty of space for a couple's getaway. Great location near parks, and grocery. About a 10-15 minute walk to restaurants on Tennyson, but we found Lime bikes/scooters nearby for a fun, quick ride over to Tennyson. Overall, great stay!"

It‚Äôs just enough space for a couple of folks looking to make the most out of their time in Denver. It‚Äôs wonderfully quiet at night so if you‚Äôre a light sleeper, you‚Äôll definitely get the rest you‚Äôre looking for in a vacation. There‚Äôs a lovely park and access to I-70 (which will basically connect you to most places you‚Äôll likely travel to while visiting) just up the block from the house. You‚Äôre about 45 minutes - 1.5hrs away from major sites like Red Rocks, Rocky Mountain National Park, Garden of the Gods, etc. but you‚Äôre also just minutes away from Downtown Denver where you‚Äôll find great eateries, dispensaries and more of that city feel. I was very impressed with how thoughtfully stocked Sarsha had the apartment. You‚Äôll find all of the essentials you need in a fully functional home."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay while exploring Denver. This accommodation was clean, plenty of room, and a small area to sit outside. Sarsha was ready for us with a book of local attractions and restaurants, which was a great help.
The location was a short Uber ride to downtown and an easy walk to Tennyson Street, which hosts a number of different restaurants. If you want a quiet, comfortable stay while in Denver, I would highly recommend this place."

We loved the thoughtful extra touches, including being kid-friendly with a high chair and pack and play available. The location was very convenient to downtown and nearby a cute neighborhood with shops and restaurants. Sarsha was super communicative, as we had booked last minute during a cross-country road trip. She gave us some great recommendations, and wish we had some more time to explore."

When it snowed and we lost power Sarsha was quick to respond and help in efforts to get us some candles and at no point we‚Äôre we cold or inconvenienced.
