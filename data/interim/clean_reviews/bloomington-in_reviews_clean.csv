2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a very special space!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful experience. This is a peaceful and clean home with what looks to be handmade features. Hammocks for relaxing inside and out perfect for a morning cup of coffee. It‚Äôs truly one of a kind and I can confidently say I‚Äôll be booking this place again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I stayed here for a girl's night out in Bloomington and we loved it! The house was clean and peaceful, and we were a minute's drive from downtown. My bed was comfortable and it was so quiet that I forgot how close I was to the city, I slept so well!
Our only wish was that we could come back in the summer to see all the beautiful gardens in full bloom!
It was a fair price and we will keep it in mind for our next trip to B-Town."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. Will likely be back in warmer seasons.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,it was great. I like the setup of the property. it made me feel like I was away from everything just like if you got a cabin in the woods somewhere. It's great all around. I just wished I stayed longer then what I did.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mark & I loved this unique stay. Max was a great host. Our stay was perfectly tranquil. The plan was to just stay the night once as a stopover on the way home from Chicago, but we plan to return to this secret retreat in nicer months when the garden is in bloom!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Oasis is the correct word to describe this cozy home immersed in nature. Beautiful natural wood throughout the house. A garden-lover‚Äôs delight. I counted 8 butterfly-friendly plants still blooming still on Oct 22! Max was very responsive & was so kind to purchase a new blender for our visit! We will definitely go back!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Place was great
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was like a piece of Berkeley in Bloomington! We stayed in a October when the gardens were winding down for the season but we could still tell it must be stunning in warmer months! A labor of love.
Home was clean and peaceful."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed quiet, peace, beauty. The Oasis is abundantly those!!! I‚Äôma gardener. Fascinating gardens surround an idyll, unusually creative cottage, beauty & serenity throughout.
Bloomington‚Äôs layout confused me. I didn‚Äôt realize until quite lost that there‚Äôs east side and west side, with same numbers. Max instantly responded to my text for help, and I arrived minutes later. Thanks, Max, for being available quickly!
It was pure joy to stay at this serene and charming place."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôve stayed here before and it‚Äôs a great place! Very clean and the yard is amazing and full of greenery. I‚Äôd definitely like to come back.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,An absolutely gorgeous property that is extremely private and not too far from downtown and campus. For the price I paid it was an absolute steal and it will be my go to anytime I‚Äôm in Bloomington.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental takes me back to the golden days of AirBNB - a unique, interesting, fun property without fuss or hassle. I thought this place was great. It's incredibly private, on a great property, and has a tranquil setting that you can really relax in. I appreciated how the rules of the property both provide, and invite those staying at the oasis to be respectful of the home and natural setting. No enormous list of chores, just a vibe that if you're respectful and decent, there will be no issues. This place is special and I would definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place met our needs well. It‚Äôs close to the IU campus, but far enough off the beaten trail that you feel like you‚Äôre away from everything - tucked away in your own private garden."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Stayed for 12 days. Beautiful gardens around the house. Beds very comfortable. Nice quiet neighborhood. Overall a great stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Max‚Äôs place was exactly as described, very unique for the area and would have loved to have seen the gardens in spring! Finding it was more Waze‚Äôs issue than the directions, but we got there.
Max was very responsive & helpful, would recommend this place to anyone."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an absolutely beautiful spot -- this is without a doubt my favorite place to stay in Bloomington now, because of the serenity of the high-walled garden and cozy, well-appointed house, but also because of the proximity to the head of the B-Line Trail. Less than a mile along the trail into downtown, and just a bit further to Switchyard Park or beyond to the gorgeous Clear Creek Trail. Highly recommended, especially if you're able to bring a bike with you! Max is helpful and responsive, but also gives you space to fully appreciate the rare experience of being in such a lush, private, living space. Morning coffee and stretching in the backyard covered patio space was a high point, as was the comfortable mattress!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beyond magical! A hidden oasis - unique, clean, and comfortable. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è We can't wait to go back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"absolutely beautiful, so glad we stayed here. Max has something really special with this spot."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,üå∫Highly recommend!üå∫ I have no words for how MAGICAL this place is. Max is such an amazing host with a beautiful soul and very responsive. Everything is true on all comments left. The Oasis is not just a word it‚Äôs that place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,When I pulled in I was a little concerned because the set up is a bit different than most places - and I encourage you to - you'll understand. But once you go beyond the gate - wow! Super cool. Super charming. Loved it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,N/a
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely perfect. We had wanted a little Bloomington staycation for the weekend and it truly felt like we were transported elsewhere. The gardens were so beautiful and the hammocks were a nice way to relax in the evening. The house itself was clean and cozy. Max was quick to respond with a few questions I had and was super friendly. It was so peaceful and just what we needed. I definitely hope to stay again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to escape to after college-apartment-supply-shopping! Beautiful gardens with a bunny, butterflies and hummingbirds, soothing ambiance, I felt like I was back in the Berkeley hills! Right around the corner from the B-line trail, and Kleindorfer‚Äôs hardware store nearby is great! Can‚Äôt wait to come back again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Serene retreat from the hustle and bustle of moving our daughter into college dorm.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There are hidden gems all over the garden. It is evident that a lot of time, energy, and care have gone into the gardens and the house. Convenient location to downtown but with a private feel. We enjoyed our stay at the Oasis."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found 'The Secret Garden' in Bloomington, IN!
All the reviews thats been written by other guests of the oasis, so TRUE. We loved the place, blissfully enjoyed it and so beautiful.
Thank you also Max for being so quick and responsive with a couple of our questions.
Our teen daughter asked...is this Middle-earth? üíñ"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was exactly what I needed to rest and recharge. Everything was so peaceful and beautiful. It felt like home. Max has worked hard to make this hideaway a perfectly peaceful stay. I felt like I could abandon all worries and enjoy the simple beauty of the garden, herbs, and the hammocks. Oh, the hammocks! I love the no shoes policy in the house to keep me grounded. This was a delightful stay tucked away from the hustle and bustle. Highly recommend"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway! Beautiful gardens and cozy spot. Would stay here again
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Oasis lived up to its name. Very private, beautiful grounds with flowers everywhere. Side by side hammocks under a covered roof were so relaxing. We can‚Äôt wait to go back."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is truly an oasis. If you need to stay in Bloomington or just a weekend get away this place is for you!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd time staying at Max‚Äôs beautiful garden oasis. My family and I really enjoyed the peaceful space for being able to wind down at the end of busy days exploring the city. It was clean, beautiful, and had everything we needed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay. The house was charming, cozy, and clean, and the property was beautiful. We enjoyed spending time in the garden with the bees and rabbits. Max was friendly and provided everything we‚Äôd need for a comfortable stay. A truly peaceful, unique place. We hope to stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful hidden gem in Bloomington. The gardens are wild and beautiful and the entire house and gardens are so private and quiet. The house is very cozy, the bathroom is great, and the gardens are unrivaled."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not your typical AirBNB: It's like a cabin in the woods in the middle of a neighborhood, with an amazing natural setting, it really is an oasis. Very short drive or bike ride to IU and downtown Bloomington."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a special place. Simple but has so many details. It‚Äôs an inspiring way to live. The hammocks in the garden shelter are so sweet.
It‚Äôs an art piece, and the only thing I‚Äôd offer to the host is to consider telling us your story. Standing inside someone else‚Äôs passion is a blessing. üòä"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really cozy, cute house with a very minimalist vibe to it. It feels like you walk through a big wooden gate and into a garden paradise! Tons of outdoor space and surprisingly not a lot of mosquitoes so it was pleasant hanging outside. Kids loved the hammocks and outdoor space! Thanks Max!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved getting to rest for the weekend at this cozy spot - I spent countless hours on the back porch, which included visits by a hummingbird, cardinal, butterflies, and a rabbit! The flowers were lovely and it was such a peaceful setting.
The interior was simple and peaceful - no clutter or extras. Breakfast muffins (from my new favorite spot, Bloomingfoods!) and fresh fruit were a perfect addition. The location is within minutes of a ton of great restaurants, the B-Line walkway, and plenty of fun things to do."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stay here if you can! Beautiful!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay here. The grounds are so beautifully landscaped with environmentally friendly plants. The little cottage is incredibly interesting and the secluded setting really makes it an oasis! I brought my mountain bike with me since this place is so close to the north trailhead of the B-line. That made getting about Bloomington and the Indiana University campus tremendously easy and safe! Bloomington is such a great town for cycling! I will definitely try to stay here again when coming back to B-town!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am a frequent traveler to Bloomington for work and had never seen the listing for Max's incredible Oasis before. I cannot express how happy I am to have found it! It is exactly what I need when working in town. Uber private, incredibly peaceful (except for the birds, bees, bunnies and occasional raccoon visitor). It was clearly designed with incredible car, is well stocked, and Max is an incredible communicator - responsive, friendly and helpful. I will be back!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved our stay- I was truly moved by the care that clearly has gone into creating this beautiful space, and appreciate the opportunity to enjoy it. Will absolutely return when we find ourselves in Bloomington or just need a few days of peace and restoration."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful and peaceful stay! Max‚Äôs place had everything I needed for a comfortable visit to Bloomington. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again next month!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly private, easy to find with Max‚Äôs instructions, beautiful house and property. Great safe off street parking. The privacy and garden created a true oasis. This is a one of a kind place. So close to B-line. Beautiful, peaceful space. Nice to mix it up with TV, internet, outdoor activities, cafe and downtown close by, or rest in tranquil outdoor space. Nice to be outside under covered area during rain, sit out in sun, or watch fireflies at night. Lovely."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words cannot express just how peaceful and magical this Oasis is . From the details in the house , to the well loved and cultivated gardens , and the wildlife that inhabits the space .. It is simply AMAZING! Max‚Äôs place is a must stay in Bloomington"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Max‚Äôs cottage Went beyond the list of things that make an AirBNB great, like snacks, good coffee support, condiments, etc. The bungalow and the garden are simply a work of art. if you are into craftmanship, creative home design and decor, and master gardening, Max‚Äôs place is a destination all by itself."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a restorative and peaceful getaway, look no further than the Oasis. I have stayed in many unique Air Bnb‚Äôs across the country and can safely say this was my favorite spot so far. If you are a spiritual, artistic, plant-loving vegetarian, you will feel especially at home here. My girlfriend and I loved the amazing woodwork, beautiful gardens, intentional altars, and comfy bed for sleeping in on a rainy Sunday. I hope we will get to visit this special place again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here! We got clear instructions to find it and it was a beautiful place. The garden all around the house was amazing. I would love to stay here for a week and never leave the garden. There‚Äôs plenty of shade and comfortable hammocks to enjoy. The inside of the house was also very cozy and nice. Very happy with the experience!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Truly phenomenal respite from the real world‚Ä¶once we entered the gate we were in a beautiful English garden and I could have gladly spent a week there just soaking it all in. To create something like this and then to share it with strangers just warms the cockles of my heart! Don‚Äôt hesitate to book a stay here if you need a little break from reality. No photos or descriptions can do it justice. So great!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Max's place is a true oasis for city dwellers like myself. Me and my family had a great time there, enjoying the indoor outdoor living. Thanks Max for offering such a lovely place to us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Like a haven in the middle of the city, this house and surroundings were wonderful for our family to have a quiet retreat to relax during our time in Bloomington."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a peaceful, private retreat from everything right in the heart of town. I was in awe of everything that was repurposed as part of the decor and structures. Also the garden was great, such a beautiful place to feel with nature. I will definitely stay again for longer next time."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Oasis was far beyond what I could have expected. It is a hidden treasure. I must have had my mouth gaping open in awe for at least a half hour before I could do anything else.
Max gave us great instructions on how to find it, because it is a bit off the road. We were also able to negotiate a late check out, so we could enjoy the beautiful scenery a bit longer.
We will definitely be back! It is my new favorite get-away destination."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The name Oasis totally fits the place, beautiful and tranquil, me and my newlywed wife enjoyed our stay there and would definitely recommend if you want a peaceful, private stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"loved it! such a beautiful, peaceful getaway:)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was fantastic.
Thank you."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Clean and comfortable - beautiful, private grounds. Definitely would stay here again. Appreciated the gardens."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Max is a great host. Prompt communication. House was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast pastries were much appreciated. Lovely gardens made for a very peaceful stay in a quiet neighborhood. Definitely recommend.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Max is a great host. Very nice and very responsible. Responded right away with any questions. Only thing is guests need to know is there is no cooking meat at his place. It was never a problem for us since we were only there one night. But some families may want to cook tacos or something for the kids and need to know. This is a beautiful place, a great house and host. I would definitely stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little getaway. Super peaceful space to get away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to all the restaurants and activities we needed!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique, totally private creative oasis."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of our favorite ABNBs ever. The photos don't do justice to how beautiful and secluded the spot is. Everything is well-appointed and thoughtfully laid out. Many personal and caring touches. Max was awesome and accommodating. Well-stocked kitchen.
When booking, we were a little worried about parking (always a concern with our van). We shouldn't have been. Parking is off-street in a spacious driveway, and the neighborhood is quiet and tranquil. We were also a little concerned about heat/managing a wood fire, but, again, no problems at all. The house has central-heating and was always warm even on the unseasonably cold days we were there. Overall, it was a delight staying here. Hope we can visit again sometime."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, secluded getaway. We all thoroughly enjoyed the garden and the home was lovely. A very memorable time. Thanks for a great stay- would visit again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unique sanctuary in Bloomington!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a gem, someone said it‚Äôs like leaving to another dimension and they are right, it‚Äôs so easy to forget the world around you here."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly magical and I feel fortunate to have had the chance to stay there. The extensive, sprawling gorgeous gardened lot tucked away in such a surprising location is just awesome. I was there just at start of spring and the bird song was constant and you could see that the gardens would soon be amazing. The unique aesthetic of the house is very charming. I already had a strong affinity for this subsection of Bloomington because I lived for several wonderful years within a 5+ minute walk of this Max's Oasis, but what he has created here is just so awesome and both adds on to and transcends the awesome feeling of the Near West Side and adjacent areas. If the pictures appeal to you, you owe it to yourself to stay in this house."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming, clean, peaceful place to stay in Bloomington. Would definitely return!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Very unique and interesting place. Thanks for sharing it with us! We would love to come back in the summer when the flowers are in full bloom.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Garden Oasis Sanctuary is THE hidden gem in Bloomington! Upon walking through the gate you feel as if you‚Äôve entered a different world! The stunning landscape provides breathtaking views. The host has done an incredible job creating this space for guests to relax, retreat & unwind. I would highly recommend this stay for anyone visiting town or even those who live in town as a perfect getaway spot. 12/10 recommend. Thank you Max!"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Would have been nice to know it was next to a railroad track (we only heard 1 train, but it did scare us)."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A true oasis. Beautiful, peaceful, and private. Max was also a wonderful and responsive host."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautifully minimalist. I can‚Äôt wait to return when the weather is warmer, and the incredible gardens are in full bloom"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful home, even better in person! Thank you for the nice evening Max!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I loved staying here! We were in town to visit IU and Bloomington, but ended up spending most of our time relaxing at The Oasis. I liked reading in the hammock and she like the natural light for painting. Loved the privacy and the neutral colors. It was so peaceful. Very convenient location near IU and restaurants."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique, peaceful experience! I'm looking forward to coming back in warmer weather."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet secluded property that is close to IU and restaurants and bars. Well cared for and the host Max truly cares about his house and property and about making sure we had a great time. The greenhouse and outside areas are very unique

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay and would love to stay again.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,A very unique secluded place just a quick ride to downtown. We stayed in January and were busy with activities but we definitely want to come back in the spring/summer/fall.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Secluded / yet not too far from downtown. Peaceful backyard. Host is responsive and accommodating.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is truly an oasis. My husband and two grown children had an absolutely rejuvenating stay in Max‚Äôs thoughtfully designed home. We read and drank tea and walked the garden and sat in silence together. It was a gift of a time made possible by the beautiful space. Highly recommend.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Very relaxing stay!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The entire place is amazing-- oasis is accurate! Looking forward to staying again. Very spacious and clean. Very clear directions on everything-- from check in/out to how to use the space appropriately. Comfy beds and hammocks. Very accommodating place for a long or short stay- the kitchen had everything we needed to cook our own meals. A perfect retreat!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Your experience at The Oasis will likely be wonderful. This is a place beyond compare. Pay attention, please, to all the host‚Äôs communications about directions, especially if arriving after dark. Inside the gate you will find a nature sanctuary - a fortress of peace. Extravagant raised bed and terraced garden, enjoyable in fall, when we came. Probably just as wonderful in any season. Maybe you will be welcomed by an amiable cat. Take off shoes. Inside, not a speck of dust. Purity embodied. Hardwood floors, molded plaster walls. Beautiful shower, luxurious sleep. A bird‚Äôs song will awaken you.. Good karma."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely and unique property. Max is a very welcoming host with great attention to detail. We hope to return when the gardens are in full bloom!

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Max has put a lot of personality into this home. The place is spotless and has special touches he did that make it interesting. It‚Äôs in an older neighborhood, and was quiet, we felt perfectly safe. The beds were very comfortable and the yard is fascinating with a variety of plants and paths. Max was quick to respond. The only improvement I would make is a more comfortable couch or chairs in the living area. I would stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot ‚Äî a hidden gem. Responsive host!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The beautiful pictures cannot do justice to this unique home. It‚Äôs a retreat. A garden. An oasis. A return to nature, both inside and out. Very comfortable bed and linens. Well-equipped kitchen with thoughtful snacks and fruit provided by our host. I could live here and be very content."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fairytale cottage nestled in a magical garden. It feels as if you enter another world and truly ""get away"" once you enter the gates of this property. But even better- you are minutes from Kirkwood and the IU campus to take care of any business or enjoy restaurants and shops. The host is very easy to work with and responsive. The home is very unique- be sure to read the amenities and host description on the listing- it is accurate. We were very pleased with our visit and would definitely return."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend! Everything was very clean and the gardens are amazing! Hope to stay again some day!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Great location and easy check in process and check out. Host was very responsive.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so cute! Was perfect for two couples to have a serene retreat away from town, but still so easy with a short drive or Uber. Very quiet, lots of parking space, very easy check in process, and good communication. Max was very flexible with us, and this was a great value compared to overpriced hotels in town."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Oasis is an essential stay for Bloomington visitors! You feel like you're stepping into another world. It was a perfect QUIET getaway for my remote work. The bed linens are lovely, and the shower is a treat. The snacks and fruit are a lovely touch, and this is the ideal spot for sustainability-minded guests! I will be renting Oasis again. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a retreat, stay here. It was really stunning to be so close to everything yet feeling like I was in a sanctuary all my own. So clean and well appointed."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet, natural getaway."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely incredible.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I loved staying in the Oasis! This is a special place. The gardens are beautiful, the house so lovingly put together, it's just a wonderful space to be in. Clean and comfortable. I also appreciated the bowl full of organic fruit, muffins, and cookies!! I will definitely return."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Super unique and beautiful gardens and lovely home
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description is completely accurate; this is a hidden oasis within a 5 min drive from the IU campus. My husband and I stayed at Max‚Äôs home when we moved our IU student in for her sophomore year. Max was very communicative and the home was well stocked and welcoming. The home was tucked away and allowed for quiet rest after our long tiring day. We awoke to bird song and had our coffee in the beautiful garden. Our only regret was not having enough time to enjoy the space. We vow to return!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location for a visit to Bloomington. Love all the gardens and sustainability practices! Would definitely stay again. Thank you Max!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I will just confirm previous reviews-- this place is an amazing secluded get-away centrally located in town. Stay here if you can.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's really hard to describe all the wonderful elements here: comfortable beds, charming touches, a luxurious shower, all nestled in the most magical secluded garden you can imagine! Book now, and if possible spend two or three days or more to truly settle in, relax, and fall in love with this wonderful gem. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Oasis is truly an experience of stepping into a different world. If I were to imagine a place where a wild and free heart thrives- it is in a place like Max has created. It‚Äôs so thoughtfully curated and you can feel the love the moment you walk in. Would recommend times 1000.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a beautiful space. The most amazing garden I have ever seen. The inside is absolutely gorgeous too. The home and property is well taken care of and is a hideaway that‚Äôs close to everything in Bloomington.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"One of the best experiences I‚Äôve had, truly enlightening."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. This home is calming and relaxing. The gardens are plentiful, as were hummingbirds, bees and butterflies. Ashes the gray cat is a fan favorite. We felt really safe here and appreciate the opportunity to truly unwind."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Oasis truly is one: a beautiful small cottage in an even more beautiful private garden, located just a few minutes from IU campus. Thanks, Max, for a great stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place hope to come back soon
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place to stay for the weekend! We loved being out in the garden and the house was beautiful to stay in.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peace, comfy beds and plants. Our kids hung out in the hammocks and explored the garden so much. We brought bikes and rode the B-line bike path to Wonderlab (~1 mile) and Switchyard Park (~2 miles, home of an awesome playground and a splash pad). Bloomingfoods was about 0.7 miles away by bike. Super kid-friendly, fun and refreshing for the soul. Thanks, Max!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful grounds
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice relaxing get away
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really cute, clean little cottage in a beautiful setting. It was perfect for our family on our short visit to Bloomington. Everything was as we expected and our kids loved exploring the property."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay in this quirky but quaint cottage. Our son especially enjoyed the hammock outback as well as watching the occasional train go by. The gardens were lovely and The host extremely responsive to his guests. He responded quickly to every request or question.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay. The gardens are beautiful and once you close the gate it truly is an oasis. House was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Was in town for NSO at Bloomington, and will definitely return in the future. Max answered any questions promptly. We enjoyed seeing the cat and our first night at dusk we got to see a racoon! Thanks Max for a great place to unwind after a busy day!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Planes, trains, automobiles, and then..............quiet.
If quiet, peaceful, nature, earth, balance, and harmony are on your wish list, then this is the place for you. Read the details of the owners manual before you book; it's all in there. And if you come away from that reading thinking you've found the right spot, you can't even begin to imagine how right you are!
Not only would I want to stay in Max's Oasis again, I'd like an extended stay of a few months. It's that peaceful!
Close enough to downtown to walk if you're a hiker / walker, and about a 3-minute drive if you prefer to drive.
Highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,4,Group trip,Max was very helpful with giving directions to find his place. We had a peaceful stay and really enjoyed the gardens and greenhouse.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"It truly is an Oasis in every sense of the word. As you step beyond the fence you would not even believe you are still in Indiana. You could easily spend all day lounging around in awe of the meticulously kept grounds. Various plants, shrubs, trees, and birds are all in plain view in an extremely calming matter. We highly recommend and plan on retreating to this Oasis again when we can spend more time on the grounds."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible place! A serene oasis in the midst of a city. It was very private, clean, and had all the amenities we needed. The gardens were absolutely stunning, and we spent most of our time outside. I can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful property. The garden area is amazing. Laying in the hammocks was enjoyable. We did get to see two kitties, which was an added bonus. Loved everything about it. Felt like it was plucked out of a fairytale."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A true getaway, we loved our stay at The Oasis!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"Each day there, we discovered something more amazing in the gardens. We went to Bloomington for a high stress NCAA track championship but were able to decompress once we were back on the Oasis property. Our photos of the blooms, fish pond, and scenic paths were truly incredible. We would love to stay again, someday."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't say enough good things about The Oasis. My son and I stayed here while we checked out houses before our move to Bloomington and it made our ""work"" trip actually relaxing and restorative! This place is close to all the shops and restaurants but feels so unbelievable private. I'm in awe of the gardens and wish to have that kind of talent some day. Fantastic job, Max! This place is a gem!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our host Max was an extremely considerate host, his home was rustic, interesting and beautiful and the gardens and ambience he created at his ""Oasis"" were magnificent."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! I started relaxing the moment I walked through the gate. This is a beautiful spot, clearly crafted with loving care. Highly recommended."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This space is exactly what I imagined for a retreat and oasis. The pictures certainly don‚Äôt begin to do it justice, and the unique and carefully designed combination of indoor and outdoor relaxation areas allowed us to unwind and slow down. The perfect setting for a recharge, and we are so grateful for the opportunity to stay here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We totally agree with all of the previous reviews. This home ""away from home"" is truly magical and accurately described. Don't miss it."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home! A hidden oasis. We will definitely be back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice it‚Äôs gorgeous and such a hidden gem. The location was great pretty close to campus but not too close!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an unexpected retreat into nature! We had every modern convenience while feeling totally removed from the city.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is just what it says - an oasis. Quiet, peaceful, with beautiful gardens outside (that will be much more so in a few weeks, when spring is in full gear) and birds singing. If you want to be in the life of the town, this isn't the place, but if you want a quiet place of your own, with a very short walk into downtown Bloomington, this place is ideal. Max is incredibly accommodating and helpful, and the place is like a little cabin in the woods - it's in a city, but doesn't feel that way. There's a lot of attention to being earth friendly, which I also appreciated. Altogether, just what I needed for a retreat for a few days."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a relaxing, cool, and unique spot. The perfect get-a-way. Would stay again, and would definitely recommend!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful private Oasis! Has everything you need for your little home away from home. Host communication was spot on!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"what a magical place! A step out of the ordinary and into the extraordinary. I appreciated the extra touches such as breakfast foods, snacks, and coffee. My kids and I loved exploring the food forest. Only wish I could have stayed longer."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Max‚Äôs property is beautiful and so serene - I truly didn‚Äôt think about real life once the entire time. Highly recommended.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay/Max‚Äôs place so much.
it‚Äôs so cozy and beautiful.
we had everything we needed (for cooking, showers, blankets and pillows‚Ä¶.)
and hammocking in the greenhouse and wandering the yard/outside space was magic!
anyone who gets time here is lucky :)"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and quiet place! Communication and check in was very easy.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute place about 10 minutes from IU Bloomington!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stepped into the Garden Oasis after a week of business travel and immediately felt my blood pressure drop. It was a cold and rainy February night but Max had a fire going in the wood stove and the house was toasty. Love the cabinetry and plaster walls. Rain turned to snow overnight so the next morning I enjoyed my coffee while exploring the gardens with Ashes the cat. Can't believe this place is so close to downtown Bloomington! Max was a great host, we will definitely be back."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and very lovely property/ house. The host is very nice and responds promptly.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Max‚Äôs home was a delight for our short stay! Best priced in town against other hospitality near by.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the BEST places I have ever stayed at!! Marina was so kind and responsive to all of our needs. She was able to accommodate us for both an early check-in AND a late check-out, which is almost never possible. We were apartment hunting, so we spent a lot of time exploring Bloomington but it was great home-base and we loved the time we spent there. The breakfast was absolutely amazing. Overall, one of my best AirBnB experiences and I would definitely stay here again. Also - her walls are COVERED with vinyl's, so if you love music like us, you could spend hours just browsing through the collection and playing them."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt right at home! Thoughtful, eclectic space in an amazing location. You‚Äôre right on the B-line and just a block away from the square and Kirkwood. Marina provided great instructions and was very timely in her communication. Can‚Äôt forget about the complimentary breakfast, which is basically the cherry on top. We would have zero hesitation in staying here again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Probably one of the cutest bnb‚Äôs I‚Äôve had the chance to stay at. Well kept and cozy with everything we needed at our disposal. Marina was absolutely great! She also provides breakfast which was super convenient. Definitely try out her crepes Saturday morning!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of my best AirBnB experiences. Marina takes great care of her guests, and she was flexible with my needs (gluten free, checking out at the last minute, having a working meeting at breakfast time). She served me a great breakfast every morning. She gave me instructions on parking. She treated me like family! I can't say enough good things about her and this lovely space."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Marina‚Äôs place was outstanding. She made us feel like family when she greeted us when we checked in on Friday. The location is fantastic (walkable to all the great Kirkwood establishments). She made us breakfast each morning as part of our stay which isn‚Äôt something you get at other Airbnb‚Äôs. The omelette she made us on Sunday morning might have been the best omelette I‚Äôve ever had in my life. For anyone visiting Bloomington, I would highly recommend Marina‚Äôs place."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a very pleasant stay.
Marina was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was perfect and personable!
We were in town visiting my son and it was the perfect location, safe, close to shops and restaurants.
The history of the restaurant and the Airbnb is very interesting and it felt nostalgic.
One of my sisters actually and her now husband, used to have date nights at the Le Petit Cafe which they have never forgotten!
All in all we had an enjoyable visit and will come back again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marina‚Äôs place is a Bloomington gem!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay. We stayed warm despite the freezing temperatures. The beds were very comfortable and the apartment was full of books to read, the fridge was stocked with treats, and the bathroom had amenities. Marina was very communicative and Colin was so kind and helpful. The area was a little noisy and you can hear everything that happens on the street below, but overall it was a great place to stay and I‚Äôd stay again."

The place has a ton of charm."

The location is outstanding and playing vinyl records made it special.
Can‚Äôt wait to visit again as we hated to leave."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at Marina's. It was a large space. Bathroom is large and has everything you might need. Bed was comfy and cozy.
Special bonus is breakfast each morning in our room. (In nice weather there's a large deck).
The Air B&B is just steps from the Square and the B-line. Christmas kicked off this weekend and it was great to have free parking and easy access to the festivities."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We just completed another weekend stay at Marina‚Äôs and enjoyed ourselves immensely. We parked the car on Friday and didn‚Äôt return to it until time to head home Sunday. That‚Äôs the thing about this place you can walk to so many wonderful restaurants, shops and attractions. Marina‚Äôs French breakfast each morning is the cherry on top!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina's place and Marina herself were lovely and accommodating. Her breakfasts were incredible and her airbnb was clean, fully functional and private. I would highly recommend staying here!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Where do I even begin?
Marina was the kindest host I‚Äôve ever had: very responsive, gracious, and friendly.

I loved the vibe of the place with plenty of space but still cozy. Hope to be back again soon."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived at her lovely property. The location is ideal, there is metered street parking right out front, and the apartment itself will make you feel like you‚Äôre living in a cool Parisian record shop. The best part of the stay was Marina herself. She went out of her way to bring us breakfast every morning and was so friendly and interesting to talk to. If you‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll get to stay here once in your lifetime!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marina was very kind and gave me lots of clear information about parking, where to find restaurants, and the space in general. She also provided a tasty breakfast in the morning, delivered right to the door at my chosen time! The space was nice and open, but still cozy with lots of records to listen to and books to read. It looked just like the photos and was located in an area that was easy to find and near to lots of restaurants and shops. While my stay was short, it was very pleasant and I highly recommend Marina's place for anyone traveling through Bloomington."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina was a fabulous host, made us a yummy breakfast from her lovely restaurant each morning. The space is exactly as described. Fun and eclectic with a great patio to relax on. Perfect for a short stay, will definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a fun, unique place above a French restaurant Le Petite Cafe. The hosts Marina and Frank were super awesome in that they were friendly, accommodating and super hospitable. The apartment was clean and comfortable in a safe, walkable neighborhood close to the square and many shops and restaurants. A fun perk was they had a record player and shelves of vinyl in which to listen to a variety of music.
The hostess was real kind and offered to feed me on several occasions. The food they offered from their business was delicious! This will be my go-to place when I'm back in B-town."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely host lovely stay üëçüëçüëç
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you go to Bloomington I highly suggest staying with Marina right above her Restaurant Le petit caf√©. She provides French breakfast with the stay. It is right next-door to Bloomingfoods and super close to the courthouse, the B line and Sat farmers market. We had such a charming time chatting with her."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina was an absolute delight to meet! I‚Äôm so grateful for the experience of staying at her place. Her breakfasts were delicious! Also, for those wondering, the staircase to the downstairs is completely walled off. Such an amazing experience!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! Marina was very kind and welcoming. We enjoyed the private, eclectic space. We even played a few records from Marina's vast collection. We hope to return again soon!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! Marina is an excellent host.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marina was a gracious host and the place was exactly as described.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay with Marina. The location is convenient for walking to downtown restaurants and for walking or a short drive to the IU campus. Her breakfast is amazing. We plan to stay with Marina again next time we visit Bloomington.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this apartment is fantastic. Marina is a superb host. The location is near caf√©s, restaurants, shopping, the IU campus, and public transportation. Also the B-Line multiuser trail! Marina‚Äôs breakfasts are delicious! We loved being able to choose from the many LPs in the room and play them on the turntable. We loved our stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina is a very approachable and friendly person. She does not seem to mind going out of her way to help her guests. The Frenchy breakfasts she provided me during my stay were delicious ‚Äì such a perk.
The location of this place is a block from the downtown center, and it takes about a 10-minute walk to reach the IU front entrance, perfect for my short legs. The Bloomington Food market is right next door, and there are restaurants, eateries, and shopping within a 5-minute walk. Additionally, there's a Bloomington Public Parking garage just around the corner from the rental with a low cost of 50 cents per hour, available 24/7.
The unit is situated above Le Petit Cafe, with its own entrance on the left-hand side. Once you get inside the gate, a set of stairs leads up to a spacious deck and the entrance to the unit, which can be found directly ahead. I felt safe here and will definitely return when I come to visit my son (who is attending IU) again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marina is sweet and kind. A pleasure to deal with.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marina was a warm and personable host. She was responsive to all emails and texts. The best was breakfast!!! Homemade and super delicious!
The apartment was just as described with lots of helpful instructions. Comfortable and cozy! And, right downtown- one block from Kirkwood and less than a 10 minute walk to the campus‚Äô historic gates!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First, this review came from my husband and children since somewhat last minutes I wasn‚Äôt able to be in Bloomington with my family also.
From the beginning Marina was easy to communicate with. Always prompt and detailed with her replies. Check-in was clear and quite flexible on the time.
My family said that the room was good, Marina was very nice, food was excellent, and bed was comfy.
The location is very central to downtown amenities and not far also to walk to the university.
I do hope that I can experience Marina‚Äôs hospitality when we visit our daughter in the near future. Thank you for being gracious and understanding with our oldest change of heart to spend more time with her family than the dorm room and for the key.
In summary, highly recommend Marina‚Äôs home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful location, very quiet with many local restaurants around. The town is very walkable and we had a wonderful time.

My family enjoyed our stay and will be returning."

We enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere, the very comfortable accommodations, and Marina's recommendations for the area, including parking.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful weeklong stay! A perfect location for accessing IU. And what a great abode. Comfy bed, interesting decor, nice shower and amazingly peaceful and quiet in the midst of the bustle of Bloomington. I especially appreciated being next to both the b-line trail (great for walks) and Bloomingfoods (nice salad/soup bar for evenings when I just wanted to stay put). And the amazing record collection you can play to your heart‚Äôs content. And Marina is such an exquisite and welcoming hostess! And her daily breakfast offerings are superb. Just the best of hospitality!"

The space was even cuter than the photos showed and the location could not have been better. Right off the b-line trail and very walkable, yet the place itself was private and quiet. She even brought us an amazing breakfast right to our door in the morning! A bonus was the huge collection of records we were free to peruse, we had a lovely evening on the porch listening to jazz. I couldn't recommend Marina's place more, it was one of the best airbnb experiences we have had."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great host, Would like to do it all over again. Across the street from Zagrebs and right in the b-line trail!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best airbnb I've ever had. Great location--within walking distance of so much. Parking might be a problem for some, but we were there mostly when the parking was free, so it wasnt an issue for us. Marina was fantastic. So nice and welcoming. The breakfast was a huge plus. Simple but so delicious. The space was very comfortable. Will def always look for this space when we come back to Bloomington."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If this place is open, book it, it‚Äôs the most perfectly Bloomington place to stay. You‚Äôll have windows open, breeze flowing in and records playing as folks walk and bike under your window on their way to the farmer‚Äôs market. The best of both downtown and campus are also a chill walk away, and when you find your way back you can wind down with wine on the deck. Marina is a flawless host and her breakfast are so thoughtful. This is the kind of place AirBNB was invented for."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our brief stay at Marinas. Loved the record. collection! King sized bed was very comfortable. Marina ihad helpful suggestions about the area.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina made us feel right at home with helpful parking instructions, a quick walkthrough, and reminders/notes placed throughout the space. We enjoyed the wide range of records made available from their collection, homemade breakfast in the mornings, and the personal touches that made the space one of a kind. The proximity to the downtown square made our entire weekend a walkable one and allowed us to park our car and leave it for the entire weekend. We plan to stay here next time we visit Bloomington!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an excellent place to stay in Bloomington. It is right on the B-Line trail and you can walk easily to downtown, campus, the farmer‚Äôs market when it‚Äôs in season, etc. The homemade and hand-delivered breakfast is a lovely perk! There is a large record collection, games, coffee, tea, and many other things to make your stay comfortable. The owner is very friendly. I will absolutely stay here again when I am visiting the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marina was wonderful! Accommodations were so much more than we expected. Would definitely return!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marina was a fantastic host! She was so personable and overall very friendly. The place was eclectic but neat. We enjoyed the coffee maker in the morning and record player with hundreds of records to choose from. We walked just down the street to the blue bird for a concert and then several bars/restaurants afterward. Nothing was more than a 10 minute walk! Our only complaint would be the parking which is metered or a 5 minute walk for free overnight. The best part was freshly cooked breakfast brought right to our door and very little clean up required of us. Definitely worth it for this great host, perfect location, and wonderful place to sleep. We highly recommend :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was in Bloomington on a short business trip and truly enjoyed my stay with Marina! The apartment is super cozy and comfortable and her breakfasts were divine.

She communicated well, answering any questions and she was incredibly accomodating. She included breakfast and had no problem preparing a GF breakfast for me, since I have celiac. The place itself was so cool. Cannot beat the location. I visited my son and was able to walk everywhere. She also provided useful tips for where to park. I'm only sorry we discovered this place the year my son graduates from IU. Wish I would've been staying there all 4 years while he was in college. Highly recommend."

We were attending events on the university campus and loved that it was just a short drive away. We were very comfortable in the space and Marina really has thought of everything we might have needed for our stay. Though the parking was a little tricky, Marina‚Äôs detailed instructions made it easy to manage because I knew what to expect.

She has helpful notes about her space to guide you through your stay, she‚Äôs thought of everything! She is very responsive with communication.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I were selfish, I would tell you all to stay away, that the space is too small, too noisy, overpriced, and far away from the main spots in town!
But alas, I am not. Marina's place is one of my favorite airbnb experiences ever, and if I have even the slightest hint that I will be back in Bloomington, I will look first to book this charming loft well in advance!! Walked in looking for a nice place to stay. Walked away with the feeling that I was leaving a friend. The location is perfect. You can walk to just about anything that downtown has to offer. You're a short drive to campus. Marina will fix breakfast for you. There's a co-op fresh market next door, and a street fair / market just a block away on Saturday (at least there was when I was there!). Absolutely wonderful experience that I cannot recommend highly enough!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have chosen to make this my homebase whenever I‚Äôm in Bloomington if it‚Äôs available. I come to visit my son a few times a year and I prefer to stay at no other Airbnb but this one! Thank you again for everything Marina!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and sweet spot. Hospitable hosts.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What is there to say that everyone already hasn't? This is one of my favorite Airbnb rentals. The location is amazing. Marina is even more amazing. And given both of those, the price is amazing. I've stayed here 3 times and have enjoyed it each and every time. Would and will come back."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,the apartment is lovely and Marina is delightful!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for Graduation Weekend May 2022 and to add to the fun filled, busy, emotional weekend was the stay at Marina's comfortable apartment. It was a perfect location to all . Marina was a friendly thoughtful host and served us delicious breakfast each morning. Would highly recommend to all."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina was a perfect host. The apartment was fantastic- we loved the wood floors and ceilings, the numerous records, the delicious breakfasts served to our door each morning, and the great private balcony. The location is perfect, too- we were able to walk everywhere. Will definitely be back next time we visit bloomington!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina is a jewel, she really cares. Convenient location, beautiful place, and her breakfasts were wonderful!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marina‚Äôs place is perfect for anyone wanting to visit Bloomington or IU. The location makes everything within walking distance. The description of the room is spot on so make sure you have read all the details. It is the perfect place for a couple or very close friends. Marina‚Äôs breakfast was outstanding and I cannot wait to go back to try more at the restaurant.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Second stay at Marina‚Äôs and loved it both times!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can‚Äôt recommend this stay enough‚ÄîMarina has thought of everything and the food is delicious! We had such a magical and relaxing weekend.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a couple looking to stay close to downtown and campus. The apartment was very quaint comfortable, convenient, and we couldn‚Äôt ask for a better host in Marina. She was extremely accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. We looked forward to her morning breakfasts! The apartment has a fridge, microwave, & coffee maker and those were perfect for our stay. The only drawback is you don‚Äôt have your own parking space but we were able to take advantage of the free parking a few blocks away. We will definitely be staying here again!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina, the host, and this location were top notch! Absolutely beautiful stay, extremely cute abode, and the perfect location. I cannot stess enough: if you are visiting Bloomington, this is the Air BnB to stay at. Not to mention hand made breakfasts in the morning :)"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host! Perfect location! Such a lovely spot to stay in Bloomington! Hope to be back very soon!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this place.
This place is great. I wish I could give it six stars.
The little apartment is exactly how the listing describes it: great location; cute, sweet place; great decor; it is small, but if your party is comfortable with each other, it easily sleeps four people; breakfast is delicious; and the host is a kind and generous soul!
We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an all around gem of a stay. Great location, cool loft space, delicious breakfast, and perfectly hospitable host! The space has a really cozy vibe, is well designed and stocked and Marina was so welcoming but not too in your space- just the right amount of communication. Tip- do not pass up the included breakfast! Marina knows what she is doing and can even cater to your dietary needs. We actually live in the area but needed a place to lay our heads for a few nights. We now have a place to recommend when friends or family come to town!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Marina was a gracious host and very accommodating for our needs. She served us personalized breakfast every morning and was always quick to respond with any of our questions or needs. The location is ideal and centrally located within walking distance to shops and restaurants. We also enjoyed access to a private deck while sipping our morning coffee and nighttime stargazing.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt emphasize this enough, this was the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve had and I cannot recommend it more. Marina might be one of the most caring and helpful people I have met, and she made a stressful week less hectic with her kindness. Breakfast was delicious - and I‚Äôll never forget that. The location is prime for Bloomington with less than a 5 minute walk to groceries, antique shops, restaurants, and shopping. 100% must stay"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location downtown. A local grocery store is right next door for many last minute needs. Amazing value and Marina was a very warm host!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at! Lovely hosts, great place and delicious breakfast provided!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic little loft apartment over a French restaurant at the heart of downtown Bloomington. There are so many things to rave about: the massive record collection spanning jazz, classical, folk, and rock; the 1-minute walk to Bloomingfoods grocery; the comfortable, bohemian vibes of the room; the proximity to the B-Line Trail, restaurants, coffee shops, and parking; the kind and most hospitable owners. Given the history of Le Petit Cafe and Marina and Patrick's time in the city, the stay is also a welcome history lesson into B-Town food and culture. Would love to stay here again."
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Cool space w heaps of records and comfy beds. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to enjoy the breakfast but I will for sure next time we visit

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My second time at Marina and Patrick‚Äôs place in Bloomington - the fond memories have only deepened; the breakfast has only gotten more delicious; the record collection even more fun to search through. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, stylish accommodation just a few blocks from the heart of Bloomington."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best away-from-home experience I‚Äôve ever had!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place right next to downtown with great food!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had the best time and loved our stay at Marina‚Äôs unique place. It‚Äôs why we love to use Airbnb and this was one of our all time favorites. We couldn‚Äôt have been more comfortable and the location is ideal for enjoying an easy walk to downtown and campus. As others have mentioned the breakfast was devine. You can‚Äôt go wrong staying here!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best stays we‚Äôve ever experienced with Airbnb. The location is perfect for walking a short distance to interesting locally owned businesses for shopping, food, and drinks. The apartment was absolutely amazing. Lots of cool records, books, a couple guitars, and history to enjoy any down time with while taking breaks from exploring. Marina is an excellent hostess. Very knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations about Bloomington and neighboring Nashville. She and her husband, Patrick, are wonderfully hospitable. They made us feel comfortable and at home. We look forward to booking a stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place. Great location. Very kind people and delicious breakfast.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,All around Perfect ü§©
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space is as described and the location can not be beat. Everything else (the breakfast and Marina) are just the cherry on top of this wonderful Bloomington Sundae.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nothing to add
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was so lovely! It's within walking distance of dozens of restaurants and shops, and right next door to the food co-op. It's cozy and comfortable, and we really loved listening to Marina's eclectic collection of LP's (there are easily over 1000 records!). The breakfast was delicious and Marina was delightful! It's a perfect place to stay, whether you want to explore Bloomington or just chill out in the apartment."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay with Marina. It was very easy to communicate with her and accessing the unit was very easy. The location is AMAZING and so close to very fun spots on the square in Bloomington. It is a large space perfect for a large party and the breakfast provided was delicious, such a great addition!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marina and her airbnb are absolutely FABULOUS! Easily the best airbnb experience I've ever had. I was back in Bloomington with my college friends for the first time in 5 years, and all we wanted to do was stay in the airbnb and listen to records because the place is so cozy! It's walkable to basically everything and Marina's breakfasts are no joke. She does not skimp on the brie! Marina is kind and friendly and ensured we had a wonderful experience. We're already planning on coming back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a lovely stay! Unusually quiet spot in the heart Bloomington. I found the lack of kitchen quiet relaxing. Marina herself provides a SPECTACULAR breakfast to your door and not only are there too many amazing restaurants within walking distance to miss cooking there is also a grocery next door with great hours. Same with no television - who needs it with access to such a phenomenal record collection! My daughter and I spent our down time taking turns on the turntable and talking about our favorite songs. This spot couldn‚Äôt have been any more perfect. All of what you need and less of what you don‚Äôt when you need to relax and escape. Thank you for your Hoosier hospitality direct from France!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay in Bloomington... great location and the hospitality was amazing!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was my favorite airbnb stay. It was perfect, it was comfortable, and I just absolutely loved it. My baby was safe and felt at home. Everything was so nice. Marina was a great host. (:"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnb‚Äòs, and this is definitely one of my favorites! I want to try to stay here every time I‚Äôm in Bloomington. The apartment was adorable and cozy, the beds were comfy, it was spacious and Marina was such a gracious and kind host. The breakfast was phenomenal every morning. I highly recommend this location."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I reserved Marina‚Äôs AirB&B for my guests from TX. Their experience was nothing short of over-the-top accommodations & Marina was very welcoming. I would recommend her AirB&B without any hesitation.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved it here! There is a farmers market within walking distance. The host makes you feel like family and is the sweetest person!

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"This is just what we needed for our family while we were in town for an IU graduation. The accommodations were so comfortable and very clean. From well-stocked kitchen needs to super soft bathroom towels, we had everything we needed. Would stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely LOVED staying in Jon and Mary‚Äôs home!! It was so beautiful and inviting. The kitchen and large tv in the living room was great. Also loved the bed to the right of the living room it was so comfy being able to watch some tv from there. The showers were great and really appreciate all the free toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, laundry detergent, dryer sheets, etc!! Really appreciate that!! Mary and Jon were so incredibly kind when i needed to stay another day. Thank you for everything and I will definitely be back!!"
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"Host are amazing and great to work with, location Is within walking distance to everywhere. Unit itself is very clean extremely nice. Only complaint is ,it is advertised as two bedrooms. I would not consider the bed in the main living area a bedroom, overall fantastic place to stay we will definitely be back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay here. The communication was excellent, even letting us check-in a little bit before we were supposed to. They also left some granola bars, coffee pods & soap/shampoo for the showers, which was great.
As a quick heads up, the second bedroom isn't really a full bedroom - it's more of an alcove with a big curtain separating it from the living room. But it has its own closet, and the curtain is plenty large to feel like it's a separated space. It wasn't a problem for us, but should probably be described a bit more explicitly in the description in case that's an issue for someone else.
We greatly enjoyed our stay though! Would recommend."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great and perfect for our moms weekend at IU. Mary was always responsive and willing to help and I would highly recommend this place as somewhere to stay, very worth it!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my husband stayed here for our anniversary. The place was great, lots of amenities, walkable to lots of shops and restaurants. You do have to climb stairs to get to the units, not sure if there is an elevator for those who would need it. I would recommend this stay and would consider booking again in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We very much enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend staying here! The space was lovely and comfortable. We were a group of 3 adults and 2 small children and had everything we needed and found lots to do near by, all within walking distance. Jon & Mary were very helpful and responsive during our stay and we would certainly stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing stay, great hosts. My family felt at home. We have already made a reservation for August, when my son starts his 2nd year at IU. Highly recommend Joe & Mary‚Äôs place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot right in town. Very walkable area, it‚Äôs cute, clean and very comfortable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as advertised. We stayed for a few nights to tour IU and it was very comfortable and cozy. The location was walkable to both campus and downtown restaurants and shops. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to bring earplugs because the street traffic could be loud at times. We would stay again next time we come to Bloomington. Thank you!"

I highly recommend this place.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and walkable to IU campus and all the restaurants and bars etc in Bloomington. Nice and clean place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed the whole week at this charming Bloomington apartment. Easy to walk to campus, bars, restaurants, shops, etc. We hope to stay here again in the near future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jon and Mary were great hosts. Very proactive with instructions. We were flying from Boston and arrived hours before the scheduled check in and they were happy to let us check in early which was very helpful. The location is amazing. Easy walk downtown.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's a lovely place, in easy walking distance to Bloomington's restaurants to the immediate west of campus. It's on Walnut, which is a busy street by Bloomington standards, but the traffic dies down by the time most people retire for the night. The bedroom abuts a common wall so one has to depend on the adjoining unit's habitants' being quiet, which they eventually were. I'd stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super friendly hosts! Location is great and is within a 15 minute walk to anywhere you would go for a weekend in btown (besides the stadium)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fit 3 of us with plenty of room. Walking distance to anything downtown, extremely clean and comfortable."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Sabrina's place! It was the cleanest air bnb I've stayed in, and it felt very cozy inside. We appreciated the privacy of the entrance and parking as well."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space was clean and new-ish. The sofa and bed were comfy. The bathroom had everything it should. We did not cook, but the kitchen also seemed right. The neighborhood is quiet. Bloomington is small enough that there was no place we wanted to go that was more than 10 minutes' drive. Check-in and check-out were both easy and as described.
The host was excellent. We asked if we could have an earlier check-in time to be able to make an engagement. She responded within minutes and cheerfully met our request.
If our travels were to take us to Bloomington again, we would be happy to stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was our first trip together as a couple. This cozy nest was perfect !! It‚Äôs small but very comfortable, well done, well decorated and well supplied.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sabrina‚Äôs place was perfect for my stay as I had to help my daughter move her belongings out of her dorm at IU.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"A wonderfully cozy little space to stay the night after the total solar eclipse in 2024. Close to downtown and campus. Just watch your head if you're on the ""short"" side of the sofa or bed!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We've stayed at Sabrina's place before, and it was our first choice for this trip. She's friendly, and always goes above-&-beyond. For instance, it was quite cold the day we arrived, and she took special care to be sure that her steps were free of any icy build-up. Her apartment is spotlessly clean, close to campus and to many fun restaurants, and very comfortable. Not sure why you'd want to stay anywhere else."

The bed is very comfortable, the shower is nice, the kitchen is well equipped, the living room is comfortable, and there‚Äôs a closet for stashing bags/gear! It was terribly hot when we were there, so we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the porch very much, but it would be really fun on a nice day. As for the sharply angled ceiling that several people have mentioned, we didn‚Äôt find it to be any problem once we got used to it. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone staying in the area."

Clean, well-stocked, amazing shower, a/c and kitchen amenities. ONLY downside was the low slanted ceilings (especially for a tall person) in the bedroom and living room areas, but that's common for a loft. Would absolutely stay there again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for graduation. It was a really cute place and Bree was so nice and responsive. She even left us two bottles of champagne to celebrate. It is teeny tiny but it is very comfortable and clean. I loved the little porch for my morning coffee and the bed was super comfortable. Graduation hotels and Airbnbs are almost illegally priced so while it was expensive, it was not out of the norm for the area!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely LOVED staying here! The place was so peaceful, very comfortable, and it felt cozy! The porch was adorable. I truly felt at home! Bree was always very responsive, had very helpful information. She was also very understanding and helpful about my check in. I feel this place is absolutely perfect!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little place! Would highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Immaculate and peaceful. Great location for mom‚Äôs weekend. We even had a chance to meet Bree who was lovely to work with!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little place was perfect! It had all the essentials, and Bree was incredibly flexible and welcoming during my stay. The bed and pillows exceeded my expectations. More than enough cabinet and closet space. I was surprised at the efficiency in design, it made it feel much bigger, and I didn‚Äôt feel cramped in the least. I enjoyed the covered patio. Overlooking the hills of
Bloomington, while strategically built for privacy, it was nice to sit and do some remote work during the day."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot for a quick trip to bloomington. She was very flexible with an early check in and I loved the cozy little balcony porch with lights.
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I loved the place, it‚Äôs a perfect spot for the week while meeting clients. Space is put together very nicely along with all amenities that I could think of like q-tips, bandaids, fresh towels etc.
The only flaw is the mattress is on the floor without much support. Unfortunately for someone who needs extra support I woke up sore.
Otherwise this would be an easy rebooking for me. Cheers!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,10/10 recommend. Modern design and very clean. Instructions were easy and host was responsive. Couple minutes away from the stadium and 10$ Uber from downtown‚Ä¶ will book again if I go to the area
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice! We enjoyed our 2 day stay! Very quiet and cozy neighborhood that is super close to everything fun. Bree was very helpful with my ‚Äúplanning‚Äù and was also very understanding when I broke her picture frame! Allowed me to replace it with no issues and worries. Thank you again for allowing us to stay! :)
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough good things about this place. It is 100% as it looks in the pictures. It's one of the cleanest Airbnbs I've ever stayed at.
The low ceilings are a bit tricky to get used to...I hit my head once getting into the bed, but it didn't do it again. Lol This does present an issue if someone has physical limitations. The bed is simply laying straight on the floor. I rolled onto the floor, then got up. It didn't bother us, but it could definitely limit others.
The bottles of water that Bree had in the fridge for us when we arrived was such a welcome sight. The freezer door has all the wi-fi info, check-out instructions, etc. Check-in and out was so smooth.
There was facial cleanser, body wash, q-tips, and even dental picks in the bathroom. The shower was plenty big...even had a wooden bench in it. My little nit pick is that the water pressure isn't the best.
The price couldn't be beat for this little hidden gem. I 1000% recommend this place and thank you Bree!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place. It was a little smaller than we originally thought but it was very cozy and pretty.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was a great place to stay for a couple nights. Bright and airy, very clean. Host was responsive. Such a calm place. Bed was very comfortable. Just be careful not to bump your head on the slanted ceiling!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and easy to follow instructions. The description and pictures accurately matched the space.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the tiny house! It's located in a serene area that offers a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. The modern and clean interior of the house made us feel right at home. Bree, the host, was fantastic to communicate with and respected our privacy, while still being available if we needed anything. The location was ideal as it's just a few minutes away from IU and downtown Bloomington, but being nestled in the a quaint wooded neighborhood gave us a sense of tranquility that we wouldn't have found in town. We're already planning our next visit and can't wait to stay at Bree's place again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great AirBNB! Had everything needed. Comfortable bed. Close to town and university. Good running and nature nearby. Enjoyed my stay!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed the place. 100% would come again. Also, would recommend to anybody looking to come to Bloomington."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Bee‚Äôs place was comfortable and super clean. She was very easy to communicate with and very kind. Her place was exactly as described. Bed was comfortable but if you have a difficult time with a low bed, be advised as it sits very close to the floor. We‚Äôd definitely stay again. Thanks Bee for sharing your home!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! Definitely going back
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute! We didn‚Äôt spend much time in the actual rental as we were here to visit friends, but it was a great place to crash. Everything was clean and tidy. Nicely decorated. However, if you are tall this place may not be ideal as the ceiling has a slope towards the bed/couch. But don‚Äôt let that deter you from a nice clean space!!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I went to an IU women's basketball game. Since tip off was 6:30pm, we wanted to spend the day in Bloomington & not have a long drive homer. Sabrina's place was perfect. It was clean, comfortable, & close to all sorts of restaurants, coffee shops, pubs, and campus.

We hope to stay at Sabrina's whenever we're back in the Bloomington area."

Extremely clean and as pictured in the photos. I had a wonderful night‚Äôs rest and treated myself to a cup of coffee with the provided French Press. Very responsive for anything you might need.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bree's place is decorated beautifully. It is a small space, but great for 2-3 people. The decor choices make it seem roomy. Be mindful that the ceiling slopes! You have to duck to go to bed or sit on the couch, and we hit our heads a few times (our fault)! Overall Bree was very clear in her directions so we did not need to contact her for anything further! Great value and super close to downtown!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay and welcoming space.
2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"adorable, well-equipped, cozy space. Bree was responsive to any needs and even went above and beyond leaving out some bike cleaning tools for us. one singular warning, is mind the slanted ceiling! it's easy to bump your head. otherwise, great stay!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was clean and well laid out! so much fun to see how this ""tiny home"" was layed out. It had everything we needed.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nick has a beautiful home with everything that anyone could need for a short or long stay. His updates and remodels were appropriate and convenient and providing a warm and cozy atmosphere. The kitchen was well stocked and had everything you needed to make good home-cooked meals. Bathrooms and bedrooms were comfortable, and the bidet was a big hit with my family. We truly enjoyed our stay here and would come again in a heartbeat. If you're looking for a place to stay through travel or visit well visiting the beautiful city of Bloomington look no further than Nick. Thank you so very much for all the effort time and energy that you poured into this beautiful home."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed one night,Good place for our last minute quick one night stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This review is based on the great price we paid for our stay and the close distance to IU. The house was cute, very cozy, and even though it's an older house, it was clean. The amenities were fantastic - so much more than I've had at previous Airbnb's! The shower was glorious - great pressure and the water felt so soft! The mattresses were good, but bed linens need to be upgraded. Some other little things: towels were nice; AC was nice and cool; spare pillows were easy to find; old house = uneven floors, but we managed. The neighborhood was aesthetically questionable, but we still felt safe. Can't beat the location to IU - just minutes down the road! Very kind and helpful host, would stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was great and easy to get to, the appliances were all in good condition."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks Nick. Appreciate your place and your kind help!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Andrew and Amy's place! It was clean, well-equipped and comfortable. We spent some of our time in Bloomington and some over in Brown County, so it was nice to be close enough to get to both places.
Andrew and Amy were great hosts: the place was set up perfectly for our arrival and their communication was good throughout our stay. We would highly recommend it if you are looking for a place to get away and want to stay in the Bloomington/Brown County area!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Andrew and Amy‚Äôs place was lovely. It was spotless and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked with all the utensils we could need.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great little place. About 20 minutes outside of Bloomington. The drive to the place through country roads isn't terrible, but be careful once the sun starts setting.
The basement apartment is all around comfortable and very nice. The mattress is particularly comfortable: memory foam, semi-firm. Be aware that this is a basement, so if anyone is upstairs you might hear their footsteps."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem. It is very clean and beautifully decorated with a well-stocked kitchen. It is convenient enough to Bloomington and the IU campus. There is a hammock on the patio, which was great for kicking back after a busy day. Amy and Andrew are attentive hosts, and I when I left Bloomington, I felt a little sad because we weren't staying longer. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute little basement apartment settled about 15 minutes from town. Look forward to using this place again when visiting Bloomington!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time and would book again in the future. Andrew & Amy communicated well and provided feedback on questions we had about the area.

Thanks!"

I love the aesthetic and how creative the space was - would definitely love to stay again when in the area for a longer time.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this place! I've stayed in quite a lot of airbnbs, some great, some ok, and some not ok, but this one was among my most favourites. One of the best places that I have ever stayed in, and I highly recommend it. It is quirky with a very cool and fun interior design. It's bigger than it looks like in the pictures, well maintained and very clean, and great value for money (very affordable for what it is). Ian is a great host and went above and beyond helping to make my stay easy and hassle free. Extra points for the balcony, which was lovely to hang out and read a book in the evening."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Close to pretty much everything and comfortable all around!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The space is adorable. It's quirky just like Bloomington. It is even bigger and cuter in person. Ian was very friendly and responsive. We will book here next time we visit Bton.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ian was an excellent host who welcomed my partner and I as we visited Bloomington prior to a move. He was super quick to respond to any question we had and very accommodating and flexible with our every changing needs.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, very accessible & well connected - a great pick if you're visiting Bloomington."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a few days to attend our son's recital at IU's music school. Ian's place was very close to both campus and downtown, easily walkable. We had a wonderful time, it is located in a quiet picturesque neighborhood and has every amenity. The unit was very cozy and comfortable, and the decor was interesting and eclectic. The porch is a great place to hand out for morning coffee or an evening nightcap. We really felt at home. We loved our stay and would absolutely stay there again when visiting Bloomington, and we highly recommend it."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this is a funky place that perfectly met our needs for the eclipse. The one drawback is the bed is not very comfy although I slept perfectly fine.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stylish, pretty apartment with cute funky touches like chalkboard walls to draw upon, handmade concrete surfaces, a shelf of games/books, and tons of great art. Quiet location near IU (host does have children that you may hear from time to time downstairs, but I didn't find this to be a problem.) Hosts are friendly and respond quickly to any issues. I plan to stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place for my short stay in Bloomington! The space looks cool in pictures, but was way cooler in person - and also so comfortable and homey. Checking in/out was easy and smooth, and Ian was communicative and clear!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely time in this Bloomington abode. Super close to campus, downtown, and plenty of food! Hosts were kind and communicative. A great deal all the way around."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This suite is spacious and comfortable! It is much larger than it looks in the photos - lots of space to spread out! The kitchen has all the conveniences one needs, and the living space is comfortable with a desk to work at (convenient plugs and lighting) and a comfy couch. The bed is tucked into a nook but a good size, and a very comfortable mattress. I especially appreciate the full length mirror! The bathroom is also spacious with good lighting and water pressure.
All in all the location is easy walking distance to IU campus, quiet and safe, and street parking wasn‚Äôt an issue to find. I was able to park on the same block as the house every time I returned.
Highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Could not have found a better spot for our short stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Vintage Bones. So charming and homey, with quirky art and furnishings and lots of character. Never met Ian but he was responsive and helpful.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing home in a great location, we were only ever 5 minutes at most from anywhere in bloomington and for the price it really can't be beat.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun place to stay in - cozy, inviting and charming! Very close to my son‚Äôs house so really conveniently located for me. Everything I needed - well appointed. Would def stay again if my son wasn‚Äôt graduating in 2 months."

Photos did not do justice to how nice the apartment was. High ceilings, spacious rooms and up-to date amenities. Comfortable furniture. Very clean bathroom. Lots of natural light. We brought our 12 year-old dog and she was so relaxed and comfortable here. Exterior stairs were well-constructed and easy for her to use. Ian was a friendly and helpful host, as well!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wish I could've stayed longer in this beautiful space! The pictures don't even do the decor justice, it's even more fun and quirky in person. I loved only being a 5 minute drive from downtown, but the neighborhood seemed quiet and walkable. Ian was responsive, had clear instructions over message and in the space, and gave me some good local recommendations. Would definitely stay here again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying at Ian‚Äôs. I travel to Bloomington a few times a year and I‚Äôd have to say his place is one of my favorites. The location, decor, and proximity to everything downtown make it a great place."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vintage Bones was a wonderful place to spend a week in Bloomington.

I would highly recommend staying here if anyone was planning on staying in Bloomington at any point!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mr. Ian is a responsible and dedicated host, and the guest suite is exceptionally comfortable. The overall decoration creates a warm and adorable atmosphere!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You had me at Mister Rogers nightlight! Pictures do not do this place justice! Coolest.Place.Ever. I only wish I had found it sooner. Seriously, this place was on my bucket list and I didn't even know it! Unique, eclectic, nostalgic, just really no words to describe this place. If we didn't have plans for most of our trip, I could've spent hours looking around at all of the neat things and drawing on the walls. Excellent communication and had everything we could possibly need and then some. If you are on the fence about booking this place, don't hesitate for another second or you're missing out. Thank you so much, Ian, for sharing your home with us and I absolutely cannot wait to come back. I'd give it a million stars if I could!"

I travel a LOT for business and stay at a lot of Airbnbs. Sadly it‚Äôs rare these days that one finds a place with a well-stocked kitchen, everything you could possibly need (yup, sugar for one‚Äôs coffee seems like a no-brainer but you‚Äôd be surprised how many places don‚Äôt even provide that!) - and more.
Ian‚Äôs sense of fun and interesting design made this place even better.
Great bed, too!
Thanks for a restful, quiet stay."

Ian proactively communicated and was OK with me checking in a bit early. They have a super helpful guide for guests with menus, etc.
The property is exactly as pictured and described. It‚Äôs a cozy section of the home‚Äôs 2nd floor. There is off street, assigned parking which is a plus in a college town. I loved the he quirky touches throughout the unit. I was happy to leave my mark on the chalkboard and to make a canvas to leave.

Featuring an intimate balcony deck, the space itself is an infusion of art and functional design. From the layout to the unique artwork and custom furnishings, it's obvious much thought and love went into creating this space. We also loved that the space was fully stocked. It seems that Ian and his wife have thought of just about everything, even little details like a coffee grinder or a fully tricked out medicine cabinet. There were so many cool surprises and personal touches. Though you are in the burbs, it feels secluded. At the same time you are just a couple-o-minutes away from downtown and all the great restaurants, gastro-pubs, and nite life that Bloomington has to offer. In summary, it was an awesome experience. We have already put this destination down in our travel book for the future. We will be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect spot to stay in Bloomington, close to campus, but in a quiet neighborhood. The apartment was exactly as listed, and Ian and Jill had great communication and were warm and welcoming.

Hope to visit again and see how the chalk wall has evolved!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I reserved this spot for my brother to stay when he came to visit me in Bloomington, and it's an extremely cute little apartment. We've stayed in several cookie-cutter-looking places in the past, whereas this, with all the concrete countertops, tabletops, and decorations poured on-site by the host, felt like a stunning and unique place to stay. I'll be checking to see if this is available the next time I have a friend or relative visiting!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Ian‚Äôs home is unique and lovely. We could tell that someone put a lot of effort into making it a great place to stay. Ian also allowed us to check out late which was such a life saver!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I stopped here for the first night of a 10 day road trip with my dog. Check in instructions were spot on and we made it in with no issues (other than my dog deciding that the steps leading up to the deck/entrance were quite scary and I had to make several attempts to get him to join me). Location was close enough to downtown without too many noisy neighbors or much traffic. The people living on the first floor did have children and a dog, so don‚Äôt expect complete silence, but nothing too major. The only big difference I noticed from the listing was that the back yard did not have any grass of note, which made letting my dog out to pee a little tricky. The yard is now covered in stone with some dirt surrounding the stone filled center. It ended up raining most of the night so we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the deck or yard as much as I had hoped, but we had a great night regardless! Ian‚Äôs home has many eclectic touches that make it incredibly charming and welcoming. Highly recommend!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vintage bones modern heart is THE place to stay in Bloomington! It is very cozy, comfy bed, spacious living area, as well as spacious bathroom. The outdoor deck is quite welcoming, and a great place to enjoy the evening sunset. I highly recommend this Airbnb.!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely house in a prime location near campus and businesses. The house has what appears to be all brand new interior with new furnishings and renovated baths and kitchen. The floor plan is kitchen and small sitting area in the center with two sections on either side - each with a bath and two beds (so 4 beds total - with nice mattresses and bedding). The host was especially helpful and helped me retrieve a forgotten item. Would stay again ‚Ä¶

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,"Heather's place was made all the nicer by Heather's kindness and responsiveness to any question. Our family had 2 graduations so it was nice to have a quiet spot to refresh and prepare for each.
The bathrooms and beds were great! The kitchen and living room were contemporary and fun, while very tasteful.
I highly recommend Heather's Place! Come for the lovely space and location, stay for the excellent treatment by the host."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a charming ranch house located in a quiet neighborhood. It was lovely to sit out back on the comfy furniture and listen to the birds. Taylor was our host and he was very responsive when we had some problems with locking up the house. He also went the extra mile and brought us some throwaway cups to use because the dishwasher needed serviced. The house is close to IU so we could zip back-and-forth for all of the Mom‚Äôs weekend activities. We were always able to find an Uber when we needed one. We would definitely stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was perfect for a weekend getaway for our family! The pictures are accurate-the house was adorable. The kitchen was well stocked. The beds were comfortable. The covered patio was really nice for relaxing in the shade. A nice park was just a few minutes drive up the road too! Heather was super responsive to any questions we had. We‚Äôd love to stay here again!
