2024-06-01,3,Group trip,"We rented this house for our wedding party the weekend of our wedding. I was so excited for the large backyard and enough bedrooms to fit all of my needs. When we arrived on site I was disappointed to see that the backyard was not large at all and did not have the fire pit that was in the photos. The house inside ended up fitting our needs, but was still not what we expected. The house is a historic home so the layout is kinda weird. The bedroom with the futons is connected to another bedroom where they have to go through it to go to the upstairs bathroom. The doors also did not lock and the king sized bedroom had a glass door that connected to the dining room with the curtain being broken so people could see into it. Also would not recommend this space for ADA accessibility if that is what you’re looking for. In addition, the hot tub only fit 5 comfortably even though the house was for a large group and make sure to read the description on parking so you know what you’re getting into."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful historic home within walking distance of downtown. All the amenities of a modern rental with the charm of a historic house.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed St. Patrick's Day weekend in Bay City! Instead of staying at a hotel we chose Jason's Airbnb and we were delighted with our decision. We liked the house and felt it suited our group really well. We enjoyed hanging out at the dining room table and in the TV room all together. The kiddos loved having their own space in the futon bedroom and it was nice that all of the adults had comfortable beds. We were just a block away from the parade so that made it really easy! We felt the neighborhood was quiet and safe, as well. All in all, we had a great stay and look forward to returning next year!"

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"this has been by far the best airbnb experience we have ever had. our hosts went above and beyond to accommodate our group. We travel a lot and this house had everything we could have asked for. Plenty of space, awesome architecture, and the couple things that did pop up were 100% taken care of super fast. If you have a large group and a pet, look nowhere else. We will definitely be booking it again in the future!"

Plenty of both gathering and private space, and we highly recommend this home and host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay. Quiet and peaceful neighborhood not far from down town
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The house was big enough for our group of 7 with room to spare. There were plenty of towels and dinnerware - these don't feel like big things but we've stayed in Airbnb's that were short on both of these and when you don't have enough of either, you do notice. The house was very close to a couple restaurants, a pub, a liquor store and an ice cream parlor, and very close to downtown Bay City. We had to ask Jason a few questions and he was very quick to respond. Definitely was a great experience overall."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This East side Bay City home is in a great neighborhood, with plenty of parking and ample space for larger groups. We stayed for three nights but had originally booked two; there was a snowstorm coming and we lucked out and it was available! I cannot say thank you enough to the hosts for ensuring the house was ready early and for making our holiday so much easier! We had almost everything we needed to make meals at the house with plenty of dishes and kitchen items. It was a big home but warm and cozy for an old home, well updated but keeping the original charm throughout, and very charming modern decor."

The host has thought of everything, it’s a home away from away.
Can’t wait to return! Thanks for the stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great and clean place
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent the weekend in Bay City at Marylynn’s home and had a very relaxing time. Spent the mornings sipping coffee in the all seasons room listening to the birds all while a cool breeze flowed through the room. Returned in the evening to enjoy the view of the perfectly lit backyard cuddled up in a blanket with my favorite person.
If you’re looking for a spot in Bay City close enough for a fun weekend but still getting ample amounts of peace and quiet. I highly recommend you check out this home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A stunning mid-century home in a beautiful neighborhood. Looked newly painted & probably wood floors had just been done, as they glowed. Comfortable , very roomy, very orderly, clean & well organized. Nice snacks for us on the counter & Keurig ready to go. Stick of butter in fridge - nice.
I enjoyed morning coffee on the enclosed back porch looking out at the large back yard, which was very inviting with its white fabric shade canopies. Obviously, Marylynn has put a lot of work into this lovely home."
2022-01-01,4,Stayed over a week,"The house works well for a couple. However because the enclosed porch can’t be used when temperatures are cold, the house didn’t work well for three adults. Unless someone wants to hang out in a bedroom, there isn’t any way to get away from each other."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay in Marylynn’s place in Bay City. The home was spacious, clean, a great location and the yard was lovely. There were four adults and an infant and we are so glad we chose this home for our time in Bay City. We would highly recommend it!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for traveling with children! Marylynn’s house is wonderful. It’s in a good location, within walking distance of a park with a playground. We came with a baby and a toddler, and we were very comfortable. Marylynn had everything we needed - a crib, pack n play, high chair, booster, and baby gates. We also loved being able to play with our toddler in the fenced in backyard. She is a wonderful host, and we would absolutely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Fantastic, VERY QUIET and EXTREMELY CLEAN place. Exactly as advertised! There are even little signs next to all switches in every room, so you know what each does. WiFi is super easy to connect to. Host was also lovely. 1000% would recommend this place for anyone who wants a cozy, quiet place in Bay City."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"As a Bay City native, I was specifically looking for a good location and safe neighborhood. Marylynn’s house ticked all the boxes; conveniently located, just minutes to the downtown, clean and modern. The house offers everything and more, especially accommodating for a longer stay. Well equipped, eat-in kitchen, plus dining room, family room, and a 3 season porch that looks out to a wonderfully landscaped backyard.
Would not hesitate to book again!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is IMMACULATE! There are stylish touches everywhere that go well above and beyond the average Air B&B.

Marylynn provided easy check in instructions and was extremely responsive. Overall, our experience was perfect and I appreciate her hospitality."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There is good reason why this house is always booked. It is an excellent value. We came to the house with 4 children and it was perfect for them. The host set up a baby crib for us in the master bedroom and even got 2 baby gates we requested. There is a nice yard for kids to play in and the 3 season room was awesome for late night relaxing. The amenities are top notch. You have everything you need for cooking, cleaning, and bathing. The guest book had plenty of recommendations on what to see and where to eat. The Host even included menus of popular restaurants. If we go back to bay city, we will be staying here again. This is the best quality bnb I have ever stayed at for a great price!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for myself, my husband & my mom to stay visiting family. Had everything we could have wanted. Super cute outside area & covered patio. Nice little touches like robes, shampoo, coffee, a book with menus & games to play. Very comfy beds also with nice linens. Felt very safe & was in a nice neighborhood close to a big park. Just happened to be close to my moms childhood home, so she loved that.
It was great since we needed 2 rooms, but didn’t want my mom to be alone in a hotel room.
My elderly mom had never stayed at a AIRBNB & was a little nervous about it even though I had done my research. She’s raved & told everyone about how nice it was!"

It’s particularly suited for anyone with an infant or toddler."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A spacious home away from home. Nice touches such as a TV in every room, large dining area, fully equipped kitchen, and screened in sun room / porch area. It’s nice to be able to move around, and not feel like everyone is on top of one another like a typical hotel room."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Very close to a nice bike route (rail/river walk) that loops through the city and along the riverfront.
Easy to check in/out.
Everything you need for a relaxing weekend."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay at Marylynn's with my mother and grandmother. Space is decorated wonderfully and the yard/screened in patio was a real treat.

2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean house in a nice neighborhood. Great host, great communication and special attention to details."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The back porch was amazing. And maybe it is under-appreciated but I will miss that as almost as much as much as much as miss my local family. The very close running, walking, biking, trail was such an awesome find!
Marylynn herself was the utmost perfect hostess. This space is ideal for a family looking to unwind after socializing all day and needing that time to feel away with all of the amenities of of a hotel but the comfort of home."

2017-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Marylynn really went above and beyond to make our family of four feel welcome at her home. She pulled out a trundle bed for our four year old and even set out some bath items for our baby.
The neighborhood is really quiet and well-kept with a scenic and short walk to a very good park with a playground. After putting the kids to bed my wife and I read for a bit on the very comfy patio furniture in the three-season room off the kitchen.
Highly recommend!!!"

The kitchen has everything you'll ever need and the living room provides plenty of space to relax and talk or watch TV. Marylynn does a great job communicating. Nothing was left to chance. We had the door code before we arrived, the place was very clean and ready to go. There is a large grocery store (Meijer) within a mile or two (found with GPS). There is also Little Caesar's Pizza less than a mile from the house. Short ride to the river, place to walk and see the boats."

We were in town for a funeral so not the most festive reason, but great to find a hospitable refuge from the heavy feelings in celebrating a loved one’s long life. Tonya and Dustin’s place was spotless and had the best furnishings. My sister fell in love with their couch sectional and Tonya even provided the details of where to purchase it. Lastly, they were extremely accommodating when I left my suit jacket for the funeral at the lodging and offered to ship it back to me. Great stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was very peaceful, beautiful the scenery was very calming and enjoyable plenty birdwatching.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I have stayed at perhaps 20 Airbnb locations and this was by far the nicest, coziest, most thoughtfully stocked place EVER!!! The host thought of everything. The amenities are unrivaled and my mother and father in law were simply blown away by the scenery, even in the middle of winter. Can’t wait to visit again when the weather breaks.
Tonya went above and beyond with commutation and making sure we were satisfied."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first time visiting Michigan! Wow!! Don’t hesitate to book this lovely home. Peaceful, quiet, with beautiful views. The living room and bedrooms are so comfortable. Tonya is super easy to communicate with. I’ve already rebooked with them!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,First class accommodations. This was our second stay and it was equally as perfect as our first. Communication with the host is always easy and fast.

Would not hesitate to book again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My husband, brother, his girlfriend and I spent 10 wonderful days in this perfect cottage on the river. We only have positive things to say about the accommodations as the house was super clean and well stocked with everything we needed. The best part though was the deck out back on the river. Since we live in Florida, August is the best time to escape from the humidity and we picked the perfect spot for our ""escape""."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy river cottage is amazingly nice! Very clean. Easy to feel at home there. We had a small family gathering and cooked burgers and hot dogs out on the grill. Watched the boats go by and drank in the summer air. It was beautiful.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Open a couple bottles of wine and relax
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best AirBnB I have stayed in to date. Perfect for a peaceful getaway. Tonya & Dustin thought of so many intricate things that make your stay feel more like home. I’ll be back as often as possible.

Tonya very responsive.
Enjoyed my stay.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tonya's place was fabulous! We loved riding the bikes, fishing off the docks, and just hanging out by the water. It was located only minutes from the State park where we spent time hiking, hanging out on the beach and fishing at the local lagoon. It was also a close drive to Midland which is what we were looking for. Her house was clean, comfortable and fun!!!!! I highly recommend staying with her on your next getaway!!!!"

We found that everything was well thought out, from a well appointed kitchen and comfy beds, to the beautiful deck overlooking the river! We would definitely stay here again!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay. This home is nicely decorated with a nautical/beach theme. It is better than the pictures can show. The home is clean and comfortable. Tonya has thought of so many things that a guest could need, even before they know they need it. When we first arrived, we were hungry after driving and snacks were provided. That is an example of the thoughtfulness of our hosts. The Welcome Book that was provided gave us a few options of local restaurants. We did a carry out order from the Castaways Restaurant. The food was very good and the prices were reasonable. We have never stayed on the water before, so this was a treat. I don't usually give a great rating as there is always room for improvement, but this was close so I gave it great."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay in this gorgeous river house!! My parents came up from KY to visit and we wanted to take them to explore a new part of Michigan so this was the perfect spot. Unfortunately the weather was a little too chilly to enjoy the outdoor patio much, but we made the most of it and played games together with the water view! It is also conveniently located close to downtown bay city with plenty of bars and restaurants to enjoy! We took a short drive to Bay City State Park to see the bay as well. The snacks were also a really nice touch for a weekend in! We would certainly stay here again- the beds are so comfortable, the kitchen is fully stocked, and the view is so peaceful!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our experience with staying at the River House was amazing! Communication between our hosts was quick and easy. The house and scenery was stunning. Having a pack n play for our 1.5 year old son helped so much! We would love to stay at this location again in the future.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property located right on the river. We had a wonderful time watching the snowmobilers run up and down the river as well as taking walks on the river! This location is close to the state park and nature trails. The garage is a nice addition, from the pellet stove to the dart board and giant TV, the space is amazing. The rental owners communicated early and often and were quick to respond to any questions. Highly recommend if you're planning a trip in the area."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Very comfortable apartment with a room.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was nice, clean and comfortable. Great neighborhood. They had a camera free monitoring system, and every time moved it lit up. Laugh to hard, it lit up. We felt like we were being watched 24/7 like children. It gave us a VERY uneasy feeling the whole time. Airb&b always have you wondering about hidden cameras and microphones etc, since you hear about people’s experiences often. This didn’t help. So, if you don’t like a feeling of being monitored, I would chose a different listing."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a simple little apartment right in downtown Bay City, close and walkable to coffee shops and restaurants. The space is clean and has all the basics. The tall windows and heigh ceilings make it feel spacious. Overall, a great value for the money and a great location, if you ever find yourself in Bay City."

As in the description, there are two floors of steps (42 steps) so don’t bring big luggage. The kitchen has just what you need to make your own meals. Bottle water & cokes left in fridge were an added treat. The only strange thing we found interesting was that the bedroom door does not close due to the bed being the size it is. But the bed is very comfortable. The host is extremely responsive and kind. The value of this Airbnb is fantastic."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall extremely nice place.
The only cons are the stairs so if you are bringing a ton stay on the second floor. If you are looking to stay in a modern historical building this is the place to be! And you will be only minutes away from almost any store."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment for a short business stay. It was clean, quiet, beautiful and close to dining and shops.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,You have a great place and it is a great location. No but there’s just a barrage of text messaging upon check in. And that’s how I missed the door code. I had to go back through and find it. But the place is absolutely amazing. And I have never slept in a bed so comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donald’s place was fantastic. Great location, great communication, super clean and overall a very lovely place to stay. Would definitely stay here again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s in a great and safe location. My girlfriend is particular about the safety when I go to new areas and was content with this unit. It’s also right in the middle of downtown by bars and stores so there’s a lot to do within walking distance. The unit itself is very nice also. I have stayed in a unit by this host before and have so far had a great experience. I will always go through them if I have the opportunity when I go to Bay City.

Loved the unit; spotlessly clean; thoughtfully done.
It is in an area with many walkable restaurants, coffee shops, craft beer and taverns. It was a great time, even on an off-season weeknight.
As described, you do need to walk upstairs to the unit… it’s worth it!!
I’m looking forward to staying here again on my next trip to the area."

I liked it until it got scary…

SO many cool options to visit, from cute shops to huge antique stores to yummy restaurants and fancy bars. Both of our nights ended downstairs at Mulligan’s Pub, which had an excellent atmosphere and such friendly service!
The apartment itself is very clean and cozy. Everything about our stay was simple and communication was very clear. Would 100% stay here again next time we’re in Bay City! :)"

The hosts even had water bottles (& cans of coke) in the fridge, which we appreciated. The only thing missing in the kitchen was something to use in the oven, like a cookie sheet or a dish.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was neat, clean and I will rent again! Truly enjoyed my stay.
The only negative was all the steps, no elevator. The owner was very transparent and made it clear about the steps. Only reason I am telling you this is just in case you miss that part.
So happy with the property!"

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome place, very clean and Jason is great to work with."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place to stay if you really want to feel part of the closely knit community that is Bay City.The house is a perfect example of the big, historic homes of Bay City's central neighborhoods.You're a really short drive from downtown, the river, bars and the bridges if you want to get to the west side.This place is also perfect if you have a ton of people who need to share the same space.The 5 bedrooms upstairs gave everyone their own private space and the mattresses and bedding were extremely comfortable!Truly! If you're someone who struggles to sleep in a bed that's not yours, you'll be fine.There's a TV in every room if watching shows at night is how you get to sleep. Plenty of drawer/closet space to move right in like you live there. The kitchen has everything you need, which you know is not always the case with AirBnB. Plenty of knives, utensils, dishes.A week's worth of coffee provided!Parking for 4, hot tub, finished basement,mega dining room.Like living in Bay City"

The location is private but maybe 7-8 minutes from civilization. The views are amazing, especially during sunrise and the neighbors are quiet and private. You are so close to so many other adjacent cities full of things to do as well. We can't wait to stay in the summer and fall again. Thanks Jessica!"

We will absolutely stay here if we’re ever back in the area, a fantastic experience overall."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's place was AMAZING. Me and my gf came for a couple days of R&R and to visit Frankenmuth's Snowfest 2024. The location and views are beautiful and peaceful. The kitchen and open floor plan make the house feel so big. The neighbors were quiet, as well as the neighborhood. You are 30 minutes from so many things, so figuring out what to do isn't going to be an issue. There were more than enough linens in the bathroom for our stay. The decor makes you feel right at home and the beds are SO comfy.
And Jessica? Jessica was awesome! She touched base before our visit to ask what snacks we would like, and stayed in touch to provide ideas of places to visit. She helped us find some great restaurants and provided us some great advice on the area. She is a gem!
You can't beat the value of this place. We have already told our couple friends about our trip and we can't wait to visit again. This will be our go-to for a while."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Shirley's Temple was a really interesting and comfortable place to stay! The living space is very generous and the location on the river is very cool! All the spaces provided to enjoy the river view were excellent.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very beautiful, peaceful and fun. Jessica was amazing in her communications.. We will be back"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to get away. Jessica was very attentive and helpful for check in and checkout, as well as made sure we had everything we needed. We definitely will book again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the second time we've stayed in one of Jessica's homes and they are both just incredible. Peaceful neighborhood right on the river and amazing views out to the Bay. Very clean, no cluttter and everything you need for short or extended stay. We feel right at home when we are here and 100% recommend this place or her other property next door. We cannot thank her enough for making her homes available. They are perfect."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The view was beautiful and the property was very clean and well maintained. We arrived a half hour early, and texted Jessica on the way to see if we could check in early. She promptly responded as she did to one other question that we had when we arrived. Prior to the trip, I asked her for restaurant recommendations, which she also promptly answered. Literally, the only negative is that the bathroom is very small and not ideal for four people. Overall, we highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved my Bay City stay in this adorable Airbnb on the water. Jessica was easily accessible and is clearly very organized. The home is spotless and cozy! It was very easy to find. Running/biking trail is just down the street and overall it was the perfect stay for me.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute house right on the water. Had everything we needed for our stay. Easy check in/check out. Be sure to visit Bay City - lots of fun shops and restaurants.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I got married over Labor day weekend and we had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful little lakeside getaway. The place was perfect, so cozy, clean and comfortable! The back deck views of water and boat traffic was our perfect little place to wind down with a few drinks. We 100% will stay again. We loved the location, exploring Bay City a bit. Hosts were super accommodating and responsive!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice place, you feel like you are at home. Super clear."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Can’t beat the view!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for our annual girls trip. Had an amazing time and great laughs while enjoying the water views.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying at Shirley's Temple and Jessica was a most accommodating host. You could tell that the house was clean from the moment you entered and everything that we needed (that travelers can't really bring with them) was provided. We enjoyed the outside as much as we did the inside. The bathroom is a little small for a group of 6 but Jessica thoughtfully brought over robes for everyone - such a nice touch!! Kitchen was perfectly stocked, and it was obvious that the linens throughout the house were chosen for her guest's comfort. The furniture was as comfy as it was attractive and so well suited for the house. And what can more I say about LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION - as convenient to everything as it was fabulous to enjoy. We spent most of our time out on the deck taking in the amazing views and breathtaking sunsets. Thanks so much Jessica, we really hope to come back again next year!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying with Jessica but at a different home. We not only loved the home but also the responsiness of Jessica. The ease of access for boater is fantastic and services offer for fisherman is even better. We now look forward to this every year! I would 100% recommend a stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was perfect. Thank you Jessica for making my first AirBnB experience a flawless one.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Situated near the mouth of the Kawkawlin River, this home has amazing views from almost every window! Jessica’s home is spacious with amazing views of the river and the bay from the living room window wall. The place is very clean, tastefully decorated and the kitchen is large with everything you need. A blender is the only thing I would add. Bedrooms are fine, the only drawback is one nice but compact bathroom. Just plan to get dressed elsewhere. We loved the outdoor space, especially screened in gazebo! It was great to sit outside without having to deal with any bugs!!! Whether from the side of the house sitting/eating area to the riverfront walk out deck from the living room or the gazebo, it felt so tranquil and relaxing, perfect for our family. We’d definitely come back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very comfortable cottage in a quiet neighborhood, with an awesome view of the river and bay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay. Jessica ensured everything was perfect. The house has scenery that made this the best place we have stayed. We spent a lot of time watching the water and the local wildlife. Plenty to do locally too.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Jessica's Cottage! Wonderful view of the River and Bay, very clean property. I would stay again if ever in the area!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and clean home in a great location. We had a fabulous stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,I feel like the pictures don’t do this house justice! It’s just beautiful! We loved spending New Year’s at Jessica’s place. It’s fully equipped and really comfy. will definitely come back.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a marvelous time! Thanks 😊
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here!! The view is amazing! Every window has a water view just about. Walk out on your porch and you are steps away from the water! The place was very clean, fresh and cute! We had our thanksgiving there and the kitchen was perfect for our needs! Great big island and nice big table for us to eat! We traveled a short distance to Frakenmuth and spent the weekend shopping and riding horse and carriage rides. One of our best trips we have ever done! Booking for next year!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"We had a perfect trip at Shirley’s Temple. The view was absolutely gorgeous as we were right on Kawkawlin River. This location is right by downtown Bay City, which was absolutely perfect for going out. Our stay was everything we were wanting, and we hope to book again soon! It was clear that our host is an absolute professional, and we appreciated the clear communication, and extremely clean stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s home is nestled beautifully right on the water with a great view of the opening to the lake. Her home was impeccably clean and to be honest the pictures don’t even do it justice. We wished we could’ve extended our trip with this one! Jessica is a great host with quick response time. We look forward to coming again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One week Autumn vacation at Jessica’s place was wonderful and very relaxing. Location on the River was perfect for fishing from the dock right outside your patio doors. My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay! Thank you Jessica for sharing your lovely home.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,loved it!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Shirley's Temple is a serene and tranquil oasis in MI. My vacation staying at Shirley's Temple was one of the most relaxing vacations ever! The first thing you notice walking into the living area is the amazing views of the Kawkawlin River flowing out into the bay. There is so much room in the living room and kitchen. The gazebo and the deck were the favorite hang out places for my friend and I. The kitchen is fully stocked with all the kitchenware you may need to cook a meal. The bedrooms were comfortable and the mattresses were great as well - I normally sleep on a Tempur-pedic mattress and for me to say another mattress is great says a lot. There is only one small drawback - the bathroom has VERY limited space to get dressed after your shower. I would recommend (if you're fluffy like me) to bring a robe so that you can walk through the house to your room to get dressed. I would stay in Shirley's Temple again and again, one of the best places I've rented!!! 10/10 would recommend!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was so cozy and it's in a beautiful location. We loved the outdoor space, especially the gazebo. A perfect spot for those seeking a peaceful getaway."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a great place to stay and relax. Very Clean with an amazing view. highly recommended.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,GREAT cottage right on the river!! We had a blast!!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home. Clean and lots of places to relax. Just like description. Would stay again!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home and managed very well. We had a wonderful week.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is beautifully decorated, extremely clean and windows everywhere to watch the world go by. Everything about our stay was perfect. We will return for sure."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful setting, extremely clean, and comfortable accommodations. This was probably our favorite airbnb we have stayed in, and we have used airbnb for several years rather than hotels. We fished off the deck and had quite a bit of luck, so that was fun. We would definitely stay again and recommend to others."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved Shirley's Temple! Beautifully updated and extremely spacious living area and kitchen. Lots of warm touches throughout. The smaller bedroom is perfect for younger kids to share. The property is located at the mouth of the Kawkawlin River and was perfect for our 22' foot boat and opens directly to Saginaw Bay. Chris was super helpful as we needed extra fenders and loaned us a spare set to help us during our stay. Jessica is extremely responsive to anything you may need or have questions about. Highly recommend staying here. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side but had everything we needed and for a family of 4 was very accommodating.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had such a great stay. Beautiful view of the river and lake. My daughter loved watching all the boats go by. Cottage was so nice, comfortable, and decorated beautifully. Everything you needed was provided. Owners were quick to respond and understanding. We appreciated the thoughtful touches like the beer/wine in the fridge and you offering a playpen for the babies. Would definitely return!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was breathtaking yet cozy. We would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I stayed at the Weber house. And I can’t wait for my next opportunity. It’s like a little slice of history with all the modern conveniences. The kitchen is well equipped to host a dinner in its beautiful dining room which was a nice surprise when I rented it over Easter weekend the first time. I needed assistance at checkout and Jason got back with me within just a couple of minutes. I was so impressed and thankful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful and large Airbnb. Every room was very spacious and had all the amenities we could have asked for. We were traveling with a 22-month-old and having access to not only a pack-n-play, but a few toys around the house made it MUCH easier for us. I had a few questions/requests for Jason prior to arriving and he responded almost instantaneously.
The apartment is less than 5 minutes from downtown Bay City and about 30 minutes from Frankenmuth. I would recommend to anyone if they are traveling to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is huge and beautiful, came here for an anniversary and we were thrilled by the living room beautifully decorated, comfy chairs/couch, and has a huge tv. Jason is responsive and courteous, temperature dropped when we came in and he immediately helped us raise the thermostat. Worth a visit if you’re in town!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family of 3 (including a 3.5 year old) enjoyed our stay in this lovely apartment! Everything was clean and matched the description in the listing, and we were pleasantly surprised to find white noise machines provided in each bedroom and some basic backup toiletries in the bathroom. There are even a few children's books and some Mega Bloks on the living room shelves for young guests! We had ample space for our small family and there was enough space for a few aunts and uncles to join us for some socializing in the living room one afternoon. Jason was responsive to any questions or requests before and during our stay. We would absolutely stay at this apartment again the next time we're in Bay City!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Third year spending St. Patty’s weekend. It is absolutely the perfect location. We walked everywhere and the place is beautiful and was exceptionally clean as always. 😊
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice unit and centrally located.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, will be back again at some point!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cool opportunity to stay in this beautiful historic home! Apartment is huge with lots of space to spread out. We were only here one night while visiting family in the area but would recommend it for a longer stay, if you’re able to. We were a little concerned that thermostat is locked at 70F since we like it cool at night. However, in an older home that tends to be drafty it was actually perfect! Thanks for a lovely stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! It exceeded our expectations. A beautiful historic home that felt comfortable and inviting. This was a family Christmas present and may have started a new tradition for us! I highly recommend staying here and hope to do so again soon.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was very comfortable and larger than we thought it would be. Everything we needed was provided, including coffee and bathroom toiletries. The huge TV was a great bonus that our kids really enjoyed. We loved how close the apartment was to downtown. Perfect location and fun to stay in an old, historic neighborhood."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a find! Jason is a wonderful and communicative host, and this home is amazing. Heavenly beds and linens, awesome shower (which I wasn't expecting in a historic building), and the kitchen has everything we needed. The living room furniture is comfortable, the TV is huge, and there was even a Christmas tree there to greet us. Walkable to shops, restaurants, and entertainment. And the pictures don't really show you just how huge this place is. We will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't locate the code that Jason had sent to open the unit. Called him and he responded immediately to my call.
The kitchen was very well appointed with everything we needed to cook our Thanksgiving meal with the exception of a large roasting pan which we took the precaution of bringing ourselves.
The unit had a pleasant environment, well stocked with games which we played on the large dining room table. The beds were very comfortable and there was an abundance of clean towels and TP. An additional lavatory was an asset given the fact that five of us were there during the day and four of us stayed the night.
An off-street parking space and rear entrance were very convenient."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at this location, and it was just as amazing as the first!
There was an problem with the keypad at the entrance (batteries were dead), but after a call to Jason, it was quickly remedied.
The kitchen is well stocked with anything you may need if you want to prepare a meal instead of eating out.
The bathroom had extra supplies of bath washes, shampoos, lotions, etc. The only issue we ran into in the bathroom was there were only towels/washcloths for three people, and we had four, but we made due with what we had.
The location is close to many shops, the USS Edson, and Frankenmuth is a quick drive away.
We would DEFINITELY recommend
this place to anyone visiting Bay City/Frankenmuth, and we look forward to our third stay!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. Nice big place with everything you need. Easy to walk downtown.
2023-11-01,4,Group trip,Stayed in a group of 6 ladies...home was very nice clean and comfortable.. would highly recommend it
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It is a very large apartment, huge TV, very clean and close proximity to everywhere we had planned to visit. We're sure the Weber mansion has many stories to tell and its character didn't disappoint. We met Charlene and she's a gem and very pleasant as well. We will definitely stay at either 1W or 1E again. Jason, thank you for sharing your place with us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a fun vacation! Jason’s place has so much to offer. It’s very well appointed, from the well stocked kitchen, to the soft linens with plenty of extra pillows and blankets. The area is quaint and has a lot of charm…it’s not pristine by any stretch, but it’s comfortable. It felt safe walking in the neighborhood and downtown areas all day, and even after the sun was down after our dinner out. There are some cute boutiques and cafe’s worth exploring. The best part of our stay was running into several people in town who were friendly, probably because Jason allowed us to bring our Great Pyrenees along, and he’s a celebrity everywhere we go! Our teens chose to stay in for a movie night in the large living room with that HUGE TV. The entire space beckons you to linger, and take in every detail of the architecture that surrounds you in this massive period home. Charlene, the home’s caretaker, is a gem!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Weber House is a lovely home close to Downtown Bay City. It met all our expectations. It was especially nice to have our own parking spot close to the house. Being an older home, there are a few things that older adults wanting to rent it might want to consider. There were some stairs at both entrances to navigate, and the lighting, due to the high ceilings, was not very bright. The apartment was very clean and the beds very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Met all of our expectations and then some.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt like royalty in this huge and perfectly appointed apartment. I would look for any excuse to return to this high value low cost property. I'm curious about ""The Weber"" and feel certain there is a rich history here. What a unique and wonderful experience! Thank you Jason!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay. It’s a Super cool old building but the inside is modern and clean. All the comforts of home and the kitchen was equipped with all the necessities. Including coffee to start the day.
Beds are super comfy and linen was high quality.
Only a 10 minute walk to great bars and restaurants.
I travel a lot and this place had everything needed. I would definitely recommend and would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, spacious apartment with a very distinct older feel. Reminded me of century homes around northeast Ohio. Would recommend to anyone staying in the Bay City area. Small note that the windows appear to not open for the most part. Very minor issue though as air conditioners are installed throughout the apartment. Definitely give this place a stay if you’re going to be in the area. Jason was an excellent host."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason’s place was beautiful, and all the Little’s extras like some emergency food items and toiletries! We’re very much appreciated. The kitchen was very well appointed with good quality pots and pans.
The beds were very comfortable as well.
Will definitely stay with Jason again when in the area!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place. Close to riverside restaurants.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was a responsive host. The location was perfect for walking to shopping, restaurants, and bars."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect! This was by far the best Aribnb that we have stayed at. The old mansion was tastefully redone and furnished beautifully with a well equipped kitchen. It was comfortable and a pleasure to stay. Thank you Jason!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The host was easy to work with and the house was well equipped .
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was conveniently located in a peaceful neighborhood and was beautifully decorated. Jason provided all the amenities our group of four needed and we were pleasantly surprised by the extra half bath located near the dining room. He gave very detailed entry instructions and we enjoyed having water bottles available to us in the refrigerator- a very generous touch.
We would definitely stay again if we have the opportunity to visit this area in the future."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jason was an easy-going and responsive host who provided a beautiful and well-kept home to stay in during our anniversary trip to Bay City. We love that it is pet friendly (our Belgian Shepard came with us) and that the city itself welcomes dogs in many areas. The Historical District (where this home is located) is a beautiful place for a casual walk, and everything you need is mere minutes away. It's definitely a comfortable and affordable deal!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,excellent thx
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was ready to go as expected. We needed more towels and they were delivered. Cool house. Good job.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect. It was cozy and comfy after a long day exploring the area. Great location! It was quiet and peaceful. Would highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great room for a large group. House was very stylish
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Weber House was a beautiful place to stay, high ceilings, beautiful comfy furniture, well equipped, and very comfortable. It's on a somewhat busy street and the road noise is a bit loud from the front room, but the bedrooms are all back enough so we slept well.
Jason was responsive and helpful.
Highly recommended; will stay here everything we're in BC!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My mom and I really enjoyed our stay. The location was walkable to downtown which was an extra perk!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this Airbnb! Bathroom was well supplied with anything you would need, as was the kitchen. Location was nice and we walked to the downtown area and enjoyed the shops and restaurants! Thanks Jason for a great time!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! Highly recommend and will stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a lovely stay at Jason’s apartment, the living room in particular was a wonderful place to hang out, and very quiet and private.
Would definitely stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was as advertised; a beautiful restored apartment with all the required amenities.
2023-07-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"I was disappointed with how our reservation started but would consider trying this space again due to Jason's responsiveness & the size of the space. I checked well after the 3 PM check in to find that the space was not cleaned (i.e. beds unmade, dirty towels on racks, wrong name on welcome board). A call to Jason started the remedy quickly. However, instead of immediately making it right, the cleaners gave us attitude, questioning whether it was left in that condition or if we made the mess. After they left,I wondered if we truly got the level of cleaning we would have gotten if it wasn't a rushed, last-minute job. In the past, hosts have offered discounts for inconveniences that disrupt. This time felt more severe since I had a 3-month-old with me but no such offer came from Jason.
Jason did help us get a better level of cool during our stay as well, which slightly lifted the cloud from the cleaning incident. I love the clear communication. Wish the stay matched the reviews more :-("
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,It was a gorgeous place and very comfortable in a fantastic part of town. We enjoyed it greatly!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we stayed here. The accommodations were spotless, yet homey. Jason resounded to questions immediately. Would highly recommend him as a host."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay and I’ll be back. Comfortable, affordable and walking distance to town. The neighborhood is full of wonderful old homes."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The Weber House is a charming historical home! There was plenty of room for us, 3 teens, and dog. The kitchen was well appointed, and the living room was spacious with nice big TV. We enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I have stayed at the Weber a few times and other places Jason hosts. He is a Great Host we always go back.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt like I dropped back in time Period As I wandered around for the 3 days in his home there was always something a tucked away that was of interest in the way of décor or furnishings Period such a large space Period we were on a girl's weekend and it exceeded our expectations Period we will definitely be back
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great stay! Check in was smooth and easy. This is a VERY large 2-bedroom unit in an historic house, with great period architecture and all the modern amenities. Very well stocked kitchen. Jason was great at communicating and very friendly. We’ll definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay. The house was very spacious and clean. Very quaint, fits the era of the houses on center street."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Growing up in Bay City I have always been in awe looking at the mansions on Center Ave. It was exciting for my sister & I to be able to stay in one. There is a lot of detail going on such as the crown molding & decor. The space was also much larger than expected. We felt right at home! Also, this was the first time I booked an Airbnb and I feel as if Jason made it a great experience! I will look into staying there again should I ever visit the area again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice clean home with lots of history! Lots of space had a great stay!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The home was as advertised. Owner was flexible with checking in an hour early as we had arrived sooner than we thought from out-of-state. Had problems with using the television. Instructions would have been very helpful, especially for using the local channel guide . Ended up signing into our Disney Plus and Netflix to have something to watch. Otherwise is was a well maintained property, very roomy, kid friendly."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Convenient location
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was awesome! We love traveling and checking out places with character and a bit of history. The surrounding houses in the neighborhood are all immaculately kept and true works of art! I’ve recommended this place to everyone. This place was massive and we felt at home right away. Thanks again!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect. The kitchen was well equipped, everything was spotless and furnishings very comfortable. Looking forward to a return visit."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was nicely appointed, comfortable and clean. We had a nice stay - everything was as described and check-in was a breeze. Thanks Jason!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment in historic neighborhood - surrounded by impressive century homes.
The living spaces were perfect with very comfortable seating in the bright living room. Master bedroom was spacious, king size bed invited restful sleep. Bathroom was well appointed, plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Parking was right at the back door.
Close to the downtown area where there were plenty of dining options as well as nice walking areas along the river."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a perfect location. Bay City is spectacular. Would highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Oh my gosh!!! What a place!! I hope we can stay here again!! Absolutely beautiful 😍
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we booked with Jason. Our stay was wonderful once again. The place was so clean! We also appreciated the water in the fridge and mouth wash jar with Dixie cups in the bathroom. Many restaurants and pubs were within walking distance. We even booked again before the weekend was over!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well I was shocked from the moment I walked in! Gorgeous Victorian home split into 3 apartments! It’s huge! He thought of everything! I would like to live there! Thank you for letting stay at the Weber!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jason's apartment. Truly this place has so many beautiful & impressive architectural touches. We loved all the window treatments & tasteful decorations throughout the house. It was a great place to relax & enjoy the ambiance of what was once a golden age of architecture in this country. And Jason was quick to respond to any messages, got answers back almost instantly. Wish we could have stayed longer!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful property. We felt so comfortable and at home. I had my 1 year old grandson with me and the little amenities provided at the house were so thoughtful.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home, great place to stay, had everything we needed."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We get to the area for business frequently and this was our second stay. It has turned into our favorite place and we definitely will be back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family visited this location to celebrate my birthday and we had an amazing time. The home was very cute and comfortable. Nice driveable distance to local areas and restaurants. We would definitely stay again when we decide to visit the area again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The apartment was beautiful and worked out perfectly for us. It was very clean, well stocked kitchen and the decor was beautiful. We frequently travel to the area and will definitely be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very spacious place, hoping to stay here again in the future. Thanks!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful historic home with plenty of space and parking. The kitchen and bathrooms were especially well done and full of amenities and the king size bed was a dream, so comfortable. Jason’s place is an excellent value, and we would highly recommend. We will be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Very clean. Slept well on comfortable beds. Most of all the unit was beautiful. The decor and the designing was lovely. Just a slight disappointment over not being able to use the fireplace. All and all a lovely unit to celebrate our 30th anniversary.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean & beautiful place. Lots of amenities, good location, and responsive host."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,We loved our stay here! The apartment was beautiful and looked just like the photos. We really enjoyed staying in and relaxing here! Jason was also great. Very helpful and prompt in communicating.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice historic home. I have never seen Bay City before, just passed by on 75 going north like many others. So this was a nice place to stay and explore the city !"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s beautiful apartment with everything you could need. We loved the area & can’t wait to come back to visit!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came up to visit Frankenmuth for my daughter's birthday... What an amazing place! Cozy and convenient to many nearby attractions and shops.
The apartment was spotless, the beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen had anything we needed. We really enjoyed the HUGE television, too!
We had a little problem with the smart lock on the apartment door (it took us a few times to unlock it EVERY time, even after reading the directions sent to us!).
Other than that, our stay was perfection!
We will DEFINITELY be back!!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazing place to rest for a while! The house is beautiful and location is perfect and easy to find!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and charming are the best words to describe our stay. Big comfy chairs, comfortable beds, oodles of extra soft throws and pillows. Huge TV — didn’t need my glasses it was so big. It was toasty warm when the weather turned cold. Great water pressure in the shower and plenty of hot water. The decor and furnishings were apropos for this Victorian mansion. Though we didn’t use it, the kitchen was well stocked with condiments, dishware and first-rate appliances. It met our needs very well."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location for walking into town. Response time from Jason regarding any questions was within seconds. I highly recommend
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay in Bay City, a Center Ave mansion house. Everything exceeded expectations by far: Comfortable beds, complete kitchen, beautiful old building tastefully updated, huge home video screen, private parking, wonderful shower, excellent communication with the host. Will certainly book again. Best AirBnB we've ever stayed in coast to coast."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An excellent apartment – very comfortable, well-furnished, very well-equipped, and in a great location. My wife and I, after spending a few very enjoyable days in Bay City in January, decided to return in October for another short break. We wanted to stay on or near Center Avenue, in the fascinating historic district, where there is an astonishing range of styles for the big houses and public buildings that Bay City’s confident lumber barons and industrialists built during the city’s boom years in the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries. As the Center Avenue Neighborhood Association (which produces an excellent walking-tour brochure) puts it: “Among our district’s 880 historic structures are examples of various architectural styles, including Arts & Crafts, Colonial Revival, Georgian Revival, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, Italianate, Mid-Century Modern, Neo-Classical, Queen Anne, Richardsonian Romanesque, Second Empire, Shingle Style, Stick, and Tudor Revival, as well as kit homes by the Aladdin, Lewis, and Liberty companies.” This ground-floor apartment, running the length of a massive mock-Tudor house, was an excellent choice for us. It is one of two ground-floor AirBnB rentals; the upper floors of the house are divided into regular rental apartments. The elegant sitting room at the front of our apartment, with a lovely bay window, the large bedroom (one of two) with the four-poster bed in the middle, the dining room and spacious, well-equipped kitchen at the back were all perfect for us. Two parking spaces off the side road, one covered, were conveniently close to the back door, making unloading and loading easy. The apartment was spotlessly clean. In the kitchen we found everything we needed, except for a kettle and a teapot (but, as traveling tea-drinkers, we are used to having to bring our own supplies), and we enjoyed frothing our milk for the occasional coffee in the Keurig machine, among an array of excellent kitchen appliances, including a refrigerator with an ice-maker, a rarity, at least in my experience, in AirBnBs. We slept well on the very comfortable, king-sized mattress, despite a little traffic noise. The sitting room boasts an enormous TV screen, so that, although we don’t usually watch TV when we travel, this time we could not resist an hour of Netflix and some Premier League highlights (there is a good range of subscription services). WiFi was excellent and abundant power outlets made it easy to charge phones, laptops, camera batteries, etc, in every room; the USB ports in the bedside lamps on either side of the bed were particularly welcome. All the doors are secured with digital locks. Outside, a few minutes walk will take you past an extraordinary and eclectic range of buildings. We also used the apartment as a base for visits to the Dow Gardens and the Alden B. Dow house in Midland (both very well worth the short drive), to the Tobico Marsh nature trail on the shores of Lake Huron, and the Bay City historical museum – both excellent. Drinks at the Public House bar and its sister Harless and Hugh Coffee shop, and dinner at The Real Seafood Company, in an elegant, modern building on the riverfront, were all very enjoyable, as was lunch in Midland at Café Zinc in the elegant H Hotel. Midland’s Wednesday Farmers Market was surprisingly lively for late October. Our breakfasts and dinners at the apartment were a pleasure to prepare and to consume at the large dining table (which would comfortably seat six). There is a coin-operated washing machine in the basement, but we did not use it. We would happily return to this apartment and recommend it wholeheartedly."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,We stayed for a girls trip and it was amazing we had a great time the place is so gorgeous definitely a place we will be coming back to stay again
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is awesome! Super cool and clean old house!! Great value. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous apartment with lots of charm. Huge TV with comfortable seating for movie watching. The master bedroom is huge and the mattress was very comfortable. We would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious and convenient. The large King bedroom and twin bedroom had lots of space, beds not terrible. Lots of blankets for the beds and living room to cuddle with, which was fantastic. Sofa bed needs extra padding or something but the couch was comfy. The living room has the largest TV ever on the wall, which was great for our movie night, almost felt like we were at the theater. The space is set up shotgun style we had lots of space for the 5 of us. Loved the kitchen, great new appliances. Great location for all the traveling we did, lots of shopping and food options nearby. Good value, would definitely stay again if going to be in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our apartment at the Weber House was great. The space is clean, spacious, and cozy. The kitchen was well stocked. It was a fantastic stay for my family."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So clean, comfortable and beautiful. Very spacious and EVERYTHING you could need is here."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Completely comfortable, pleased with everything!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This location is BEYOND INCREDIBLE, and far exceeded my expectations! So much so that I do plan to book further out in the future for a longer stay. I also noticed (by reading through the guestbook) that a lot of other guests are repeated customers of this AirBNb, and I gotta say after staying here I see why. I love that they thought about the needs of their guests, and I do appreciate that the place is kept up so well and it is very clean.
My boyfriend and I rented some ‘Bird’ scooters that were found in the parking lot right next to the AirBNB and drove them around to see all the historic houses. The location is so beautiful that even that felt like an amazing experience. I stay at AirBNB’s across the entire USA as I travel for work frequently and this is one I am adding to my list as one of my favorite that I have to re-visit for vacation! Definitely recommend!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cool space! And perfectly located to downtown and major arteries for the region. I mentioned staying at the Weber to a local historian and he said that the building was one of the best examples of architecture from the turn of the 19th century. Victorian exterior and modern interior - this is a great place.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Right off a busy street, easy to distract yourself if you turn in the tv and relax in a recliner for a while. When you need to stretch your legs, be sure to get out and enjoy a walk in the neighborhood m, the homes are beautiful!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place, just as promoted! Clean, well decorated with beautiful antique furniture, and very spacious!

Well done, and a great value."

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Duplex was laid out nicely. All appliances worked as they should. The house was very clean and spacious for our group of 3. Could easily have had 3 more people with us with plenty of space. The internet connection was very fast, we had no issues having 3 gaming systems online at the same time. Jason is very responsive to any questions we had. The walls must be very thick because we did not hear the people in the duplex next to ours. Overall great host and great place to stay! Thanks again Jason!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place to stay! lots of room and qn great price!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apt was everything it was expected to be. Old world charm with modern day amenities. It was a very cool area with all the mansions around it. Also has some sights and a great lake ( Huron) near by. The apt had all the comforts of home and more. A very enjoyable stay. Thank you Jason.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow. This home was spectacular. It was not only historically beautiful but it felt like home. There was everything you could possibly need from an extra toothbrush to board games. The beds were extremely comfortable and the living room was perfect for our family to spend our vacation together. We cooked meals, ate at the large dining room table and snuggled in the living room and watched movies and played games. We will absolutely stay here again while in Bay City. My only complaint is that the thermostat was locked and set on a daily cycle. One day it was very hot and I wasn’t able to turn down the heat and the next day it was extremely windy and you could feel the draft through the windows. It could have been user error, but I wasn’t able to make any adjustments. The front door to the apartment also did not always unlock with the code but the back door which was closer to the assigned parking spot worked every time. We made unforgettable memories here and enjoyed every second of our stay."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Had an amazing time, the place is beautiful and in a great part of town."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very spacious and historic getaway! We really enjoyed our three nights there, and had plenty of room to make dinner for our kids who live in Midland. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable, and the huge TV was great for watching the Olympics! Kitchen was very well stocked. Bathrooms had nice touches and plenty of paper products. Extra bonus points for being able to bring our two French bulldogs! We will be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice mansion conveniently located. It only gets a bit noisy at night due to the busy street. But the apartment makes you feel like a king or queen.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB is a lovely apartment in a beautiful Victorian home. Jason has created a welcoming environment, right down to the plentiful lap quilts.
It’s proximity to restaurants & boutiques was convenient, & the surrounding houses are lovely to view."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place is outstanding.
If you are traveling through Michigan and happen to be staying in the Bay City area, do yourself a favor and stay here; you will not be disappointed. From the time you enter the Weber apartments (recently renovated) and make your way to apartment 1W, you'll immediately take notice of the very spacious and plush living room, with its ornate bay window. This apartment has all of the modern features we've come to expect in the 21st century, and yet still retains much of its early 20th century charm. You'll truly feel like a man-about-town here, especially being so close to Downtown Bay City. There are many pots, pans and dishes. A drip coffee maker and a Keurig are available. It would appear as though there wasn't a single utensil that one would be deprived of. The bathrooms were clean and well-appointed. The main bathroom had just about several different types of shampoo and soap available, and stocked with clean towels and linens. It would appear that everything about this apartment is designed to give the guests a fantastic urban experience that will keep them coming back for more. Surely, I shall be counted among them, no doubt."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy and well appointed space… and more importantly, exactly what an Airbnb should be. I would return here just to stay in this place again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, clean place. Well stocked kitchen, gigantic tv, large, comfy bedroom, close to food and shopping."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Unique, had everything we needed, and loved the space. Pictures do not do it justice. Enjoyed the Christmas decorations! So nice to have that this time of year."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I have booked from Jason on two separate occasions - both experiences have been exceptional. Jason responds promptly to questions and the airbnb was clean and easily accessible. I highly recommend any rentals Jason offers.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is absolutely gorgeous. It was very comfortable and relaxing.

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Jason's beautiful home. The apartment is very spacious and the kitchen is perfectly stocked with everything you need to cook dinners. Shops and restaurants are near by, and Frankenmuth is about 20 min away. There is a good sized dining room table and the bathrooms are well stocked. The large tv in the living room was awesome. We would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Bay City."

We enjoyed a walk around the beautiful neighborhood and a friendly and enjoyable dinner at MI table. It was nice to park for the evening and walk to anything we needed. The apartment is clean and spacious. A very homey night for our travels.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love coming back to The Weber. Fantastic location and beautiful home. As always, a pleasure to stay here. Brought another set of guests to enjoy and all give it a 5 ⭐️"
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Super cool space. We felt at home. It was clean and cozy. Beds were comfy and the whole space was spacious.
The listing at the time
If booking AND at the time of stay said the second room had a double bed but there were two twins. It was a small bed for an adult but we made it work. It helped they were comfortable.
There is a queen pull out in the living room, but the 2nd bedroom was not as the pics showed or as listed. Plan on two twin beds in that space.
The host was helpful with our many needy requests!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just as it said in his property description. It was a very interesting place, spacious and well decorated. The huge TV was a great plus for chilling at nighttime. Very reasonable price for the amount of space. Loved it!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean with an awesome look and feel. We loved how close it was to everything and were surprised how big it was! Would recommend 10/10
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing flat. The pictures don't do this beautifully restored flat justice. The interior design is flawless. The kitchen is better appointed than my own at home.
I dropped this from a 5 star review for the following reasons:
* The house is on a busy street. There is a lot of street noise starting at around 7:00AM. Night time was quiet.
* Not one window in the flat could be opened. All were painted shut. We always enjoy fresh air in our home and this was annoying.
* The covered parking space had a hug hole in the roof that was right above the roof of our car. As it was raining when we were there, we got less wet keeping the car out of the parking space.
I would still highly recommend staying here."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful beautiful place great value amazing!!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great place! The house is so neat & a large space. It had everything we needed. Jason is a great host that responds very quickly to anything you need. The location is awesome. 1 mile to Kroger, or other stores for supplies & less than a mile the other direction toward the bay. We could walk to restaurants, shops, the bay. It was a fabulous place all around."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice and clean historic house. Family friendly, there are toys and high chair which I wasn’t expecting those. Beds are very comfortable!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved The Weber

This Airbnb is not to be missed !"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was fully equipped with about everything you should need to cook, including coffee and tea, extra towels, toiletries, blankets. Good location, close to downtown shops and restaurants. No outdoor yard area, but we knew that since it was a apartment and didn’t need it. Did some walks through the neighborhood around the home, which was nice. Covered parking was nice. Also was perfect since it was pet friendly so we got to bring our dog. One outdoor patio restaurant even let her sit with us outside while we ate. Very roomy for an appointment and can accommodate a group."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Great location and apartment is extremely spacious and rooms are great. Will definitely be back.
2021-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, cool old home close to downtown Bay City. Clean, very nice sheets and towels. Beautiful, very well equipped kitchen."

Lots of amenities, which we appreciated. There’s plenty of things to do in any direction you go. We would definitely stay again! If you are reading this, just book it, you won’t be sorry!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, high ceilings and lots of room to spread out. 10/10 would stay again"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was so spacious, the attention to detail was beautiful, and it was so close to so many things. The king bed was so comfortable, as was all of the living room seats. Incredible way to bond with family!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A great location that's close to a lot of things to keep a family busy. It's great that you can walk the beach all the way to the state park around the corner. Plenty of nearby trails to explore. A quiet, peaceful spot that's a quick and easy drive to a lot of things in and around town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love the cute and simple decor, great view of the water, very clean, responsive host, dog friendly.. overall a great spot to stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay! And actually was sad when our weekend stay was done! And was already discussing our next trip to come back when it's actually warm out so we can enjoy the outdoors more!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place very beautiful
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved this place. It was so amazing!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Krysti's Place was very clean, excellent condition, amazing views. Krysti attentive & hospitality make for an unforgettable experience. We plan to come back to this place on our next visits. Thank You!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I booked Krysti’s home for a quick weekend getaway. It was located only about 1.5 hours from where we live, but it felt like we were in Northern Michigan, quiet and serene. The home had all the amenities we could ask for, and we didn’t need much of anything for our stay. Check-out was a breeze, very little to do. This would be a fantastic location in the summer, too, with lots of yard leading right to the bay. A state park is within 2 mins walking distance from the home, or a short drive, eh oh we took advantage of using in the sunny weather. Krysti was responsive, friendly and helpful. We’ll look to book this home again for future trips!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was so homey and clean! It had great views of Lake Huron. I highly recommend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place and good location. House is cute, bright, and tidy.
It is far enough away from the busyness of Bay City, but close enough to enjoy the downtown area and restaraunts.
The lakeshore out back of the house is nice and is just a very short beach walk trail to the State Park and all it has to offer."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Krysti was a wonderful host. She was so great to communicate with and her home was absolutely stunning! We already can't wait to go back:)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My stay was great, standing out by the water was extremely nice. I went back out with a friend at night and was able to see the big dipper, which was totally unexpected. I cooked dinner for my family and I and the kitchen had everything I needed. The place was exactly as described."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Krysti was incredible! Seriously so responsive and helpful we sure appreciate her quick feedback.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The lighting in the living needs to adjustable. ceiling can lighting was too bright on, too dark when lights were off, especially at night. Not a big deal, but something to improve."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was beautiful, Clean , and nice views of the water."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was the best stay ever.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was such an honor to be the very first guests staying! We felt so cozy, it was so clean. Everything felt brand new and i wanted to stay for another night! You can tell that they put so much work and love into their airbnb. They followed the coastal theme all the way through. This is a perfect place to stay with people you love. Enough room for a family and a lake in your backyard. Book this for a summer stay it will make your vacation a million times better."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find. This little hideaway had the perfect balance of form and function. A beautiful calming aesthetic from the moment you walk in, with well thought out attention to detail to make it a very easy place to stay. I love the fireplace, the flexible lighting layout and the NEST central air conditioning/heating. These made for a warm romantic atmosphere. I’m a fussy coffee drinker and Linsay’s coffee venue downstairs was perfect and super convenient. I’d definitely stay again."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was beautiful and we can’t wait to come back. Truly a great experience.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice. Wish there was as a tv to watch a movie.

2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean. The reading nook was super cute and the fire warm and relaxing. Water pressure was very good. (I always appreciate that) Bed was comfortable. My only small negative was, We could easily hear converstions of people walking down the sidewalk, cars that drive by or had music playing and the garbage truck bright and early one
Morning. But these are things out of the hosts control so we dont hold it against the rental. Just something to note if you go during busy season and are a light sleeper or are not used to city life. We barely heard any noise from the coffee shop below, outside of an event that was hosted one night, which got quite loud, But the guests left by 10p so it didnt bother us too much. The Public House is a must for brunch! All in all we enjoy this cute cozy place."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cool spot! We sat by the fireplace and enjoyed our time. No TV which was a nice change, and a bunch or restaurants and things to do nearby. Definitely would recommend staying here. The bedroom was a little loud with outside noise from the street, but we didn’t have much trouble getting to sleep because the bed was so comfortable."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"awesome place, great expierence!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft looked just like the pictures. Perfect for our quiet, relaxing night away from our busy schedules. Close to restaurants and downtown shopping. We had a great time and definitely would return."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb exceeded all expectations. The moment I entered, I was greeted by an immaculate space, where every detail was carefully attended to. The environment immediately set a tone of luxury and care. Coupled with the cozy fireplace, which served as a beautiful focal point, the room's warmth and comfort were unparalleled. The soft furnishings and elegant lighting further enhanced the serene atmosphere, making every corner a perfect blend of comfort and style.
What made the experience even more delightful was the Airbnb's location right above the coffee shop. The convenience of having a lovely cafe just downstairs added a unique charm to the stay."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We would like to Thank the hosts for helping is with our last minute plans! The hosts were so responsive and accommodating Loved the loft apartment very well decorated very comfortable and quiet! We will definitely visit again ❤️ Thank you for sharing your beautiful space!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic space right in the heart of downtown Bay City. Fireplace made the living room very cozy in the cold November rain. :-) Great shower and bathtub. Washer and dryer were an added bonus helping us to fly back to Europe with luggage full of clean clothes. Huge bedroom and bed. Loved pretty much everything about this apartment. Would stay here again. Thanks Lyndsay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our absolute favorite escape! Beautiful loft, above our favorite coffee shop. And all within walking distance of great shopping and dinner spots!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a gem! This place is beautiful. Every room was clean. The lighting and openness was very welcoming. The pillows and blankets were so cozy. We used the fireplace to make it even cozier. There are board games, a deck of cards and so many restaurants and shops to go see, we didn’t even notice there wasn’t a tv until bedtime. Kitchen is fully equipped besides having a microwave. Outdoor area is also nice with a fire pit and a rooftop view. The coffee/wine shop downstairs is also a nice place to go morning, noon or night. It would be a perfect place for a wedding reception downstairs and bride and groom suite upstairs. Will definitely stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lyndsay’s place was perfect! Location could not have been better, the decor and ambiance was absolutely amazing! We loved our stay and would happily book again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,wonderful stay as always! we'll be back soon! :)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Design-first approach: tastefully curated with a contemporary approach the loft was exactly the gem I was looking for. The hosts were incredibly responsive, the location was perfect with an equally stunning coffee shop below. Close to wonderful food and art galleries, as well as a great bikable rail trail around the city. Design friends, highly recommend if you're between Traverse City and Detroit!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I recently rented this Airbnb for a wedding along with the downstairs coffee shop: Harless and Hugh which served as the wedding reception venue. This Airbnb was PERFECT for the bride and groom. It also served as the location for the bride and bridesmaids to prepare for the wedding. We spoke so highly of this space that everyone at the reception downstairs wanted to come up and take a peek! The layout is perfect with a huge romantic bedroom and bathroom. The kitchen is seems functional: we mainly used it as a bar for drinks since we didn’t cook any meals. Location for us was stellar as this Airbnb is in downtown Bay City close to bars, adorable shops, Antique Center, courthouse, riverfront, Princess Wenonah, Planetarium, hotels where other wedding guests stayed, Third Street Light Bridge, art galleries, etc. This Airbnb also includes a private rooftop terrace surrounded by ivy making it very private. It was perfect to overlook downtown.
Interior: so well-decorated, clean&Awesome!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay in bay city
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,We had a girls weekend there and the only complaint was no full length mirrors
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here - it was beautifully decorated, and very light and cheerful. You could walk to local restaurants and coffee shops - so super convenient. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lyndsay’s loft is a stunning renovation of a historic loft in the heart of downtown Bay City. The immaculate space is perfect for a romantic weekend getaway, with a lush king size bed, well-appointed mini bar, and a spa-like bathroom. The pictures on the listing don’t do it justice. I’m already looking forward to my next visit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is cozy and beautiful and just what I needed for a weekend away. Everything was really clean, and the café downstairs is really nice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a couple to unwind! I instantly felt relaxed. The reading nook, the comfy bed, and rooftop deck with fire feature were standouts. Love the simplicity and openness."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft was perfect for a girls night away with an old friend! We enjoyed the luxury of the space and how clean it was! It was also walking distance to great coffee, food and drinks!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly beautiful place. Very comfortable and peaceful. Loved the outdoor space and the proximity to Harless and Hugh! Space is bathed in natural light, but the blackout curtains kept the bedroom dark. Some street noise, but nothing outrageous. Bed was very comfy and the pillows were supportive. Great shower pressure and delightful bathtub. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, great location"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment & furnishings. Very easy to find and instructions were clear. The coffee shop and wine bar ""sister spots"" were delicious and had great vibes. Thanks Lyndsay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was our second time staying at the Harless & Hugh loft and it was just as perfect & relaxing as last time!! I'm already planning our next trip back! ❤️
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time during our second stay at Lyndsay’s. Fantastic location and the loft was perfect! Great place to stay in Bay City.
2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"PROS:
As pictured
Walkable
CONS:
Lacked functionality for a longer stay - no dresser for clothing, no counter space in bathroom, lacked adequate lighting in the bathroom, and no hook for a hand towel near the sink in the bathroom
When we experienced issues with our accommodations the host wasn’t very hospitable or empathetic. They seemed offended that we experienced an issue, rather than being empathetic to our situation. We ended up staying in a hotel for the final 3 days of our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Beautiful loft and was super clean. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely the best Air BNB we have ever stayed at! It is beautiful and Lyndsay was so nice! We will certainly have to book this again! Thank you for the wonderful stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here. The place was exactly as pictured on Airbnb and it was more spacious than we anticipated. We spent an evening on the rooftop patio. It was super cozy and private. Really enjoyed the fireplace on the patio. Loved that we were right above their cafe. Delicious cappuccino and pastries/toast. The staff and the host were super friendly and helpful. It was our first time to Bay City so we really weren’t sure what to expect. We came Memorial weekend and, surprisingly, a lot of places downtown were closed. There was a huge antique store and some small shops open. We were just wanting a quiet night away (with good coffee nearby) and this place was definitely that. We would come again for sure!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean. Beautiful. Comfortable. And pretty darn cool.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stylish and spacious oasis in Bay City. Beautifully appointed. Lindsay has chosen high quality finishes, decor, and amenities. Super convenient to Harless & Hugh coffee shop, local restaurants, and activities. Highly recommend this AirBnB!!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I’ve been wanting to stay at this location for a while and it did not disappoint! Loved the look and the aesthetic of the place. I genuinely enjoyed that it was on top of the coffee shop and right in downtown Bay City.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully curated “zen den” for my solo retreat. From the steel tongue drum in the bedroom to the salts and candle in the bathroom this spot made for a perfect experience. I enjoyed the downtown location with meals, shopping and other attractions (check out the planetarium!) within walking distance. A day of perusing the many shops followed by a long soak in the tub and then sitting by the fire really made my stay complete. Some of the noise in town could be distracting at times (loud horns from a train or boat) but I brought earplugs and used those. The bed was firmer than I care for but some may appreciate that. The large reading nook was very cozy! The stocked “mini-bar” and fridge (add-on costs) were a pleasant surprise."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved our stay here! The aesthetic of the place is amazing. We were here for a quick overnight trip and felt right at home. Would recommend to anyone!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location for an event at the Pere Marquette Depot. Beautifully decorated space. Would recommend for anyone visiting.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Exceptional in every way
2023-02-01,3,Stayed one night,"The place is really nice, but the owner wasn’t very pleasant to deal with. They lock the thermostat so you can’t control it. You can only check in after 4 pm and you have to check out by 11:00 am. They’ll charge you $50 if you stay a min late"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyndsay’s place is beautiful. Updated, spacious, spotless…we will be back
Pat, Fargo, ND"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful and worth every cent! Booked for our anniversary and Lynsday was super helpful from the day we booked. The bath and fireplace were incredible, I’ve never felt more relaxed 😌 We grabbed coffee downstairs and already planning to come back for brunch! Would highly recommend especially for a small unplugged moment ❤️"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This comfy loft is the perfect place to bond with your special someone. The town and local area just adds to a beautiful personal space that really warms the heart the moment you step foot In the door. Waking up and getting a latte and hot chocolate to explore the town and making your way in at night for a place you wanna eat in rather then eat out. Top it off with an awesome shower or even soak in the beautiful tub before relaxing in the beautiful king bed. Couldn’t recommend enough.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot. Perfect for a couples getaway. Would definitely stay here again if I decided to come back to Bay City.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing experience! Right in the heart of downtown and a perfect mini get away! Would definitely recommend this lil beautiful stay!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and really decorated in a nice decor. Minimal and it was relaxing. Great roof top deck and fireplace inside and gas fire pit outside. Note: there is no tv, which at first was somewhat surprising as I never thought to look in the listing. But we had music and it made us not just sit around and watch tv like we would at home!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"We loved this place and would definitely recommend to anyone! Very aesthetically pleasing with thoughtful design touches. It was in the perfect location for us to walk throughout the city all weekend.
Our only reason for not giving 5 stars is that it seemed to be missing a few amenities that we are used to having in AirBnbs. ( Especially in this price point) We would’ve loved to have more bathroom amenities - body wash, face wash, bubble bath, etc. Additionally, we could have used some hand soap in the kitchen along with a full length mirror somewhere, and bath mats. We are all about minimalism as well but would’ve loved those extra few touches throughout to really make our stay. Over all, however, a beautiful space and we hope to stay with them again some day at another of their beautiful properties."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent location, beautiful loft however you must be a morning person to enjoy this stay as once the coffee shop opens downstairs it gets rather noisy (didn’t bother us but figured it would help others)."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Nice and relaxing! Prefect little retreat for us.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place! So well decorated. We stayed in Bay City to do some antique shopping on our way back to Ohio from Harbor Springs. This place is in the heart of Bay City. Easy walk to really anything we wanted to do. Our timing was just right because we got see the Alabama tribute band (boys in the band) at the Ampitheater which was also fantastic.....and free! Walked around the river walk. Got to see the Spanish tall ship that was in the harbor so that was a plus. Cool places to eat and shop. The roof top sitting area was a nice way to relax at night. Just close enough to a hear a DJ at one of the outside bars and enjoy some music to wind the evening down. Would stay again if we are ever back in the area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot! The aesthetic, cleanliness, and overall atmosphere provided the perfect getaway! Super walkable to most Bay City attractions and a short 25min drive to Frankenmuth"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely GORGEOUS little place. Extremely clean and very well decorated with lots of high quality amenities. Great location, close to lots of neat things. Host was very accommodating of my last minute check-in and I thoroughly enjoyed my night. Slightly on the higher end of pricing for the size, but would definitely recommend staying here."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous! As mentioned in previous comments, it looks even better in person! Great location and walking distance from everything. Had such a lovely overnight trip here and will definitely be coming back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even better than the photos, which are also beautiful! I loved being able to walk to restaurants and the adorable coffee studio right downstairs. The outdoor rooftop patio space was lovely. Would highly recommend this space. Clean, thoughtful decor, and great communication with the host."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful place to stay! Would definitely recommend!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful place that we would certainly stay in again if re-visiting Bay City. Rooftop was awesome to have a few drinks on in the evening. Morning cup of coffee from the shop underneath the loft. Great stay overall! Would highly recommend👍🏼
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the place, very comfortable bed"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is absolutely amazing!!! It is beautiful, modern, clean, and has the best location! It was so nice to be able to wake up and go downstairs to their cute coffee shop in the morning and be within walking distance to everything we wanted to do during our weekend away. I 100% recommended this Airbnb!!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nothing but good to say about the place. Even nicer in person than on the app. Spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful space close to the water and bars/restaurants. Lyndsay was very accommodating and responsive. Would stay again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s even more beautiful in person than the pictures and I didn’t think that was possible! So beautiful, cozy, and clean. Perfect for a girls getaway or a romantic stay with your partner. Also, it’s right downtown and Bay City is such a cute town!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience that was.. The space it’s self is spacious, bright, quite and cozy. Extensive mini bar options with affordable prices and the easiest way to pay the bartender. The living vines covering the window, the warm fireplace after a nice bath or watch the stars and listen to the city with a bbq and fire pit on the patio. It all made the experience so great. It is less than 3 min walk to everything from Saginaw River, amphitheater, DC Planetarium, dispensaries, food and more. If you want to cross the river just rent a electric scooter, the extra money is worth it in the elements and not in your car.
The coffee downstairs was crafted perfectly, and don’t forget about the fresh baked goods or [what seemed] seasonal menu of delicious, light food/alcohol options. The space was bright, clean, and friendly. The curtain matched the drapes, so to speak.
Don’t hesitate to book this place. Check in and check out was a breeze. Respect this place like it is your own so much effort went into creating this space for us."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location with plenty to do within one block of walking. Easy check in, communication with our host was great. Slept great bed was comfortable. ! Would book again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay and great location downtown Bay City! Would absolutely stay again, Lyndsay was also wonderful to talk with before and after our stay!
The stocked bar and fridge (available for purchase) made it great for out of towners and was a nice surprise!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and location. Super clean and very well done.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This spot is a gem in Bay City! We loved being within walking distance of restaurants, shops etc. You will be happy you stayed here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful space! We decided to stay here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday with another couple, and we are gad we did. The vibes were so cute! Reminded us of being in Europe with the step out patio, ivy, and simplistic details. The bed was comfortable, sheets were clean and cozy. The kitchen was full stocked with everything we needed for the day /night. Check in was super easy. Lyndsay was attentive prior to arrival and also while we were there. We decided to try The Public House for dinner and drinks and we are glad we did. We travel a lot and love to try craft cocktails and small plates from around the globe and these did not disappoint. The drinks were so good as well! The next morning prior to leaving we decided to try the coffee shop under the airbnb location and we really enjoyed this experience as well. If you are going to bay city and are looking for a trendy space to enjoy your stay this is it! Walking distance to everything! We could see ourselves staying here again!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The unit was very clean and centerally located close to pretty much everything. Lyndsay was a great host and communication was superb. The rooftop space was an added bonus.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,host were quick to respond and answer any questions we had. a lovely place near downtown shops and restaurants.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is so beautiful and the design was perfect. It was clean, comfortable, and my husband and I had an amazing stay.
Make sure you stop at their coffee shop below, good coffee and food. We ordered a charcuterie board and took it upstairs paired with a bottle of wine.
Just a tip- Bring something for white noise if you're not used to the city. We used an app on our phone, and slept good."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful space! My boyfriend & I had a perfect weekend here! We will definitely be back!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay in a fun spot!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great time! The loft was clean and super cozy. Would definitely recommend/stay again.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Easy enough, I suppose. Cute little apartment with unique touches. Enjoyed the animal skins, water pressure, lighting selections, plants and comfy bed and pillows. Missing some of the amenities I’ve come to expect in an AirB&B rental, (especially for this price point). I found myself missing a Keurig, bottled water, snacks, bubble bath/bombs for the tub, lotion, a television, a clean bath rug, convenient parking and handrails for the entry stairs."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful. Had a little solo night here. The host even let me check in early. Highly recommend.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely love the harless + hugh loft!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place! The loft is cute and the coffee shop on the ground floor is lovely. Highly recommended.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Was looking for a quick getaway, found this cool loft on Airbnb was available so Bay City it was! The loft is stylish, spacious and comfortable and we had a great time playing records on the vintage turntable and playing Scrabble on Christmas night. By day we explored shops and architecture in Bay City and visited Bay City State Park and Tobico Marsh. We ran out of time with plenty more to explore so looking forward to coming back and would definitely stay at this Airbnb again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The perfect place to stay if in Bay City, the decor alone will delight the airbnb travelers and the comfy deep tub and comfortable bed were so welcomed. The outdoor rooftop patio and gas firepit was great for sharing some special moments. A modern and sophisticated dwelling above a similar style coffee shop below and situated right downtown with shops and waterfront nearby. A true delight!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was beautiful. great environment around it as well. You will not be disappointed, only recommendation is to bring a laptop or a small tv with you if you’d like to relax and watch a movie.
Super clean, quiet at night, everything you need it left out for you."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"So much prettier than the pictures even! A ton of space- especially for just me and my husband- but it was really nice to stay in a super artsy hip place for the night. Would be great for a girls weekend. Lots of bars working a stone’s throw, literally- so close! And their bar The Public House has SUCH good cocktails."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed staying here! It was a nice change of scenery, and it felt like we were in a city. The bathroom was a nice oasis. Communication was great, and we'd stay here again."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a really cute place! The coffee shop is great too connected to the loft. Great outdoor space with a fireplace!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing, beautiful, cozy, dreamy… not gonna go through the entire alphabet but you get the picture. This place is as elaborate, fancy and gorgeous as it looks in the photos"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay at the Harless & Hugh loft! It was a nice, quick getaway for the night."
2021-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"This apartment is a good choice while in Bay City! The downstairs coffee shop is cute and high quality. The mattress and bedding were comfy. My only constructive criticism is that the bathroom was too dim for to put on makeup, etc. and smelled a little bit like sewage (the shower drain I think?) Everything was very clean, though. I would stay here again if the odor was addressed."
2021-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"The loft is absolutely lovely and the decorations are beautiful. We loved the location and being able to walk to dinner was so nice. The tub was a highlight of our stay and having the bath salts provided was a really nice treat! The only suggestion I would have would be to offer a regular drip coffee maker and coffee accessories. I don't know how many guests would have the knowledge of how to make their own pour-over coffee and there were no directions. We ended up buying cups of coffee from the downstairs, which was delicious, but a little inconvenient first thing in the morning."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot,little pricy but would happily stay again"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Found this place last minute as an added bonus to our anniversary trip. We enjoyed the company at Jakes and had fun with new friends. Sunrise at the state park was beautiful! The bathroom is even better than in the pictures, super luxurious!! In the “living room” there was an old school surprise that we really enjoyed!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Good
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Definitely checkout the cocktail bar and coffee shop!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay! We had fun exploring the small town and coming “home” to a cozy, chic space. Coffee was delicious, too!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft! Loved the private rooftop patio. Great location! Would definitely stay again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The Airbnb is very central to everything Bay City has to offer. The space is absolutely beautiful and thoughtfully decorated
2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A cute, quaint, quirky, apartment. Easy walk to downtown restaurant & bars. Short drive to must see Bay City state park."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This stay was absolutely perfect: clean, organized, comfortable, and cozy with plenty of space and all of the amenities that we needed. The loft is absolutely gorgeous and in such a great location! The coffee shop underneath serves wonderful food & drinks with great service, too. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is so cute! It looks just like the pictures. Lyndsay was very helpful with everything and responded quickly. The town is small and cute, perfect for just a night to get away."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The Loft was so lovely and such a cozy atmosphere! Great communication and amenities and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I have rented this loft multiple times and I am always so satisfied. It is absolutely gorgeous!
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, beautifully decorated.
Something to note, there weren’t any board games like the description claims (I did not contact host about it though as we really didn’t need them), also some of the photos are outdated.
Only negative is that it could’ve been cleaned a bit better, it looked like things weren’t moved to sweep around, and there were dust webs in corners and on the lights fixtures.
Overall a nice stay."
2021-08-01,3,Stayed one night,"This listing had great interior design (very photo friendly), a lot of antiques and quirky things like every glass option you could imagine, and is in a perfect location for going out downtown and spending time by the water.
We found it wasn’t very accurate with the amenities, there wasn’t any board games or extra pillows and blankets, no shampoo or soap in the bathroom (other than hand soap), or coffee provided (although there is a coffee shop downstairs). I’m used to staying at locations that go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and it felt like the focus of this listing is on the design.
Also be aware there is no TV (which is communicated in the listing) or sound system for music.
There were also 3 closets/rooms locked that we thought maybe were locked on accident and some of the items I mentioned were located there, but that is just speculation. In the future I’ll probably stay at a local hotel."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Stylish decor and excellent location
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Favorite place to stay in Bay City! Beautiful and planning on staying again.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful loft right in the heart of Bay City, MI. Loved the added bonus of a patio! Would highly recommend if you are looking to stay in the Bay City area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space, comfortable bed, great location!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lyndsay is the greatest, she’s quick to message back but does not bother her guests. The coffee in the shop below is top notch and the staff are very friendly. We would have stayed another week if possible, would love to come back ! The rooftop area really completes the spot, and the location is in the middle of the best of Bay City !"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Extremely clean, well decorated apartment in a great location. I’d definitely book again on a return trip!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the first Airbnb I’ve stayed at & immediately started planning another stay as soon as we checked out! The place was AMAZING & in THE BEST location. I had sooooo much fun on my 24th birthday this past weekend! It was perfect & we were so sad to leave!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,awesome spot!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,So beautiful! Definitely will be coming back for our next trip there.
2021-07-01,2,Stayed one night,Stay was okay. Great location
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lyndsay is an amazing host! Her loft is so gorgeous and clean! Her communication is fantastic! We loved everything about our stay! My favorite was the rooftop access because there was soft jazz playing from the cafe below.
How romantic!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very centrally located. Enjoyed being able to see much of the city within walking distance.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, clean, host quick to respond"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Lyndsay is an awesome host! Such and cute place right downtown. The coffee shop below was the best coffee I’ve ever had in my 27 years! Give it a try!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely clean and we'll put together space, patio was great for the fireworks too! Very close to a lot of downtown businesses, we were able to park once for pretty much everything we needed. The coffee shop and cocktail bar run by Lyndsay were also fantastic, they had a similar aesthetic with delicious food and drink!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lyndsay’s place was beautifully designed, it was very clean & centrally located. If ever going to Bay City her stay is a must! & her coffee shop below is also a must!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I've never stayed in an apartment that is so beautiful. The intention and design behind the space is inspiring (make sure to check out the coffeetable books), and gave my partner and I a much needed moment of luxury and intention after such a challenging year. We left with plans to create more intention in our own space, inspired by this stay. The coffeeshop down below is lovely, too. I only wish we had arrived earlier-- get here as close to check in as you can, to fully enjoy the space!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect! It was clean and way bigger than expected. It felt like an expensive luxury apartment in the city.
We were only able to get away for one night so we didn’t spend a ton of time other in the apartment other than coming and going as we walked around downtown and in the evening when we sat by the fire pit and slow danced under the moonlight on the roof top.
We took advantage of having the coffee shop below us and literally walked everywhere once we arrived.
Thank you for the perfect place for us to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic loft with everything you will need to enjoy your stay in Bay City!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very sleek, stylish and comfortable accommodations centrally located over a delicious coffee house! What more could you ask for?!? Highly recommended!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful place. The coffee shop is delicious, so don’t miss it. The patio and bathroom were so gorgeous and luxurious. Just a heads up—there is only AC in the bedroom and the windows are not screened, so it can get pretty hot and buggy upstairs. Overall comfortable bed and great coffee."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous spot! we stayed in the airbnb for most of our trip because we loved it so much, the roof is to die for."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a wonder space! it’s so unique and warm, we can’t wait to book again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful get away! Beautifully decorated and primed for relaxation! Everything you may need is close and hand and the coffee shop and craft drinks/food from shop/restaurant the owners run is HIGH QUALITY, do not miss out on staying and checking out of the craziness of life for a while!
Watch the stars on the rooftop terrace after a long day-- let go of the day."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great little loft! We loved the coffee shop and how close we were to everything!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This space is styled to perfection! Lyndsay was amazing at responding to any questions I had. The location is perfect for walking anywhere in downtown bay city. We would definitely stay here again!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay very much.The house was beautifully decorated and had everything we needed for our stay. It was also perfectly located downtown. We were able to walk to dinner every night. The rooftop was awesome. It was a lot more spacious than I had thought from the pictures. Also Lyndsay was a great host and was quick at responding to our questions. If we ever visit Bay City again, this would be the spot to stay at."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lyndsay’s listing is accurate to what we found upon arrival! It is stylish and comfortably sized, with privacy and nice touches throughout. Another review on her place led us to Tobico Marsh, which was difficult to find, but a very nice hiking/walking path with a couple of lookout towers. Bring binoculars if you want to see the birds though! The Public House has great drinks and we walked around and stopped into an antique store. Great quick overnight trip for two!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lyndsay was a wonderful host. She was easy to communicate with and answered quickly when needed. The apartment was clean and so stylish, I loved it!! My husband and I had a great stay!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a great space. Fun, clean, adorable! Great area!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful space for our quiet, summer weekend in Bay City. The apartment was a bit bigger than I had expected. I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday with the trip and the space definitely gave the ""WOW! This is amazing!!"" reaction I was hoping for. :) We drove up after work so I am very grateful we were able to do a bit later check-in. Communication with Lyndsay was always prompt, and she is so helpful.
The private rooftop patio was so wonderful to make some Harless + Hugh coffee and enjoy in the mornings. She has the place stocked with coffee gadgets so you can make your own perfect cup. Or you can go downstairs for a cup and enjoy the coffee shop's cute patio with locals.
All of the restaurants and bars are a short walk away, making it easy to play the weekend by ear. One of the mornings we rented kayaks on Saginaw River (only 6 minutes away). We also enjoyed the state park (I recommend the Tobico Trail head!) and stopped to dip our feet into Saginaw Bay (both are about 10 minutes away).
Could not recommend this place and Lyndsay as a host enough. Looking forward to the next time we can visit."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonder space. Clean, well furnished and right in the heart of downtown Bay City. We loved it!"

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful loft space! Very welcoming and comfortable. Slept great in the comfy bed and had plenty of room to spread out through the living spaces. Much bigger than I was expecting. Good location for restaurants, shops and river front. The coffee shop was good for breakfast and we had a blast at the Public House for dinner and drinks. Lyndsay was very helpful, communicated everything well and has created a very lovely space to weekend in!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks so much. Adorable place!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A gorgeous, modern interior design that will make you feel right at home in a comfortable and stylish living space. Lyndsay responded quickly to messages and offered suggestions of local places to check out. We loved the full bar inside the loft and overall hospitality offered by Lyndsay. The attention to detail really impacted our decision to stay here instead of an ordinary hotel. My husband and I have already recommended this loft to our friends and family."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Loft is open, airy, spacious, comfortable, quaint, well decorated. The absolute BEST place to stay if you’re looking for a unique downtown experience. We would give this space 10 stars if we could. They take their time to personalize the space for you and make sure that you have everything you need. Lyndsay is such a pleasure to do business with as well!"

The neighborhood is quiet and close to downtown bars, restaurants, and several local businesses. The runner in our group felt safe taking evening runs and was please to discover several running trails nearby.
The kitchen is well stocked-we made dinner for 7 almost every night and had everything we needed to do so. DO NOT sleep on Jack’s Fruit and Meat market if you’re planning to cook. Super fresh produce and the most beautiful cuts of meat I’ve ever seen.
The hosts are pleasant and very communicative."

2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This house was convenient and met our group’s needs. That being said, the place was noticeably dirty upon arrival. There were multiple bugs in the master bathroom, false eyelashes from past renters, rugs coated in dog hair, dust coated vents, and piles of dust under the couch and media unit. The other main complaint is the lack of hand soap in 2/3 of the bathrooms and that the smoke detector in the master bedroom was missing. We reached out to the owner prior to leaving this review about our concerns, but never heard back."

There was PLENTY of room for our stay of 4 and two dogs. Bonus points for a full master bedroom on the main floor so the in-laws didn't have to worry about climbing stairs!
The beds were big and comfy and the living and dining area had plenty of room for us to enjoy the areas together in the evening. Plenty of supplies and linen when needed, and lots of utensils, plates, etc. They have anything you think your family might need. Wi-fi and the signal was strong.
The location was great being close to many restaurants and options. The hosts Jason and Jamie were awesome! Can't stress how great the communication was -- very responsive with info from booking through checkout and they were able to accommodate our request for a later checkout.

We traveled quite a distance to celebrate my grandmothers birthday and ending the night at Big Blue made us feel right at home. The games were a very nice addition. The biggest bonus though, for me, was “TheTable.” We were all able to gather around the table and have one of our traditional family discussions. The memories we created here are for a lifetime.
Big Blue may just be our family’s go to location for all of our home trips. Huge thanks to the wonderful host for being very thoughtful in putting this place together for my family and family and friend groups alike."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing house. Amazing hosts. Had a great time. All I will say is Bay City Is very run down. This house is like an oasis in a desert. If you’re looking to hang in, this would be a great trip. I would come back if I liked the city.
The house is just like the photos, hot tub was great. Had to trouble shoot on my own, but figured out how to clear the vent to let the heater work better. Beds were comfy. Tvs are very nice. Host was responsive. My friends and I had a blast together. 10/10 trip. Only con to this is the surrounding area, so like I said if you’re looking for a place just to chill out at home for a weekend, this is your place. Don’t expect anything crazy from the city."

Enjoyed the little local bar just 1 block away and the hot tub was clean and functioned well.

It was a relatively short drive to Frankenmuth and to the Bay City State Park beach. We were surrounded by a revitalized downtown and riverfront and had plenty of eating and pub-type options. The riverfront was one block to the west and was peaceful and relaxing. The place itself was great and had everything we needed for a few days' stay. It was clean. Parking wasn't a challenge even though there is no assigned parking directly for the space. We would stay again if we are in the area. Thanks, Donald!!"

There were 5 great restaurants within walking distance, which allowed us to eat and get right back to work.
The river was close enough to walk to when we needed stretch our legs.

So, the most amazing feature is the mattress- expect to sleep the best you’ve slept in a long time! Our stay involved a downtown concert within walking distance which made our stay extremely convenient and fun!!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely enjoyed my 5 night stay in Bay City. I loved the location. Close to Saginaw River. Enjoyed walks along boardwalk, exploring across river at Kantzler Memorial Arboretum, walking Riverwalk Pier and footbridge over to Bigelow Park (island). Lots of artwork placed over city to discover. Bay City is a popular place in the evenings with a variety of restaurants. Roads are closed nearby to allow for outdoor dining.
Parking wasn't bad. Typically I found a spot around the corner. After 9p able to relocate to spot where car was visible. Since my stay included weekdays, a parking pass was provided. Noise levels from restaurant patrons was tolerable for me. Wood floors in my apt and above me pretty squeaky but not bothersome for me. Was mindful when using bathroom in the middle of the night. After 11p quiet hrs observed.
Apt was clean but recommend deep cleaning. Would like to see kitchen bakeware & containers provided. Overall, pleasant experience and would stay here again."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely area, host was very responsive, we had a nice time. Floors were pretty squeaky since it’s a historic building, which is fine but I would recommend reserving one of the third floor apartments if you’re a light sleeper (we had some noisy upstairs neighbors). Other than that, it’s a lovely stay."

We will keep this place in mind in the future, and would definitely recommend it to others."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,great hospitality!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"OUTSTANDING STAY. Used Donald’s place as a home away from home while visiting family. Couldn’t have asked for a better location.

Will certainly be back again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay just prior to the holidays. Having grown up in Bay City, it was great to be downtown and withing walking distance of so many things downtown. We had several family members 'visit' us which was great - it was open and enabled us to gather with 6-8 family members easily. All said they would keep this location in mind for future visits (both those who live in Bay City and those who also were visiting). (The stairs were a slight issue only because they were carpeted and it had snowed so those with issues on stairs were slightly apprehensive but no one had any actual issues)."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We rented from Donald in the past, and were very pleased with the location and the property itself. The apartments are very cute and clean. The building is downtown, above a pub, and across the street from the planetarium. You can see the river, and there are nice parks nearby, as well as antique shops, an art gallery, and plenty restaurants. We will rent from Donald again in the future."

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very well located but a little bit noisy (it’s an old house, so we easily ear people coming in or outside, on the street)."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome host and great location to see Bay City, especially if you're there for a bachelorette or some other sort of party. We stayed during summer and the multiple bars on the block had loud music on their patios into the wee hours, so be sure to pack ear plugs if you need to use the bedroom that faces the street. No street noise carried into the larger back bedroom, though!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay ! Location is fabulous, just park and walk everywhere. One of my favorites~ I will be back !"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a clean property in a great location. There are MANY shops and restaurants within walking area. (We recommend Gatsby's or River City for dinner and Mandy's for breakfast.)
We never had trouble finding street parking. There was a lot of live music in the area mid-week. There is a riverwalk located nearby that was great to walk on. Donald's unit is no frills...think clean bachelor pad. I would suggest bringing pillows from home if you like firmer pillows. Toiletries included were bar soap and shampoo for the shower and hand soap for the bathroom sink. We appreciated the soft toilet paper. Don't laugh...some places stock the stuff that is a step above sandpaper. The kitchen had the usual pots, pans, dishes, silverware. Don't expect a lot in the way of spices and other cooking essentials. This was fine for us as we ate out for all of our meals. Donald thoughtfully included 4 bottles of water, 4 cans of Coke, and 4 cans of Diet Coke chilling in the fridge. There are two bars located directly under the unit and the building is vintage, so if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs and maybe have a white noise app on your phone. (To be clear, the bars catered to chatting adults, not rowdy college kids, but since we were there in the summer, there was outdoor seating outside the living area and one of the bedrooms.)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location very close by many different dinner options. Very comfortable mattress and nice looking living space.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is spacious and very clean! Steps away from dining and entertainment! We loved it here and the beds were so comfortable! We will return!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,great location.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you can go up and down stairs with no issues, this building is a gem! Located right in the thick of everything in Downtown Bay City, it is the perfect place to be. The high ceilings and architectural details give the apartments tons of character, and the tasteful classic decor feels very upscale. All the comforts you need are provided. At your doorstep are shops, restaurants, walking and bicycling trails and Bay City is a very charming town. I have stayed here twice and I will definitely be a repeat customer."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, can be loud during night from surrounding places though."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Donald’s 2 bedroom apartment was as advertised. We had very informative communications from him before and during our stay. He clearly communicated the fact that there were steps to get to the apartment and there was no elevator. Parking was street parking and it was very close to the apartment. There are lots of little places to eat and drink nearby. The apartment is very well located to enjoy a walking tour of the area.

The beds were so comfortable, we all had the best sleep we’ve had in a while. All the amenities were as promised (plenty of towels, full kitchen, etc). The location is ideal, within steps of the river and surrounded by many restaurants, bars, and shops.

All-in-all, we had a great trip with absolutely no complaints."
