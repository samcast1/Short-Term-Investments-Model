2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very good stay, quick check in"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place to stay on my way to Minneapolis St. Paul. The house was really clean and adorable. Maura even had some fun little K cups available for her guests to use in her Keurig, which I really appreciated because I forgot to get some at the store on my way up. The house was decorated with a find Bohemian style. You could tell that Maura put a lot of effort into the details of her living room and kitchen; the communal areas of this home There were some great restaurants near nearby on the main street in downtown Janesville. I had a wonderful salmon salad at the Whiskey Bar and Grill. Also, the neighborhood had an old-fashioned little Americana feel and I felt extremely safe. In fact, I’m staying there again on my way back home tomorrow evening. Thank you so much for your hospitality Maura!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very comfortable and clean apartment! Highly recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house was very comfortable and a homey place to stay for a week. It is well-set up for people traveling alone or with one other person. The kitchen was well-equipped and I appreciated being able to cook breakfast. The only missing item was a cutting board, which is not essential. The living room was cosy, a bit small if we had been a group of four, however great for one person working on a laptop. I really appreciated being able to park in the driveway for peace of mind about the rental car! It was great to know that Maura and her husband were available and responsive throughout my stay. Overall, they have provided a comfortable and very functional place to stay durya visit to Janesville."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Inexpensive space with a large backyard for the dogs. There is only one bathroom for four rooms, so that could mean up to 8 adults sharing one bathroom. The shared kitchen was sufficient for minimal meals and food storage in the refrigerator/freezer. Maura was very communicative."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very Nice. Would come back if I needed to.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute little place and nice fenced in yard for the dogs
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Maura was amazing! Check in was very easy and the instructions were clear. I left my glasses and Maura was kind enough to send them to me! Would stay here again :)
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Maura’s place was fantastic, easy and flexible check in all for a great price."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house as elegantly decorated. The host provided soap and shampoo for the bathroom, and allowed me to use the garage where I staged my luggage for my next stage of travel. The people staying there, on the other had were very stand offish and it was like having the house to myself. I am used to a more socially friendly place (not Maura's fault)"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy to find and cozy.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean accommodations, comfy bed, quiet neighborhood."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This place was nice; comfy after a snow storm around Janesville. The place was warm, the paths shoveled and a place for leaving shoes. My 2 pugs enjoyed the area even though the snow was too high for them 😃. But they were able to find spots to go. 💩 And having a poop bags available was very nice as I had forgot mine. Having a kitchen available was very nice. I will stay again when in the area."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,I stayed for 8 weeks. Very nice clean place to stay. Host was always responsive. If I ever go back to Janesville I would definitely stay with them again.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay for a couple days to a week. Nice bathroom, good workspace in bedroom, and really comfy bed!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the first time I have had other guests staying at the same location, but all other guests were friendly and helped when needed. The location of Maura's house was in a great location, I had access to all my events within 10 mins from location. I would stay again if ever in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here 1 night as a stop over on our 2 day road trip. It was so nice to have an area to let my dog out and there was another guest with a dog so they got to play a little which helped. The house is super clean, which is impressive considering how many people must stay there on a weekly basis and most of the house is shared."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Maura was very helpful and the house was great!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Stayed for a month and was very happy with the quiet neighborhood, the fenced in yard for the dog, and the friendly and timely response from Maura. Definitely would stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a quiet neighborhood and close to everything we needed. House was very clean and well stocked. Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect for my family. It was immaculate and very comfortable. They were very accommodating and stocked the home with an array of supplies and essentials. We are so grateful!

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Newly renovated and Spotless.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Nice place!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is in a great location, very convenient for the town. It was in pristine condition and very well decorated. The cleanest airbnb I’ve stayed in to date. It’s perfect for a weekend landing spot or a professional staying in the area for business. The hosts were very helpful prior to my stay and had everything ready for my arrival. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great place with lots of land and bedrooms!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely gorgeous home and perfect for a large family. Very gracious hosts. Hoping to stay again the next time we visit.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay with a large group! 15 min drive to Janesville with groceries and food options.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay at the farmhouse. It fit our needs for a business/social retreat with a great kitchen, dining table and places for conversation. The sleeping accommodations were also very nice. Host was very responsive and pleasant. Beautiful location in rural Wisconsin."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Very private and the house was really clean
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,the large dining room was the perfect size for our large family. we are very happy that we found this place.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Booked for the holidays with family. Was very spacious and peaceful! They decorated the home and everything!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,We loved it! It was very clean and quite. Beautiful location!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely 1880's farm house has been updated cosmetically and provides comfort and space for a large group. Good communication, check in was easy and flexible due to no booking immediately before or after, ample parking, well stocked kitchen including a nice welcome basket, awesome large dining table with coffee bar area, comfortable beds in bedrooms with ceiling fans.
Biggest negatives: No bathroom on the second floor where 4 of the 5 bedrooms are. Downsides: The towels in the bathrooms are somewhat small (although an abundance of wash cloths were provided) No side tables for some of the beds, no table lamps, and limited outlets for plugging in. The road the house sits on is actually fairly busy and surprisingly noisy even late at night.
One complaint: removing my own bedding and taking out trash when I'm being charged a hefty cleaning fee. (Other places do not require this)
But, it's a beautiful home, in a lovely setting, great for large groups convenient to several towns in the area"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved our stay!!!
It was worth what we paid and absolutely BEAUTIFUL!
We stayed for a wedding in Janesville and met our needs in so many ways- the amount of rooms (to fit 8 people), and space it was perfect."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very nice, clean and very accommodating."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Very rare that I stay somewhere that is better then I thought it would be. This is such a place.
1. Extremely clean and updated
2. Lot of amenities: Firepit, cornhole, etc
3. Communicative and kind hosts. Internet wasnt working. and within a few minutes of telling them, they came and fixed it. Also great suggestions on things to do prior to our arrival
The only con would be only 2 bathrooms, but this is something that is stated very clearly from the beginning and so can plan for the two bathrooms."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect stay for a quick family vacation not too far from home! We enjoyed the large dining table, the out door space, used the grill, and the rooms fit everyone just great. The two restrooms there came
in handy with so many of us. It was a pleasant time and can’t wait to be back! Thanks for hosting us!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was amazing for our crew! We were a large group coming from all over to relax and vacation together. The kids had plenty of space for playing and many games of sardines were had. The fire pit was well stocked & the walking field was well maintained so we could stretch our legs. It was the first time we didn’t have to eat in shifts when all together, as we all fit around the dining room table. We were comfortable in our rooms & the insulation was so great that the littles could go to bed early and the big kids could stay up later and play without worry of waking them up. The house itself is beautifully renovated, with amazing old details sprinkled around (ie: the doorknobs!). It was so clean and comfortable! We want to make this a yearly get away!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful place for a family reunion. Beautiful setting with outdoor seating and historical architecture! We loved it.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The house and land is better than the pictures! Everything was perfect for a larger gathering!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This is one of the most beautiful, peaceful places we have rented anywhere in the states! The home is lovely well cared for and spacious. The hosts had a very thoughtful book of things to do and places to eat nearby; we grew up in the area yet discovered new adventures. We made s’mores by the campfire, took walks and watch the fire flies over the field. In the evenings… it was truly magical."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,The home was just right for my large family. We felt right at home and would definitely use this property again.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our group really enjoyed staying at the farm house. It was cute and was exactly as pictured. The towels and sheets were very clean, and so were the bathrooms and kitchen. We enjoyed the spacious land and privacy. The welcome book had some good restaurant recommendations that we tried and enjoyed. We hope to be back one day!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and quiet place for a weekend getaway. Convenient location with all shops available within 10 miles radius. Had basic kitchen utensils for cooking. Lawn was tidy for the kids to play in barefoot. Had basic board games to keep ourselves busy. Would strongly recommend to my friends.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, peaceful and nostalgic. Quiet and restful! Very responsive hosts and clearly proud owners of a historic site with remodeled kitchen and plenary of room for big family or group."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. My grabdkids had a great time playing in the yard and exploring the land
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I love being in the country so that made it wonderful! The place was super clean, calm, quiet, and very lovely. My son just died and my other children are scattered all around the country, so this was the perfect meeting place. It was nice having my family all be able to stay in this beautiful home without being crowded. The house has so much room, and the huge table in the dining room was just the best. Lots of talking happening around the big table was comforting for everyone. The kitchen was also well stocked and we could cook rather than go to restaurants. From check in till checkout everything went perfectly. This is not a house, it is a home filled with love. We were able to create some new memories to cherish. I’m hoping to be able to come back in a couple of years and have a nice family reunion. I think any family would love this place, and should try it! Highly recommend for peace and quiet when you don’t want the hassles of running from room to room at some random hotel!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We LOVED this house, it had so much character and charm. We had 16 people and it was a huge space where we never felt crowded or cramped. Absolutely beautiful, hosts were responsive and let us check out late. Also didn’t have to worry about noise with the huge property. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"This property exceeded all our expectations. The home was spacious and clean, allowing all of us to comfortably reunite and catch up on life. The bedrooms and bathrooms were well equipped with plenty of linens and towels, which added to the overall comfortable and relaxing experience. The location was tranquil, and it was a perfect getaway. The house was very accommodating for our large group allowing us to make memories together. The communication with the host was great as well, they were always available to answer any questions we had. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable, tranquil, and enjoyable stay, especially for large groups looking to catch up and reunite."
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The site is as pictured and described; it was very comfortable for our family reunion. We were 7 adults sharing the house, and it worked very well for us. The bedrooms were large and comfortable, the kitchen was more than adequate for preparing full meals, and the house was tastefully decorated for the holidays. Great dining room with farmhouse table and benches, and nice coffee bar.
The farm is about 15-20 minutes from Janesville, on good roads. Easy to locate, but load up w/ supplies needed before you come."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful AIRBNB. Beautiful house and property. It was perfect for our large family gathering.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful stay, would definitely recommend and return."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,The house was perfect. Very clean and welcoming. We had all of the comforts for our stay. We will go back when we visit our family again. So much room too!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Great home, clean updated and well kept"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We found Jim's place to be a perfect accommodation for our visit. Clean, cozy, quiet and relaxing. Will definitely look to stay again when we are un the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough to describe how amazing this little place was! It honestly had everything you would ever need, especially for long stays, and it was very cozy. My mom and I only stayed a weekend, but would love to come back for a longer visit. This definitely will become our goto stay when visiting family in Janesville! Thank you so much for sharing this lovely home 😊"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a comfortable stay at Jim’s place! It was much better than we expected, actually. They had everything you would need in the kitchen for cooking and even had plenty of snacks and water which was a wonderful touch. The area was very clean and the linens smelled great. The host was quick to respond with any questions we had. We would definitely stay here again next time we visit the area!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had a wonderful stay here. We are return visitors and will be back next time we are in Janesville. This is the ideal Airbnb for anyone looking for a quiet and comfortable place to stay during your trip. Couldn’t recommend it more!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Jim's place was great. Everything was as described, and matched the pictures (or was better in person!) We walked to several restaurants and enjoyed the area, as well as our being able to come back to our quiet, clean, and homey stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim was a great host!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a lovely one bedroom two bed apartment. Very close to downtown and had off street parking. Was exactly how it was advertised and allowed us to have a great visit in Janesville.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our fifth time staying at Jim’s. It’s always comfortable, cozy, and clean. The kitchen is well stocked if you plan to cook. The new TV in the bedroom and new air fryer were great additions since the last time we were there. It’s also walking distance to a small Mexican Restaurant and Grocery store."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Among my favorite Airbnb places! Perfect size for one or a few guests. Nicely furnished, including a decent set of cutlery! Jim & Marilyn left some snacks and bottled water which were appreciated after a cross country drive. Quiet, respectful neighbors in a nice middle class working neighborhood - more like ""small town"" feel rather than suburbia. Great internet connectivity. I'd stay at Jim & Marilyn's place again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. Pictures are very accurate! Clean and convenient, great communication."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend this rental. Great location-could walk to downtown restaurants. Place is charming and well kept.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice place! Loved how he had coffee and a sweet treat in the fridge. Will probably be booking again soon!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay for the price
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, and comfortable, Exactly what we were looking for. We felt right at home and had a great weekend in Janesville!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location and so well appointed! Very spacious and very cozy. Jim & his wife were so friendly and helpful, ensured I got in alright. The kitchen has the basics (like actually has them so you don’t have to buy oil/butter/spices if you opt to cook) and then some. Very walkable to downtown Janesville but set a couple min away from the middle of everything so it feels cozy & quiet at night."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED!! An absolutely perfect stay and the photos don’t do the apartment justice. Super nice and responsive hosts, Jim greeted me in person with a delicious pumpkin roll in hand that paired wonderfully with hazelnut coffee - what a warm welcome! There are two beds with excellent separation for two individuals traveling together, the bed was super comfortable, as was the furniture in the living room. There’s a cozy fireplace that I didn’t use, but everything is so inviting that I didn’t want to leave. I really appreciated the ceiling fans as well as portable tower fans that will oscillate. The lights on dimmers were much appreciated, too! So many thoughtful touches. This has been my hand-down favorite stay. I was in town to meet with an attorney and found this location to be super convenient to the downtown and courthouse area, easily walkable and friendly neighborhood that felt exceptionally safe. It was nice to be able to use the driveway, especially for unloading and loading luggage."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect. Loved all the little touches including instructions for light switches and TV, snacks, and the cinnamon rolls. It’s clear the host takes a lot of pride in this place and enjoys hosting. Bed was comfortable and place was clean and quiet. Loved the decor in kitchen and living room and the elector fireplace made it really cozy. Can’t wait to stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim's is a great place to stay while visiting Janesville. It had everything we needed and the location was perfect to walk downtown. We would love to stay again next time we visit.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot. Walked to downtown, lots of restaurants, bars, etc. quiet and peaceful backyard. Two clean and comfortable beds. Full well stocked kitchen. Great value."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying at this apartment. This was our third visit. We actually booked our next stay before I even got around to writing this review for our previous stay, so we'll be back soon! The apartment is very comfortable, well stocked, and a home away from home. I ended up having a terrible migraine the night we arrived. I appreciated so much the comfortable couch where I could just rest and watch t.v. The apartment is walking distance to the Lions Food Mart, as well as a Mexican grocery store/restaurant. The grocery store/restaurant has basics and we were able to get eggs, cheese for quesadillas, and a lemon for some homemade guacomole. I always cook when we are there and the apartment is well stocked with a blender, crockpot, cooking utensils, etc."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and the bar has been set very high.
They thought of pretty much everything. I arrived later than intended and not only did Jim take my phone call to help me find the location, he stayed on the phone to be sure my code worked on the door and I could enter.
The water bottles in the fridge and snacks available were a wonderful addition (especially after a long day of flights). They had an entire folder of local restaurants and things to do in addition to puzzles and some games in the house. Instructions were clear for everything and we had a wonderful stay.
When we come back to visit family again we will definitely plan on staying here. We had a great time and it was everything we could need and more."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m a Superhost myself and I have to say, Jims place is amazing. The bed was comfortable and had everything we needed. We surprised my daughter who just moved here for a job and turned 21 years old. Was not to bad of a drive into Madison and we enjoyed ourselves exploring. Came back to the Airbnb cooked dinner enjoying the outdoor patio space play a trivia game they had. We definitely will stay here anytime we visit."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the fourth time we have booked here, so, obviously, we love it. It is our go-to place when we visit family in Wisconsin. Thanks for everything!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely stay here again! Jim was very responsive to any questions we had and very accommodating! Place was exceptionally clean and comfortable...almost wished we could have stayed longer. Definitely see why he is a superhost. Overall an excellent experience.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we had a good experience at Jim’s place! It was nice being able to get just about anywhere in town in ~10 minutes. We had trouble with the code to get in initially, but the issue was resolved within 30 minutes or so. Unfortunately, the wifi was in and out our whole stay, but Jim was responsive about it. While we didn’t pursue getting the issue resolved (we weren’t at the house much, so it just didn’t feel worth it to worry about), Jim offered to come over to take a look, and we feel confident he would’ve gotten it resolved. He actually refunded us part of our fee for the trouble… so kind! The hosts left muffins on the island for us, which was so thoughtful (and awesome particularly for our 5 year old… she was excited)! And we really appreciated the cold waters in the fridge after a 20+ hour trip. I think it’s important to note the home is older (i.e. no central A/C, uneven floors, smaller spaces, etc) - so as long as that’s your vibe, you should have a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such an enjoyable stay! The house was so cozy and private. We loved using the kitchen and how easy to use everything was. There were so many thoughtful touches that made us feel right at home. We wish we would have booked a longer stay! The location was so convenient and close to all we needed to get to. Thanks for such a wonderful time!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was just as described. It was very clean and well stocked with towels, bed sheets etc. The location was quiet and peaceful."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the 3rd time we have stayed here while visiting family in town. Always love to see the continued updates but we felt the change to bi-fold doors on the bathroom lead to much less privacy. We will definitely be back when in town.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Marilyn’s place was wonderful. They went above and beyond to provide thoughtful touches and had everything necessary for a very comfortable “home away from home”. When I updated my reservation to add my friend who decided to join me, Jim messaged and offered to convert the futon into a bed without me even asking - I was really impressed with his care and attention to this small detail that I didn’t assume he’d think to take care of on our behalf. This level of care is obvious as you peruse the unit - outlets next to every bedside for easy charging, lots of snacks and drinks available for you to take, kitchen full of tools and spices for your cooking convenience! The beds were comfy and the linens spotless, along with everything else extremely well kept. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and you should, too!!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our time! So cozy!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim’s place was well-kept and clean and very comfortable. Stayed two nights in mid-February after a decent snowfall, so the off-street parking was nice and in a quiet neighborhood. Check-in was easy with clear instructions. The additional refreshments were a nice touch. A nice breakfast restaurant was a short walk away (about 5-minute walk) and other bars and restaurants downtown were about a 10-minute walk away. Overall, the stay was pleasant and convenient and Jim’s place is highly recommended, particularly if you want easy access to downtown Janesville."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim’s house is everything I could have asked for. It is very cozy and comfortable, and it had everything my toddler daughter and I needed. Jim is very responsible and provided everything I needed for a smooth check in. I highly recommend it and plan to stay there when we come back to the region."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying in this apartment! It was our second stay and was very comfortable and cozy. We even had a few Trick-or-Treaters on Halloween! We did most of our own cooking and enjoyed having the spacious kitchen. The living room is also very comfortable for watching movies. There is a small Mexican restaurant and grocery store around the corner. Though small, we were able to get some basic items like eggs and bacon. We took several walks and the neighborhood is very family friendly and walkable."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim’s place is great. Much more spacious than anticipated. Good location. Check in was so easy. Jim was great to communicate with. Would definitely stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jim was super helpful and quick with communication. I booked very last minute without any issues. Will definitely book again if we need another place to stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, within walking distance of some great restaurants, would recommend if you’re looking for a nice calm stay somewhere. The neighborhood was really quiet for pretty much all of my stay"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy stay. The hosts provided snacks and water and communicated very clearly. I was here in the summer and really appreciated the small backyard area. It is thoughtfully landscaped and serene. Walkable to downtown where there are coffee shops, food, and bars."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect!!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy apartment with everything you could need right near downtown.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is spacious, extremely well equipped, and in a quiet neighborhood that is easily walkable to downtown and restaurants. The shower is great, the furniture is comfortable and the hosts are generous and responsive. I had an excellent stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great place to stay at! Went above and beyond our expectations. Definitely will stay again coming into town!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's Airbnb was the perfect location for our adventure in Janesville. The neighborhood is quiet with lovely landscaping and a back patio to enjoy on a nice day. We found the place to be comfortable and cozy. The kitchen was equipped with all the basics and more including some fun snacks! We loved exploring downtown Janesville which was only a 10 min walk away. The ice age trail and bike trails are very close. We biked the Peace trail to Beloit/back and the Glacial river trail to Fort Atkinson and back. We also hiked the Ice age trail. Jim's communication was always helpful and prompt. I notice the little extras that aren't necessary with an airbnb but convenient. I appreciated the plug ins/USB outlets next to the bed on both sides, the easy keypad entry, the coffee options, the water/snacks/games provided, accessible shower and great water pressure, the fresh flowers, and the restaurants/brewery suggestions. We feel like we made friends in Janesville and look forward to coming back!! Thank you Jim and Marilyn!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jim is a great host. We have stayed there twice and we will staying there again when we come up to Janesville.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim And Marilyn are great hosts with a wonderful and cozy property. Their property is very clean and has a comfortable and homey feel.

2020-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I don’t think you will be able to find a better host than Jim. You can tell he really wants to make this a good experience for his guests.

There was a pantry full of snacks made available to the guest, a frozen pizza in the freezer for a quick meal if needed and a Keurig machine. Definitely will be back if we are in the area to visit relatives. Highly recommended!"
2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! My wife and I had a wedding in Janesville that weekend. I was impressed with the amenities and the personal touches the host had done with the apartment. The weather was poor and we were happy to relax and watch 4k tv at night.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's place is so comfortable and inviting. It had wonderful snacks and beverages and even a fresh Kringle for breakfast! My friend and I were in the area for Wisconsin Sheep And Wool Festival and we loved having a homey place to relax and catch up. It was only a short walk to many wonderful restaurants. The front porch was a very peaceful place to sit as well. The only thing I would advise is to let Jim know if you would like to use the futon as a bed. We assumed we would just be able to make it up ourselves when we came home after dinner the first night. But there was no extra bedding in the unit. When we contacted Jim he brought bedding and a nice pad for the second night.
I would most certainly recommend this place!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very nice place that's much bigger than it looks in the pictures. Drinks and snacks at the ready, many hospitable touches throughout the place, and the hosts are very helpful with quick response times. Everything you need except a washer and dryer."

He was quick to respond and easy to get a hold of. One of the better AirBnB hosts we have had contact with. If the upstairs tenant was home, there was nothing to indicate it. The kitchen is very user friendly had we needed to prepare a meal there, it would have been a delight. Our stay was short but Jim made the entire experience pleasant."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean. Great location! Larger than seems in photos. Fantastic place to stay.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jim's place was great for my time in Janesville. I needed a home base while teaching a two-week course at UWW Rock, and this space was great. It had all the amenities that I needed plus a few more. Great kitchen space stocked with snacks waiting when I arrived. The bedroom has a comfy bed and plenty of dresser and closet space. I really enjoyed the light through the many windows and breeze that came through when the two screen doors were open. Close to downtown and the river, I had great walks around the area. When I return to Janesville, Jim's place is the first place I'll look at for a place to stay."

Beautiful apartment with a lovely layout, very clean and there were a lot of thoughtful touches throughout. We spent just over a week in this very cozy place that really felt like being at home, and we loved every minute of our stay. The location is in a very beautiful setting and we really enjoyed our morning coffee on the back patio looking out into a beautiful and tranquil wooded area. Highly recommend this apartment and plan to stay there again the next time I'm in the Janesville area."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very clean and cozy apartment in a nice community that is very thoughtfully furnished & equipped. I never met my host but communication was great & access was easy. Fantastic place to stay.

2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim and Marilyn have put a lot of thoughtful effort into making a space to relax and reflect. We felt very welcomed! And the apartment is a short walk to downtown shops, restaurants, and the Rock River. The set up is really nice too. For a small space, my husband and I could be together or sneak off alone to the bedroom, sitting area in the front of the house, or to the living room by the electric fire. We decided we needed a place like this at home--a she shed for me and a writing shack for my Paul! :-)"

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed in this apartment. Clean, comfortable and wonderful amenities. The hosts are friendly and responsive. The apartment is located close enough to interstate to get to Madison or other areas you may want to visit. We walked to the downtown area, which isn't thriving, but does have some nice restaurants and small town charm. Gas and quick stops are nearby as well. This place in great for 3 people, but could probably accommodate a couple more, depending on how friendly the group is. There is a BBQ, if you are visiting family or just want to chill. We like the Janesville area, and this was a perfect stopover that is priced right!"

Overall a really good time was had by all, and our hosts were very gracious and responsive- thank you for a great stay!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible! I've stayed in airbnb properties in major cities across the country...who woulda guessed that this hidden gem in tiny Janesville, WI would be my favorite??? Every aspect of the stay was great:

- Zero noise from neighbors
- Communication was great, check-in/check-out process were quick and painless

The final touch that put this over the top was the fully stocked kitchen. I walked in and noticed muffins on the counter and thought to myself, ""Oh, that's a nice touch."" I unpacked my stuff and was about to head to the grocery store, but stopped to open the fridge quickly to see if maybe there was a bottled water because I was thirsty. The fridge was full...yogurt, water, juice, adult beverages... Then I looked in the freezer and there were pizzas... Then I looked in the pantry and there were snacks from top to bottom. On top of that, the coffee and tea selection was the best I've seen at an airbnb. Jim and Marilyn know how to host."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When it comes to Jim and Marilyn's setup, I couldn't imagine a better spot in the Janesville area. They really know how to make you feel at home.

Fresh flowers, options to snack on, beverages, clean linen and towels, bathroom appliances, and I could go on and on. We are definitely going to recommend this space to our great friends who reside in the Janesville area for any of their guests. It was a pleasure."

We are starting to feel like this is our home away from home. And now, since we are moving to town, we have new friends in Jim and Marilyn.
Again, the thoughtful and interesting touches won us over. And, even though there was only a short time between visits, Jim had made some improvements!"

2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t get much better than having adult beverages already in the fridge waiting for you! Jim also had a few cans of New Glarus Spotted Cow beer in there. That beer can only be purchased in Wisconsin. Besides that, Jim was an outstanding host. I had misplaced the key and managed to lock myself out as well. As embarrassed as I was in telling Jim of my plight, he came quickly to the rescue! A great place with a great host! I would stay there again, if Jim would have me. Lol"

It was perfect for what we needed!"

The place was extremely clean, well kept, and cozy. There were quite literally no issues with our stay or the home."

We were able to cook a family dinner with the pots, pans, knives, spices, etc. that the kitchen had. It would be great if the living room had more seating but overall a nice place. The neighborhood was quiet, I also liked that it had sidewalks as other neighborhoods I’ve stayed in this area don’t always have sidewalks (safer for going for a run)."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place!!! Everything about this home was outstanding. We came to visit our 2 college students in Whitewater and brought them here with our yorkie and would not want to stay anywhere else in Janesville. The host was very responsive.

Nice little welcome gifts for my husband and I, as well as our kiddos.

Another evening, we locked ourselves out and they had us back in within minutes of texting them.
Very clean and very well laid out home. We also really enjoyed the fenced in back yard for our pups to run.
Overall, a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back:))"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying at the B And S Holdings in Janesville, WI! We were very impressed by the house layout, amenities, cleanliness, and overall experience. The hosts were very friendly, proactive, and accommodating. Our only downside was just how busy the street the house was on was. I think we only really noticed this aspect because we have two small children and a dog. Otherwise the neighborhood seemed nice. There was a hidden park nearby that was great for us to walk to and it was very easy to get to and from a number of things in the area. We LOVE the house and felt so at home. We really liked the design, functionality, and flow. The added bonus of having a desk/workspace (I work remote) was super convenient too!"

I’m looking forward to making this Airbnb part of our annual traditions."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A Threesome of old traveling buddies decided to attend a Rodeo in Janesville, WI and chose this fantastic Airbnb to stay in for 4 nights. What is the most important aspect of a rental property? Cleanliness and B & S Holdings sparkled! The floors, tubs/showers, countertops, appliances, drawers... everything was spotless! We could not have been more pleased with the amenities including the comfortable beds, a basement that had various activities, the closet full of board games, and a fenced-in backyard with a firepit where we gathered every night to catch up on our lives. Lastly, the owners were fantastic and quick to respond to our questions. This was the PERFECT place to rent and the pictures don't do it justice!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"""Above and beyond"" doesn't begin to describe how responsive the owners were, both in their communication and in how incredibly accommodating they were in addressing every question or need we had. A rating of 5 stars is much too low to reflect how much they care."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home, spotless, just what we needed on our trip to Janesville for our nephew’s wedding. We had plenty of room for our family.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"This home was everything stated and then some. There was lots of great communication, and plenty of answers to my questions prior to arrival. The home itself was absolutely beautiful. From decor to functionality in cleanliness this place was top notch. Everything was labeled and if mechanical had instructions. The beds are super comfortable and the back yard a great place for coffee (from the fully stocked coffee bar) in the morning. We had a slight issue with the dryer, and the host was unbelievably responsive, and had someone there to check on it (and fix it) within a very short time. If I ever go to Janesville again I won't hesitate to stay there."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter graduated from college and I was super nervous and stressed. I decided to rent an Airbnb for the weekend. And I have not made a better decision this year. Due to bad weather, I was late checking in, but once we got there we found a home away from home. Everything was nice and clean, there was so much space, and the kitchen made me rethink my home decor! There were board games and snacks-- my family devoured the Hershey's kisses. The temp in the house was a little crisp but the host left easy step-by-step directions for adjusting the heat. In the meantime, every room was filled with baskets with fluffy blankets for our convenience—tons of things to make my family feel welcome and comfortable.
Since my daughter has graduated from college I most likely will not be returning to the area any time soon, but is it possible that B&S Holdings have other listings? I would rent from them not just anytime but all of the time!!!! Thank you for a great weekend B and S Holdings!"

There are lots of thoughtful touches and many available snacks - we spent one very cold day totally inside, very very happily. Quick ride out to the Ice Age Trail segments. A perfectly relaxing stay and I would oh so gladly reserve again!"

Close to some nice outings (botanical garden, ice age trail)."

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was fantastic! The location in Janesville was near everything we wanted to be near, but not so much in the middle of any hustle and bustle. The host was very communicative and answered any questions we had promptly. The suggestions for local entertainment and food were spot on."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little house convenient to everything. Good food recommendations and snacks to tide you over. Great experience overall.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and quaint space— just what we needed for a quick trip to visit family.

This made for such an easy transition into the weekend!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a delightful, comfortable and stylish home. We enjoyed the thoughtful touches like the provided drinks and snacks. The back deck is a lovely place to spend time. Christine was welcoming and easy to communicate with. We'll be back."

Great to have morning coffee on the backyard deck. Comfortable living room furniture and bed. Would stay here again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Mathew is very kind and responsive. His rental property is quite basic but it gets the job done, especially if you are just looking for a place to sleep. Some supplies were initially missing, but he came by pretty quick to restock. I feel that the cost is a bit high for the value, but it seems to me that Airbnb fees have been rising so this may be par for the course now. Overall I rate this property 4 out of 5 stars."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Matthew’s place was very easy to check in. Matthew is friendly and accommodating always replied, with in a little while if I had any questions . It’s close to restaurants and shopping. Great place overall ."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Needed a place to stay close to family over the holidays with a dog - this was one of few options and met our needs. It was very clean! Shower pressure was great and bed was comfy, with extra blankets and pillows provided. Not in the prettiest of locations with minimal amenities and overpriced at $230/night for the 2 of us, but a pretty cool older home with character that could house way more ppl. Called the owner on Christmas Eve to get the lockbox code and he picked up right away, can’t ask for better service than that."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This home was perfect for our trip to see or granddaughter. We will be back. Thank you Matthew for everything.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I was very happy to stay here. It was so much better than a hotel. The neighborhood was safe and nice that it wasn't right in town. I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Janesville.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I think this was our 3rd or 4th stay at this location. Kevin is an absolute fantastic host.

Highly recommend Kevin and any unit he maintains. He's the best!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,We always try to stay at one of Kevin’s properties when we go to Janesville! Kevin is a fantastic host. The unit is spotless and has a lot of space. Kevin is very responsive and helpful - he always gets back to us extremely quickly! Best host by far!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal - one of the best AirBnB’s we have ever stayed in. It was so cozy that we remarked we could envision living there. Check in was a breeze, the host was rapid quick to respond, the unit was stocked with everything you could need. Wish we could have stayed longer!
For any fellow road trippers, we had some minor inconvenience (of our own making) because the garage clearance was too low for us to drive in with our roof rack on. Noting quickly if you’re in a similar position as us."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We always check if one of Kevin’s properties is available when we are in town! This was our first stay at this particular home and it was perfect for us and our dog to stay for the holidays. The house had everything we could have needed - especially appreciate having a well stocked kitchen and washer/dryer.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is remarkable! One of the most well appointed and beautiful Airbnb’s I have ever seen. Very large rooms, spotless, and very nicely decorated. Having use of a garage (with a remote) and access to laundry facilities made staying here like home. Was in town for business for the week and having a place even better than home made having to be away for work not only bearable but relaxing and productive. This property is a gem and Kevin was super friendly and responsive. Where is the 6th star so I can use that rating?"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this rental as a place to stay for our wedding in Janesville - it was the perfect place for wedding prep activities and getting ready on the day. It’s a beautiful, very functional home that felt spacious and nicely updated. Would recommend/stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the second property we stayed at that Kevin manages, and it did not disappoint! Kevin’s homes are always in fantastic condition! A great space to relax in - large bedrooms, 3(!) bathrooms, a spacious kitchen and a great family room with a gigantic TV! Loved the washer/dryer on the first floor as well! Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed at Kevin’s place while we were in town for a family wedding. It was more than enough room for our family of four. We had a busy weekend and didn’t cook at home at all but it was very well appointed. We appreciated the toiletries and comfortable beds to get great rest after long days.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was wonderful needs comfortable. Everything was great only needs railings and a wingback chair !
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,we truly enjoyed our stay. Kevin’s location is five star where we are also super host and we loved everything about this location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is one of best Airbnbs that I have stayed at, in terms of feeling like a home. Nice neighborhood, nice backyard, and quiet but close to things. Kitchen is friendly and open, connects well with living area. Clean dishes. Comfy bedrooms. There is a quiet space with a desk in the basement. Definitely want to stay here again. Super host!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay with our pups. Great place and host!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My dad and I had a wonderful stay. Absolutely fantastic home. Thank you!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We can’t say enough good things about Kevin’s place. The home is very clean, comfortable and well supplied. The quiet neighborhood also made us feel right at home to enjoy a walk around the neighborhood, dinner on the patio and a good nights sleep. Kevin is very quick to respond to questions and easy to communicate with. We would definite stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was exactly as described. Central to everything and in a great safe neighborhood. The decorations and linens were top notch. Great communication and flexibility. Would stay here again if ever in Janesville.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place to stay with lots of little touches that made it feel like home. Loved that there were snacks and water upon arrival, hand soap, shower gel, blankets, lots of towels, and hangers provided as well as a vacuum which came in handy during a long stay. Beds were super comfortable and the location is very quiet (could hear birds chirping in the morning). Well decorated, modern, and perfectly clean. A few things to know- water pressure in showers is really strong, there is only one tv (no tvs in bedrooms, which for us turned out to be a plus), there is a toaster oven instead of a toaster. None of these detracted from our stay and were easy to adjust to. House also has a peaceful backyard with a great grill and patio furniture. Would love to stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"All the comforts of home! Clean well equipped with everything you need. Beautiful up-dated decor. Perfect location close to shopping and restaurants. Will definitely stay here again!!
Jim & Vicki, from SC"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place was perfect for our needs! And Kevin was very helpful and a great host! We moved from another state and were closing on a house and needed somewhere to stay for a month on very short notice. Our original choice booking was booked by someone else; however, Kevin helped by letting us know he also had this property, which we think turned out even better for us. It’s spacious inside and out (nice two-car garage and long driveway), has a lot of useful starters like toiletries, laundry supplies, coffee, etc. Water pressure is awesome for showers and lots of hot water. It’s tucked back in a quiet, nice neighborhood, yet has close access to shopping and major roads. We cannot say enough about our host Kevin! Very kind, easy to talk to, always available, never intrusive; he took a lot of pressure off of our very stressful moving transition. I highly recommend this location and I highly recommend Kevin as a host!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place, great location, perfect for our needs… we will be staying again next time we are in town."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the percect place to stay when coming to visit my family with my baby and dogs! The place made me feel right at home. Kevin is very responsive and great to work with. We are so happy we found this option when coming to town. We will definitely stay here again in the future. Thanks for accomodating us perfectly!!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful space with plenty of room and high ceilings which is great when you’re tall. Fast and efficient snow removal even in a minor blizzard.

Everything we needed was provided as well as some extra touches! Truly a home away from home! Kevin was fabulous to work with, he helped us out so much when we had to extend our stay unexpectedly. 10 out of 10, highly recommend!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I was looking for a place last minute for my family & 2 dogs due to something that came up at my home not to far away. Kevin was great to communicate with and made it so easy to reserve the home and responded quickly! This was a great stay-cation even though I still had to work from home. It has a nice downstairs with a desk and chair if you need to have a quiet place to work. The place was super clean (huge bonus points), kitchen has everything you need with all the amenities. Loved the added bonus of the snacks on the island! If you have dogs there is a nice backyard space that they will be able to run around in. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area. The neighborhood was very quiet, but yet you are close to many places to go and eat and shop. If I needed to stay somewhere close to home again, this is the first place I would reserve! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5"

Nice park within walking distance as an added bonus."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the nicest Airbnbs we’ve ever stayed in! Well-appointed, spacious and comfortable — with an amazing backyard. Beautiful furnishings and decor from top to bottom. Immaculately clean with thoughtful touches throughout — fully-stocked gourmet kitchen, big-screen TV, ceiling fans in the bedrooms, crisp white towels and pristine two-car attached garage. The home was perfect for the four of us — and our dog was in heaven in the backyard! It felt just like home. Kevin was a fantastic host -- super friendly and responsive. We highly recommend this property!"

Great host!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house is impeccably clean, super comfortable, and has a lovely kitchen for cooking and organizing your food. Some kitchens in airbnb's don't inspire me to want to cook, but this one did. The beds are nurturing, the house is well lit, and Kevin is quickly responsive to any needs that might arise. It was only a 40 minute drive to Lake Geneva and we were able to take a gorgeous fall walk there."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kevin is a great host. His property is very well maintained and he goes above and beyond. We hope to stay with him again.

Janesville was a fun place for our two young kids; there was A LOT of great outdoor activities to enjoy nearby. The hosts were helpful with recommendations. Wonderful experience."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb’s we have stayed in. Very modern and everything was very clean. We had an event in Madison and it was an easy drive every day and nice to stay out of the city.
Kevin was quick to communicate with and made it easy to check in and out. Would highly recommend!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If we could give Kevin 10 or more stars, we would! Before/during/after our stay, Kevin was incredibly responsive. I've rented Airbnbs in 10 countries on 4 continents, and Kevin is #1 among all hosts.
The unit itself was perfect for us for our 14-night stay. We prepared and ate almost all of our meals in the unit, which is outfitted very well. Standouts include: (1) The Weber grill; (2) the large Speed Queen Commercial washer and dryer and all of the supplies needed for washing/drying clothes; (3) the excellent 65-inch TV in the living room; (4) ceiling fans in both bedrooms; (5) a spacious 2-car garage with 2 remote controls; (6) both Keurig and filtered coffee machines, along with a generous supply of K-cups and high-quality filters; (7) plenty of good-quality bath towels."

Everything looked as amazing as pictured, and having a kitchen complete with every imaginable utensil, glass, and cookware and a stocked laundry closet was so convenient. Location was in a quiet, conveniently located neighborhood for visits with family and day trips, and we loved sitting out on the patio enjoying our morning coffee and star gazing at night. Kevin was great with communication, and checking in and out could not have been more convenient. Would stay again in a heartbeat!"

Attention was paid to all the extras, kitchen supplies, extra towels etc. The decor is truly warm and inviting. The host responds quickly. I will definitely consider booking again in the future when visiting family in the area. My only suggestion would be a small table added to the bathroom, as there is no counter space for the toiletries."

2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was rough due to the lock not working, they did say they were ordering a replacement. I did have to have them unlock the door since the house is connected to them ( side by side duplex ). I did have a zen inscent burning during my stay which I didn’t know was against the rules, I then got billed $200 for “smoking in the residence.” I don’t smoke. I Wish the rules were more clear so there would be no mishaps, also wasn’t aware I had to leave the place completely spotless, due to there being a cleaning fee."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Home is perfect for 2 people. Very nice decor and very appropriate for tourists. Very conveniently located to with lots of places to eat and close to interstate. Very accommodating. 0 complaints. Would definitely stay again.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Jamie's cabin. The living room was comfy, and the views from the kitchen table were beautiful. I had so much fun just watching the wildlife from the kitchen table. The beds were comfortable, even for people who often have trouble sleeping in hotel beds (most of my family). It was very clean. Also the air conditioning worked amazing, even when the temperatures almost reached 100. We highly recommend staying here!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for 2 weeks, and it was lovely! The neighborhood is off the beaten path, but near enough to Madison. It was quiet, and the chipmunks kept you company during the day, while the fireflies and owls came out at night. It was near to towns that were fun to explore too. If we come back to this area, I would definitely look into staying here again."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was clean and comfortable. Stove and kitchen good for cooking. Jamie was great! Neighborhood in early April was very quiet because it was off season for boating/lake activities.
I would stay there again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Immediately after check in I went outside to take pictures of the cabin before dark and ended up standing there in the snow till my finger tips were frozen observing the beautiful family of deer that just gradually passed right in front of me. I took this as a sign to just be in the moment. So I did. Truly taking advantage of the peace I felt here and will be back for more! Thank you for sharing this beautiful space.

2022-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The kitchen stove oven! Do not close the door ‘
And in the sleeping room, I personally think it would be a stronger ceiling light or dimmer that can regulate the intensity"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is cozy for a weekend getaway. Our small family stayed for Thanksgiving and it was very calming. It’s a little hard to get in with a double keyed deadbolt. I’m sure the weather attributed to the lock sticking. Otherwise it’s Alexa enabled, Wi-Fi was great and Nest thermostat. Appliances are stainless steel although we ordered food and didn’t use them. The sunrise and sunsets where the best!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie has his stuff together. Clean cabin, great views, and 30 minutes away from Madison. I reached out for help a few times and he was always quick to respond. Would definitely stay again!"

Gorgeous views (especially of the sunrise over the lake in the morning!), a lovely quiet setting, and comfortable cozy accommodations. I even saw deer outside several times. The upper deck is perfect for relaxing with a good book and enjoying the ambiance. There is even a lovely county park with wonderful hiking trails just a few minutes drive away."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful visit! The Overlook at Lake Koshkonong was perfect for us. The open-floorplan downstairs area has a kitchen, a living room with an easy to use and comfy fireplace, and a dining area. There's also a dining table with chairs and a combo Keurig/regular coffeemaker. The upstairs was very cozy too, with a very comfortable larger bed, skylights (with Roman shades for nighttime), another bathroom with a tub, and a large closet space with hangers which was useful for clothing since we were staying for several days. There's a deck on the second floor with seating, which was awesome for coffee on brisk October mornings. The surrounding area is lovely, with the lake across the street, a wooded area behind, and restaurants a short drive away. It's a great location for quick drives to Madison, and during our stay we also visited Milwaukee and the House on the Rock. Our host, Jamie, was super responsive and a pleasure to work with. Thank you for a fantastic experience!"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very rustic & charming Cabin.
With lots of wooden features & a nice outdoor deck to enjoy some morning tea & coffee.
We were there to prepare & celebrate our wedding so it was nice to be able to use that deck to sit & talk with friends as they waited to check into their AirBnb.
The area is very pretty you have many tall trees around you, a small view of the lake & friendly neighbors.
It was quiet which was perfect!
Very relaxing.
Jamie the host is super friendly & very good with communication.
Thank you!
:)"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location. Great views of the lake. Some quirkiness noted as in other reviews with shower, but didn’t find it a problem - and the charm of the place easily overcomes that. Very thankful to the hosts - super easy check in and check out, info about surrounding places to eat, etc. - highly recommend!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was in a great location and quiet. Jamie was great he was very responsive to any questions we had and the follow-up was great also.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Charming cabin. Wished there was more lake view with it. Quiet setting. Made for a relaxing time.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin to get away from the busy life - the kinda place you might see bigfoot in :)
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The lake is awesome. Location is with in about an hour to the dells or Milwaukee. This is a great choice if planing a long week end and wanting to visit either or both without staying in the congest areas.
BTW check out the local bars a d restaurant for good food and entertainment.
Buckhorn supper club, Stagecoach, and Anchor"
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at a cozy little cabin on a Big lake.The Sunrises over the lake are exceptional ! Very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Jamie was a great Host! Would return again in the future.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a couple's weekend away. Charming log cabin in a peaceful nature setting had a good location for exploring Edgerton, the Indian Mounds and Fort Atkinson. We appreciated the covered carport when an unexpected hail storm came through. We enjoyed the little garden and the upper-level deck was perfect for enjoying coffee in the morning and a warm breeze in the evening. We ate at Cafe on Main and 2 Brothers in Edgerton and both were excellent meals!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place. Good upper deck to relax on.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking to hike, fish, boat and/or kayak, location is ideal. Comfortable sleeping. The deck is wonderful for outside seating in woods near water."
2022-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is nicely built however it needs basic upgrades as well as cleaning on the outside to clear away cobwebs and update the seating. There was maintenance needed inside as well such as getting the cold water to work in the shower - it was too hot to be comfortable - and fixing the bathroom light switch so it stayed on. Adding nicer accommodations such as basic bedside tables and comfortable living room furniture would be appreciated. Note that the lake access is a ways down the street at a small public boat launch.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a comfortable and cozy spot for a quiet lake-side getaway! Has everything you need for some quality R&R!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredibly peaceful
2022-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,It was a very cozy place. The only issue was with the shower. It only had blazing hot water. Other than that it was a nice stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt in love with this place, amazing experience with nature, very peaceful, great to recharge energy. Love to look the birds and animals around in the morning while I was drinking my coffee outside, the sky during sunrise and sunset, the moon and the lake were perfectly great. Definitely I wish I could come back soon. Host attention and communication was perfect. Thanks Jamie."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable.And affordable.Will definitely be back.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful cabin, amazing view of the lake, very clean and cozy! I couldn't recommend enough!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sweet little cabin on the lake not far from gas stations and grocery shopping if needed. Easy to get to and lovely scenic drive. The neighborhood was quiet with the public access to the beach just a couple minutes away. I only got to see one waddling raccoon but several wildlife residents partied through the night and gave the cabin a very cozy, secluded feeling. Even on a cold, rainy weekend I would recommend this spot!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There isnt access to the lake, however, the view from the top deck while drinking coffee is tranquil! Stores and othere places are well within driving distance. Neighbors are nice and respectful."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay except no direct access to the water.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at Jamie's cozy, lakeside retreat. The fireplace was especially lovely, and the kitchen is a cook's dream! We look forward to visiting during warmer weather, when we can properly enjoy the beautiful, spacious deck."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place! We will come back!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful cabin on the Lake setting. Our host, Jamie, was attentive, accommodating and exceptional!! The beauty of nature, the lake, the deer in the backyard, the red cardinal, the woodpecker on the tree and the red robins looked staged if we did not know better. Ha! Will most definitely try to book this cabin again when we return to WI from AZ! Pat & Greg"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place with a thoughtful host!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angreat getaway spot, we absolutely loved staying here with sights out to the lake! We loved that it was so cozy and had all the comforts of home, we were able to make all our meals on site and the kitchen had everything we needed. We ate breakfast on the terrace and enjoyed a bit of outdoors at a local park, and it’s close to Fitchburg and Madison for day trips. Jaime was super responsive and accommodating, an awesome host!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely place to stay while visiting Madison! The cottage was warm and inviting, with beautiful attention to detail in the wood trim and paneling, bathroom tile, upstairs deck overlooking the lake, and comfy living room. Cooking meals was a breeze in the large kitchen with big, modern gas stove. Jamie answered all of our questions before and during our stay. Highly recommend!"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet space.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy & comfy! It was warm and clean and everything we could have wanted. The plentiful amount of cooking utensils allowed us to cook all weekend! We have only good things to say about this spot. Also there’s a cool Amish grocery store about 15 min away that also had a goat, dog and 2 cats to pet out front. 10/10 perfect trip!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a nice cabin that worked well for my husband and I and our three-year old. We’d love to come back when it’s warmer and spend some time outside.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cleanest AirBnB we've ever stayed. Everything was great, sunrise over the frozen lake was gorgeous. Lots to do in the area, even in the winter."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie was great, and the cabin was AMAZING. Highly recommend this place :)"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the quiet, peaceful getaway we had at the log cabin with view of the lake across the street. If you’re staying in the winter, bring warm socks as the tile floor on the main floor is chilly."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was really clean and cozy!!
we enjoyed the stay!!
Hopefully we can come back in summer time !!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful custom built contemporary cabin with all the amenities one would need in an Airbnb, full fledged kitchen, fridge, One Pot, Ninja Mixer and much more. It has a rustic look and is surrounded by trees on one side and the lake on the other side. The best cabin experience we ever had!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cozy little house! Good for relaxing in the winter! Not sure about summertime possibly will find out!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderfully custom built wooden cabin with clever designs to save space. Felt at home right away, and was able to catch a solid 3 nights' sleep not waking up at all from noise/light. The nice electric fireplace, kitchen, washer/dryer and upstairs deck were huge bonuses! And we were right across the lake from Indigenous effigy mounds so we got to learn about the history of the lake and river culture <3"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing cabin! Jamie was really communicative and checked in on us during our stay, so we really appreciated that. The cabin was beautiful and clean. Really liked having a full kitchen and having central heat in a cabin was really helpful. The deck lights up at night so my bf and I were able to sit out and hang out to some calmness, something we don't get much in Chicago. We really enjoyed downtown Edgerton as well! Met some kind locals that made the trip even more memorable. Highly recommend it and would love to come back! :)"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a weekend getaway in December, nice cozy clean."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great experience! The Overlook surpassed our expectations. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by an entire family of deer. To the smallest of details, having everything we could’ve needed and more. Truly a home away from home in the coziest cabin."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful space and good location. I wish I went in the summer because I would have spent so much more time outside. We loved playing chess and checkers!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the ideal cabin for a fall or weekend getaway. Everything feels rustic but has modern comforts. The kitchen is especially well done. Lovely area with woods backing up to the property. Highly recommend to anyone seeking a cabin stay
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute cabin across the street from the lake. You are higher up so you still have a lake view. Neat patio off the bedroom. Too cold and snowy for us to enjoy but maybe if we come back in the summer....
House is very comfortable. Stairs are a little steep if you have a problem with stairs."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, great stove, amazing location"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place nice people I very much recommend for everybody
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We will definitely be staying here again if we are in the area and recommending it to friends. The space is beautiful and well-cared for. We used two beds: the king was soft and cozy and the twin day bed was firm- fitting both our preferences. The deck is awesome and you can see the lake and the sunrise.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The overlooked cabin is a beautifully done cabin with an interior that is completely wood paneled except in the bathrooms where the tile work is extremely well done! We enjoyed all the amenities that one could think of in this comfortable and modernized cabin with a rustic look! we enjoyed being on the second story deck with the view of Lake Koshkonong. The grounds are nicely kept and have some large hickory trees. The cabin is perfect for a couple or a small family with one or two children!
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay overall! Cabin was very cute and the location was nice and peaceful. The place a cute little getaway from ago the hustle bustle and craziness of life (and yes, I needed a getaway from it!). As long as the bed is fixed (very creaky) it would have been perfect!

The space is clean and cozy with a lovely peek at the lake from the spacious deck. Would definitely recommend for an easy getaway!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little cabin. This was the perfect mini getaway for us at the end of summer.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and super cute cabin. Jamie is a very good and helpful host.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family had a very nice time during our stay. Everything was clean, the appliances (and AC) worked well, and all the amenities in general were great. It also felt nice to stay in a more secluded town than others in the area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so relaxing. The upstairs patio is a great place for meals with a great view of the lake. There is a great place to put a kayak or boat in just down the road.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Three old room-mates had a wonderful restful reunion at the cabin. The cabin is a work of art, beautiful construction, and nicely furnished. We enjoyed cooking on a lovely stove and eating at the cabin. The outdoor deck has plenty of comfortable furniture and is very peaceful, next to a large white pine tree and shag bark hickory tree. We didn’t have any trouble with mosquitos.
We had a great time playing music on Amazon’s Alexa, and going for walks in the interesting neighborhood.
The bedroom upstairs isn’t large, but it was large enough for the three of us to have three separate beds, one being on the floor.
Everything was very clean, and we felt safe.
Jamie is a great communicator, very responsive and helpful.
We hope to stay at this cabin again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Just as the pictures show!! Quiet and Relaxing !! AC works well
Jamie responded right away !!! Thanks so much.."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a cute little cabin! We were very happy with our stay and Jamie’s responsiveness to our questions. 10/10 would stay again!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Overall an excellent place if you want to get away from it all. No TV , with only subscriber access to online services. Not for those with any mobility issues due to the stairs and the limited use of the upstairs bathroom. Downstairs Bathroom with shower stall did need a shower mat which we left at the cabin as the vinyl shower stall is very slippery during a shower.
Would have appreciated a manual on what remote was needed for what ever appliance/ light or TV needed. Not everyone is accustomed to having everything on a remote."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was exactly as shown in pictures. It was very clean with everything there that you could need. It was quiet and private. We totally enjoyed our stay..
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This cabin is a must stay. Can’t beat the price and it has everything anyone would need. The owner is super cool.

2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Giving a big thanks to an amazing weekend me and family had. Peaceful and all the animals/wild life is beautiful. Outdoors was amazing. Inside was cozy, and the wood work was beautiful never seen anything like it. And also had a great crime book. But hands down great cabin in woods by beautiful lake. Loved it."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend Jamie & Kayla's cabin for a 2 person getaway. The place was exactly as described, very clean, everything smelled nice, and had some nice extras (plenty of shampoo & conditioner, makeup wipes, tampons in the bathrooms, a little basket with beach towels, water bottles, sunscreen & bug spray, etc). The deck had a nice little view of the lake, and is bordered on one side by trees, giving it a more secluded and woodsy feel than expected. We loved the bedroom opening up to the deck, and the whole cabin is a study in well used space, as well as being very cute (by far the cutest, most cabin-y place on the street). Wouldn't recommend if you have a toddler or crawler, due to the open stairway and spacing on the deck rail, but it's perfect for 2 people, or 2 adults + a kid old enough to not fall off a deck but young enough to not creep you out sleeping on the little bed 2 feet from you.
The area was very peaceful (we were there during the week).
We also found some good bars & breweries within a 25 minute drive - for some reason there's no public beach on this lake, but there are a few on Lake Mills 25 minutes away. Recommend hitting Sunset Bar & Grill (15 min drive)."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great...it was clean and cozy, very well kept. We have never used AirBNB before, but will definitely consider this route in future vacations. Jamie was also very prompt in relying to messages. 5 out of 5 starts."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was a great AirBnb rental. Everything well kept up with special little touches and conveniences everything.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin has a nice lake view, is a short drive to Madison and a reasonable one to Milwaukee. We had a great time visiting a local dairy farm, visiting Madison, and visiting Milwaukee.
Cabin was very clean and the hosts are super responsive. For the price it is a great value."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cabin was clean and cozy. We had a great time there. We enjoyed sitting by the fire pit and listening to birds.

It was wonderful to open the windows at night and listen to the crickets."

2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing. You will not want to leave. I loved the room with the beds so much. It connects directly to the deck or ""overlook"" that floats above the relaxing wooded scenery with a splendid view of the lake."

2021-03-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The home is very clean and would be excellent for a couple or small family looking for a relaxed and quiet weekend away. If you are hoping for wide open spaces and nature adventures with your children, then please be aware that this property does not offer a large play space or direct access to the lake. We took our kids for the mile walk to visit the lake and we enjoyed this (as we are the walking type), but it was not the daily fishing trip and nature play space we had envisioned. The host was kind and communicative, and the home was clean and well-kept. Thank you!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything I needed on my recent business trip. First of all, it was extremely clean which was my biggest worry. I was greeted by two yummy chocolates on the table and a house full of clean, smelling good linens, as well as all of the appliances you could possibly need. Everything was above and beyond, from the soap, shampoo and conditioner in the shower, to the makeup remover towelettes and laundry pod to do a load of laundry before returning home. The fireplace added such a cozy feel along with the ability to listen to music on the echo dot. I truly felt like home and that is much appreciated as I get homesick! Highly recommend this cute little cabin for a family trip, couples trip, or a lonely business trip!"

I can imagine this being a great place in the summer with the lake so close."
