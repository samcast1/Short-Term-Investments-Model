2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What's in Ohio? I often asked that, until we stayed here. Urbana is a city of dollhouses. When you're not admiring the sunsets, or the cute town, you can hang back in this cute, comfortable studio.
Some pros:
-The tub, have you ever bathed in a $4k tub? You can here.
-The bed is super comfy, my fiancee wants to know what the pillow brand was.
-The tv- Works great with plenty of apps/easy to use.
-The hosts- They went above and beyond. Super kind, responsive, and generous.
-Murray the orange cat- She runs the Airbnb well, the best greeter you can have.
-The shower- It's like being on MTV Cribs.
Living without a full fridge posed some challenges because we're ice cream junkies, but we were able to fit some in there anyway, so it worked out.
The town is walkable, photogenic, and overall friendly. The lady and selection at The Merchant Shops are outstanding. People in reviews complained about the kids, but we had no trouble with anyone's kids.
We hope to return, and loved our stay"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stay was very clean, quiet, modern. Would definitely stay again"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little nook. Perfect place to get away for the weekend and escape the busy loud world. You'll fall in love with the tub no doubts. Comfy space and the little downtown area is walkable. Highly recommend Depot Coffee House down the street.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and we were so impressed! The inside was tranquil and the bathroom was a dream! We loved being able to walk to dinner, the local brewery, and walk around the neighborhood with all of the large old colonial homes. What a spectacular time!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time relaxing for the weekend at the Bungalow. I loved that we had a private entrance. My favorite part was the tub - I haven't relaxed like that in years!
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"if your there to get away and rest, don't mind the noise from the kids screaming and crying and a barking dog. host was very nice and accommodating. I have never stayed at airbnb and wasn't expecting the excess noise from the front of the house."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was so lovely. I definitely recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Lots within walking distance!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The ultimate relax getaway suite. I adore staying here. You will want to stay longer or find reasons to return. I am a frequent flyer at the suite. I stay at many many other spots on my work travels but this one’s my absolute favorite. Safe and peaceful. Easily walk the fun town to get food or see the shops.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cory and Emma were accomodating with a last minute booking for me, and I am beyond grateful! This momma needed some R & R while touring the Dayton area and starting a move. This place was so beautiful and peaceful. It is just as described and probably more gorgeous than the photos, in my opinion. The perfect size for a single person or a couple. The host has thought of everything, right down to cell phone charging cables, (because who hasn't ever forgotten those on a last minute trip!?) Thanks again Cory and Emma for everything!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described and cozy accommodations. Great location for a short stay while working nearby. Wish I would have had time to explore the area nearby, there seemed like there was a lot to do. Urbana seemed like a very nice town. Exactly what I needed."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for access to the heart of Urbana!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Cory and Emma’s home and I loved it even more than the first time! You can’t beat the price for the location and quality of this AirBnB. Super comfortable bed, LUXURIOUS bathroom…..what more do you need? Also, Cory is a very attentive and communicative host - easy check in and a easy check out. I’ll stay here every time I am in the area, no question!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We were in town for a wedding at the Fairgrounds. We were able to walk to the wedding! It was the perfect amount of space and location for our 1 night away. Everything was so clean and cute! Cory was great at messaging!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tub was amazing and the sole reason I booked. Perfect quick birthday getaway!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Scioto Bungalow was a home-away-from-home getaway! You thought of everything imaginable to make our stay comfortable, cozy, and clean...AND THEN SOME! The state of Ohio chocolates were an extra special touch. And we would have changed our trip plans just to spend one more night there in your beautifully-decorated historic, completely modernized unit. You were easy to communicate with, accessible, and we felt safe and snug as bugs in a rug! We will look for more reasons to visit Urbana, OH!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved this cute bungalow. It was so quiet and peaceful. Just what I was looking for while visiting family in the area. Everything I needed was there. Comfy bed and that TUB! I can’t say enough about how relaxing that tub was. Emma and Cory were very fast at responding to my messages and very friendly. I will want to stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing! The hosts went above and beyond by providing coffee pods, creamer, chocolates, games, tourism pamphlets, a binder with all the essential information and bath bombs for their gorgeous copper tub. They really thought of everything and it was so cozy and perfect. Highly recommend staying here even if you live nearby and need a getaway!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely lovely stay, thank y’all so much, the board games and bath bombs were a nice touch!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This bungalow had everything we could have ever needed for a weekend getaway. The bathroom was an interior decorator’s masterpiece with the walk in shower, rainfall shower head, antique copper oversized soak tub. This place was beautiful decorated and had everything we needed for the weekend.
Thanks Cory,
We look forward to staying here again!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"First off, they provided anything I could ever imagine needing (first aid kit, coffee, water, games, and kitchen accommodations for a kitchenette). Secondly, the place was decorated LOVELY. You can tell they spent time, money and thought in every touch. They even provided a cozy robe to wear after my amazing bath experience! To top it all off I had some trouble turning the TV on (it was installing updates that I was unaware of) and asked for help. He left me extra batteries outside the entrance door in the middle of the night. This bungalow was everything I was looking for, for my 1 night stay. They were quiet and I never heard a peep even with them having a small child and dog. I would absolutely book any Airbnb they would have. Thanks Emma & Cory! You guys are really doing it right! ;) 10 stars!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and i had a fantastic time. The bathtub is an absolute luxury and the shower was a treat I will miss when i'm home.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great quiet spot to get some work done, very flexible overall and super responsive!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"the Scioto Bungalow was perfect for a girls' getaway for one night. The Ohio shaped chocolate in our room from a local vendor was a nice personal touch. The keypad on the door allowed us to come and go easily, and the location was just steps from town. Cory and Emma were very responsive to our questions and were flexible when we had to reschedule at the last minute. The roku tv was great at the end of a busy day, which gave us a variety of choices of movies to watch. We loved the bathrobes, such a classy touch !"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was great! We’ll be back.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved my stay! They were amazing to communicate with. Only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is because it was hot and there was no where to adjust the temperature yourself. But other than that, I enjoyed my mommy vacation."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cory & Emma's spot was super clean, quiet, cozy, and accommodating. Comfy bed, large bathroom with beautiful tub and shower. Would absolutely recommend this stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was great! Bathroom is what I want my bathroom to be like. Right in town close to food and just a short drive to Dayton. It was perfect!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"For the price, this place was great. I will say, however, my next visit to the area probably will not be here because we found it too hot to sleep comfortably during our summer stay. It wasn’t terrible, prob upper 70s, but we like to sleep cold. Again, great stay for what we paid, but I’ll pay a little more for some personal climate control next time."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay. Would highly recommend and would return again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A truly lovely little apartment. I stayed for one night to break up a long road trip, and was so grateful for the easy check-in, plentiful parking, and beautiful (beautiful!!) bathroom. Emma and Cory have really made this spot feel like a private little haven, and it was the perfect place to stay before hitting the road again. The pretty posters of other places in Ohio just made me wish I had more time for detours!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We felt so at-home. My kid said ""why does it feel like we live here?"" LOL
Everything we needed was there, with lots of other extremely thoughtful small amenities like makeup remover wipes and lots of K-cups to choose from for the morning. My kid loved the large bath, and three bath bombs at once! The bed was comfortable, and there was plenty of bedding pillows."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a wonderful deal! So cozy and relaxing. The bathroom is luxurious!! Very comfortable and walking distance to many restaurants and shops.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved the place and had a wonderful stay. It was quiet, comfortable, convenient. The hosts arranged and communicated everything very clearly, made the entire trip pleasant. Would definitely try to stay here again."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place is nice. We were in town for a wedding and the location of this place made it really desirable. The air in the room was a little stale and we had some trouble getting good air circulation.
The place is very well-renovated. There are a lot of serious design choices that went into the place and I certainly appreciate that effort.
For the price and location, there’s really no bad thing I can say. I encourage others looking to stay in Urbana to stay here so long as the air circulation thing is figured out."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This is an absolutely beautiful space. Such a good value. Very clean and peaceful. I will definitely be staying here again as soon as I can. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed. The bathroom is amazing. The town itself is lovely and I walked around quite a bit. Fun.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"So far my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed in ! My fiancé and I even talked about coming here to do a little getaway soon and explore the little town since we were here for a wedding so didn’t get to do much exploring. But the venue was very close by to the Airbnb as well as there’s a lot close by to eat which is very accommodating! I love how they showed every detail on their listing for example what the door will look like to get in so you know what house you’re looking for even in the dark!! Also very descriptive on where things are and what they have! The only side comment is maybe having like extra toilet trees for the guests in case they forgot something. My fiancé forgot a toothbrush which is no big deal, I forgot make remover wipes when I swore up and down that I packed them but didn’t want to ruin their nice white towels so I used a tshirt I packed. But seriously this place is so stinking cute I love it. The tub is literally SO relaxing and huge !! Definitely will be back here !! Thanks so much!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was an excellent stay with a number of small, personal touches- from the bath bombs to the guest book. It was clean, bright, and welcoming. A great stay. The local town is very cute- great for antique hunting."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was everything! It was very clean, cozy and everything was just as pictured. The bed was very comfy and the pillows were fluffy. The huge tub and waterfall shower were to die for! The cute add ons like the essential oil bath bombs were very well thought of. There were even extra blankets, a space heater and a fan. The hosts were quick to respond and very friendly. If I’m ever in the area again I will definitely be rebooking! I loved this place!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super cozy, safe place to stay. The owners were very respectful of our privacy and I have nothing but good things to say. The space had everything we needed and more. Definitely, highly recommend this stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"For the price, this is the most excellent place I have ever stayed. I came to Ohio for the Springfield Extravaganza, and Cory/Emma’s place is exactly what I needed after a long day of walking in the hot weather. That tub was everything!!!! If you stay here, you have to eat at Cafe Paradiso. Best food ever. The AirBnB was super clean, super comfortable, exactly as described and pictured. I highly recommend staying here. I will stay here every time I come for the extravaganza!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Super! Always perfect!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a perfect place to stay!! They really thought of everything you could need. Private and spacious, it was an absolute treat to unwind here for the night after a very long drive. Beautiful bathtub, mini fridge and microwave, utensils/plates, coffee/tea, white noise machine. Games and books. Very clean. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay — very accommodating! Would stay at the Scioto Bungalow if we’re back in town!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this cozy, adorable bungalow! It was very clean and we really enjoyed the soaking tub. Great location within walking distance to lots of yummy eateries. Highly recommend staying here!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Everything was great. Loved the big copper bath tub and the later than typical check out time. The bed was great also.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location for our trip to the cave, young’s dairy, airplane museum & fish farm. The copper soaking tub & bath bombs are a nice extra touch. Great value stay, all the amenities of a hotel at 1/2 the price.
Only downside for us, since this unit is attached to the owners home (separate entrance) you can hear some
Noise from the floor above & under the doors. Having a sound machine provided helps drowning out some of the noise.
Emma’s communication was great. She even allowed our toddler to play in their backyard, which was super helpful.
The airplane cafe was wonderful to eat outside & watch the planes take off & land. Definitely worth checking out. Freshwater fish farm offers some great smoked trout, cheese & wine. Everything you need for a wonderful dinner to bring back to eat at the unit."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very welcoming and warm! Neat and tiny spot to stay and very accurately described by the host, definitely would go back."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The airbnb was very clean & Cory was very kind to leave a nice binder with good local food recommendations as well as biking/hiking info. Urbana was a beautiful historic town & this property fit right into it perfectly. Highly recommend staying at this property! 😇

2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay here was incredible restful! Space was clean and host went above and beyond in the little touches—like complimentary bath bombs.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Scioto Bungalow is SO lovely! A very cute and welcoming space with gorgeous features, especially the tub! Such a great value considering how affordable our stay was."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,very cute place to stay in a lovely little town! definitely recommend if you are in the area.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to spend a few days! “Bungalow” is exactly the right word. So comfortable and clean, and Cory and Emma could not have been any better to work with. Best Airbnb I’ve stayed at yet … I’ll be back."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even though we had to change our reservation around a few times, Cory and his wife were unbelievably accommodating and happy to work with us! We appreciated their fast and consistent communication! The suite was beautiful and so so clean! Everything was thoughtfully organized and ready for us. The “kitchen” area was precious and had everything we needed. The suite was a bit cold when we first arrived, but the space heater they provided kept the room warm throughout our stay. Our only issue was the shower and bathtub were touch and go for us, as a had difficulty getting the hot water to last. The hosts answered questions we had about how to deal with the hot water and how to make it work and checked in on us during our stay. My partner and I look forward to returning when the weather warms up. The bed is like a big marshmallow and we had a great night of sleep. Other than definitely staying in this beautiful suite, my other recommendation would be to go to Teabaggers for lavender lemonade, bubble tea and yummy sandwiches! We loved the quaintness of Urbana and can’t wait to return!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and cozy get away. Well worth the stay.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where to begin... from the beautiful little town, down to the small touches like the handmade bath bombs this place is absolutely amazing! The parking is hassle free and there was plenty. When you walk into the foyer area there is plenty of room to hang your coats and leave your shoes (the hosts have also thought of leaving an umbrella in case you decide to take a walk on one of Ohio's not so nice days). When you enter the beautiful room it is absolutely breathtaking. The beaded chandeliers, live plants, and homey touches such as extra blankets and honey sticks for the hot tea you can make in the Keurig are much appreciated. However, the absolute best part of this stay is the show stopping copper tub that fits two comfortably. It is jaw dropping and so relaxing. After a soak in the tub, we recommend a competitive game of Scrabble while enjoying some popcorn provided by the gracious hosts. After that, there is a fantastically comfortable bed where you can enjoy a movie before you drift off to sleep with the provided noise machine. We are so grateful for such a wonderful night away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Our hosts thought of every detail and even were able to give suggestions on local activities to do on the day of our departure. We were so sad to only spend one night but we will be back!"
2022-01-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute little suite on a quaint downtown street. It was perfect for a quick getaway!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved this beautiful place! Cleanly and very cute! Definitely will be back. Highly suggest!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a quaint beautiful home. The bungalow was everything and more. Hosts provided many special touches to make our stay perfect. Bed was super comfortable. Decor was beautiful. THAT BATHROOM was my favorite of all time. We walked downtown to visit the local shops and boutiques. Urbana has so much to offer.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very cute and comfortable place to stay, I would definitely come again!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic place to stay. We enjoyed the beautiful tub, and the place was immaculate.
Walking distance to a bunch of nice restaurants and shops.
Don't miss Café Paradiso which is just up the street. Very romantic, but also good for families of older folks."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely my favorite Airbnb EVER. It was so cozy, I never wanted to leave. And the bathtub..omg, the bathtub. Amazing."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome hosts and an awesome place. Everything was super clean and comfortable. The location to the downtown area is great and there are lots of great shops and restaurants within walking distance. We will definitely book again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome host, awesome place, accommodating to every request, and everything was accurate!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The BNB was such a beautiful place to stay! They had a totally separate entrance which was so nice since some evenings we were out later with family that we were in town to visit. They noticed we were traveling with a young toddler and set out electric outlet covers to use while we were there, put the knives from the kitchenette up before we even arrived! We had such a wonderful experience and would absolutely come back!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay! Nice and cozy, and super cute!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about this place! The location was within walking distance to so many cute downtown shops that we were able to explore. The room itself was SUPER clean and comfortable - Everything we needed was provided including dishes, games, snacks, coffee, creamer, water, etc. The bed was actually super comfortable which is hard to come by in many listings. We had just enough space for just the 2 of us. The pictures of the bathroom speak for themselves, but the shower and bathtub were amazing and so relaxing! Besides the space itself, we also had a great experience with the hosts. We actually encountered an issue with our vehicle during our stay, and they were more than willing to pick us up from where we were stranded to bring us back to where we were staying until we figured out what to do. Lastly, the value of this listing is AMAZING. I really appreciated that we weren’t charged several extra fees on top of the listing price - it made our stay very affordable. I wish we could’ve stayed longer, but we will definitely be back! :)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I loved our stay here! Cory and Emma were very welcoming and helpful. I can’t wait to stay here again!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friends and I loved the place! The bathroom is beautiful and providing bath bombs was a nice touch. It did get a little hot with four of us in there but the fan and cracking a window helped. I would definitely stay again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was so happy to find this gem in Urbana. Love the brand new pillows and sheets. Comfortable bed, nice sitting area by the bed side, the little bar stool area, the cups and bowls and other utensils, microwave to warm my leftovers, refrigerator full of water, extra touches like a basket of snacks….Nespresso or tea for my morning coffee….great shower! A linen closet with extra blankets and air mattress, heater and comfort supplies…. Great value, great location ,friendly and great communication with Cory and Emma. I will be back!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental is hands down, par excellence. The room is beautifully appointed, the soaking tub is addictive (not to mention the water pressure and hot water are both appropriate for a tub that size), the bed is comfortable, the house is centrally located, and it smells amazing! Cory and Emma were absolute dolls and they left me wanting for nothing. I cannot sing the praises of this place loud enough. I was thoroughly relaxed and happy my entire stay and I would definitely stay here two or three more times."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Scioto Bungalow! We only wish it was longer. From the stylish, clean space, to the thoughtful touches, it was wonderful. They were prompt with their communication and very helpful!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Scioto Bungalow is a gem. It's exactly as presented, super clean and has thoughtful amenities. Emma communicated well both before arrival and during the stay.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I just wanted a space where we could hang out to visit and craft for a weekend. This space was great for what we were doing. We were able to spread out and chat while working on our projects. It was a comfortable place and felt very homey.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this is a great place just off the beaten path. It's quiet and peaceful while still being close to anything you may want to do.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was as advertised and perfect for our stay! roomy, comfortable, and the view of the stars at night was amazing. Will stay again when in town!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, even more so than the pictures. Remote and very quiet. The owner has dogs and signs posted about security dogs, so I stayed in my car until they came and told me the dogs were friendly. The dogs didn't bother me after the first day, but I would have liked to know they would be greeting me. Additionally, the host was very cagey about the check in code and wouldn't provide it to me until 30 minutes past check in and after multiple messages. I was starting to be become concerned about the ability to enter. After arriving, I realized that wouldn't be a problem because the host's house is on the same property, but I didn't know that going into the situation."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was really unique. We had several conversations about the decor. I was a little disappointed because there's no television in the loft bedroom BUT I now am truly grateful there isn't. We had wonderful conversations and laughs. Very quiet and clean. When we are in the area again we will definitely stay again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! This place is the perfect spot to stay at if you are visiting Urbana. It’s close to everything but tucked nicely in the countryside.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,always loved staying here. you can stay for days and still notice something new each day around inside. hosts have always been awesome.
2022-06-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"The place is lovely, with peaceful surroundings overlooking a corn field. It was enjoyable to watch the fireflies at night, something we do not have at home. The barn was clean with no traffic noise or neighbors to contend with. The bed was comfy and check- in was easy. Very nice having two bathrooms . The decor was amazing….lots of collectibles and artistic touches everywhere. Beautifully decorated! The barn is quite spacious and the kitchen was stocked with all the cooking supplies one might need. The only downside for us was the alarm system. It started chirping ( similar to a smoke alarm) every single night at 1:45 am. Brittany kindly gave us the access code to disarm it, but unfortunately, it came back on several hours later, every single night, and we had to get up and disarm it again. We didn’t get much sleep. I’m not sure if it was a defective system, an incorrect setting or a low battery…but something was very wrong. Brittany said she is having someone look at it. She has very kindly offered us a free night to compensate for the bother. Thank you. When the alarm is fixed, it would be an awesome place to stay! I do hope it’s fixed quickly so others may enjoy this lovely place."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very spacious, homey and fun place to stay! Manages to be close to the Urbana businesses and extremely secluded all at the same time. They had a beautiful sunset for us every night of our stay!!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barn Loft is a unique experience and fun place to stay. It was clean and easy to access. The farm land is wide open to just enjoy the quiet, or head into Urbana about 5 minutes away. Some fun local restaurants are on the fridge waiting for you. I liked Coppertop, or bring your groceries and drinks to use the full kitchen."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable and cozy! Love this spot!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here! Clean, well-priced, roomy, open concept loft barn with everything you need. The decorations are awesome.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great space! It's bright, open and artfully decorated. I loved that I could watch the sunset every night and even woke up early enough to see the sunrise one morning. The farm is secluded, but Kroger is 5 minutes away and the charming downtown with shops and restaurants 10 minutes away. I was traveling solo, but I'll be back with my husband."

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matt and Britt's is an eclectic barn loft with a lot of quiet and privacy. Many nice touches and amenities make it a great place to relax.

2019-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great, kitchy place for a weekend getaway!"
2019-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We did enjoy our stay. The loft is decorated so eclectically, we loved it. The town is wonderful. Our hosts communicated well and were quick to make us happy. They could work on their cleanliness. There was hair on the shower walls and the shower floor was quite grimey looking (unless it is a permanent stain, IDK). The upstairs toilet runs off and on all night and the bathroom doors are terribly squeaky and need to be shut hard, making it impossible to use the bathroom without waking your spouse. The dishes were put away dirty so we had to wash them before and after we used them, the counter tops were full of crumbs and the stove top was quite dirty. There was a spiderweb in the ice dispenser and the fridge froze our fresh veggies and we had to throw them away. The electronics (lamps and TV) are quite difficult to navigate and more instruction would really help."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a splendid weekend during our stay! We will definitely visit again. The place was clean and decorated perfectly. The hosts provided everything we could need and the location is close to Urbana, but far enough out to provide a nice, quiet setting."

2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would happily stay here again... pictures do not do the place Justice
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt and Britt were flexible, easy to contact and communicate with throughout our stay. Great hosts!"
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I felt right at home. It was super cozy and welcoming. I enjoyed the privacy of the loft. It was incredibly spacious. I’d happily stay again and refer anyone who wants a quiet get away.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is fantastic! My boyfriend and I had a blast! When we weren’t out and about we were playing the foosball table, some board games, or watching TV. So there are plenty of things there to keep you entertained. The decorations are great, as well. There’s also a Kroger nearby so any extra things we needed were just a few minutes away! It was definitely worth it and we would consider staying here again."

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a lot of fun to stay in. The decorations kept us smiling. Though plain on the outside, the inside is full of character and very comfortable. Sitting out back on a small patio and enjoying the quietness was a highlight."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first AirBNB experience. The space was much larger than I imagined. Tall ceiling was also a bonus. We had a pleasant stay and plan to come back. It was great to find decent accomodations in Urbana, rather than having to stay in Springfield. Thank you Matt and Britt."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hello. Matt and Britt's place is great. We loved the layout and decor. It is easy to get to, private and quiet and pretty much whatever you would need is there. I especially loved being able to sit outside and enjoy morning coffee. I really liked the feel of it both inside and out."

2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very nice space for 1 or 2 people.
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Barnhouse is truly a pleasure and the decor will keep you in awe and have you wonering ""how did they do that"" and ""wow, I wonder where they got that"" We really enjoyed our stay. Very clean and very private. Wish we had more time to enjoy it. Highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We were extremely comfortable during our stay. Everything was just as expected and Bryce was quick to answer our questions. The location was great for our needs - walkable to where we needed to go. We would definitely stay here again!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a nice time. Everything was as shown and stated. We went to Ohio Caverns and it was in close proximity. So the location was very good. Nice big kitchen where we could cook our own meals. We just happened to be in town for the home coming parade which came down the street right in front of the house. We were able to sit on the porch to watch the parade. Our dog was especially happy because she got some treats. One was especially nice because it was a homemade treat from the FFA. So you definitely have a nice small town feel.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved the space. Thoughtful host with a great setup. Easy to use and a pleasant stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location was perfect! Easy walk to dowtown Urbana. Fun activities in close driving distance. House was clean. Appears to be a quiet, clean, safe neighborhood. LOVE the back yard. Did movie night outside with kids and smores by the fire. Bathroom set up was a novelty for us and brought extra laughter to our stay. All supplies for laundry and coffee provided. Comfortable for 4 adults and 2 children; 3 and 5. Parking was available for 2 vehicles as well. Easy to find. Clean and comfortable. Recommend for family of 4-6 or 4 adults and a few children."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was close to town and we felt right at home!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great stay!!
My Husband and I came to visit our son who was attending the Jordan camp just outside town and need a place close by to stay for a evening.
We loved how comfortable the beds and couch were and how easy it was to make ourselves at home.
Our host was very easy to communicate with and was accommodating."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Perfect for our stay. Host was very responsive with any questions.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay! Close to the town square with restaurants and a brewery. Would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute! Have never experienced a “wet” bathroom so we soaked a few toilet paper rolls…but I think he anticipated that & had plenty of TP available! Loved the fenced in yard & easy entry front door lock! Having a laundry & soap/fabric softener was terrific. Wonderful place!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,had a great time at this cozy house. would definitely stay again
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host! Very responsive and flexible with check in/out times. Highly recommend this stay.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little place, wish we would have had more time for a fire."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"amazing little place, clean, close to town, Brice was a wonderful host"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to relax and get cozy. The beds were comfy, the couch was beyond comfortable, and the kitchen was pristine. Perfect for a couple just getting away or visiting family."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Great communication.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place is cute and met our needs for a one night stay while traveling. Be aware it’s an open shower concept in a small bathroom.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Bryce was very helpful and responsive. The place was exactly what we needed! Thank you!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,The communication was very good. Easy to check-in. Quiet neighborhood. House was very nice and we had everything we needed. Nothing to complain about.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay! Will most definitely stay again
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive host.. Would stay again & recommended ..
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bryce was an absolutely perfect host, and the stay was beyond expectations. He was very accommodating, the space was spotlessly clean and smelled fresh, the beds were comfortable. Would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I, plus our dog, stayed at Bryce's Place over the Christmas weekend while we visited family in Urbana, and it was perfect! Centrally located, cozy, easy check-in, and awesome communication from Bryce made it a great stay. We drove in from a neighboring state so the winter storm caused our plans to shift a bit, but through it all Bryce was a fantastic host and graciously allowed us a late check out."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce was a great host. The interior of the home was spotless and clean. The kitchen and the couch were my favorites. Decor was cute and minimalistic. The bathroom was unique and small. It’s different than anything I’ve ever seen before but appeared efficient. The smart keypad door was too smart for me. User error on my part and Bryce gave me instructions on how to get in/lock and try again. I did have some difficulty with the screen door but that may have been from the wind storm my first night there. The exterior of the home was definitely upgraded to a more modern aesthetic. If I was able to stay longer I would have definitely used the fire pit. All in all, if I get to see my friends in Urbana again I’d choose the hillclimber house again."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Everything was very nice and quaint in the house. The appliances seemed new and the kitchen was very spacious. Downtown Urbana restaurants and atmosphere was very nice. The only complaint or issue we had was the bathroom situation and that there were no blinds in the main room where my son slept so the sun would wake him up. The bathroom issue was due to the size and that there wasn't an area to change and every time we took a shower it would get the toilet wet.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a quaint and quiet home in Urbana. We were in town for a concert in Bellfontaine which was a short 30 minute drive away. The house is located near a bunch of restaurants/shops and was easy to find. The house has everything we needed for a short overnight stay. We would stay here again in the future. Bryce was very responsive and kind!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and good walking location for dining. Enjoyed our stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect for what we were looking for! Very clean, cozy and had everything we could need. 10/10 recommend"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place and close to everything, host was very accommodating"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a great little place to stay for a night. It was a little difficult identifying which house it was in the dark because the numbers blend in to the wood porch beams, but after we found it, getting inside was easy and secure."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Conveniently location to downtown Urbana.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,amazing get away and so convenient. super cute house! great host!
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The small older home utilizes creative solutions to small spaces. The kitchen is modern and the washer and dryer would make longer stays easy. The only challenge with more than two adults is the wet bathroom. It shouldn’t effect your decision to stay in the small cottage, but it does present a challenge. I wish the weather had been cooler so we could have enjoyed the fire pit in the back yard!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Wonderful.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very easy check-in. The place is just as advertised. Great for a weekend getaway or even a longer stay.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,thank you
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Place same as the pictures if not more cute and Very clean!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location walking distance to Urbana's quaint small town main street is great and only about an hour outside of Columbus if you're looking to add a day trip to Columbus to your travels. The house was clean upon our arrival and the electronic door lock with the code makes check-in a smooth and easy process. The space was exactly what we needed, including that it's pet friendly with an affordable pet cleaning fee."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was really a perfect place to stay for the Jeff Jordan wrestling camp. We went back and forth all weekend for our son and it is literally a 10 minute ride to the high school. Everything on the ad is accurate. Bryce, The host, is extremely accommodating and very timely with communication. The street was quiet. A five minute walk takes you to the round a bout in town and there are several restaurants ( Cafe Paradiso was an excellent Italian cafe with extremely good Mushroom Ravioli with Red Pepper Sauce) a candy store, bakery, antique stores. Be aware if you stay in one of the Inns, on the round a bout, it may be a little noisy since all of the mufflers rumble as they come out of the round a bout."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce was an excellent communicator, and even more wonderful host. He gave me fabulous pointers on things to do (eat, hike, etc) in the area, and was happy to address any and ever concern as they arose. Definitely would stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a clean, comfortable, and convenient stay…recommended!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Exactly what I needed for a few days in the Urbana area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As an Urbana University Alum, Urbana holds a special place in my heart. I was in town for the UU Reunion, and The Hillclimber House was the perfect home base! It is walking distance to all of the small town attractions! I highly recommend staying in this adorable Air BnB!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place for the price! Loved the fenced in yard for the dog. Bryce was great at communicating with us and was very helpful overall. The shower/ bathroom is a little strange, but no issue for a short stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location good, house remodeled and in great condition. Fire pit a plus to sit outside and enjoy weather. See you again next year."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was immaculate, with nice furnishings and a well stocked kitchen. It's close to a quaint downtown area, but on a quiet street. I met a few neighbors and they were polite and friendly. It was nice to be able to bring my two dogs with me and they enjoyed being able to run in the backyard at the end of the day. I had a small problem with the lock on the front door and Bryce responded immediately and came over within a few minutes. Great stay and would stay at this home again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This little home is perfect for a short get away. The bathroom is interesting but usable. The next door neighbors were very friendly. Short distance from an amazing vineyard (1000% recommend visiting if you have time) and the Ohio caverns! We would love to come back some day and explore the town a little more!
2022-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Bryce is a great communicator.
I arrived after hearing my friend was in the hospital so I couldn't visit her.
I had my bike to ride but really wanted a puzzle.
he actually went to the store & bought an awesome puzzle!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little home in a quiet neighborhood. Immaculately clean with plenty of towels. Large kitchen with new and modern appliances. Comfortable beds. Fast internet. Fenced backyard was perfect for our dog. We decided to stay two additional nights.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I love the house! Bryce is an amazing host… thank you
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome little place, right downtown! The host is super quick to respond and helpful with suggestions. We stayed in Urbana to explore the Ohio Caverns and realized it was a neat ""central location"" to explore downtown and the surrounding towns too. The fenced in yard was an added bonus if you have dogs. We would definitely stay again!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic! We needed to find a space quick since our other place fell through, but ended up finding a much better place with a great location and value. Not only were they fast and kind in communication, but very flexible and accommodating. The cute bungalow is right in the middle of downtown Urbana. It has updated appliances, and a big back yard for our doggies to run! Will definitely stay again!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautifully restored & had everything we needed for our stay. It was close to where we wanted to be & was so peaceful! No complaints at all!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I stayed at Lee Ann's place the night before the solar eclipse. Lee Ann had sent me lots of information before my arrival. I was already looking forward to my stay because of her friendliness and care. I arrived late after a long drive and it was very comforting to find a clean and cute space waiting for me and my dog. I loved the decor and details and you can tell a lot of thought had gone into it. I had everything that I needed for a short stay but I would love to come back someday and spend more time there. The neighborhood seemed very peaceful and quiet.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife and I couldn't have been happier! The pictures do not do the house justice. This place is absolutely beautiful! The rich history and antique architecture of the house makes for an incredibly cozy, romantic and unique stay. Squeaky clean and outstanding amenities! Lee Ann was an amazing host! Everything was spelled out perfectly and she was very responsive. We will absolutely be returning if were ever in the area again! 5 Stars all the way!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing Airbnb! Beautiful and charming with extra little touches that made our experience special. We appreciated the excellent communication and flexibility of our host.

It had everything I would expect and more, and was very reasonable. What more would I need ? Thanks"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the 1868 ❤️ Very clean, tastefully decorated, and cozy. We enjoyed running from the house and into town. Lots of beautiful architecture in the area and nice shops/cafes. We bought a shamrock plant at the plant boutique, had dinner at Cafe Paradiso, coffee at the spotted cow, and yummy cupcakes at the bakery. Very lovely town."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Lee Ann's place. The pictures don't do it justice. it was comfortable and clean. She is a very thoughtful and responsive host. The apartment had everything you'd expect and also had a lot of small thoughtful items available in case you forgot to bring something.
The apartment has a great 19th century aesthetic but still has all of the modern amenities you could want. We would definitely stay again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lee Ann's place was bigger than I expected. It is most of the second floor of a large house. The space was clean and comfortable. Lee Ann was great. I was concerned about the low price--thought maybe something was wrong. Instead, what a great deal! We'd stay here again. Thank you."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay! Thanks ❣️❣️
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Such a lovely homey feel, and the host had everything you could ever dream of as far as amenities go.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place to stay and it was extremely convenient to downtown Urbana. The bathroom was so luxurious and the vintage details made it extra fun. I highly recommend this place.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our time here! The home is beautiful and full of character and super close to all the fun things to do downtown.
Hosts were incredibly accommodating and informative. We hope to come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean and nicely arranged. Lee Ann communicated quickly.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was raised in town and came back for a visit with family and my 50th class reunion and the apartment was located ideally to everywhere I needed to go. The apartment was so charming and had everything and more that I needed. I wish I had more time to stay I was made to feel welcomed and so comfortable. I hope to be able to stay again soon on another trip back home. If I could give this property and especially the hosts a rating of more than 5 stars, I would. This was the first time ever I have used Airbnb and the hosts made it so worth while and positive that I will again.
Karen Bazzle"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming space for a weekend getaway! Urbana is a delightful town and Lee Ann is a lovely host! Easy to find, nicely located and easy entrance.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Enjoyed walking around the town
Easy to get to our brothers house from there
Environment was beautiful
House was beautiful but we missed having a regular stove. The price was good."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I loved our stay. The apartment you stay is much bigger and nicer than even described. It was so quiet and peaceful. The bed and the linens are superb. Everything is labeled and there are puzzles and a lot of great reading material for you to enjoy. I was fascinated in the beauty and history of this home. It is a lovely walk downtown with many restaurants and shops to enjoy. The neighborhood is beautiful and very safe. Lee Ann even sent a message that they were keeping an eye on the radar about the weather and would keep us informed. How sweet and caring is that?! We were lucky enough to have meet her and had a quick chat. Would have actually loved to set on the porch and talk with her more. I can’t forget to mention the easy self check in. Book your stay here, you will not be disappointed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lee Ann is a wonderful host. Enjoyed my stay and the city of Urbana.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So there was a snowstorm in the middle of my stay and I was supplied with a heavy duty snow scraper and brush. So very thoughtful and helpful! I have multiple trips planned in the future and this is likely where I’ll be staying each time.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was a delightful escape! Close to town where we found great antique shops to explore and a wonderful Italian restaurant. Lee Ann was a wonderful host, allowed us a flexible check in and answered any questions within minutes. We found it to be a very restful and peaceful apartment. Loved the furnishings and the helpful labeling and instructions. It was a beautiful 40 minute ride over from Jackson Center where we had our Airstream in for service. Would highly recommend this Airbnb to our fellow Airstreamers!!! 🦩🦩🐾"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful and cozy. Wish we could have stayed longer!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the house and Lee Ann was a great host, wish we could have stayed longer!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Urbana. We did a weekday stay and it was perfect. Nice living room space for us to relax and play lots of board games. Exactly what we were looking for. Note that the rented space is on the second floor so consider what luggage you want to carry up a older staircase. Easy and quick entry to the building with shaded street parking. Definitely would consider staying again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very well maintained property, located in a nice & quiet neighbourhood. Lee Ann and her co-hosts respond quickly to their messages.
I highly recommend this place!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place to stay!!! definitely a must if you're staying in the Urbana area! great location, so close to everything"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, nice host"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place and a good value. If you have mobility issues, the winding staircase would be difficult. Other than that, it is a very nice place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very comfortable and clean apartment. Hosts are very friendly and quick to communicate.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cute and unique place to stay.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The absolute best Airbnb I've ever stayed in, overall...attention to detail, providing way more than just the basics, location walkable to town, excellent communication, dog-friendly, quiet, clean, gorgeous historic home. These people truly care and have put a lot of time and energy into their places. I've never felt so safe traveling alone and I ended up booking another stay with them before I had even left the first one! Thank you, Lee!"
2022-02-01,4,Stayed over a week,Great place always felt safe. I work nights so I slept during the day but never had any issues. Would totally stay again.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was my first Airbnb trip, and it far exceeded my expectations! I stayed for 11 days just to get away. It's on the second floor above the hosts' residence but felt like I was in a home of my own. It was snowy and very cold outside (Jan-Feb), but inside was perfectly cozy! Each room has radiant heating along with a tower heater (the ones in the bedroom and living room room are oscillating with remotes), and there's also an electric fireplace in the living room. My little ESA LOVED curling up in front of them. There was a very brief power outage, but it was an easy fix; Lee Ann texted me back immediately to have me reset the breaker, and everything went back to normal. These things happen, especially in older homes; I only mention it to show how quickly she responded and resolved the problem!
I was also there during a major winter storm, Lee Ann offered to pick up provisions for me at Kroger before it hit so I wouldn't have to go out myself! When it was time to leave, Eric even scraped the ice off of my car.
It's conveniently close to a somewhat busy area, although I thought it would be farther out from the general sounds of traffic at night. This has nothing to do with the hosts or accommodations themselves and it's not excessive so most people won't notice, but I can be sensitive to noise, especially when trying to sleep. There was a loud sports car nearby that woke me up each day, but I was able to easily fall back asleep when it left. I've never slept on a memory foam mattress before, and the first night I thought it was way too firm.. but a few minutes later it was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Every night after that I looked forward to it and it immediately felt perfect. I was sad going back to my own bed!
I really could rave on and on about all of the positives. Lee Ann and Eric truly went above and beyond. Wonderful hosts and beautiful home, I recommend staying here 100%!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Darling ,cheerful and whimsical apartment to rest and recuperate! Loved it . Everything you need is provided. Must be able to do full flight of stairs."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's in a quiet neighborhood and the parking on the street was good.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very comfortable full apartment with a lot of character. However, it is very old and has a narrow curved staircase leading to the apartment. If you have any mobility issues, this may not be the place for you."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lee Ann's private upstairs apartment is located on a quiet residential street with easy on-street parking. Each of the four rooms is very spacious, with room to move around in the kitchen, bath, and living room. Lee Ann carefully thought through providing everything we would need for an extended stay - plenty of cooking and eating utensils in the kitchen, lots of office and bath supplies, and a more comfortable bed than I have at home. We felt very welcome here."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home! Very comfortable and exceptionally clean. I stayed here with my daughters and Lee Ann thought of everything! She had sweet books and some toys out in the living room for the girls to play with. There were snacks in the kitchen and the fridge was filled with water bottles. The rooms are quite large and I wish I had thought to take pictures of our setup. I put the packnplay in the kitchen for my youngest and had my 3yo set up in the living room. I know we will be back and I know my girls will love seeing Lee Ann and Eric and playing with Crix in the yard! Lee Ann and Eric are just the sweetest! If you happen to run in to Lee Ann while she’s working in the garden, you will leave feeling like you made a new best friend."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow ! My first Airbnb experience and I have 4 words : “I will be back” - I promise I’m a picky traveler & this place was a dream. Felt right at home. Not only was this a very Beautiful historic location right near downtown - It was very private with its own entrance & what not. The host is a gem & dowtown Urbana is too ! Also recommend the little Italian spot in town.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very thoughtful host who thought of everything to make a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing stay! Lee Ann is a super host extraordinaire! She is so warm and welcoming. Her communications before I arrived made me feel like I was going to visit a friend. When I met and got to know her, I knew we would be great friends.
Her place is even better than the photos. The amount of space and privacy exceeded my expectations by far. It is super clean, fresh and beautifully appointed. Lee Ann has thought of everything a guest could possibly need. The bed is super comfy with soft sheets and linens. I slept soundly. The kitchen and dining room area is very large. High speed Internet works great. I had to work while I was there, and no issues with my Teams video meetings. Love the bathroom. It is very large and again super clean. Lee Ann even provides extra toiletries in the event travelers have forgotten anything. The lavender bath salts are so relaxing.
The location is centrally located, and the neighborhood has so much charm. I wish I could have stayed longer. I recommend stopping at Depot Coffee while there. Super friendly and great coffee.
I loved staying with Lee Ann, loved her beautiful home and and space. I can’t wait to come back again."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this stay!

We would definitely stay here again, no problems at all! Plus very short walk to the downtown shops."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for a little anniversary get away! A beautiful old home with modern conveniences and charm. You take the beautiful old staircase up to a private, 4 room apartment. It was clean and well supplied with all the things you’d have available in your own home. It was quiet and the bed comfortable. You can tell Lee Ann loves to host. You get the royal treatment here. She was quick with communication and recommendations. We would love to stay here again."

Lee Ann is amazing and enjoys hosting, she has a lively spirit and enjoys meeting new people. She truly cared about our stay. She is detail oriented and it shows in the care she takes in providing for her guest. She is a genuine host who has a good heart.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay! Had the charm of a historic home with all the amenities you might need.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a peaceful retreat with all the extras, including a friendly host! My husband and I came to Urbana to visit the unique shops and neighboring town of Tipp City. Lee Ann & Eric’s home was PERFECT! Lovely decorated spaces were comfortable, clean and had everything we needed including 2 pencils for keeping score playing the new game we bought on our shopping spree. Both Friday & Saturday nights were SO QUIET in the neighborhood that we thought we were on a private street! Fusion & Teabagger’s restaurants are a MUST and less than a mile away."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This is truly an amazing stay. We have stayed in so so many AirBnbs - across the world, and we have never felt as welcome as we did here. The 1868 home is so beautiful, and truly is like stepping back in time - but with all needed modern amenities. So many perfect touches; amazing snacks and beverages, fantastic teas and coffee. Everything you could possibly need was available.
The front porch is a welcoming haven. A perfect place for morning coffee or evening wine. And Crix (the lab) is the best welcoming committee. He’s there if you need a pup visit :)
The home is walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants and the quaint downtown area. Honestly, just strolling down Court street and neighborhood was such a treat!
We will definitely return! I can’t imagine NOT staying there when we are next in town. Don’t miss this opportunity! Stay at “1868 Itanianate Casa” for a beautiful, relaxing vacation - even if just overnight!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Best Airbnb we've stayed in! We loved this place, the pictures didn't do it justice. We loved how they left the old style, and touches in place while tying it in with modern touches and functionality! It is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and the space is very well laid out and furnished. We enjoyed our stay and wished it was more than one night! The only thing we thought could be better is the bed, to us it was a bit firm, but that is a subjective thing depending on personal preferences!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the best places we have stayed through AirBnB! Lee Ann thought of everything. The historic home is so nicely updated. Lee Ann's hospitality was 5-star. She helped gave us information on area attractions when we mentioned what we came there to do (ride on the bike trails). I recommend this place and will return when we can.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I needed a quick place to stay with a dog on the way from Chicago to NC with a very late arrival! Lee Ann answered all my questions quickly, offered to personally pick up anything I needed since I would be arriving late, met me at the door at 4 am when I got there, told me to stay as late into the afternoon as I needed to rest up, completely stocked up on snacks for when I got there, left a care package for me at the door in the morning with breakfast and water for my trip, and supplied everything you could need staying the night somewhere! Not just your little soaps and conditioners, there were cotton balls, swabs, razors, tooth brush and paste, handmade soap, sponges you can take with you! I’m a young solo traveler and it gets a little rough sometimes being the only one taking care of yourself. Felt like I was staying with my mom, except Lee Ann was nicer! (Lol)
The only thing that could have made it better is if she asked me to move in. Absolutely beautiful space in a beautiful historical home, hosted by a beautiful family. Thank you so much Lee Ann!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lee Ann's place is great. An older home with lots of character and great amenities. Lee Ann has thought of everything you may need. A perfect location for walking to restaurants and downtown. Or hop on your bike and hit the path to Springfield or the other direction to Bellefontaine. Lee Ann's is the perfect place
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you stay at Erick and Lee Ann's place you won't be disappointed.
They have done a wonderful job breathing life back into this lovely older home.

2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment in a killer location!! Everything you could want and more, this apartment is cozy and comfortable and is fully stocked with every essential you need. Mrs.Lee Ann goes above and beyond in providing for her guests and she is such a sweetheart. The location is very central and an easy walk to downtown, the neighborhood is safe and just gorgeous. There is a rich history in this home and in this town and I had such fun learning about them. We will be back and I would recommend this apartment to everyone. You will not be disappointed!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful home away from home - every last touch of comfort!

We enjoyed our stay very much, and will be back to stay again."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I will tell you that Lee Ann is the best. I have never been treated this nice by anyone and the apartment was fantastic. She thought of everything and if I needed anything she would get it. Quiet, clean comfortable. I will stay there Everytime I go visit my mother. Just make sure you don't stay when I'm going to be there, lol. Just playing but seriously you could not ask for a better place or a better host."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a fantastic and accommodating space. The atmosphere was comfortable and well decorated.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I visit Urbana every year and until Airbnb’s became a thing and came to Urbana I always struggled to find a place that was comfortable, safe and affordable. Lee Ann’s place meets and exceeds all that and more. The location is great, right near town and easy access to main roads, good parking and quiet location. The home itself is beautiful very well appointed you can tell a lot of thought and care went into restoring this 1868 home. The amenities were wonderful having coffee and breakfast available without having to go out the first morning was so nice. I slept well and had plenty of time to relax and just enjoy the small town feel of Urbana. You will not be disappointed in this home or the hosts. I hope to be back to Urbana this spring and as soon as plans are set will be booking this home again."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Definitely coming back.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, well appointed home with amenities too numerous to list. A quick walk down the street to a quaint Square with lovely shops, boutiques and great places to eat.
Lee Ann is a fabulous host! Very hospitable, informative and accommodating. She even provided for my dog's needs!
You will not be disappointed staying here. I highly recommend it. I will be staying here again."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Extra special touches that make it perfect
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lee Ann’s place had personal touches that made our short stay so wonderful. The location is dog friendly and she provided dog bowls for our pupper (and treats)! Communication was quick and consistent. Place was spotless and she provided a heater since it was chilly. We also had a long drive to get to the location, and we appreciated the water and snacks!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay here! Well equipped apartment and very comfortable. Made a great spot while I was on a long weekend trip for work.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful experience! Everything was super clean and better than the pictures. The front porch was really enjoyable especially the swing. Everything was in perfect working condition with every extra touch you can imagine in every room. It was cozy and homey everywhere. The linens were especially fluffy along with good snacks, special coffee water...which is important to me and bagels and basics provided. I hope I can come again. We there 6 nights."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place to stay. Had everything we needed and more. Lee Ann has thought of everything, if you for get something just look around and you will find that she has one for you. Check in is easy. Lee Ann was very friendly and great communication before arriving. It is close to the downtown are which looks like a fun place to walk around if you have the time. We will stay again when in the area."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This weekend was just what I needed. Lee Ann has thought through her space thoroughly. She had a fully stocked kitchen including farm fresh eggs and English muffins, snacks, water coffee and tea, extra toiletries in case I forgot anything (including feminine products) plenty of fresh towels, clean sheets and fuzzy blankets for handing out on the couch. She even set up a writing desk and provided me with note pads, pens and pencils after I told her that I was there to write. I enjoyed the history of the house on display and the current decor. It was stylish but not too ""busy"". Everything was fresh and clean. I loved being able to take a short walk to coffee shops, restaurants and boutiques down town."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lee Ann was an amazing host and was quick to try and work out any issues, her place is still a work in progress but I wouldn’t let that deter you from staying here"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hosts were proactive in sharing instructions and very responsive. The home had so many lovely gathering spaces. The bedrooms were large with good storage. We had 3 generations staying. We appreciated that the adults could continue conversations while the babies could sleep. And we all loved exploring the house and all its treasures.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The historic house was very unique and had so much character. Tons of space for our family event. Loves the venue. Very close to downtown Urbana’s shops.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great stay! The area is very walkable, the home is beautiful. we tried out a little store called In Good Taste Market, created really great meals from there. Everyone in town was very friendly."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time at Sara's place. The historic home was truly amazing. Beautifully decorated with lots of spaces to explore and enjoy. There are also great places to eat locally, and we enjoyed that.
Here are some tips I would give to prospective renters. Remember it's a very old, historic house so plumbing and electric reflect that. Electrical outlets in the bedrooms are few so bring an extension cord. Multiple people showering at the same time leads to low water pressure so time your showers. The home has lots of step ups and downs between rooms and lovely antique furniture and decorations so it might not be best for really young children (toddlers). Also, there are quite a few places where electrical outlets don't have a cover plate. That would be an easy fix for the owners but until that is taken care of it's a safety hazard for kids. But, having added those caveats, we thought it was an amazing place to gather a large group and we loved it there!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"In reviewing the pics for this home, I loved what I was seeing. So I booked this site for my daughter's bridal shower. When I arrived it was the same as the pictures seen.
Ryan was very responsive to me when I had questions.
My guests loved the place and I enjoyed looking at the wildlife in the morning."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town for a family wedding and needed a big house for our family.
This beautiful estate fit us perfectly! Very clean, loved the history, very well kept up and restored. We felt right at home and enjoyed our stay tremendously. Highly recommend and if ever in town again, I would rent it again."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Pictures do not do it justice! This place is absolutely amazing! You will be stepping back into history. Such an enjoyable stay here with family.
Great for large family or friends to all stay at the same place instead of a bunch of separate units."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Most of our travel is either for work or for a vacation. Either way we travel with a large crew. It’s nice to find a house with sufficient accommodation. This house is cool due to its age and historical value. Don’t expect to have conveniences above the basics of shelter, water and sleep- it’s old but beautiful. Well kept, in terms of cleanliness. Great working boiler- had exceptional heat all light long with temps 16°F. Very large and spacious accommodation. Would recommend highly to larger groups especially. We were able to utilize all three showers simultaneously without drops in water pressure or temps-Two thumbs up."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"My family stayed here during our son's wedding down in Vandalia. The historic charm of this wonderful home drew me in as soon as I saw the photographs on the listing. It felt like you were being transported back in time. Our family of ten enjoyed all the room, gathering in common spaces, watching old family videos, and celebrating around the dining room table with family and friends. Fond memories made - and we hope to come again when visiting the area in the future. Wish we had more time to spend at the home!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed making family memories for thanksgiving and then Christmas too. 🎄. A beautiful setting 😊
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The home is very unique and filled with history. It was perfect for our family.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was exactly what we were looking for, and was a great stay. It was a bit tricky to find, but that is because I didn't read the arrival instructions all the way and missed the instructions on finding it. GPS will bring you one street over.
House it great, full of charater and history, and the ammenities were great too."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for sharing your beautiful historic home with us. We wish we had more time to enjoy Sara’s grand home and the quaint neighborhood and town of Urbana.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoying staying at this historic 203 year old house!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay. Definitely the most interesting home we have ever stayed in. We would stay again 100%
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It is a very beautiful house, and great attention was made to take us back into quieter, simpler times. The house is very large, and we had great fun exploring all the rooms and appreciating the furniture and decor. It was a blessing for our family coming from three states to stay there. We saw so much wildlife- deer, woodchucks, Cooper hawks. It is a wildlife sanctuary in the middle of Urbana. It was hot and humid during our stay, so trying to air condition the whole house from 5 window units in the upstairs bedrooms was a real challenge. Overall, it was a great value and we would definitely return."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had to come back home to Urbana for a family funeral and were able to house most all of our immediate family right here. This beautiful home is spacious, wonderfully decorated. It's so homey with all the different sitting rooms to choose from for intimate conversation or the large sun porch where we had family and friends stop by and visit. This is definitely where will stay when we have opportunities to come back home in the future. Thank you Ryan for being so very accommodating!!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great historical house. Perfect for our group with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an amazing property and even more amazing hosts! If you are a fan of historical houses, this is a must stay! Will definitely stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Very nice home and very quite. Very nice place to stay
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"If you love historic homes, this one had a lot of charm and character."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Ward Estate was the perfect venue for our vintage tea party Baby Shower. The guests were just in love with the house and the expansive and peaceful yard. Thank you so much!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I can’t say enough about this place! Such a cool experience staying in this historic home. So much history. So much space. Beautiful and peaceful setting. Kids loved it and the adults did as well! Can’t wait to come back and stay longer!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay. This is a place where the house invites you in. Beautiful yard and the small town of Urbana is something from the past. Would stay again. It fit our family well. If you have children they will find many fun old fashioned toys and enjoy the large outdoor space.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,From the moment we drove on the property we loved it. Everything about this home was perfect. In the mornings the deer cross the lawn! That was a treat while having coffee. The back patio was perfect for grilling and for the kids to play close by in the backyard. We hosted friends from Michigan and New York and found the many rooms and restrooms to be comfortable and clean. The best part was walking around to see all the beautiful paintings displayed and feeling right at home. Our family will definitely return even though we live 25 mins away. It was a dream! Thank you to Sara and Ryan. We loved it.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Let me start out saying I’m a history nut to my core and to have the opportunity to stay here was fantastic for me. Do not miss your opportunity with this home. Definitely a favorite now on my list of places to stay.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The house is lovely with lots to look at and discover. From our three toddlers to great grandma and great grandpa, all four generations enjoyed it. The host was so cooperative with our need for a late checkout. We took care of the kitchen trash, but they didn't ask us to do anything to clean up after ourselves--they took care of all the linens and bedding. It's a historic old home, built in the early 1800s, with lots of nooks and crannies, so if you have bad allergies to dust, you may have some difficulty. But otherwise everything was clean and functional. Had hot water for showers and all the fluffy white linens we needed. There's nowhere else we could have stayed with 10 adults so affordably and comfortably. We would definitely stay again if we were back in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Being in The Big House brought back wonderful memories! My husband Rick and his brother Ted grew up in that house so each room held memories of family and friends, both locally and visiting. Holidays around the dining room table, summers on the porch, playing in the yard and in the barn. It is still a wonderful place to be!
Thank you for this opportunity, and thank you for preserving this beautiful old house."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"I have been visiting Urbana for my 51 years and no idea this home was here.
The home is so comfortable and convenient. The rooms are generous and warm. Lots of areas to relax or mingle with family.
We are so appreciative of Sara and Ryan for allowing us to stay here. We will definitely stay here again in the future as we created a lot of good memories and were able to unwind."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was so much fun. It is exactly as described. It has the historic vibe (built in 1820) and is well maintained. My family and I loved every minute we were there. The kids had fun learning some history and being afraid of the dolls. We had our Easter celebration. It was perfect. Extra large dining table could hold all eleven of us. I will go back again when the opportunity comes up. Maybe Thanksgiving! Also wanted to say how clean and nicely decorated the house is.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family stayed on our way back from Florida. This home was perfect!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying at Sara’s place. Not only was it absolutely beautiful, it was comfortable for being so big and spacious. We even had a a large family gathering one of the days we stayed there and it easily accommodated 30+ adults and children. The garden is beautiful and at night we had plenty of animal visitors as it seemed to be an attractive resting place for a large heard of deer. We loved using the fireplace and staying inside on the colder nights. There is no doubt you will love your stay at the ward home."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"We needed a large home for our girls trip to Yellow Springs and this historic home not only fit all eight of us comfortably, but is full of antique charm. We all loved it!"
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice quiet location. I grew up in Urbana, and surprisingly never knew this was a historic house. Relatively close to the bike trail that travels the town from end to end. Our plans for visiting family unfortunately had to change, so we spent more time at the house than expected and I must admit, the wicker furniture in the main TV room is not the most comfortable. Also, the pots/pans selection in the kitchen is very limited. Had we needed to cook for ourselves more than the couple of meals we prepared, it would have been very difficult to do so.
Overall though, we enjoyed our stay."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Josh and Stacy were the best part of this house. They were responsive and did everything within their power to make our stay happy and comfortable. They provided lots of extras, the water was super helpful! We really did not spend much time at the house as we had other engagements."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful home base for us during a tournament in Cedarville. The home was beautiful, well stocked, comfortable, and clean. Joshua was quick to communicate and so friendly. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay for my family of 5! The home was very clean and had many “extras” including toothbrushes which came in handy for my teenage boys who didn’t pack one! There were snacks and water bottles available, which was an added touch! Joshua and Stacy were very responsive and friendly. We would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice... Perfect location for our girls weekend. Comfortable, clean and well stocked. We appreciated all the extras. Easy check-in and convenient parking. Thanks Josh!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Josh’s place was a wonderfully cozy and comfortable place for my family! The house has tons of charm and was a true home away from home. I appreciated all the thoughtful touches— from the warm and welcoming communication to all the amenities needed to cook, relax, and play games. It was a perfect stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,I have no complaints. Very responsive hosts. Everything met expectations.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Joshua’s home was clean, beds were comfortable, home was easy to find and area was extremely quiet. Thank you for the bottles for water."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joshua was extremely accommodating. This home was so welcoming and cozy for our week. I wish I could rate this one 10 stars. Our kids even loved the home and they can be hard to please 😁 Thank you for such a welcomed stay!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at the Mechansburg Manor! A quiet neighborhood within walking distance to several restaurants and playgrounds made it a prime location for our family with young kids. The house itself was absolutely adorable, clean, and extremely well furnished. It has a very cozy atmosphere, and we could tell Joshua and Stacey had spent considerable time and effort to make it feel like a home away from home! The kitchen was well stocked with appliances, cookware, and utensils. They supplied us with everything we could have needed, plus some. We also appreciated how they stayed in touch during our stay - making sure we were comfortable, safe after a storm went through the area, and offered us a late checkout. 10/10 experience at the Mechansburg Manor."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful home from the 1800’s still has character but also updated. You will not be disappointed and Joshua was a great host
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Everything was perfect. The house is very nice and the owners particularly welcoming. We had a wonderful stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's been quite a while since I last felt so thought of and we'll hosted. The house was extremely well-appointed and had so many extra touches, from a personalized welcome, to extra snacks, to all the extras in the bathroom. The beds were extra cozy and the backyard fire ring along with the stocked bird feeders made everything special. It was a central location that allowed us to explore from Urbana to Yellow Springs. We will certainly be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our second time staying with Josh and Stacy. Unfortunately, we could not spend as much time as we would’ve liked on the property, as we only got to stay one night, but it was just as amazing as last time! Every time I come to Ohio, we always check if this place is available!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying at Josh and Stacy’s!
They are incredible hosts and their place feels like home. The house and town is quite and friendly, with a super park for kids or walking just a block away. Great hosts and nothing has been overlooked! Another great stay in Mechanicsburg!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Josh & Stacy were so kind from the time of booking my dates until I checked out. You couldn’t ask for better host with me coming into town from down south. Especially since I also had family coming from up north, thinking we were going to have to stay at a hotel. I was happy/relieved when I found this charming home that was only a couple minutes from my family’s house.
When I walked in, I fell in love. It was very clean, it had everything you would need. We all decide we plan on renting here every time we get together if it’s available.
Thank you again Josh & Stacy for this beautiful Airbnb!
Brenda"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Josh and Stacey were wonderful hosts we needed a place to stay to gather with family. Their Airbnb was as advertised and so cozy with lots of charm. They responded quickly to any questions and were there to help with anything we needed! I would recommend this place to anyone!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay! Just as described. Loved the uniqueness of the property. All the extras were much appreciated. We have never stayed in a home that had so many pantry staples, snacks, and toiletries available. Property was immaculate! Excellent communication from hosts - even alerted us to a potential minor inconvenience (internet issue due to weather) before we even realized there was an issue. Easy check-in and check-out. We'll definitely return. Thanks for a wonderful stay and much needed respite for our ""Sister Weekend""."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. Everything you could need in a home away from home was provided. Josh and Stacy communicated well. The house is very roomy, beautifully remodeled and the beds were super-comfortable!! We will definitely come back!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good about the hosts. They went above and beyond making this home PERFECT for my parents (74 and 82) to stay in through Christmas. They decorated it with a Christmas tree and decorations just for there stay and even left a couple of gifts for the family to take with them. As for things you’ll need, well you won’t need for anything. The home was built in 1880 and has rich history. With that comes some uneven (but very safe) terrain. My parents loved it and we did as well; even deciding to do Christmas Eve dinner there instead of my house. It was cozy and inviting. I’m sure we will book again in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We absolutely loved staying here! We were only passing through for one night, but as soon as we stepped through the front door we were immediately disappointed that we weren't staying for longer. It is so well decorated, and so cozy, and they had it stocked up with snacks and board games, which was so appreciated. They answered all of my questions before I even asked, and were very responsive. Also worth noting, the beds were extremely comfortable!! We just loved staying here and would highly recommend for anybody."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful place, great place to relax at the end of a long day. Would recommend to anyone!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a awesome stay will stay again. House is beautiful.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was less than 12 hours, but we were grateful for the comfortable, quiet, and safe surroundings to spend the night! Joshua communicated details very clearly for checking in after dark. The house was exceptionally clean and well stocked with anything we might have needed or forgotten. Although we didn’t get to use it, the backyard fire pit was a nice amenity. We also enjoyed the Simple Coffee shop around the corner. Would highly recommend this cozy renovated historic home!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My group of 4 had a wonderful stay at Mechanicsburg Manor. We had excellent communication and local recommendations from Josh and Stacy. The home was clean, charming, and well furnished and decorated, and the beds were comfortable. The backyard was great - 4 large Adirondack chairs around the fire pit, and a nice table for 6 on the deck. Easy walk around town - Simple Coffee Co. was great, as was Mixx 165, with fresh ingredients and a modern menu. We would definitely recommend and stay here again!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for such a wonderful stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We booked this place because it was much closer to the wedding venue we were attending than hotels. It is an older home so floors are a little unlevel , which I get my house is from 1929. But the home is very clean and homey . Josh and Stacey live right next door. They were quick to respond with any questions I had, and so nice and friendly . Would def recommend to anyone going to the area ."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Well worth the money. Josh is super nice. Had bottle water in fridge and snacks. He right next door if need anything. Plan on booking g again for our annual guys trip. Thanks again Josh
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you, Josh and Stacey..
The place was great. Perfect location for our sons wedding at Wrem Farm In Mechanicsburg.
This property is charming. We appreciate the snack basket. That was a nice touch.
Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Myself, my bride, and my small wedding party felt at home in this space. it was cute and had everything we needed for our short stay and time before and after the wedding. it was super close to our venue and we loved it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joshua’s place was the most well stocked house I have every stayed in. It had everything! Great value. Cute little town with great coffee shop. Joshua was extremely proactive with suggestions. It was really peaceful. Super comfy beds. Will definitely stay again if we travel through. There is a reason they are a super host. Thanks!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cannot say enough about this place. Everything new and everything worked. Fancy silverware and lines. Remodeling and decorating top notch. Bonus: fully fenced in backyard. Awesome!!!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"the house itself was beautiful, historical, incredibly well kept and phenomenally decorated. you can see the time and effort put into the upkeep and design of this house. the hosts were very responsive and sent me a detailed message with all the information i needed as well as some bonus information. if you get the opportunity to stay in this airbnb, TAKE IT!!! for the price, it was a wonderful stay. unfortunately i was only able to stay one night, but when i come back to springfield/mechanicsburg, this will 100% be my first choice."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place felt like being home. Host was great as well!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joshua's place is excellent. My wife loved the character and there was literally anything you could have possibly forgotten to pack. Joshua definitely goes above and beyond.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and comfortable. Check in was super easy with clear instructions. We love the character of the older homes with the rolling floors but there was no creaking or noise when walking across the 2nd floor so very sturdy! Joshua was very attentive and was sure to leave another contact info when he was going to be out of range for a day just in case we needed anything. With the water filter system being down for repair they provided complimentary bottled water. The first night we drove less than 20 minutes to eat dinner at Der Dutchman in Plain City. The second night we stayed close by and ate at the local Mixn's N Fixn's country dinner with morning coffee from Simple Coffee Company. Both are a short 2 minute drive or a nice 8 minute walk and were absolutely wonderful. After checkout on Saturday we drove 15 minutes to Urbana to visit all the shops before we headed home. We will definitely stay again when coming to the area. We are already planning another trip.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,We had stayed here for our wedding weekend and it was everything I thought it would be. The house is absolutely beautiful. I had grew up about 15 minutes from there and it just brought back so many memories being back!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joshua did a great job communicating instructions. Check in was seamless, felt like coming home to your house. Highly recommend! Excellent host!"

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful home in a great neighborhood! Plenty of amenities, very clean, and the Joshua and Stacy were very hospitable and kind! Nala the outdoor cat was our favorite too 🥰 We didn't get to explore the area much due to the nature of our visit, but they had plenty of recommendations for local places to check out! Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy home! Very clean space! The beds were very comfortable!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend this place to anyone, it’s super clean, and cute! It’s super close to downtown, to super cute shops! This Airbnb has everything you’ll need for your stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,It was a very nice place with some character and charm. We were able to rest and relax while preparing for our daughter’s wedding.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,A great place to stay while attending a family event in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it. It's an older home with rolling floors, but we loved it. Enjoyed the town too. Beautiful area. Owners always responded quiickly and were very kind. They provided water bottles for us & kitchen was fully stocked. Loved it!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place! It is an old home with loads of character. Very nicely decorated and clean! They had everything we could possibly need! The kitchen was well stocked. The bathroom had any and every toiletry one could ask for! Josh was immediate with responses and kept us informed of all the details of our reservation. We really enjoyed our stay and recommended this place to other people at the wedding we were attending!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great older home with character.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautifully refreshed older home with quality furniture. The mattresses were very comfortable, the towels were plush, and we appreciated the bottled water and snacks. We’d gladly recommend this home away from home to others!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,The house layout and backyard fit well for our family of five. The hosts communicated well and were very helpful when there was something we needed or wondered about!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Joshua was super friendly and proactive with our stay and was very thoughtful by stocking the house with drinks and extra toiletries. The house was the perfect spot for our weekend in town for a wedding—very clean, comfortable to hang out in and a great back yard and patio. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,The hosts were super responsive and helpful. They even provided us with bottled water because the osmosis water system was not working. Liked the house even though it was on a little slant so that was odd getting use to. They provided plenty of toiletries which was great because we had 2 families in the house.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. Everything was as pictured. Josh was excellent at communicating with us. Highly recommend.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home has alot of character. The hosts have thought of everything. The home is stocked with so many extras.
The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful and the backyard is cozy and beautiful.
A great place to stay when you are in the area.
Thanks for being so welcoming!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The BEST host and adorable
And spotless home!!!! Love this place!!!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing hosts and an amazing place to stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joshua has set the bar. Fully stocked house (anything you might think you need!) with lovely backyard!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Very comfortable, clean accomodations located in a quiet neighborhood. Within easy traveling distance to fun activities in Urbana, Yellow Springs, Clifton, and Springfield. Columbus very doable too. Josh quickly responded to all our questions and needs. Highly recommended."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"The best ABB yet. We stayed for Cedarville graduation and it was totally worth the drive. So very comfortable and amazingly clean! Beds were very comfortable. Plenty of towels and everything you could ever need if you forgot something from home. Fully stocked kitchen and even a washer and dryer. Clear check in and check out instructions, easy and quick communication. House was exactly as described including rolling floors and one short head clearance but these things only added charm to this old house. Tastefully decorated and did I mention clean?! Fire pit was stocked with wood and comfy chairs. Nice back deck with full size outdoor table and chairs. The model stay!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Home was very clean and comfortable. Felt safe and at home the whole trip. The attention to detail was amazing. Very well maintained and kept, older historic home! Check in was smooth and easy and everything was ready to go when we arrived. Could not have asked for better hosts!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"This was the perfect place to stay for the night during our short trip to Columbus. The house was very clean and well stocked, including snacks and toiletries! The house is located in a peaceful town about a 35 minute drive from OSU. Josh and Stacy are great hosts, responsive and friendly, and they sent very detailed instructions prior to our arrival. Highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Definitely the best host I have ever had! They pay extremely close to detail and made a wonderful environment for my stay at the airbnb! They are the very definition of a 5 star host!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Airbnb was clean. Loved how it was decorated. They provided snacks, water, apple juice and V8 juice. Communicated to see if we needed anything. Fenced in yard was nice to have for our dog. Thank you Stacy and Josh!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed Joshua’s place . We were passing through the area on our way to take our kids to Legoland in Columbus. The hosts were very responsive when we asked questions and all of the check in details were very organized. The house was very clean and organized. This is probably the best Airbnb we have stayed at as far as little extras and a very well stocked kitchen . Our kids appreciated the little snacks and juice upon arrival, as well as games and crayons. We had plenty of space for our family of 5 children ages 2,4 & 6 all slept comfortably. There is plenty of room in any bedroom for a Pack N play if needed . We had everything in the kitchen we needed to prepare coffee and dinner for our family . We stopped in Urbana on the way for a few groceries which I definitely would recommend because there aren’t many stores in the area . We did see a couple local diners up the road but didn’t stop in . Overall , we had a very comfortable stay and would definitely recommend it."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved our stay! The house was nicely updated and super clean. Hosts were super responsive and had the house stocked with extra amenities! We were sad it was only for one night.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean!!! Comfortable beds, plenty of comfortable seating in the living room.
The host left juice, water, coffee supplies and a large array of snacks and easy food to fix."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joshua and Stacy's place was just as described - very comfortable and clean with beautiful high quality furniture and linens. The king bed slept wonderful, as well as the other beds.
Communicating with Joshua was as previously described in another review ""just like communicating with an old friend""... He was so pleasant and helpful.
We enjoyed dinner at the recommended local ""Mixin's N Fixin's Diner"" - great food and accommodations there.
""The Delightful Mechanicsburg Manor"" was most certainly 5 ⭐ ... Book it!! - you will not be disappointed!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Joshua’s home was outstanding. From the arrival to the retrieval we felt safe and at home. The bathroom was stocked with anything you could need. The kitchen was filled with everything you could need, just like your at home kitchen would be. Even stocked the fridge with drinks and left complementary snacks. The back yard was very spacious, great for pet owners and children to play! There is much more about this home that’s worth the stay! Joshua & his wife definitely out do themselves with this lovely home! We will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Mechanicsburg Manor! Josh had water and snacks for us, and the instructions on the Airbnb site were spot on. Everything you could possibly need as far as toiletries is there if you need it- down to toothbrushes, shaving cream, and nail polish remover.
The house is historic, and with that comes some quirks. The floors aren’t level and it’s a very odd feeling at first. We got used to it after a day or so. The stairs are not an even height, so you must take your time going up and down. And watch your head! All of these things were disclosed, and are not a deterrent. It’s part of the charm of the house.
There were plenty of pillows and throw blankets to cuddle up with while watching tv or reading. The town itself has a couple restaurants that we tried and liked- Mixx 165 and Mixin’ & Fixin’ diner.
We had a wonderful long weekend and can’t wait to come back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joshua‘s place is even better than anything you could expect. The minute I walked in I felt like I was at home, and Joshua made me feel like I was communicating with a best friend. Helpful beyond describing. Very proactive with giving us ideas and suggestions for everything like how to work the TV to restaurants and sites to see. The amenities were out of this world and more than I could’ve even provided for myself. My 18 and 19 year olds even loved the place. Beautiful historic home. There are not many places I would visit more than once because I like to see new sites, but I will definitely be back to Joshua’s place.
Also, they were very willing to work with us on booking a second night. We fell in love with the place, and then discovered a storm was coming in the area we were supposed to travel the next day so we booked an extra night. They were outstanding at helping us out .
I cannot say enough positive things about this place.
Book it! You will not be disappointed."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home. We stayed due to wrestling tournament at local high school and it was perfect. Peaceful, quiet neighbors. Everyone slept great. House was built in 1888. The ceiling in living room shows the character. The house speaks for itself. The snacks on top of fridge were great for kids and the drinks in fridge helped so much. Great hosts"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a lovely stay! We were very surprised to see how well the bathroom was stocked with anything we could possibly need. The house was perfect for my family and yard was great for my dogs. Would absolutely stay again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joshua's home was exactly as advertised. it was very clean and comfortable, and had far more amenities than I am accustomed to seeing at comparable AirBNBs. Joshua is very friendly and proactive in his communication. An all-around great experience."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The hosts were very friendly and responsive. We loved our stay. The house is beautiful. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Would stay here again if we needed to!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Josh was proactive the entire process trying to make sure we had an amazing experience without any glitches. Clean home, lots of character! Comfy living furniture and beds. The added little amenities in the kitchen and bathroom were truly the icing on the cake!
We were so busy with family Christmas activities that we didn’t get to enjoy the peacefulness as much as I wish we could have. We will make plans to come back for a visit just to chill. ❤️"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Above and beyond hosts super clean they literally thought of everything very cozy and peaceful thank you so much for a wonderful peaceful experience
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My teenage boys and I came here as a stress-free Christmas getaway. As luck would have it, it timed up with the bomb cyclone. However, this stay was a wonderful place to hunker down, keep warm, and rest. The house was incredibly well stocked, too, with everything you could need….from snacks to cooking implements to toiletries to board games.
Because of the ice, some of my initial plans had to be changed, but Joshua and Stacy graciously allowed me to tack on an extra day at the last minute. They were also extremely responsive and during our entire stay.
This was a lovely little house in a great location, and I would absolutely come here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"After a horrible flight, we were so pleasantly surprised to arrive at such a charming home! From the cozy living space to the welcome snack basket (more than just ""snacks"") the perfectly stocked kitchen and the very comfortable beds... This home had everything we needed,and was MUCH more than we expected! The town was like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting, and if you don't grab at least 1meal from Mixins and Fixins (recommended by our amazing hosts, Joshua and Stacey) you're missing out. We will book this home for EVERY future trip to Ohio. Stacey was so amazing and worked with us directly through a glitch in the AirBnB system. Can't say enough great things about the home or the hosts! We absolutely loved it!!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Charming historic home with a welcoming, cozy feeling as soon as you open the door. Stayed here for a family wedding in the area. The location was perfect, the house was inviting with everything you needed and more. Josh was a super friendly, helpful and gracious host. Highly recommend!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was beautiful in a quiet area! The home was great and clean and modern, but yet historic! We didn’t try any of the restaurants locally other than a pizza place but it was good pizza and wings!
Joshua was very helpful, always answered my questions promptly, and was very respectful!
I am very happy. I chose his house for my daughters, sweet 16 overnight stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay and the house was perfect for what we needed. The listing was accurate and the host was very friendly and helpful. The host had lots of amenities and it made for a great stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Giving thanks for this place to celebrate Thanksgiving. My husband and I decided to celebrate the holiday near our daughter, a student at OSU. It was just going to be so much easier than trying to bring her home to South Carolina. So we found this place, pet friendly, about 45 minutes from campus. It was beyond perfect. I have rented through AirBnB and VRBO across the US and Europe. Many places are exactly as described, I've never had a real problem. But this place? It went far and beyond even the description. I knew that I wanted a full kitchen, but this one was so well equipped and supplied, that it rivaled my own. There was coffee, teas, spices. Bathroom had abundant towels and extremely hot water. Beds were tremendously comfortable and had abundant pillows and blankets. Living room was deliciously inviting, we enjoyed many naps in the reclining couches. Backyard was perfect for my dogs. There is even a huge park just under 1/2 mile away with a dog park!
It was just perfect."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful older house, fixed up into a very cozy place and super clean! Comfortable furniture and beds! A perfect place if you want a small town feel away from the bustle of life! They have many complimentary items to use and enjoy, and communication was great! Highly recommend!"

It had everything from water, snacks to everyday essentials. The hosts were super nice and very responsive. Probably one of the best “value for the buck” airbnb I’ve stayed in.
The place’s design was thoughtful and well kept. I would definitely stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic place to stay and Josh is the best host ever. I have never stayed at such a well stocked AirBnB. Mechanicburg is half way for my sister and I so this was perfect. We had our dogs with us...my 2 Dalmatians and my sisters Blue Heeler. Fenced in yard was perfect. We especially enjoyed coffee sitting around the fire pit. Easy drive to Yellow Springs for fun shopping. Definately will stay here again .

There was no detail that they did not think of and went above and beyond by providing a few extra's if you forgot something. Loved the exposed beams in the living room and all the comfy seating as we had a large family gathering to accommodate. Wonderful back yard with a fire pit and lights on the fence that made it wonderful to be out in the evening. Super comfy beds! Josuha and Stacy were incredible hosts and give them 5 stars!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Joshua was a great host, had excellent communication and was very accommodating.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is amazing! The small details are definitely noticed upon entry! Great communication, over the moon impressed with the accommodations! This will be our spot when we return again to the arena! Thank you for the greatest stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent place to stay. Tons of room indoors and out. Perfectly clean. Lots of nice touches. Joshua is a great host who communicates quickly and effectively. And Mechanicsburg is a wonderful town. Worth the short drive out of Columbus.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Was welcomed immediately by Rita who was super friendly and gave us a lovely tour! A book of local restaurants and activities was posted online and in a binder in the cabin that was very helpful. The cabin itself was very clean and well decorated. The location was beautiful and quiet with beautiful trails for my dog to explore! Rita was super helpful the entire stay! During bad weather (tornado warnings) she communicated with us to make sure we were safe and was on top of the radar in case anything bad would have occurred (thankfully nothing did). She even provided an extra heater on a particularly cold night and left in on the porch for us without us asking! Very kind and considerate, going 100% above and beyond what I expected. Will definitely go and visit again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Rita welcomed our family with open arms and gave us a very hospitable tour! We enjoyed this very peaceful and cozy cabin with songbirds and inviting trails that led to a gorgeous open field. My health enthusiast daughter loved the workout room on the property. Such a tidy and relaxing cabin with just the right touches on the patio and adjoining fire pit area. Would recommend to anyone looking for a special getaway spot!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This made for a really lovely mini-retreat. A restful place to listen to birdsong and the sound of the wind in the treetops.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jared & Rita's cabin is the perfect peaceful getaway. The cabin is extremely private with all the amenities including easy access to private hiking trails, fire pit, and grill.
Instructions and communication were easy and clear to feel safe and comfortable. Rita especially made my pets feel comfortable and made sure we had everything we needed.
It truly was one of the most pet friendly (and clean!) spots I've stayed at. We can't wait to visit again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really loved the landscapes, the tranquility, the cleanliness and everything. Everything was very nice and I plan to return with my family again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved our stay here. When we arrived, Rita mentioned that there was an opening the following night. Without hesitation, we took the second night. We felt right at home in this cabin. It was comfortable and clean with just enough decorations to accent the interior. On our full day, we wandered the trails, played some music and had dinner at The Farm Market Restaurant, based on Rita's suggestion. We didn't use the fire pit at night, but actually spent some time relaxing during the day. Plenty of wood was available, as well kindling and starters had we chosen to have a fire each night. The feeder, located within view of the front porch, provided a show of several bird varieties. On our drive to dinner, we spotted a Bald Eagle by it's large nest, which was a bonus. I think we may try to return to this little cabin, although it's not near any of our future bucket list excursions. Having stayed in 8 airbnb's over the course of 3 weeks, this was the BEST!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin was lovely and just what we were expecting. Private, quiet amd everything logically placed and laid out. Co-host Rita was there to greet us and our dogs as soon as we arrived to go over everything. The surrounding acreage had nice trails that we enjoyed with our pups. Beautiful spring flowers all through the woods made the walks extra special. We would definitely recommend to anyone in need of some downtime."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the prefect weekend getaway that we needed! This place is a total hidden gem! Everything was perfect and we couldn’t have asked for a better weekend. The trails and fire pit on the property are great! Would definitely recommend this place or stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely Amish crafted cabin in an idyllic setting. We and our dogs absolutely loved the trails through the woods and walked them several times a day. Location is close to the Ohio Caverns, the Champaign Avation Museum and other local attractions. We even saw the worlds largest loaf of bread! Rita made check in and out a breeze and was very helpful with local suggestions."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Staying at the cabin was the perfect long weekend away. The cabin was so cozy, clean, and welcoming. Rita was a great help welcoming us upon arrival, showing us around and getting us acquainted with the space, which had everything we needed. This is truly a special cabin and property. We spent hours hiking through the woods with our dog, taking as many ways through as we could to enjoy all the scenery. We left refreshed, with one very tired dog from all the exploring. The price for the experience was unmatched- we really appreciated how affordable it was to be able to get away and stay in the woods. We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay. Nice private cabin to relaxe inside and out. Location is very quiet. Enjoyed staying by the firepit and cooking out on the grill. Was greeted as soon as we pulled in and made to feel welcomed. We will definitely be back.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is our second stay at the cabin. If you are looking for a relaxing, peaceful stay this is it. The cabin is the perfect size that had everything we needed. The wooded property is perfect for walks with the pup. (Loved our sunset walks) The porch is perfect for bird watching as well as sunsets. (I think I properly identified 5-with the help of the provided book) Just a short drive away is downtown Urbana with its small downtown charm. We spent some time there walking the neighborhood. We were excited that all of the shops welcomed our pup with opened arms. We thank Jared and Rita for giving us this opportunity. Rita, it was nice to see you again. ❤️"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Best place to spend a lovely time! We spent our 2nd anniversary here. Made a mistake of booking it only for a day! I should've reserved the spot even longer! Felt like staying for few more days! I will definitely visit this place again! Rita is so welcoming and I really want to thank her for making it so memorable!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely setting, beautiful cabin, and wonderful hosts! This is a great place to getaway and unplug. While it is out in the country, you're not very far to drive to restaurants, shopping, and activities. Or just stay in the cabin and recharge. Jared and his mom Rita are super hosts, and Rita is right on site if you need anything. Thanks for a great time!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice hosts and I greatly appreciate how accommodating they were!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I am so happy I chose to reach out and look into Jareds pet friendly cabin. This cabin is in the same town where i live but a change of scenery was needed. The walking trails are great. The cabin was so quaint, well appointed and deocrated so well. The bird feeder has 3 male cardinals as regular visitors. The check in with Rita was very easy. I will stay here again! Cant wait to see this in warm weather months and use the outside spaces too! Thanks for a great visit!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We spent the night just to have a night away from home. Perfect atmosphere. Quiet and relaxing space. Hosts were great and take great care of the property. We will definitely stay again in the future.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife had been asking for a getaway from the stresses of work and this private retreat in the middle of a beautiful wooded property was just what she needed. We were greeted by Rita when we arrived and given a tour of the place. While I normally prefer having a self checkin, Rita was a joy to interact with and she was the sweetest guide ever. The cabin was very nice inside and out. Our dog also thoroughly enjoyed going for walks in the woods and sitting by the nearby fire. We were close enough to several small towns for when we wanted to go out for a night. In particular, we would highly recommend Fusion 40.38 and Teabaggers in Urbana. We will definitely be coming back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The perfect gateway, extremely people & dog friendly. Host (Rita) was thoughtful and very accommodating. The trails system was perfect for our dog and newborn."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is just what I was looking for. Tucked back quietly on their property with lots of wooded area surrounding. It's located right next to another cabin but there is for sure privacy. I needed the getaway for some much needed peace and quiet to relax for a couple of days and unwind. It was the best place ever and I'm so glad I found it! Rita (co-host) was so welcoming and an absolute gem! She met me upon arrival and gave me a quick tour and run down. She was so lovely! It was nice to know that she was close by if I needed anything. Everything about this adventure was just what I needed! Thank you for hosting me!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an amazing time and we will be back!! Thanks for the great memories with my daughter!!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"always love staying here! the property is gorgeous with a lot of birds to watch and trails to hike. urbana's about 15 minutes away, and makes this the best secluded area juuuust far enough away to see the stars, but not too far away from stores/restaurants. I miss it already, and can't wait to come back!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay in our favorite AirBnB.
Jared and Rita are wonderful hosts, it feels like coming home every time we visit. Can't wait to return in the summer!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you have kids that are athletes this is the place. We walked the property. Well groomed trails. We wish could of brought our honda atc... Killer spot to teach athletes techniques for jounior high or high school lifting. Was able to teach my twins and there friend squat, sissy squats, pull ups, bench press, hyper extension machine and many cool old school tricks for hand grip exercises. Being a trainer for 25 years I really loved the spot. Thanks guys!!!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"what an amazing little get away. I surprised my wife with the cabin after having to cancel our anniversary plans due to her needing surgery. and she was astonished, it is just our kind of cozy little place. This was our first air bnb experience and I couldn't have been happier. I originally thought this was a lone cabin tucked away in the woods which is what I am used to ... I was pleasantly surprised to find that Jared and Rita live right on site but everything is very thoughtfully set up in a way you still feel very private and secluded but someone is right there in case of emergency. The trails were great and kind of just wandered around the property. Everything was just a perfect addition to our visit all the way from Arizona. I only wish we could have brought our pups they would have loved it, Everything is set up to be very pet friendly. I can't say enough good things and what an amazing experience at such an affordable price. We will definitely be back.!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, peaceful... the dogs had a blast! Beautiful, wooded property/trails for walks. The cabin has everything you need. Great firepit with wood provided. Rita is super-kind and the communication with her and Jared was easy/fast. There are a number of parks/nature preserves relatively close... and Urbana & Bellefontaine have some great restaurants and breweries.
We will come back and stay longer next time!"

Everything about it was perfect :)
Wonderful through and through :)
Perfect 5 stars :)"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend Nicole and I came for a relaxing girls weekend and it did not disappoint! We had such a lovely time walking the trails and enjoying some peace and quiet. We ran out of fire wood the first night (we very much enjoyed having a very nice long fire under the stars!) and Rita was so sweet and made sure to give us more to last the rest of our stay. Hands down would recommend this lovely Airbnb!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing cabin getaway in this quiet and nature filled area. There were lots of places close by to hike, as well as around the property, that we really enjoyed. The hosts were so sweet and very responsive to us the days prior of our trip! Amazing experiance!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not sure a few words can even describe how incredible our stay was. it definitely exceeds our expectations, we felt right at home.

Separate, huge thank you to Rita for allowing us to check in earlier, showing us around and pointing us to great places to visit."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful, cozy cabin. You feel right at home as soon as you walk in the door.

I can’t say enough good things about our experience at The Cabin of Maple View. 🙌"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful!
Everything was spotless.
Very well equipped with everything we needed and more!!!
Very friendly and accommodating host.
You're never really sure what you're going to get, but this experience exceeded my expectations. The location was beautiful with acres of woods to explore. We spotted deer just about every time we took a walk.
Could only stay 2 nights, but would have loved to stay longer."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the cabin. Rita provided a quick tour when we arrived - and was available to answer questions if we had any throughout the stay. The cabin was clean, nicely decorated, and has everything you need. The trails right outside your door were great, and good restaurants and other 'things to do' such as Ohio Caverns where close by (within a 10-20 minute drive). We highly recommend this cabin!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at the cabin! Our sons and dogs loved walking the trails and exploring the property. The cabin was so cute, clean and cozy. It was a perfect retreat for the weekend. We look forward to another trip in the future!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely beautiful place in a fabulous setting. We went for numerous walks through the hiking area. So peaceful and quiet. It was exactly what we were looking for. All the modernization you want with the quiet of an old fashioned cabin.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very short visit but, my husband and I enjoyed our time in this cozy little cabin. It was tucked away in a wooded area with a hiking trail and nature.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our third time staying at the cabin and already cannot wait to return. Jared and Rita are amazing hosts and think of everything to make your stay laid back and seamless. The cabin has everything you could need or want. A perfect quiet get away in nature. It's truly a perfect cabin and surrounding woods are beautiful year round. We love to hike and then cozy up in the cabin. The fact they allow you to share the experience with your fur babies is beyond amazing! Thank you for all the memories and sharing your space with us (and our dogs!)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a very relaxing time at the cabin. Great place to get away and unwind. Incredibly peaceful location with beautiful trails to hike. Rita and Jared were very kind, responsive, and helpful hosts. Recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jared and Rita were excellent hosts. Rita greeted us when we arrived and explained how everything worked in the cabin and gave us some recommendations for dining in the area. Great communication and quick response if you have any questions. The cabin and grounds were beautiful and we enjoyed walking our dog on the various trails that are available on the property. We visited some local state parks and nature preserves while there. I highly recommend you give it a try. You won’t be sorry you did. We timed it just right for the Fall foliage. Thanks for having us! Hope to see you again sometime in the future!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable! Loved the hiking trails. Such a beautiful peaceful place. Very much enjoyed the fire pit.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Out stay was lovely and peaceful. The surrounding land was beautiful and the map was very helpful. The only thing is a new cabin was built directly behind the guest cabin and it is now shown in the photos so know you are not truly secluded or private in the cabin.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful weekend in nature. The cabin is very clean and well-stocked with kitchen essentials, games, and outdoor supplies. Rita set up a starter fire for us which we thought was very thoughtful. It was so lovely and we definitely recommend this place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Jared's place; my only wish is that it had been longer!

Thanks, Jared and Rita, for making our stay so comfortable and for making us feel so welcome!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I had an incredible stay with Jared and Rita! They were gracious and accommodating throughout our entire stay. Rita even got the fire ready for us before we arrived! We will be returning as soon as we can.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My only complaint, ♥️ was that there wasn't charcoal as listing suggested. It was extremely windy, however, I'm a trained chef and know how to wrap a grill so hot ash has a much lower chance of escaping the grill. .. other than that, I was a tiny bit taken aback by how close the property owner was to my cabin. As I soon found though, she left me completely alone. which is what I came for. I've already re-booked for june."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,lovely place to unwind.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this cabin is magical. have stayed there 2x and it gets better every time. plenty to see and do in the area. great wineries and restaurants with many shopping venues. already planning our third stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at the cabin. It had everything we could want. We would definitely recommend to others who are looking to enjoy some time in the woods without having to be completely unplugged.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I would like to say my wife and I love the place Rita was friendly and nice so peaceful I love the wooded areas and trails and I would definitely come back soon…
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay overall. A place I will always remember , especially for future reference. We loved the cabin and it surrounds but there was one problem a tall person or elderly would have a problem a low toilet. I will have get a high raised toilet seat that would will fix the problem for next time we go . But not a deal breaker, love the place. Meet Rita very nice and helpful . Thk you jared and Rita for a nice stay"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I booked this comfy cabin to get away from our busy lives and just relax and spend time together for our anniversary. We loved that we were able to bring the dogs with us. Enjoyed the trails, took advantage of the fire pit, and relaxed in the hammock. I’m from Austin where there’s lots of outside things to do, moved to Indiana where there’s not as much, so I just loved every moment of this space. My husband and I also got to go to the Ohio Caverns and had a great time! The caverns were super close by so that was neat. Overall we had a nice weekend and I would (and already have) recommend this to friends. Rita was also a sweetie and got us all settled :)"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A little slice of paradise! Although I almost hate to say that, because I don't want it to be impossible to book again next time we want to visit. It's the best of both worlds - you're in a private, secluded space surrounded by woods and peaceful farmland, yet you have all the comforts of modern living (including good water pressure and temperature in the shower, always my top priority). We loved the firepit, the nature trails, the starlit sky (no light pollution), and the comfortable bed and futon. The cozy log cabin was all-wood - floors, walls, furniture - which we also loved. And Rita made us feel completely at home and welcome, including our dog, who even got her own blankets and towels to use."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great private place to stay. Campfires we’re great in the evening, trail was good, lots of birds at the feeder. There were great recommendations on places to visit for meals or you had everything you’d need if you brought your own food. We enjoyed every minute of it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very enjoyable stay I wish it could have been longer. Rita was very kind and showed us around the place when we arrived Everything we needed was there. Very relaxing and would recommend. You have a beautiful place and we hope to return soon. Thanks again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to go relax!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at the cabin with our 3.5 year old and 9.5 month old and had a very relaxing time. We did a lot of hiking and had a fire each night. His mom greeted us and showed us the cabin. It was very calm and quiet there. Jared has a book of all of the area activities and their recommendations, so that was super helpful. It was very descriptive. We recommend his place."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rita was waiting for us when we arrived and she was very friendly and accommodating. Our stay was peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed ourselves very much and have already booked the cabin again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jared & Rita’s place was so wonderful! Well worth the price, beautiful scenery, so peaceful & private. Rita welcomed us in so we knew right where to go, and she was such a delight! She showed us around briefly and we didn’t hear from her or see her unless we needed something which we did not - everything was very easy to find and we felt right at home! We made soup & sandwiches, hot dogs over the fire and s’mores! The trails were a great addition since we love to hike and explore nature. We will definitely return here in the future"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thanks again for the warm welcome. We left a review in the guest book but also wanted to leave one online to share with others. The cabin was perfect for our family. The hosts are very thoughtful and had everything we could have needed. We enjoyed the trails and hanging out by the fire (everything was provided). The kids loved the hammock. The area surrounding the cabin is so beautiful and they have a very nice welcome book that had a detailed list of places to eat and/or visit in the area. We ended up going to Ohio Caverns which is only about 10 minutes from the cabin and it was an amazing experience. I enjoyed relaxing on the front porch in the morning with my tea (which was provided), watching the birds and listening to nature. Before we left, a hummingbird came up to my daughter’s window for a few seconds as if it were saying goodbye. ☺️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful little cabin getaway. Clean and tastefully decorated with all the amenities. Pet friendly without pet smells! Great deal and beautiful property. Thank you Jated and Rita.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a very relaxing place that was neat and tidy. We felt right at home. Loved seeing all the birds and want to come back to venture on the hiking trails. Thanks! Rita is Jared’s mom and she was wonderful in helping and greeting us when we got there!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay at The Cabin at Maple View. A warm, personal touch and attention to detail were apparent in every aspect of our experience from booking to check out. We were made to feel welcome and at home from the moment we arrived. The cabin and its surroundings were pristine and beautiful and included all the amenities needed to create an enjoyable, relaxing atmosphere. We have traveled extensively and for extended periods of time, both domestically and abroad, but our brief getaway at The Cabin at Maple View still stands out as one of our most enjoyable and memorable travel experiences, mainly because of the personal touch and incredible attention to detail of our hosts, Jared and Rita."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rita was very welcoming and had great recommendations for food and swimming. The place was very peaceful and Tiller (the dog) was very friendly and we enjoyed his visits. Lots of birds that I don’t see in the city. All around very relaxing get away from the outside world. Definitely 10/10 recommend!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great as before. Grandson loved it as much as we do. Peaceful and calming. Hope to come back next year.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Meeted expectations.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin faced the woods. If you love to watch birds, this is the place for you. Spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated and full of thoughtful amenities. Quiet and peaceful. Rita is a great hostess."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin stay was great! We enjoyed the peaceful setting and all of the amenities that come with it, including the hammock, late night fires, visits from Tiller the pup and more. The host was super helpful - our TV was broken and they had a new one on our porch that same night
One thing to note - you are going to be right next to the host. The pictures don't do a great job of showing it, but the cabin is about 10 feet away from another one, so it's not as secluded as it looks"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful. We were able to find the property pretty easily. Rita was able to come out and meet us upon our arrival. She is very sweet and took us around for a tour of the cabin, showing us all the amenities. The gym is just a short walk from the cabin. The trails were so well maintained that it was easy to walk. we had rain throughout our time, but the canopy is so thick the rain had little effect on the trails. The cabin was perfect, we ever loved hearing the rain on the tin roof. the bed was super comfortable. Rita gave us such wonderful recommendations for towns to visit and things to do. We could not ask for a better experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had the best time! Such a tranquil spot for a long weekend. Rita was an amazing co-host along with Tiller, who we can not wait to come back to see. Would recommend to anyone who loves camping or just being in nature."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and very quiet when you just want to hide from work.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our third time staying here and just as wonderful as the first time. Quiet and serene and able to enjoy the birds singing and the frogs croaking at night. A very relaxing place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and get back in tune with nature. Rita & Tiller greeted us when we first arrived. So good to see them again. Can't wait to go back again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful setting and perfect cabin. Rita was wonderful. We really enjoyed our stay. The front porch was the favorite, watching the variety of birds and the squirrel. Couldn't ask for a more comfortable and close to everything we needed to do. Coming back again. Thank you"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little cabin for a weekend getaway in a great location. Loved all the hiking trails that we could take our dogs on.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin has been my family's getaway several times over & we'll continue to make time to spend here. You won't find a nicer, friendlier, or peaceful place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful time! Rita was so welcoming and friendly. The cabin is right next to the woods, and woods were lovely. The cabin had everything I would ever need and was very comfortable. I could watch the birds and squirrels at the bird feeder from my porch, which was very relaxing. Tiller, their dog, was a good companion on the porch and on walks. I would like to come back. Thanks for a very peaceful time!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,100% recommend!!! The cabin was so clean and cozy and equipped with everything that we needed. Rita and Jared are so welcoming and friendly!! We had so much fun walking the trails and exploring the area. Our kids keep asking when we can go back and visit with Rita! Such a wonderful place to visit and explore nature. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another perfect stay in our favorite AirBnB. So peaceful and relaxing, it truly feels like home. Thank you Jared and Rita, we will be back soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful clean and quiet, temperature controlled perfectly amazing find!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jared & Rita are amazing hosts. They have created an enchanting little slice of heaven. The cabin was neat and tidy and afforded beautiful surroundings. Rita greeted us upon arrival and was sweet and delightful. Our walk in the woods there was peaceful and lovely. We enjoyed the fire pit, the front porch as we bird watched and took advantage of the many nearby attractions all listed in Jared's helpful guest guide. the nearby towns (20 mile radius) had so many things to see and do. We can't wait to go back someday to escape adulting again. You know you have had an enjoyable vacation when you really don't want to leave. Thank you Jared & Rita for sharing your little paradise with us!!
Dawn & Jack"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a great stay here! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet peaceful place to stay that's still close to restaurants and things to do.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin, property, location and little town are amazing! This was my second time there and I can’t wait to go back! Couldn’t ask for a more comfortable stay and Rita is so nice and accommodating! Thank you! 😊"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing quiet and quaint cabin tucked behind the road! Rita was amazing - making sure I was totally settled and squared away. It was a beautiful weekend getaway
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jarod was a great host and Rita was very helpful. This is the cleanest most organized airbnb we have rented. I can't think of one negative finding. The location was so peaceful and relaxing and we found many things to do in the area. I'm sure we will return.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice quiet place to stay after a long day on the road.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Came to getaway for a night and enjoy my birthday, it was an absolute paradise. The trails are beautiful and the cabin was as cozy as could be. Rita, the co-host, was so welcoming and even gave us a tour of the cabin and let us know where everything was. They even had a binder filled with brochures for the local attractions/restaurants. I would highly recommend staying here if you’re in need of a nature retreat!
Also - didn’t get a chance to visit but this is super close to the caverns! I will definitely be booking again in the future!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was perfect!! We thoroughly enjoyed are couple of days of purposefully going without technology (even though the cabin does have it available). The trails through the woods were great!! We will definitely be coming back again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great host and place to stay. They were easy to communicate with and I had a great time.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay to unplug and relax.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, peaceful setting. Walking trails everywhere. Host was helpful, and very dog friendly. Made us feel at home. Definitely will be back in future. Cabin was clean and very homey cute."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the cutest little cabin in the perfect place for peace and relaxation. We loved every minute we spent there, whether we were just watching the birds and squirrels, relaxing on the deck , or taking a walk in the trails close to the cabin. This place was perfect for us to unwind and just take in nature. I can't say enough about it you just have to go see it for yourself."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jared and his mother take great pride in creating a welcoming and comfortable space. My boyfriend and I were surprised to find such a wonderful cabin in Ohio with walking trails on the property. We enjoyed eating breakfast out front while bird watching. All the little touches - from the bedside charging mount to granola bars and waters - showed us they cared and went above and beyond to ensure guests have a wonderful stay. We only stayed one night, but it was the perfect end to our road trip!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this place for my parents while they went to the Springfield flea market. They had a wonderful stay. They said the place was extremely clean. They loved all of the birds around the place (and gave me a full list of all they saw). Jared was very responsive. The only slight drawback was the proximity of the rental to the non-rental home. Overall, it was a very worthwhile stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for my wife and my 3-day fishing getaway on the Mad. Near plenty of river access points, but secluded back in the woods with great hiking trails. The property is managed very well, and Rita helped with check-in and was a joy to meet! Many nice small amenities (fire pit w/wood, charcoal grill, hiking trails, great wifi, interesting reads, etc) and felt cozy. The binder of points-of-interest helped us plan our evenings, which really enhanced our trip! Close to town where you can enjoy a great meal and the charm of Urbana's town square, but tucked away enough that you're truly in the woods. We didn't need anything, but felt like if we did, the hosts would quickly fill our needs. We will be back, no doubt!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place. We have stayed here multiple times, and will continue to come back a few times a year. It's the perfect relaxing weekend, and our dog loves the property and trails."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This little cabin in the woods definitely did not disappoint! IT’s everything the site says it is. We really enjoyed the cabin and its surroundings. A very rare find!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the most relaxing and wonderful place! Special touches everywhere and the little shops and restaurants in Urbana were amazing! Can’t wait to go back next month!

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Honest review. Good and bad things to say. We will be back here again to start. The cabin was great. Felt like it could be called home. It looked just like the photos. The bed, chair and futon were very comfortable. There was plenty to do inside the cabin when it was raining such as puzzles and games but the real place to be is outside. The wildlife which in our case was birds, red squirrels and chipmunks was very enjoyable. Our last night... we did hear a coyote close to the cabin. The trails were a great way to spend time. They were clear and easy to walk. Probably my favorite part the stars. The stars were awesome. Onto the bad. There is more than one cabin on the property and even one right next to our cabin. This made the feeling like the entire property being ours not true. I'm sure the owners wouldn't care much for noise or other things but felt limited. The gym was not part of the cabin The worst was one of the dogs who would bark at us and scare away the animals."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great hosts, clean and inviting space and easy check in/out!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,BEST ..MOST AFFORDABLE STAY EVER IN MY LIFE !! I LOVED THE PEOPLE THE ATMOSPHERE ...AMAZING !! INDESCRIBABLE PEACE HERR !!! HEALING REST !! THANK YOU !!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was wonderful, had to leave early for Emergency but loved the stay. Sitting on the porch watching birds hearing nature so peaceful,"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed the woods with Spring Peepers singing at night, and lots of wildflowers on the trails."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the most enjoyable relaxing vacation! It was a bonding experience around the campfire, cooking on the grill, relaxing in the hammock, listening to and watching the birds and animals. Kids loved playing throw the stick with Tiller & Dax accompanied by the co-host Rita who is a GEM!
Played a lot of cards listening to the old fashioned radio.
Number 1 in our book and will return!
Anyone should come here as often as you can!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and calm.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a fantastic cabin! Lovely people to deal with who have very clearly put so much thought into making your stay very comfortable. We absolutely loved it there and wish we could have stayed longer. We just needed a place to lay our heads at night while in the area for state park visits/hiking but the cabin could have been our sole destination and we would have been quite happy with just staying there for the entirety of our trip. Maybe next time. Truly a gem.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Despite having colder weather than we had hoped for, our stay here was absolutely perfect! Jared & Rita were super friendly, responsive, and accommodating for us and our dogs, the cabin was absolutely adorable, well stocked with anything we could have needed, and the trails were a huge hit with our pups! Would love to book here again!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,It was easily one of the greatest experiences I’ve had on this app. And the price for it is perfect!! Definitely recommend to anyone needing to get away.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The cabin was impeccable, as always - and we enjoyed so many things during our stay. It was great to get out on the trails and see the transition from brown forest bed to sprouts of green - and we saw new birds we hadn't seen in previous visits. We love how welcoming both the indoor and outdoor spaces are and one of our favorite things to do was simply sit on the porch, watch the birds and enjoy the sounds of nature. Jared and Rita are wonderful, accommodating hosts. We will continue to visit!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Enjoyed our stay at the cabin, great family place and lots of fun adventures out in nature.
Everything we needed was there, super clean, hosts went above and beyond to make us right at home.
Bed and pull out cough was comfortable, there was plenty of room for the pack n play in the bedroom.
We will definitelybe back in the future!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We chose this place to have a relaxing trip with our dogs, and we were not disappointed!! The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed! Our dogs had an absolute blast on the trails behind the cabin and even made a friend with the hosts’ dog 🐾 One of the hosts, Rita, met us at the cabin to welcome us and show us where everything was. She was very kind and friendly. We will be back again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very peaceful and dog friendly. The walking trails on the property are very nice. There’s a wide variety of birds to watch.
The cabin is very tidy and clean. The bed was comfy."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a very relaxing weekend away at this very cozy cabin- Rita is great and a very welcoming host!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay at Jared and Rita's cabin. The cabin was clean and cozy with all the amenities you need. The hiking trails were very nice and private. The gym was a great bonus.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay and hosts!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here at the cabin! Although it is neighboring another cabin, the wall and trees really make it extremely private. The trails out back the cabin were beautiful, not too long of a walk around either. Provided firewood was awesome as we didn’t need to worry about that aspect, very very kind to include. It is also quite a close drive to the Ohio Caverns, which is great location-wise to take a day and go to, as well as visit some local markets and restaurants. I would 10/10 come back to this cabin, it was a great getaway for a couple days! :)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the stay here!! Me , my boyfriend and our two reactive dogs went and it was so nice to have some peace and quiet without triggers of people for my dogs. The owners dog would stop by here and there to say hi and he was the cutest boy!! Overall we felt at home, great location, everything we needed was there, and we are already planning on coming back again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best AirBNB places I have stayed in. beautiful surroundings, and just the right sized cabin. Tasteful, immaculate, everything you need to enjoy the woods and a little quiet time. Rita was super welcoming, I instantly felt at home. Excellent price, they have purposely made this space affordable, and that means a lot to me. I came through town for work, but ended up having a nice little respite. Thank you, Rita and Jared."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved staying here. Super dog friendly. The pups had a blast. I cannot wait to come back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great getaway for my dog and I!
I would definitely love to return."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome cabin! Well appointed, super clean- and the area is very quiet and peaceful! We loved it! I highly recommend it and hope that we can return sometime!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our time here! Super cozy space and the woods are awesome to walk around in. We didn’t realize we’d be sharing the property with the owners (different houses on the lot) but they did a great job making us feel at home and giving us space.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our getaway was romantic and peaceful. We felt time stand still, like we were actually away from our routines and stress much longer. Thank you for the beautiful illusion💞"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From our gracious greeting by Rita until a later-than-some-places check out we had a relaxing, enjoyable stay. My adult son with autism and I wanted a few days away from the city where we could experience some quiet and a slower pace. Despite some rain drizzle we were able to enjoy a stroll through the adjoining woods. The cabin is a great starting point for trips into Urbana, Yellow Springs and other nearby sights: John Bryan State Park, Glen Helen Nature Preserve, Clifton Gorge, Young's Jersey Dairy, just to name a few. Thanks so much for allowing us to stay at your cozy cabin!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The two of us had a wonderful four night stay. They met us at check in which was quite helpful and showed us a few things. It was all written in a book also, but it was nice to not have to read instructions when we first arrived. We went hiking every day. So many places within A 30 min drive. My favorite was Kaiser lake just 10 min away. Urbana square has great restaurants and a fantastic cupcake place. It is only 15 minutes away. And of course the fire pit and hiking is right out your back door. We don’t have a dog and there was no issues with allergies or anything for us which is a bonus. But very dog friendly for people who have dogs. We will stay again. Thanks for a great trip!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Felt very homey, very relaxing! The sounds of the woods are so peaceful. Definitely coming back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time on our little getaway ! Place is beautiful and just like pictures . In the house you can find everything you need and was very clean . Communication with Jared and Rita was really good , would reply to all our questions quick . We loved everything about this experience !"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thanks so much for a great weekend stay! The cabin and the property were beautiful and well maintained. We enjoyed a weekend of relaxation.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jared and Rita are the people you want to be hosting you and your family. They were super kind and responsive.
I recommend this Airbnb for anyone!! The cabin is als super tidy and clean."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a lot of fun, will be coming back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jared is very responsive and made the whole process stress free. I had the pleasure to meet co-host, Rita, and she is very hospitable and kind. I would recommended them as a host and will definitely consider them in the future."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jared & Rita’s home was the perfect place for a quick getaway. The trails were well kept, the cabin was well stocked & clean, and the surroundings were beautiful! Every little detail was lovely. The rain on the tin roof & smell of pine was the cherry on top! 10/10 spot!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great place to stay if you want to unwind and relax in the woods. plenty of walking space, and it's pretty easy to get in and out of. Jared and Rita were kind enough to offer the space for an extra day In advance at a discount so I could beat the snow storm. I'm glad they did because the property looked beautiful covered in snow! 10/10 recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,beautiful property with private trails close to the mad river can't wait to book again!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jared and Rita are absolutely amazing people. The cabin was exactly what I needed to unwind and refresh. I can’t say enough good things about Jared, Rita and their cabin. Absolutely incredible experience!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I love this space. The woods are beautiful. The land is peaceful and expansive. The hosts were great, and I lacked nothing. Definitely recommend, and would love to come again when the weather is a bit better. Great space for the dogs to roam and wonderful spot to just unplug. Thank you Rita and Jared!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place. The location is to die for. Beautiful woods in the back that had hiking trails. A short drive to some spectacular caverns. Another short drive to a nearby Ski resort which we took advantage of. We were able to pack a lot into 2 days. Next time, I'm hoping to stay longer."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,I took a nice hike in the surrounding woods on a cold morning. I did not use the fire pit this time. Too cold and windy
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jared and Rita were WONDERFUL hosts. The cabin was just what my husband and I wanted for our honeymoon. Jared was kind enough to allow us to bring our dog, a one year old Golden Retriever. He loved the trails right out from the cabin and hanging with us by the fire at night.
The TV had cable channels and even though Rita thought not, there was plenty of WiFi service to stream!
We loved that it was affordable, and was very dog friendly! (A very small fee for our dog).
Rita greeted us upon entry, to explain a few things and then let us relax. The directions to the cabin were spot on, and the GPS helped us get there just fine.
We definitely want to come back!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a much needed peaceful weekend away just my pup and I in this perfect cabin. Beautiful hiking trails and views. The cabin was very clean and perfect for a getaway by yourself or with another person. Love that it was pet friendly. My dog enjoyed exploring the woods.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved it - would like to come back when the weather is better to enjoy the outside - would recommend
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, adult son and I spent a couple days at the cabin. We brought our dog. Very dog friendly . I would not have more than 3 people in the cabin; two is ideal. It is small. Check in couldn't have been easier. Host was pleasant and helpful. Cabin was immaculate and as listed. Just FYI, I had a zoom meeting I needed to attend last night and the wifi was weak, kept losing the connection. No complaints whatsoever. definitely recommended!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another perfect stay in our favorite AirBnB place from start to finish. Jared and Rita are the best hosts we have ever had, and their cute and super friendly dog Tiller is an added bonus🙂. Can't wait to come back again in the summer!"

Yet, if you want to venture out, there's plenty of great stops close by (parks, restaurants, wineries, breweries) definitely something for everyone.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our second time staying here and this trip was just as great as the first. Highly recommend! Jared is very responsive and the cabin is extremely clean. The hiking trails and peaceful surroundings are our favorite part.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We had an unfortunate experience where we nearly flipped our car near their property due to the severe winter storm that hit last night and Jared and Rita were the most generous and helpful hosts! They offered us to spend another night and even invited us to have dinner with their family so we’d have something to eat. The cabin is cozy and perfect for a couple and was fully stocked with everything you could possibly need. Our pup had a wonderful time was well and the three of us were more than grateful to have such a beautiful space to wait out the weather in.

Rita and Jared were also very communicative and welcoming. Very happy we stayed here!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this cozy little cabin. Perfect for a couple looking to get away for the weekend. We do not have pets, but the location and host are pet friendly. Keep this in mind if you have any pet allergies :)."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't imagine a more peaceful relaxing getaway, its exactly how it is listed, beds were comfy, incl the futon, the cabin was spotless and with so many thoughtful touches, will def go back."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay, making a fire despite the snowfall and hanging out in the cozy cabin. It is closer to other buildings on the property than I realized, but this was not an issue as the orientation of the cabin creates a private space that feels like you're nestled in the forest. The cabin faces the woods, with an entrance to the hiking trails just steps from the porch. I appreciated that firewood was provided, and found the cabin to be very clean and well appointment. Highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Do yourself a favor and book a trip to this insanely special oasis, you won’t regret it!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is always clean and cozy. The hosts (and their dog) are welcoming and friendly. The trails, fire pit and general area of the cabin are awesome. The water is hot for all of us to take a much needed shower after a day outside around the fire. There’s always extra linens and other things like k cups and dishes which are great. The nearby towns are cute and welcoming. Our dog is free to roam nearby and later on cuddle up on a rug in the cabin. Highly recommend!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m not entirely sure there are words for Scott his wife and co host! Our stay was beyond anything we could have ever imagined and then some. Scott was available for a late evening phone call and to our surprise him and his wife showed up at noon the next day to bless us on our wedding day. The house was impeccable and the pictures do not do it justice. We will never forget the hospitality and generosity we were given.
The beds were comfortable the pillows too! I personally used the down stairs shower and upstairs shower and main floor tub all were amazing. The kitchen had everything needed to cook with. The views were amazing it was such a private get away.
The hosts of this property were outstanding and again I could never sum up our experience into words. They literally feel like family to us.
We will be back and pray that everyone who visits enjoys their stay as we did.
Anyone looking to book please consider having a meal at the farmer’s daughter restaurant in Urbana."

We did have to be cautious with the little kids and the stairs, but thankfully we had enough adult eyes to monitor.
We would definitely stay here if we end up visiting the area again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay for a long weekend. Everything was so peaceful. The host was very friendly and very proactive in communicating. We absolutely loved the fresh baked bread that was there on arrival, it was so good. It was a very comfortable stay and we highly enjoyed it.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Second time staying here and honestly it's my favorite place to stay when going back home to Urbana to visit family. Still a beautiful place inside and out and downtown Urbana is just breathtaking.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time and really enjoyed the apartment. We loved being able to step out the door and being right in the middle of town. Patrick was a great host and even gave us a partial refund when we had to cut our trip short. We are looking forward to coming back soon and finishing our trip.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, enjoyed our visit and accommodations"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The decor was beautifully placed to where your first impression is like ""wow"". I loved the location and even in the heart of Urbana it's still peaceful and private. There was extra linen's already there so we didn't have to ask for more things. The inside of fridge and freezer was very clean and that's things I look at right away to see what kind of place I'm staying at. So housekeeping is great. Communication was very good. This place is bigger than what you think and what the pictures look like as well. Kitchen had everything you needed to just cook as well. Thank you both for sharing your home with my family. I would definitely stay at your place again. Beautiful home and great home owners."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place. Parking was a breeze. The loft is very comfortable and has everything you would want. Why spend the money on a hotel when you can have such a wonderful place like this! And don’t miss eating from the restaurant downstairs. Fantastic food.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay during our trip to Ohio! Even though we had business to attend to Columbus, we didn't want to stay in the city so we found this little gem instead & were not disappointed. The space had everything we needed for a comfortable stay & was within walking distance to restaurants & bars. It is above an Italian restaurant & yes, I recommend that you try them out. The food was delicious! Abuelas Kitchen was great too. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place for a weekend getaway! So convenient to downtown shopping, restaurants, etc. The cafe below is the best restaurant in town too!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a weekend getaway. It is right on the square which was convenient for us.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was beautiful and in a perfect location. We were in town for a short stay but were able to enjoy the food trucks and vendors in the square for “Second Saturday.” The wifi was pretty slow as it is an open network, so it is not really suitable for streaming/working remotely."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Patrick’s Air BnB was just as described - super comfortable with all the amenities you could need. Pat was quick to respond and sent all the details for check in prior to arrival. The revitalization of the area provided many restaurants and shops all within walking distance. I would absolutely stay here again next time I’m in town visiting family!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved it. We actually weren't ready to leave. It was like we were living in our own little story. The apartment was beautiful and everyone was so nice. We can't wait to rent with them again.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank again for such a lovely stay! This was our second time renting this perfectly located loft. We love Patrick’s eagerness to make us feel right at home. Very safe and his restaurant downstairs is by far the best Sicilian food I’ve had! I love how this cute little town has so much businesses within walking distance and they all help support each other. Such a strong community! We will be back again for sure!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beyond our expectations times a million! Such a great host with one of the best authentic restaurants I’ve ever had in ohio! New York is the closest I’ve tasted as far as flavors and passion cooked into its food. Place was absolutely perfect. We were in town for a volleyball tournament at game time sports. We’ll be back for another tournament in a few weeks and hope this rental is still available! Thank you Patrick and your beautiful staff for making us feel safe and like part of the family❤️

We absolutely loved it, and we will be back!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely, comfortable space - right by our favorite restaurant. Everything was so convenient inside the unit. And is so perfectly located.

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, cute place! Right downtown and convenient to some great shops and cafes.
Only downside is the fire department is a block over so you hear them when they go out during the night. Also, heating and cooling unit makes a loud bang when it turns off. I sleep with ear plugs so it didn’t bother me too much but…
Overall, a great place to stay!"

We had never been to the Urbana area and were a little concerned about being able to find it, but it’s right at the center of town, and our GPS took us right to the parking lot in front of the building. If we’re ever in the area again, we’re hoping the loft is available because we will definitely stay here!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Love our stay at the Loft! The location was perfect and it was fun to be right in the downtown area. Even though no designated parking, finding parking close to the loft wasn't an issue.
The loft is bigger then what the pictures convey and is tall and airy. The kitchen is stocked with the bare minimum but had everything we needed for the few meals we cooked. There is a decent amount of steps to climb to get to the loft, so take that into consideration if you have mobility issues."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loft on the Square is perfectly located for exploring Urbana and the surrounding area. Above the Cafe Paradiso and next door to a gourmet market it's a dilemma whether to eat out or cook in. It's nicely furnished, comfortable and looks much larger in person than in the listing photos. Highly recommended."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The hosts are great. Excellent communication and the ease of self check in is great. They were quick to respond to any questions we had and very pleasant as well. The loft is equipped with everything you would need for any stay…short or long. We were really impressed with how large the space is. Pictures don’t do it justice.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,I honestly loved staying here due to the fact that the owners were great and very helpful. Kid friendly which was amazing for me. Spacious enough for a small gathering. Way better than a hotel room space wise and price wise for a weekend. Beds are comfy furniture is beautifully decorated. The only thing I would suggest for here is that there’s TVs in the bedrooms. I didn’t know that and had to grab a couple for my stay there. But we made due so overall a must and a for sure coming back stay. Thank you for the stay 😊

We felt very safe here. We can not wait to return to Urbana! We visited for The Extravaganza. We honestly loved the shops in town more than the entire Extravaganza! So ecstatic we stumbled on The Four Gables! We have no reason to ever look to stay anywhere else! We will absolutely recommend The Four Gabels , anyone on the fence as to where to stay, this is definitely the place. You will not be disappointed whatsoever, I promise!!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for visitors - steps from market, restaurants, shops. Plenty of parking. Very clean and cozy! Comfortable bed and pillows. So happy to find a lint roller in the closet too. There’s about 12 stairs from entry to apartment door, but the stairway is wide enough for lugging suitcases and strollers. Recommend staying here!"
2021-04-01,3,Stayed over a week,"The apartment is nice and Urbana is a fun little town, but there’s a major issue with road noise. The building sits directly on the Main Street through town, which also happens to be a state highway, so there’s constant vehicle traffic (including semi-trucks) at basically all hours. Combined with the old windows, this makes for a serious noise problem, especially at night and early in the morning. If you’re at all sensitive to noise while trying to sleep, I’d avoid this property until the hosts get some more sound-insulating windows installed."

Kim left water in the fridge, and all the dishes, etc. that made it easy for us to bring our own food. There is a market and deli in the same block, and the place is downtown, so easy to walk to shopping, etc., and centrally located, so it is easy to get to anything. If you want to stay in, she has all the cable, and the internet is great. Beds are comfy, and the shower has good water pressure. It is quite homey - comfy furniture, etc. I love the upstairs location. The master is located off the bathroom, and the other bedroom off the kitchen area. We loved our stay, and will be back!! Thank you Kim!!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kim’s place! I’m a city/suburbs girl, so the ride up to the apartment was a little iffy for me. The small town country vibes are not what I am used to, so I was skeptical! However, the moment we walked into the apartment, I was pleasantly shocked! It was very nicely styled and well-kept and made my small worry dissipate. Kim has a local business, so the next day, as we were settling in, we ended up running into her as she came to check-up on us. I especially loved this because out of all the trips I’ve had, I’ve never had the owner personally come and make sure we were squared away. I would highly recommend this little apartment in Urbana. Great stay over all!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Very accommodating! Left a personal item at the apartment and Kim went out of her way to make sure I got it back!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kim’s place is perfect. It was immaculate and nicely decorated. It was spacious enough for 4 adults to move around and enjoy without being in each other’s way. The location was perfect as it’s downtown Urbana. There’s a nail salon, barbershop, hair salon and a market all within the same block as well as a nice restaurant in walking distance. Everyone was so friendly and Kim was quick to respond to any questions I had; her husband even helped me unload my car. I will definitely stay here next time I’m in town visiting family. #perfect"
