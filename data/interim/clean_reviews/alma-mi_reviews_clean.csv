The location is right in front of a lushis green field with amazing views. it's tranquil. it's calm. and it's minutes away from a cute little downtown area. everything is boutique and a nice getaway from the big city life. however the house is only about 20-30 minutes away from a small city that has all the chains. it's really a great location. we were met with muffins and there was plenty of snacks, coffee, and cereal stocked in the kitchen. Most importantly, Karla's service was outstanding!!! she really helped us out. I needed an Iron last minute and she brought one over to me late night. I highly recommend to stay here. take a breather, get away from the grind. enjoy the calm"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS GEM! Such a beautiful, cozy little place! Incredibly clean and on a beautiful piece of country property! The owners were so kind and hospitable! We will be back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This location was amazing! Right at the end of the lake so it felt more private and there was not a lot of boat traffic. The beach area and dock were great for fishing, kayaking, and lounging. The house had everything we needed for 4 adults and 2 kids to share comfortably. Food and stores were within a reasonable drive as well."

I enjoyed the comfy living room couches, as well as our private space. A perfect little spot!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,It is a very nice house with a big community area where we had dinner with the kids. The beds were very comfortable!! We couldn‚Äôt find any AC around so we had to open to windows and use the fan that was provided which was good but still a little warm even with the windows open. By the time we were ready for bed it was almost 11 and too late to reach out. Very convenient to campus and allowed my kids to spend extra time together while I was able to get settled for the evening. Thanks so much!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Right in middle of campus. Perfect location. Room is a nice size. Easy to get in and out of. Only issue is the chair in corner is close to the bed so you may hit your shin on the edge but otherwise it‚Äôs great.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Some of the best beds I've slept on.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed two nights, the house is terrific‚Ä¶lots of interesting historical memorabilia‚Ä¶be advised: there is no elevator, so if luggage and steps don‚Äôt mix for you, ask about ground-level room availability. Having an oven to heat up food for our event and a refrigerator/freezer to store drinks and popsicles for the 5-year-old was a huge benefit. The college campus is right across the street."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, quiet, and super comfy bed! It‚Äôs an older house, so creaky floors are expected but I could barely tell there were other guests or housekeeping around. It did get a little warm in the room but once I found the fan in the closet, all was well. Thank you for the quick responses and lovely stay!"

The snack basket was very much appreciated and it's so nice that some spray oil and salt and pepper were provided. And the air fryer!!! Views are amazing from every living area. Just a nice, fun and relaxing place to visit. Lots of stuff to do in the area - movie theater, food trucks and the ice cream place were a hit, too! Summer 2025 we will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at this house! It is right on the lake and has a beautiful view. The host left us a little basket of goodies and we had everything we needed for a wonderful stay. Nice and clean and bright and welcoming. Can't wait to come back! It's perfect for a few adults and a handful of kids
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for a short vacation and can't wait to stay longer!
Crystal Lake is a large, clean, and clear lake. The views from the cottage are amazing! It was too cold for the kids to go swimming as it was only May, but we enjoyed walking to downtown and getting ice cream! Sitting on the cottage deck overlooking the water was the best. Gorgeous sunsets, too! The Crystal Water's Edge Cottage is very clean and absolutely perfect for a few adults and kids. Having a bathroom on every floor was so nice. Beds were very comfy! We have no complaints, and can't wait to come back with another family!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacee was a great host. The cottage was clean, comfy & we felt very at home. Being on the lake was very relaxing, enjoyed sitting on the deck drinking coffee in the morning & wine in the evening. Would definitely stay again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The rental was exactly as described. Beautiful setting and home. Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place! Cozy, tucked away place on the water."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The rental is exactly as decribed and pictured. We had everything we needed for our weekend stay, it was clean, and I love that we were able to bring our dogs. The scenery is beautiful and we loved having the gas fireplace during the chilly evenings. It was too chilly to enjoy getting on the lake while we were there, but if you're considering during warmer days, the rental offered plenty for outside fun on the lake. I would consider staying here again if I'm in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely love this place. once you get there you don't wanna leave.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place for peace and relaxation. Great communication with the host and the cottage felt just like home. We look forward to staying at the cottage in near the future. I would recommend this location to others.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a very relaxing and cute little place on a private lake. Very comforting and beautiful views
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So fun little spot. Would absolutely come back here.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this place for a funeral (it was a last minute booking) my reservation was booked around 5 pm the day before I needed it and was excepted around 10pm. We had around 6-7 hour drive from our house to the Airbnb and the only complaint I really have is that we couldn‚Äôt get into the driveway due to it having about 2 feet of snow on it. So we really didn‚Äôt know where the driveway was and we had to shovel it after that long exhausting ride ( we did book last minute). Other than that the house was clean. The kitchen has coffee pots, pots n pans, cups, bowls and a microwave, 2 refrigerators, a gas fireplace and there was a portable electric heater and a fan. The house sits on a lake, the lake was frozen solid so the family did a little ice fishing ( fishing supplies on site) The neighbors were very friendly. It also has the older baseboard heaters and the 1st night was pretty cold. It was hard to warm it up even with the fireplace. Would I book it again YES! All in all very Comfy!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, beyond full stocked kitchen (bring your own chef knife if youre a stickler), and tons of little fun features. You really dont need anything as it has paper towel, tin foil, solo cups etc. I love the diffusers (which did need a bit of a cleaning), but it got rid of the dinner smell. TV ready to go, gas fireplace is a nice touch, and the deck is super nice."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect space for our needs. Comfy, clean, and plenty of things to keep busy.... if your in a cabin lakefront mind-set of opportunities to be had.
Beautiful and personal and careful touches throughout. So calm."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,A very comfortable cabin on a tranquil lake. We were there in the winter so didn‚Äôt have a chance to use the kayaks etc. A very comfortable place to stay. We felt very safe.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a fantastic time at Stacee‚Äôs place. The house sits on a nice lake with great views. We‚Äôd love to stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stacee's Lakeside Cottage is marvelous. It is well-provisioned and very comfortable. We were here mid-November, and although it was cold and blustery outside, the cottage was warm and cozy. The kitchen is small but full of utensils, pots, pans, cooking paraphernalia and lots of plates and cups and mugs. You enter through the garage which is set up as another lounging space (is this a Michigan thing?) so don't be surprised when you first walk in. The windows look out upon the small but scenic lake outside. The road around the lake is very walkable. The neighbors are friendly and helpful. The beds are comfortable. The geese serenaded us at all hours, which was delightful. There are also lots of supplies for boating or fishing (neither of which we did, but they were there anyway). It is about 20 minutes from any town, but that makes it even more of a getaway. We will come and stay again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and comfortable home. Enjoyed a peaceful getaway and felt very homey.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Stacee for preparing a beautiful and relaxing place! It was a lovely place that was well-stocked and comfortable. We loved the bedding and living room furniture. A kayak and paddle boat ride we‚Äôre just what we needed.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage was clean , comfortable and cozy on a quiet lake. The geese decided to be a little noisy one night, but rarely heard any of the neighbors. This was our first experience booking an airbnb and everything worked out fine. Several lakes to kayak on within a 5-10 minute drive."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peaceful cottage not far from Ann Arbor. A nice getaway.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and place! Had a great weekend and would definitely recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, peaceful lake"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cozy cottage! Opening the large windows in the main living area to let in the summer breeze makes for a perfect and peaceful time to unwind and recharge.
Bedrooms and dining area had new high quality ceiling fans installed and several portable fans to use. The bathroom was fully loaded with an abundance of communal toiletries, towels, and packs of toilet paper. The kitchen was also fully loaded, and both bedrooms had many extra blankets. The home was very clean, especially for a place that allows pets! No weird smells, stains, or stray dog hair at all on the floors, linens, or couches.
Couple of things as a heads up: the area felt very safe, but for nighttime privacy there are only curtain sheers in the home and an accordian door for one of the bedrooms which didn't close all the way for us. The home is also on well water, so bring water bottles if you're not accustomed (there's a great little grocery store 10 min away).
Loved our stay there, very refreshing!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stacee and her dad accommodated an early check in for our 37th anniversary. The hosts were finishing up as we arrived and walked us around the home. They were very friendly and took great care to provide a comfortable and clean place to stay. The lake is very peaceful and quiet. We used the aluminum rowboat, and they had ample fishing gear that was available for us to use. We didn't use the kayaks but plan on a return visit when we have more time. This is a great place to get away and we highly recommend.
-Rich and Julie"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay so much! Such a great price for what you get. So peaceful and relaxing, beautiful home."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stacie was extremely helpful and responsive during our stay!
The cabin is quaint, simple and very peaceful. We didn‚Äôt have AC during our stay, but thankfully the weather was beautiful and we even needed some additional blankets at night with all the windows open.
Full disclosure, we came to town for a family reunion and didn‚Äôt rent this place with the intention of using the lake amenities but it was still a great deal!
We would love to comeback hand have an actual ‚Äúlake vacation‚Äù because this place is very cute and has everything we need."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cozy cottage on a small lake! We enjoyed our stay for a three day getaway. Not much to do locally, but we enjoyed having a few lazy days. My young boys enjoyed fishing off the dock and caught plenty of small blue gill. Not able to swim off the dock, but you can swim in the middle of the lake. The cottage was small, but had everything needed for our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The property was as described. We mainly were just fishing. It was very quiet almost in the middle of nowhere. Host was very quick to answer questions. They had many items needed for grilling/bonfires which was nice. Our only minor complaint was the paddle boat had water inside it that we were unable to get out which made us nervous to take it out. The other small boat worked fine but it would slowly take in water. Every 2-3 hours we would have to come back in to drain it out. Overall it was a great experience.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stacie and Leigh were wonderful and super responsive with all my questions due to my inability to read well written documentation. Very helpful, very friendly. It was beautiful peaceful getaway."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I loved our stay so much!! It was so clean and welcoming, it was easy to relax and enjoy our stay. It was very affordable and exactly what my family needed!! We will definitely be back!!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very peaceful. We enjoyed our stay
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It was a wonderful stay. The inside was nice and felt clean. The environment was very relaxing and well set up.
The fridge was a bit on the small side but made sense in the space and was enough for the 2 of us. The kitchen has dishes, pots & pans, as well as cups and whatnot, which was very nice
There is a neighbor that is close but didn't bother us any and seemed friendly enough.
The body of water had decent size fish and plenty as my bf caught 6 of them. The host even offered fishing equipment as well as kayaks. There was quite a bit of seaweed, so you have to paddle out to get past it. The internet worked well, and we were able to watch movies.
There is a place to get wood about 7 minutes from the cabin cash needed to purchase it.
There are only shear curtains on the windows, so keep that in mind. It didn't bother me, but it may some people.
Overall, I have no complaints."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was great! Exceeded our expectations!

We enjoyed the serenity of the moonlight shining over the lake from the attached deck ,there is also seating next to the private dock that comes along with the rental."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,I really enjoyed my stay and I plan to come back again soon!

I was looking for a nice quiet place to stay for a hands on training class and this was a perfect match in terms of location. Community it is in looked great but I was there for training so I couldn‚Äôt really take in the surroundings but it sounded really nice.

There was plenty of room for us to hang out and there were games to enjoy as it‚Äôs May in Michigan and was cold one morning. The place was beautiful, inside and out. We loved all of the decorations throughout the cottage. We were able to enjoy the outdoors including the kayaks and fire pit.

Angie was extremely helpful and thorough in her directions. Her directions are posted in the house so I never felt I needed to reach out with questions.

I would love to come back during the summer to enjoy the lake!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous little gem on a lake. Although we were here during the off season the place would be a great space to enjoy all of the amenities of living just mere feet from the water! The place was cozy but 2 bedrooms were plenty big enough and the open concept kitchen/dining/living room were more than spacious enough for our party of 4 adults.
10/10 would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Amazing view of the lake as well!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Angie was super responsive and helpful throughout the entire stay. She communicated quickly and her home was so welcoming! Absolutely loved the view and loved the coffee setup!

I stayed here for a weekend and I was definitely occupied the entire time and had such a beautiful view with many things to do. They had games set out, things to keep children occupied, fishing, and just so much more. The host Angie was amazingly responsive to any questions and needs I had. Very kind,attentive, and easy to talk to. Oh and they have one of the most beautiful cat‚Äôs I have ever seen and met my entire life. Would definitely book here again in the future. üôÇ"

All amenities were provided as listed. Plenty of pictures and information in the listing - to understand the space and feel well prepared on arrival. The space was peaceful and had direct access to the lake directly out the back door. Communication with host was great - Angie is responsive and thorough.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy cabin with a great view and layout. Amenities and the kitchen were well stocked and the place was clean upon arrival. I imagine it would be an amazing stay-cation spot for a family that wants to spend time on the water in the warmer months. In the winter, the road to get there was a bit rough and bumpy, but they made a good effort to plow the snow. It was passable for FWD cars, but a vehicle with a taller suspension would be better suited there in winter conditions.
The host is very helpful and communicative. Thank you again for everything."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this cottage! It was so nice! The open floor plan was so nice! We cannot wait to bring our kids back this summer! It‚Äôs a great place! Super clean, perfect size for us!! Thank you for having us!"

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute, cozy place right on the lake. Older home, but seems well taken care of for the most part. We were there only for an overnight, so suited us well.

Even though Mother Nature had plans of her own, and we didn't get to do what we originally planned, to wake up in the morning and look out to see the sun come up over the lake was a real treat. It's a very scenic area.
Check-in and check-out was super easy. Check-out time was perfect at 3pm.
We had pots, pans, and dishes provided for cooking meals, as well as plenty of bottled water, as the area's water has a high iron content.
We needed a couple things from the store that we hadn't packed but, we weren't far from shopping.
The bedding was clean and there were plenty of extra blankets, if needed; plenty of towels and some toiletries were provided.
Overall, we had a very pleasant, peaceful stay and would go again."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you get a super cute cabin with a fabulous view and a host who goes above and beyond‚Ä¶ its a recipe for a fantastic trip. The instructions right from address to getting in, around were on point. The cabin was so cute and clean. It felt spacious. The host had little (pleasant) surprises throughout the cabin which made the stay even better. Our teen daughter wanted to try fishing for the first time and the host not only gave their own stuff but also taught her how to fish. There were kayaks and paddle boats and we had fun using them. The house was recently renovated and you can see the love, effort and dedication that has gone into it. We would love to come back again. Thank you!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family LOVED this place! We hit all the available watercraft running and didn't stop paddling until after dark! The lake is super peaceful and calm...perfect for feeling secure to let the kids be out there. Angie went above and beyond in offering some of her own additional watercraft once she saw that our family really enjoyed being on the water, and in offering to let us stay later than the posted check out. The cottage looks small and super cute, but packs a big punch! The open living space is roomy and comfy, the kitchen looks brand new and is squeaky clean, and the bedrooms were nice with very comfortable beds. We enjoyed the games that were there, and the drinks and snacks Angie left for us. We had EVERYTHING we needed, and after a week of staying in a different Airbnb every night, we all agreed this one was our favorite! Thanks Angie!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying here! My boys 10,4 and 1 loved the water being right out back.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs even more beautiful when the sun is out, but since we‚Äôre from Seattle we actually loved the misty, moist weather. The cabin is in a quiet area and is beautifully decorated, clean and neat. The bed had a memory foam topper that we loved and the kitchen had all the essential utensils/pans/S&P, etc. we needed to cook our own meals. Lots of thoughtful touches like games and books, soft fluffy towels, snacks, plenty of bottled water and coffee. It was obvious that Angie cares about making her guests feel comfortable.

We were greeted by Daniel‚Äôs wife the second we pulled up to the driveway and she helped us find where to park and enter! It was a great and kind welcome! When we walked in it immediately felt like home! It was so comfy and they even gave us two free muffins that were absolutely scrumptious. Me and my daughter watched movies and explored the campus. On top of all of this hospitality, they helped us in a time of trouble. My daughter forgot to print her parking pass for another college we wanted to visit and needed it urgently. We called up Daniel and he and his wife printed it out and delivered it to our door within an hour. Made my day. Needless to say, if my daughter decides to attend this college (which seems very possible ;) I will be back. Thanks for everything! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If we could rate this place higher than 5 stars we would. felt very welcoming from the very beginning and was welcomed with a personal note and treat especially for my family.

Thanks for being a terrific host Daniel."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay at Pine Lodge. Our host provided a yummy treat and personalized welcome! It was peaceful and restful. It was a great space to get away, enjoy our family, and sleep well for a couple nights. We couldn't have asked for better hosts.

Daniel is the perfect host.
My first Airbnb experience. Thanks to Daniel, it's just the start."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,I loved staying at the Pine Lodge for our pool tournament! Daniel and his wife were extremely sweet and helpful!

My new go to when traveling to Mount Pleasant!
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Daniel was everything an air bnb host should be, as was his cabin all we hoped it would be. This was my first air bnb experience, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Daniel even offered to come out and start a bon fire for us! We ran out of time for that as well aS viewing the little art gallery created by Daniel‚Äôs talented wife and son, but plan to on our next visit. We did see some art originals in the cabin and enjoyed those. The surroundings are beautiful and couldn‚Äôt be more private. We saw multiple deer in the yard and the outdoor space was inviting with a large deck and seating available there as well as out and about in the yard and surrounding woodsy area. Yummy muffins and treats were a nice touch. I confidently recommend this beautiful cabin to anyone looking to stay in the area. Daniel is the perfect host and your stay is sure to be wonderful!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pine Lodge provided the perfect place for our family to stay for the weekend of our son's wedding at Little Flower Barn at Lake Isabella. It was so helpful to have a full kitchen not only for refrigerator space but as a place to do some food prep for all the various meals over the weekend as we prepared rehearsal dinner, breakfast the morning of, appetizers for the wedding, and then brunch the day after. In addition, there were delicious muffins and snacks left by the hosts for us to enjoy. We could not have asked for better accommodations. It was the perfect distance away and had the amenities we needed that no hotel would have provided. Although we live less than 45 minutes away, staying at Pine Lodge, which was less than 10 miles from the venue, and being able to come and go as needed over the 3 days was a huge blessing for my husband and myself and my sister and her family. We would definitely choose Pine Lodge again if we ever had a need for overnight accommodations the the area."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, warm retreat! It is secluded in a wooded area with nature all around. The cabin is clean, warm and inviting. We loved sitting at the table on the deck for a long, relaxing breakfast under the umbrella watching the birds come to the feeder and hearing the sounds of the woods. Having two bathrooms was an extra bonus since we shared our stay with another couple. Plenty of room to lounge or just get away on our own. The full kitchen, complete with cooking utensils, appliances and dishwasher, gave us the opportunity to prepare our own omelettes, toast, coffee and snacks during our stay. The muffins that were provided for us by our host were delicious! Daniel and Randy were such gracious hosts and responded immediately to our texts. Without reservation, we highly recommend this private retreat."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If they have an opening jump on it. The pictures and descriptions do not do it justice. Everything was there for us from welcome muffins and snacks to shampoo etc. Little touches that made it so cozy. By far the best place in Mt. Pleasant.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fabulous stay! Even booking was very easy and the host was very accommodating to our requests. The home is great nice and clean with everything you could need. The lake is a hidden gem - sandy bottom and perfect size for our kids (9 and 11) to kayak and paddle board. We stopped at Walmart in Alma for food and then any little things we needed we got at the Dollar General or gas station less than a mile away. Oh and the ice cream place up the road is great. 3Ds pizza was also good and they even delivered and it was super quick. Everyone in our party said that they want to return next summer.
My only tip would be to pack your own pillows if you are picky/particular like me. I wish I would have as the pillow was a little small/flat for my taste."

We did rent the boat, was an added bonus. We had some trouble with it, and does not have a very high maximum speed. We did also get stuck out in the lake for a bit. Jeb was absolutely wonderful in helping us get it back on, so we very much appreciated his quick communication on that!

The home is soooo beautifully pull together. Every detail was carefully thought out! I loved all the decor.
What made this stay even better was the beach and patio seating area! My friend and I sat out in the chairs for hours enjoying nature and a few glasses of wine into the sun set.
We ended the evening with a nice campfire under the stars!!!
It was just what this mama needed!!
I loved the place so much that I wanted to book it for a couple weeks after when I came back to town for my niece‚Äôs graduation, unfortunately for me, it was already booked!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"1) The place was perfect for our needs. Lots of space both inside (expansive kitchen/dining room/sitting room) and outside (deck, large yard, children's playset, etc.). The long driveway meant that we were far from the main road.
2) There were several positive surprises for travelers with small children: a variety of toys/board games were available inside, the kitchen was stocked with toddler plates/cups/cutlery, and the outdoor playset was a fun outdoor diversion.
3) John/Cheri were extremely responsive to communications (quick replies with relevant/detailed information).
4) You know at time of booking that the location is quite rural and removed from any major towns...but I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of stores/amenities within a 15 minute drive. There was a donut shop and a gas station less than 5 minutes up the road that were useful in a pinch. And there was a loaf of bread, some butter, and a little local honey waiting for us when we arrived. Huge win!"

The calm of the farm, the gorgeous view of the fields, the farm animals and the wildlife were absolutely a highlight on our trip across Michigan. It was a delight to hear the baby lambs bleating as we rolled in, and our daughters are still raving about the baby kittens. After hours in the car, we instantly felt at home and relaxed when we stepped into the farm.
The apartment was spacious‚Äî easy to spread out a family of six. We loved the king beds! This listing was right next to Cheri‚Äôs home but we felt like we had plenty of privacy and space to ourselves; we had our own entrance, and parking space, porch, and backyard space complete with a play structure and basketball hoop.
Our favorite part was just hanging out and enjoying the refreshing and relaxing vibes. We will absolutely be back!"

A lot of windows in the living room to enjoy the sunrise and the outdoor view. Cheri's husband (John) gave us a tour to the sheep farm that they own and it was a unique experience for me and my family to see that many sheep and great to see the new borns. John also explained to us in detail how the farm works (excellent experience).
Great areas to walk and while sitting on the deck enjoy the view of the pond (very relaxing). Definitely, my family and I will find another excuse to go back to Cheri's place. Highly recommended for any one that would like to have those relaxing moments in the country!
Thank you Cheri and John for all your attentions!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to stay for one night before a nearby conference, and Jospeh and Brenda's place fit the bill, just minutes from the CMU campus.
Joseph and Brenda were excellent hosts and very friendly. They had plenty of recommendations and have lots of experience using Airbnb's themselves. The accommodations are HUGE, with a wide-open feel. It is in a basement, but the floors are nicely painted and there are some rugs.
Everything was super clean and welcoming. We took advantage of the theater area, the gym and the sauna...I even had room to get in a decent walk inside after my workout. The bed was very comfortable, and there was an assortment of pillows, so you're bound to find one or two you like.
This was a GEM of a find, and we will definitely stay there again. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is because I want to be sure it's available whenever we want to come to town!
Book it, you won't be unhappy!"

Overall I absolutely loved my stay here and will definitely be back when I come back through."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay! While the listing is new, it's clear that Joseph and Brenda are not. They had all the details covered. The area was spacious, welcoming, clean and perfect for our party of three. I would absolutely stay here again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Great host and great location near alma.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Doug was so helpful before our stay, during our stay and even after our stay. This was the first time we had ever stayed in an Airbnb and I was a little nervous but everything that was listed out about the place was spot on and the directions given to get in and out was so easy to follow. I highly recommend working with Doug."
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"No A/C that was promised in listing. Host mentioned there may be portable fans but there were none to be found, and upon being told this information, the message was read but no response given. Trash behind bed upstairs. Window upstairs was cracked open which let 2 bees inside that had to be killed. Also multiple spiders."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our weekend here. House was perfect for our needs. Just a little warm as ac units weren't put in yet, but we opened all the windows and turned on the ceiling fans and it was great!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great lots of room
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Doug‚Äôs place while in town for a family reunion. We mainly just slept there but would have been able to spend the whole day if needed. Great kitchen, supplies, clean area. Definitely recommend and would love to stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a very cute house and worked perfect for me and my family
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great Host!!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We rented Doug‚Äôs air bnb for my wedding weekend and loved it. It was in such a cute little town
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,This place was nice and clean. Loved the fire pit out back. Pretty walking trail nearby. Two upstairs bedrooms are connected but otherwise looks exactly like the photos
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. Since we were in town to visit family, we weren't able to take advantage of some of the amenities this property has to offer including the great space out back. This property would be the perfect space for a cozy personal retreat as the neighborhood is quiet. We were grateful for Doug's hospitality."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great, the bed was comfortable downstairs, and the recliners in the living room were very relaxing. The kitchen was well equipped for all my cooking needs and the bathroom was spotless with a wonderful shower. There were 2 swings outside for my grandkids which they loved. If I were to nitpick there was only 2 things that could have been better, upstairs didn't have covers on the outlets but I just had my grandkids sleep downstairs on the couch and the trash in the kitchen was half full when we arrived, but I wasn't too bothered by it. Basic, but comfortable!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet neighborhood and home was just what we were looking for.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay fast responses would stay again!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great place. Needs to feel a little homier. Bath towels need upgraded.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"My clan and I really enjoyed Doug‚Äôs place!
We were in town for a wedding 20 mins away and this was a perfect spot to hunker down for 2 nights after wedding festivities.
There was a convenient gas station / dollar general right down the road for our last minute needs. Since we were just here for the wedding we didn‚Äôt get to explore much of the surrounding area but the location was peaceful.
Very cozy, clean, comfortable place.
Would recommend.
Thanks Doug!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall was a great stay. Wish the a/c unit upstairs was in the bedroom with the larger bed, as my husband and I slept there with our babies on the other side next to the a/c. Kind of cold for them and hot for us. Beds were very comfy. And it was overall a nice place. We enjoyed the community days parade too!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were visiting family and it was very convenient to find an Airbnb in the area that accepted our dogs. Overall, we had a pleasant stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we needed! The porch swing is a dream. Doug reached out before the trip and was very responsive. My ONLY suggestion would be that the bed sheets could use some replacing. Thank you for everything!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,"My family and I stayed at Doug‚Äôs place for an event a couple miles away in Edmore. Check-in was easy and the neighborhood was quiet. The beds were comfortable, we had plenty of hot water, and the house was fairly clean. There are a few small restaurants in the area and a Dollar General just down the road which is convenient. Overall, we would stay here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,was clean and nice!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Just what we needed
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was a nice place to stay, it was clean, had everything you needed and looked like the pictures. The upstairs bedroom was a little small and the stairs going up to it were steep, but not a problem for our group . It was located in a quiet area so sitting on the porch swing after a long day was relaxing. It was pet friendly which is a plus for me. I would definately stay here again when in the area. A good value for the price."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Small typical house in the center of a small market town in Michigan, ideal for us ."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was close to seeing our
Kids. Nice big kitchen and yard. Enjoyed the front porch swing"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were visiting family nearby and Doug‚Äôs place for the bill! Loved the memory foam bed and great floor plan downstairs (we didn‚Äôt need the upstairs area). We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in the area. Wish we had been here when the weather was warmer so we could have enjoyed the front porch swing and ice cream from Farmer-in-the- Dell!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was just as advertised! Everything we needed and close to the location we needed. Quiet neighborhood and pet friendly. Definitely would come back for another stay!
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"Overall, this was a very convenient place to stay for a weekend of deer hunting. The place was clean and had full kitchen amenities. I had trouble getting the top of lockbox back on and the upstairs was a little chilly even with the space heater. I would stay here again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a great house!!! Doug was a fantastic host! Super clean and inviting. Loved the fire pit and enough chairs for 8 people to enjoy the fire. Nice quiet town. We loved it here. Lots of 4 + star rated DG courses with 30 mins. We will definitely be back!!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little home! The house was great and quaint and just what we needed for our stay in Michigan. Doug was very helpful and responsive! Highly recommend.
2022-09-01,3,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here during CMU'S family weekend because all hotels were booked. There were 5 of us so it was nice to have us all under 1 roof for about what we would have paid at a hotel. Towels, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer and all your bathroom needs supplied. Beds were very comfortable. Kids enjoyed having their own room. right off ours while their aunt got a room all to herself."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the house!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! We stayed here for a baseball tournament in the Mt Pleasant area, and though it required some commuting, it sure beat cramming our family of 5 into a hotel room. The house is spacious and clean, and Doug was responsive throughout the stay. Small-town Vestaburg is quaint and we loved it. If our future travels take us back to the area, we'll be staying here again."
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Just finished our stay. Great little cute place. Very clean and quaint. Easy to find. Communication with Doug was great. Would highly recommend 3D‚Äôs pizza. Pizza,cheese curds and fried pickles were on point! Good location for us to stay for our sons graduation from CMU."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the back yard and to be able to relax around a nice fire. It was a perfect little place for my friends and i to stay for the weekend. The casino wasn't all that far away either. Loved that they had lots of blankets around so it felt cozy. The only thing it needs is another mirror somewhere in the house other than the bathroom and maybe some new frying pans!
We had a great time here and would for sure rent again if i needed a place to stay in that area!"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet town to stay in. Washer, dryer and fridge was SO worth it! We stayed while working Maple Fest and it was almost perfect for our needsüòÅ There's no food options late in Vestaburg so don't forget to pack food."
2022-04-01,4,Group trip,"Nice and clean, decent size yard. Just make sure to bring food and groceries with you. There aren‚Äôt many stores in the area. It‚Äôs nice and quiet there too."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"very cozy and inviting.
probably the best sleep I ever had which made me realized I need better mattress.
quiet little place and was happy to bring my dogs.
stopped at local ice cream shop before we left."
2022-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This was my first time using a Airbnb and definitely the way to travel with a big family and dog. I will be using this for now on when planning out trips. Overall this was a great stay and would recommend this location.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent space. Clean quiet and comfotsble
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Nice little house in a quiet town. Not that far from Central Michigan University and better than a hotel. Nice big kitchen. And a washer and dryer!
Even games if there are kids! Cute little backyard but it SNOWED so‚Ä¶.glad there was a shovel near the door as I did need it!
Didn‚Äôt really spend a lot of time at the house as we were involved with a wedding in Alma. But it was very convenient and will probably stay again."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and always warm during the winter. Very taken care of.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Nice house and good communication
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Doug's house in Vestaburg was a great find! My wife and I along with our 4 children had plenty of space. The kids really enjoyed having the entire upstairs to themselves. Quirky but neat house that is located in sleepy little Vestaburg. We were 25 minutes from family in Lake Isabella, 20 minutes from Mount Pleasant and it was great! Nice, quiet place just a little off the beaten path!"
2021-11-01,4,Group trip,Nice place for a family with pets to stay Beds were comfortable If coming in colder months the upstairs bedrooms are very cool so dress warm The pizza place down the street was awesome and dollar general is a mile down the road

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location. Clean and open living space. Had a great time!
2021-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"My daughter attends CMU. We stayed at Doug's place so that we could bring our dog and cook our own meals. The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The town doesn't have much to offer, not much there. But I expected that and preferred the quiet. But if you are looking for anything other than a place to stay, not sure you will find it here. The fire pit was nice and we spent the early evening around it. I can't imagine the two tree swings out back would support much weight. My only disappointment is that we couldn't get the internet working. The only reason we were disappointed was because my son was looking forward to watching a particular movie with his sister over the visit and we couldn't get it on the TVs nor our computers without the internet. Overall it was a good stay and I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a place to stay in the area. Didn't get to the ice cream shop... maybe next time."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little Gem! Will stay here again, next time we visit our kids at CMU!"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wedding in Carson City and had a hard time finding somewhere that was close to stay the night. This place was perfect location and exactly what we needed! It has a nice layout and is very clean. Although we didn‚Äôt get to use it, there is a super cute little bonfire area in the back as well. Would definitely stay again."
2021-09-01,4,Group trip,"Cute little quiet town. the fire pit was a nice option, unfortunately didn't get a chance to use it. Love that it is dog friendly. The stairs are a little steep, manageable but be careful. There was no comforters except for the one bed, however with it still being summer time I understand most get too warm. Extra blankets were available to cover up with though."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean place to stay. You wont be disappointed!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, quiet and safe place to stay. Vestaburg is very much like a ‚ÄúMayberry‚Äù town‚Ä¶I felt safe and comfortable. Even watched Amish horse and buggy stop at the hardware store while out walking one morning!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were very Satisfied with the home clean, nice open concept. Satisfied with Doug for answering our questions in a timely manner. Would recommend him highly.
Mrs Janie Rodriguez"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,If you need a place to stay near Alma or just a quiet country getaway this is it. Small town charm and the occasional Amish stopping by the hardware with horse and buggy add character. House is comfortable and relaxing with a great kitchen.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying in Vestaburg. The house was exactly what I expected after reading the description. It's about 20min from Alma & St. Louis. Quiet little town. There is a pizza place (3-Ds) about 3 blocks West and they have great subs, pizza and ice cream. I would absolutely stay there again next time we visit family."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was the perfect place for our two week vacation and celebration of life for my dad James F Gates. This house was perfect for us. Extremely clean spacious and well-stocked. We did have a few days of heat wave but the little window air conditioner did it‚Äôs job and we were so comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here instead of having to stay at a motel. The house is very close to Bass Lake, Rock lake and then Meijer biking trail. We will definitely be staying here again thank you so much Doug."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Wow definitely Recommend air BnB over a hotel. The neighborhood was cute and quite. The neighbors were very friendly. House was clean and has everything you need.
2021-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I liked that I could bring my dogs with and that there was a walking trail that I could take the dogs to that was walking distance from the house. Also liked that we could check in early.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Doug was a great host. House had a lot of space and was clean.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I definitely recommend this place if you want peace and quiet this is the place for you, you do have to drive a few miles to get to stores or fast food places so if you don‚Äôt want to do that then keep searching but this is a awesome find no doubt"

If you are in the area I highly recommend you to try Dougs place! If I‚Äôm ever in the area again I will be booking here.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,I would like to thank Micah for opening up her cabin to us. The property was beautifully rustic and the nature was very soothing.

Thank you again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful stay! We loved it!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We needed the a place to stay for a week for a competition happening at the college and this was an even greater experience than we expected. Our favorite feature is the space to be in nature while enjoying a campfire. One of the last nights there we invited some other schools to enjoy the campfire and some s‚Äômores and it was such a hit to have all the students come together and share a friendly space that allowed for community to thrive. We will miss the cabin but we will carry the memories we made there.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were in town for couple of days to celebrate a new born in our family. Place is clean and very peaceful.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This was my 1st Airbnb experience and from the first moment I decided to go with Micah's beautiful cabin I felt ""heard""! From needing to add an additional day, to it being my daughter's birthday party & her looking forward to a bonfire... there was a b-dayüéà bouquet on the table with a pk of üî• - starters & plenty of ü™µ stacked out by the fire pit! The cabin itself is on a gorgeous slice of land and the sound from the pond pump was like a babbling brook...so very peaceful! There were plenty of pillows, blankets and everything you could need, even internet if you weren't interested in unplugging. Plenty of beds and rooms to choose from, even a futon couch in the open area where the upstairs Bannister is, just inviting you to curl up and read a good book! Micah was an amazing & very responsive host and made this mammas hopes for a gr8 party easy to manage! definitely will be coming back again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay for our basketball tournament!!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Thanks

This quaint and cozy cabin will get you back to feeling like a youngin and provide quality family time where you can reconnect with conversations, family meals, board games, and great outdoor scenery with access to a pond! No television to distract you from connecting with your loved ones. My husband and I enjoyed the quiet, and our pups truly loved everything! Disconnecting from the world is sometimes all you need to reboot yourself . We will most definitelybook again! We only wish we were able to stay longer than 2 days."

It is a delightful home in a quiet neighborhood, close and convenient to Alma College and downtown Alma.

2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting Alma College, this is the place to say. Prefect location in comparison to the rest of campus/downtown: walking distance to everything without being mixed in with dormitory living. Plus the house itself is great. Perfect size for a comfortable two or a cozy three person group. Having been here twice, I imagine staying anywhere else in Alma."
