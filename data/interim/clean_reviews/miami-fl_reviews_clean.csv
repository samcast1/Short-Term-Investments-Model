2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the opportunity to stay here during a two day spell, and while we had some issues during our stay, we would confidently stay here again.
Location is great - Little Havana has so much to offer, and my wife and I felt like this place was a great access point to great food and culture‚Ä¶we even got to meet the neighborhood cat and chickens!
We had an issue with the AC, as we originally were not able to change the temperature. With a quick note to our host and a switch of some batteries, we were able to figure it out.
We also had an issue with the bathroom: the lights didn‚Äôt work, and the light fixture fell and shattered, but with a quick message to Johanna, she immediately offered to refund part of our stay.
All in all, we were provided excellent customer service, and while we had issues, Johanna made it whole and was extremely responsive throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend staying here."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose Johanna‚Äôs place because of its proximity to Little Havana. We loved the location. It was as described in the pictures and on the listing. If you like soft beds, you‚Äôll love the queen bed. The futon was a little hard and difficult to sleep on for our daughter, but we knew the second ‚Äúbed‚Äù would be like this and it is no fault of Johanna."
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is perfect for a short stay in Miami. The location is amazing, and the flat offers a lot of amenities.

We left the car in the yard and moved around by public transport, which was very easy. Johanna is a great host and 100% recommended."

The place had everything we could need, for cooking, eating, even going to the beach. The sector is close to little Havana, with supermarkets and stores just steps from Airbnb. Johana for her part is very caring and caring, great host. If I go back to Miami, I will definitely rent this airbnb again without a doubt."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joanna was very communicative and accomodating to us !
2023-09-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"-The place looked great in the pictures and had great comments which I always checked to make a decision to rent a Airbnb, However we did not like this place, when we got there the cigarette smell was awful even though on the rules it says smoking is not allowed we could barely cope with it, the host said it was the previous guests that left the place in bad conditions and with that smell, if that was really the case she should have let us know about the situation so it was our decision if we wanted to stay there still, we were never communicated that the whole place had a excessive cigarette smell.
-Place needs some painting inside.
-The shower needs some good cleaning
-There is a fence outside the place that is falling apart it makes the place feel unsafe.
Host was responsive and help us with the remote not working.
We did not have a good experience here unfortunately."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,would definitely stay here again!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I stayed at Johanna‚Äôs place for a weekend to attend a concert and explore Miami. We were a bit surprised that the AirBNB was a smaller room to the side of the main house but it was nice regardless! The place is also walking distance to Calle 8, but my sister and I took a car there because of the heat!
The place was very comfortable and homey, perfect for a weekend getaway, and the neighborhood is calm."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The landlady was very friendly and communicative.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"W location, I liked being in little Havana it was cute and cozy. Also there was good food spots in the area !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very lovely stay. The place was really cute and had stove, microwave, toaster, fridge, etc. Didn't need to use them all, but was nice to have! Close to great restaurants and downtown. Literally less than 10 minutes to most places. Would recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and cozy bnb and super close to Miami international airport. Also was in a great spot close to a lot of local restaurants and places to see. Host was very responsive and friendly. Everything is all in one room except for the bathroom.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Johanna is a very hospitable and responsive host. Place was exactly how it was described. Close proximity to Little Havana and Wynwood and about 20 mins drive to the beach. We had a great stay. Thank you for your warmth and kindness, Johanna!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect. I have nothing to say. It was just perfect üíØüíØ I would go back to this house whenever I go back to Miami
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely love this place . So cute & Cozy
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Johanna‚Äôs Place is clean and cute, and with comfortable bedding. It was perfect for an overnight stay in the Little Havana section of Miami. My wife and I selected her place in part for its proximity to Calle Ocho, and that worked out well. Walking over to the trendy restaurants and bars in the late-afternoon/early evening took just 15 minutes and felt totally safe, despite some stretches of the route being a bit run-down. Being totally new to the area and not knowing ‚Äòthe vibe‚Äô of walking off the beaten path later in the evening, we decided to play it easy and safe and opted for a $6 Uber ride back, and that worked out great."
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joana's place was very clean, exactly as described, but I had a problem that ended up disrupting my entire trip, when I arrived at night the electronic lock stopped working and as it was late, I was unable to contact the host, I ended up staying on the street, I asked for help from airbnb who asked me to provide a hotel on my own, late at dawn, when I needed to sleep because I would take the road driving for a long trip the following day. It was a very unpleasant situation, I was only able to access the space and my belongings at 7:00am."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was nice, cozy, clean and met expectations. The neighborhood is quite and felt safe. Will definitely visit again here when I come Miami again. Thanks."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was beautiful and convenient to Little Havana, the airport and shopping. Johanna was lovely and available if I needed her. Would love to stay again if I‚Äôm back in Miami!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay and enjoyed our time here. The place felt very clean and private and we were very comfortable. There were a few hiccups however, the mini fridge started leaking and then the kitchen sink faucet popped right off when water was running and got a lot of the kitchenette and floor wet. Johannna was extremely fast at responding and everything was taken care of within minutes of telling them what happened.
Overall, we had a great time. Just wished things were double checked a little more thoroughly.
Thank you so much!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at Johanna's place! A very cute and cozy little studio. Definitely would hav stayed longer if we could have.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Johanna was a wonderful host to us during our stay in Miami. She was very responsive and friendly! We stayed here for two days and explored little Havana area. This place is small but very homey, and is equipped with everything you may need for your stay. Thank you Johanna for sharing your beautiful property with us!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely stay at Johanna‚Äôs place. Short drive to the Miami Beach area and a 15 minute walk to the heart of Calle Ocho. Super comfortable bed and quiet area.
Johanna even allowed us to book in last minute as our previous Airbnb cancelled 1 hour before check in! She was so helpful and accommodating with settling us in."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Loved spending my time here, very close to Calle 8 and to the baseball stadium. Highly recommended!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this stay. It's private and cozy. It's in close proximity to downtown, the beach, and so many restaurants and shops. Great AC system as well!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Johanna is the best host that I‚Äôve ever met. She is very responsive, kind, and caring. She provides everything as mentioned in the amenities especially Starbucks coffee and beach chair üòç The bed is also super comfy and the towel is super clean. Johanna‚Äôs place is super near from the Little Havana area just around 4 mins drive and the house‚Äôs area made me feel like living in the real Havana! Will definitely come back again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great stay!The apartment is very well located and very cozy, you find everything you need to make your stay more comfortable. Johanna is a very attentive host, she has helped us at all times.
I would definitely repeat! üíñ"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Johanna was super helpful and responsive. We had all the privacy we needed and she worked around our schedule as well. The place was clean and cozy and worth the price. My husband would like to return again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Johanna is a great host and made everything she could to help us with check in, check out, instructions, etc
Place is very clean and had a lot of useful amenities.
Worth it"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would stay here again!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Johanna is a wonderful host! The bed was super comfortable and all was provided for in one humble place! We had all we needed as if we were right at home. This is in the heart of little Havana and walking distance from our favorite place in Miami, Calle Ocho!! We will definitely book here again for our next Miami trip"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The listing is as described and is a tidy, compact studio a few blocks away from Calle Ocho in Little Havana. It‚Äôs the ideal size for a solo traveler but might be a bit cramped for two (my friend stayed the second night on the futon during a two night stay on our way to a trip overseas). The unit is stocked with essentials (cutlery, linens, etc), but also thoughtful extras (aloe gel, condiments etc) which comes in handy. During our stay, we had a bit of trouble with the digital key entry and it ended up locking us out, but Johanna replied back almost instantaneously and told us how to access an emergency key box located right by the door. She was very responsive throughout the whole booking process and stay. The neighborhood is in Little Havana so we did hear some wild roosters crowing about (they‚Äôre a hallmark of the area), but we both had earplugs and this wasn‚Äôt really an issue for us. The unit is just close enough to Calle Ocho to be convenient but far enough to not be disruptive."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This studio was exactly as advertised, and fit my needs perfectly. Bed was comfy. Keurig coffee was perfecto. Parking space was very valuable as spaces on the street would have been hard to come by. It‚Äôs a short walk from here to Little Havana, and that was a wonderful outing. And it‚Äôs not too far to Bayfront area (but farther than a walk). There was a problem at one point with the electronic lock on the door, but the host took care of it while I was away."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was perfect!! It was clean and very nicely (modern) decorated and had everything you would need and more. Would definitely recommend. Also Johanna was very helpful/welcoming throughout my check in when I mentioned I would be staying for a few days of my recovery. Nothing but great feedback!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time staying with Johanna and it was just as great as the first time. She was very responsive and got back to me right away with any concerns I had, which weren‚Äôt many haha. The space is comfortable and has everything you‚Äôll need as a home base. About a 15 min walk from the colorful and lively Calle Ocho and a swift 15 min drive to Miami Beach!
I would recommend staying with Johanna if you‚Äôre visiting Miami!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay for 2 people! Johanna is very friendly and very responsive! Would recommend and come back!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Johanna was very pleasant and responsive! The place was perfect for what I needed! Shower water started to come out cold after the second day and the bathroom could be cleaned a little more but overall it was a perfect place for the weekend!!!

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good location.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay in the very clean home with a central location, well equipped and Johanna responded to all our pre-trip inquiries. The only details we found is that in the photos it seemed to be more spacious and the futon was a little hard, but it's still a great choice to stay in Miami!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for your attention and for this stay.
The place is the same as in the photos, it is cozy, it is super central to everything touristy, it is a walkable distance from restaurants and supermarkets. Also super close to the airport The uber, I'll charge us 15usd
Although we do not need it also allowed us to be flexible with check-out time.
The place is very well equipped, it has towels, soap, even chairs and umbrellas to take to the beach. Very complete.
The area is super safe and quiet.
Definitely if I go back to Miami I will stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely studio a few minutes walk from Calle Ocho. Good location. Air conditioner/heater worked well, which I‚Äôm grateful for."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Her recommendations made our entire trip!! She responds in a very timely manner (we had an issue with the batteries being out of the padlock and she had someone there in minutes).

All the amenities of home, clean, private and in a fantastic location.
Bed was very comfortable. And cute little touches here and there. Close to all the shopping and restaurants, easy to get in and out of. The keypad was a little tricky at first for the door but easy and convenient to use. Glad not to have to keep track of a key or card!
As to the comments about the neighborhood...I traveled with my adult niece. We found the neighborhood is so cute, and quiet. We had no issues at all with anyone and never felt like we were unsafe being there. We were out in the early morning, and late in the evening.
I would stay here again without hesitation and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area."

Bed is comfortable bed and so is a sofa bed. Soft, clean towels and linens.
The location is ideal. Look for Calle Ocho walking, it doesn't take any time. Neighborhood with atmosphere and all services nearby: restaurants, supermarkets, points to see. The airport is 14 euros Uber and South Beach is about $18 Uber ride.
If I go back to Miami I will repeat location and house. Recommended."

Johanna is super communicative and makes you feel right at home. I‚Äôd just be ware for the light sleepers, since it‚Äôs relatively close to airport so you do get airplanes, and there‚Äôs a window near the bed that light peaks through. Otherwise a phenomenal stay would highly recommend."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for 1.5 months and can say this is one of the best Airbnb experiences I‚Äôve had.
Hostess - The hostess is amazing. She always responded very quickly and went out of her way to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I needed.
Location - It‚Äôs a 5 minute walk from the exciting Calle Ocho and a 10 minute drive from Brickell City Centre. 15 minute drive to South Beach and Wynwood. It‚Äôs close to everything. Also about 15 minutes to the nearest beach and the Miami airport.
Safety - the neighborhood is very quiet and I felt safe walking around solo both day and night. I even had some mail delivered there with no issues. You may hear some roosters though!
Studio - The place was very clean, comfortable, and overall practical. I was even able to extend the table to fit my 3 computers so I could work remotely.
This is the best bang for buck spot you‚Äôll get!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Johanna's place was great!! The bed and the pillows made for a great night sleep. The decor of the place was super cute and it kept with the theme of little Havana very nicely. There were some welcome snacks available to us when we arrived and the AC unit was definitely a great touch. The only concern was the size of the bathroom. It was manageable but if you're a big guy you could run into some trouble! My husband and I would definitely stay here again!

2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is cute but floors where real dirty, there was dust, old dirty socks under the bed, old 2 liter bottle under the couch. Had to sweep and mop when I got there. Do not wear white socks cause you will them see how the floors need to be steam cleaned, your socks will be black.
There is a small sitting area you can‚Äôt enjoy cause the entire fence is falling apart with nails sticking out and 2x 4 holding it up. Very unsafe.
But overall it‚Äôs a cute place just some small things that need to be fixed and corrected."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the spot for a couple in Miami, especially for the price, the place is cozy, it's very organized and of course very clean, majority of cool places to visit in Miami are as close as 10 to 13 min away the farther it would take you to go is 15 mins.
Johanna will set up everything for you so you can have a very pleasant stay, she's awesome."

Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to stay in the best Airbnb in the heart of Miami City."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"1 hotel is always a first choice of mine. Place is as pictured, neat, clean and everything needed is there. Dishes were not the cleanest, but not a deal breaker. Just a quick rinse was needed, otherwise dishes are available for you to use so no complaint.
1 hotel is the perfect stay, everything is very convenient and a great place to unwind"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Amenities were beautiful

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, beautiful location, highly recommended"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at a luxury property for much less than a hotel room would be. The condo was extremely clean, and exactly as described/pictured. The bed was very comfortable and there were tons of extra pillows and towels, plus plenty of dishes/kitchen ware, etc. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was very convenient (although the dryer took a many cycles to actually dry the clothes, so don‚Äôt wash anything right before leaving!). The private furnished balcony really set this unit apart from other similar Airbnbs in this neighborhood, and the view was really awesome. You will have to restock coffee pods/TP etc if you‚Äôre staying more than a couple days, but there is a 24-hour Walgreens right across the street.
Very smooth check-in and check-out process, very communicative host, and you really do get full access to the entire resort (all the pools and the beach amenities). It was pricey, but we definitely don‚Äôt regret it!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay at this cozy apartment near North Miami Beach. The location was fantastic, just a short walk from the beach and surrounded by a great area.
While I appreciated the helpfulness of the concierge, I did feel their presence more than I expected, which detracted a bit from the privacy I usually enjoy with Airbnb stays. Additionally, there were minor issues with some dark spots in the bathroom tile grout.
Overall, it was a delightful retreat, perfect for a relaxing beach vacation. I'd consider returning in the future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing hosts, very attentive and responsive to any issues. Unit and area was great, beautiful views! Will be back for sure üëç"

5min walk to the beach
Easy check in process
Responsive host
CONS
Terrible WIFI service
TV turning off/on (probably bc wifi)
Difficult to find parking in evenings
Bed extremely uncomfortable (mattress too soft & can feel the springs, paper thin sheets, stained comforter)
Zero amenities and overall feels more like a motel than beach airbnb
Disappointing stay for the $$$"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is exactly like it looks in the pictures.
I know the area and is great for walk, bike, go running, beach and eat. The building is really nice and is quiet, something that I look for. You have the beach at just 3 blocks!
Ernesto and Mauricio make a more pleasant time as they are great hosts! Always checking in how we were.
I definitely recommend it, and I will comeback soon!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a great place to stay with access to a lot of things. The room got a little warm due to the thinner windows. The temperatures normalized as the sun went down.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for small groups of people. Good location
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is definitely a better alternative to hotel staying.

For the price and location, I will definitely be returning. Thanks for everything!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice choice for all things
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was in a really lovely, quiet location and so close to the beach. They were very accommodating and allowed us to drop off our luggage early and leave it with them while waiting for our flight. They also offered a late check out which was great. Room was comfortable - comfortable temperature - nice large tvs - just a cute stay with some nice stylish touches. The only thing to make it absolutely perfect would be to have someone on site at all times but truly not a complaint and just a suggestion! Additionally - they left beach chairs for us in our room upon arrival which was super generous. Overall great stay and worth the price. Would stay here again.
It is also quite close to Cafe Sazon which we were obsessed with. Walk here if you can before hitting the beach!
If you‚Äôre looking for a relaxed beach stay where you can grab food and drinks and sit at the beach in peace and quiet this is the place. Thank you for a great stay!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I had a great stay at the apartment. I was primarily in the. states to do some shopping so I could order a lot of things online and everything arrived. One package arrived late and I could coordinate even days after to get the package forwarded to me!
Besides that the area is very nice, a couple of minutes walking and you are at the beach. There are nice bars and restaurants nearby. Grocery stores are also very close."

A couple of minutes away from a free trolley that takes you all the way down to South Beach too! The studio itself is very cute inside and is just enough space you need for 2 or 3 people. Recommend üëçüèª"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the perfect few days here! There‚Äôs tons of great food and the beach all within a 5-10 minute walk, and we appreciated the convenience of the location more than anything. If you‚Äôre looking for a more lowkey Miami Beach visit this area will have everything you need."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place! responsive host!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I really enjoyed our stay! The location is perfect and the hosts are very communicative. The beach and bandshell are walking distance, and Sazon is an incredible nearby restaurant/ventanita. The area and complex are generally quiet, although staying on the first floor meant some noise from upstairs.
We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an excellent stay at the place! It was in a great location, just a short walking distance from the beach and restaurants.

From there everything is excellent, very good!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend!! The place was clean and incredibly conveniently located. Beach was ~5 mins walking distance. Restaurants and cafes located closer than that. Communication with host was super easy!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was lovely overall, Ernesto the manager is very helpful and the communication was great. The building was noisy, neighbors/other tenants were very rowdy, and the fire alarm went off at 8am Friday morning and while I know that was out of the control of the host it was still bothersome. I don‚Äôt believe it was worth the price I paid for it per night, kitchen was lacking a few things that would have been useful (like dish soap, a cutting board, and a basic of salt & pepper would have been nice). But overall, it was a good stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ernesto went above and beyond! He was super nice and checked on us to make sure everything was going perfectly. We will definitely stay again at his property! ¬°Mil gracias, Ernesto!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, 5 minutes walk to the beach, and within driving distance to all the best things to do in Miami.
Very responsive hosts, clean and spacious.
Free street parking was available however most evenings was always difficult to find a space, some nights waiting 30 minutes to get parked, but still free, and made rental car a no brainer!
Would stay again if visiting the area again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy to get into the Airbnb with the door keypad. Had the necessities. Very close to a nice beach.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing place if you look for something peaceful in Miami Beach but at the same time not far from everything.
The location is very convenient - the beach is just two blocks away, very clean beach and water, plenty of space, very nice boardwalk, volleyball terrains on the beach. All the amenities are also very close - many stores , restaurants, coffee shops etc. There is trolley stop that could be used to go to the South Beach. For those with car - the nearby street parking is free, but on first come first serve basis, so on weekends the spots are almost always occupied, but on weekdays - there is no issue to park. In any case -quite nearby there is a huge outdoor municipal parking lot that does not cost a lot and sometimes is free.
The apartment itself if very clean and convenient. We had two rooms, with the one which is purely for sleeping and another as a hybrid bedroom/living room. Bathroom is convenient as well and air conditioning is powerful and not noisy. I recommend"

The room was clean ."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Satisfactory.
Bad mattress, causes back pain.
There is no change of towels, which I think is inadmissible for 8 days. For the price paid, very little delivery. There is no courtesy of coffee or tea at the accommodation.
Parking as listed, and Free ( if you find vacant!!!)
They should put this on the ad.
The host, very polite and helpful, note 10.
Improve the quality of the towels and change of mattresses."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"host was very nice and responsive, made sure we felt right at home. location is great everything is at walking distance. would stay again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location. Very clean. Basic but all that is needed. Ernesto was super helpful and responsive.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Parking might be hard to find sometimes but it is totally worth it.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place a cute stay for my fianc√© and I! It was 3-4 blocks from the beach which was awesome! However, the space would be a bit tight for more than 2 people. It also was very loud at night. You could easily hear the neighbors.
The air bnb photos were not very accurate. The air bnb I thought we booked had a separate room with a bed in it; however, the space we got had the bed right as you walked into the front door. No separation from the kitchen and the bed room. Very limited utensils/kitchen supplies in the unit though. Could use a scissors, useable knives, garbage bags, more towels, etc.
Overall, made a great little stay for a couple nights though! The space was nice, clean, and cute!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"the place is great, minutes walk to breakfast, shops and the beach. It is more North than South Beach, which was better for us, given that South Beach is mayhem during Spring Week."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly customer service & cute little bnb!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pros:
- The area was very safe and quiet
- Walking distance to plenty of food and to the beach
- Two TVs in the AirBnB
- Bed was comfy and air conditioning worked well
- The host is super friendly, nice and communicates well. He is near the property if you ever need anything
Cons:
- Parking is awful, you need to get lucky to get parking (or there is a parking lot about a block away but you‚Äôll need to pay like $5 to park car overnight)
- The host will charge $15 for extra towels
Overall:
This a nice place to stay, especially for the price. Parking and the extra towels fee are annoying but the AirBnB is still a nice place to stay, especially if you‚Äôre downing most of your time on the beach or out exploring and just need a place to sleep for the night."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We found this place a good value and convenient to lots of things including the beach. Parking is plentiful in the day time but you may need to park in a lot nearby after 8 - it is free. we stayed in Unit 10 which was in the back near the cleaning area and trash can are located behind and a little noisy on trash day - might be other units that have a better location - Ernesto was very attentive and friendly. we liked that it had two different codes for security.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, sweet little space. Clean, fresh, nice detail."

We had absolutely no complaints as the place was exactly what we were hoping for! This was our first time in Miami and the location of our place was perfect! Less than a 5 minute walk to the beach, lots of amazing restaurants around, tennis courts across the street, and overall a very safe family friendly environment. The place felt very secure and it was always peaceful. We will definitely return!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love this place, we definitely need to go back, it was a 6 minute walk from the beach"

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at the apartment for 3 nights. It was cozy, quite small. Had everything you need for a short stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was like the photos. Area very quiet for Miami Beach, and yet with many nearby restaurants and about 7 min walk to the beach. Self check-in possible. Parking is effectively free in front of the house, we never had to walk more than a minute (first come first serve).
And all this at a very reasonable price for Miami Beach! We would definitely rent again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tip for parking because it can be very hard to find a spot in the evenings- there is a large public parking lot near the tennis courts that is walkable distance back to the Airbnb! It is paid parking but only a few bucks.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment was comfortable for the three people, well located, easily accessible and in a very quiet area, the description of the publication fits perfectly with the depto."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had high expectations after seeing all the five-star reviews, but was left a bit disappointed. The room was much smaller than I thought it would be and it didn‚Äôt feel very private either as people would frequently walk past our biggest window which was directly next to the bed. We sunk into the bed and I had to make my own pillow by folding up a blanket because the pillows were extremely over-the-top fluffy. For whatever reason my partner did not get even one good night‚Äôs sleep.
The owner approached us several times and though he seemed nice it was clear that his English wasn‚Äôt very good and so we were hesitant to share this information anticipating that it likely wouldn‚Äôt be understood. Thank you for the effort, but all in all this felt like staying in an expensive hostel."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here. Will for sure be coming back!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive & well maintained property
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is just like in the pictures. The location is very good. The host and the team who served us have always been very helpful, helpful, polite, and responsive. What's worth the additional attention: (1) the parking lot is on the street (public) and if you arrive after 10:30 pm it's very complicated and difficult to find spots. (2) depending on your neighbor next door or above, if the neighbor speaks loudly or stepping/walking hard you hear the noises or voices. (3) the bathroom box only partially covers the shower area and gets the area (outside the box) very wet after the shower."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It looks just like the pictures! Easy to find and the description was on point. We booked the reservation last minute and the host was super helpful and very responsive. I would recommend to anyone on the fence about staying here.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,everything what's excellent for the price; especially in that area. the only thing that was missing was an oven and there was a hot plate only. in addition there was no dish drying rack or dish towels for when I needed to wash them. there was also no broom and mop but when I asked for them the manager promptly ask the cleaning staff to provide them. Ernesto was an outstanding host and highly responsive. if there's an issue he takes care of it right away. I wish all hosts were like that. definitely give him five stars.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, very close to the beach and places to eat and shop. It is a quiet, very clean apartment with everything you need to spend a short season. It's easy to move from this point to other places of interest. The parking lot is public and in case you can't find a place there is a public parking lot very close where you can leave the car."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great host! (Ernesto was a rockstar!). I loved the location, very quiet, easy to walk for great breakfast and lunch options. Street parking was not too difficult to find and was free. Bed was comfortable, apartment had all you need for a nice stay. Unfortunately I had a very large person staying above me who was always walking around the apartment during all hours of the day and night. I could hear every footstep. But other than that I have no complaints and really felt welcomed by Ernesto. I will return again soon!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,There's only one problem: the building is very noisy and doesn't get along well with its neighbors. Especially when you're on the ground floor.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maybe the best airbnb host I‚Äôve ever stayed with. Everything was as pictured and the place was spotless. Situated 2 blocks off of Collins in a quiet residential area, it was quiet and peaceful yet close to all of the action. Great restaurants, bars, and a beautiful beach within walking distance. Cachito Coffee and Bakery, Burgers and Shakes, and El Grande Rancho were my favorites nearby. 15-20 min Uber to South Beach, Brickell, etc.
The best part about this booking was meeting the property manager Mr. Ernesto. He was kind and very polite and made us feel safe and welcomed. We will definitely book again on our next trip to Miami Beach!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed staying here! Ernesto was very proactive in communicating with us the day before and after check-in, and was so very friendly and helpful! The place was in a very quiet neighborhood and close to lots of great restaurants and only 2 blocks to the beach. We spent the week walking and biking to mid-beach and to south beach from this location with no problems at all. We had our coffee and breakfast at Sazon and the Argentine bakery across the street daily, and had several of our dinners within walking distance as well. This really was the perfect location for us, and we would highly recommend. The unit was clean, with plenty of supplies. The bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed. The unit was behind a security gate in the courtyard which made us feel extra secure. Thank you so much to our host Ernesto, we will be back for sure!"

I would highly recommend for a weekend getaway and good for a group of friends. The location was very close to the Brickell which has many restaurants and bars. It is also within walking distance of Bayfront Park and the Arena."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Miami! Max was super responsive and handled any need I had during my stay. The condo is spotless, comfy and mirrors the pictures. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide a spectacular view and abundant natural light. Check-in and parking details are concise and require several steps to officially check-in. There‚Äôs an active construction site right next to the building that you can see and hear from the condo. Work begins early in the morning (before 7 am) through the evening. The noise didn‚Äôt bother my family, but it does obstruct the views and can impact the ‚Äúvibes‚Äù of your stay and sleep. The area is walkable, with various places to eat and socialize. Miami Beach and Wynwood are 30-40 minutes away. There‚Äôs a tasty vegan restaurant across the street (in the Connect Four building) that‚Äôs open late called The Cocinita. Overall, it was a wonderful and worthwhile stay! Go ahead and book it!"

Also, it‚Äôs very easy to catch Ubers from this location and there were so many amazing restaurants in walking distance. 10/10 stay and host."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great appartment located in one of the best areas in miami, Brickell. Its a beautifully renovated apartment, importan to take into account that there is only two bedrooms and the main room is open (loft style) so you have to take into account there is not much privacy on this one. Even thought it has great spaces and with this location its worth repeating."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing time in Miami thanks to Max and his beautiful, centrally located home in Brickell. Max was incredibly responsive, and ensured my group of friends was safe, and had plenty of amenities and recommendations to choose from. The apartment itself is sizable. For each person to have their own bed, the max would be 4, but we were 5 and slept comfortably. One thing I will say is that there is a bit of construction that makes it noisy outside, but that can easily be solved with some earplugs.
A huge plus is that we were just a short drive to Miami Beach, and to all the major hot spots.
All in all, we had the best time, much in part due to Max and all of his help!"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely cottage just a few minutes‚Äô walk from the heart of Coconut Grove - a quick walk to shops, restaurants, historic markers, and the waterfront.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were delighted with our stay. The location is outstanding, within walking distance of restaurants, merchandise shopping and even grocery shopping. Carlos's place was wonderful. Clean, light, safe. Smartly designed. This was our first-ever stay in an airbnb, so we needed a little extra ""hand-holding"" at check-in time, and Carlos was amazingly responsive in answering our questions."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Fabulous, safe, clean spot in the heart of the grove! We loved everything about Carlos‚Äô place and can‚Äôt wait to be back! We loved the security of the gate and how each spot has parking. I wouldn‚Äôt change anything about this place!! Highly recommend! We stayed here for 10 days and didn‚Äôt want to leave!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay! The cottage was very clean and well-equipped and we loved the location. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring Coconut Grove and walked to different restaurants each evening. I cannot speak highly enough of Carlos and Kaz. They were incredibly responsive and helpful every step of the way, from allowing us to arrange an early check-in to immediately fixing a slight plumbing issue. Everything was exactly as pictured on their website and I highly recommend staying in this lovely cottage."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Carlos was kind and responsive. pictures matched the place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described in the listing. Very nice place in a good location. Easy in/out & parking. Road/car noise is noticeable at night.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had another great stay in one of the cottages! The recent upgrades have made check-in even more convenient. The rental was clean and comfortable with it‚Äôs own parking. I love the location for walking to restaurants and entertainment.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Carlos‚Äôs Private cottage in Coconut Grove. It was amazing. Super Close to many great restaurants and shops. 25 minutes to South Beach. Highly recommend visiting the Vizcaya Gardens and Mansion, 6 minutes away. The place is bigger than expected and was very roomy and the AC and Hot-water were excellent. Can‚Äôt wait to comeback next year."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirBnB was in a secure and private location which made us feel safe and at ease. We used Uber Eats quite a bit and it was easy for them to find the place. Hot tip: make sure your Uber drivers pick you up on Frow, not McDonald :)
The layout and decor of the space was great, the bed was very comfortable and cozy (great pillows). The shower was awesome though the bathroom can get steamy as there is no vent and windows don't open (it's a Florida thing, to avoid mold growth in the HVAC). The AC worked perfectly. We loved having a free washer/dryer because we could go home with clean clothes (tip: bring your own detergent pods or plan to buy a bag at the CVS, a five minute walk from the AirBnB).
Small suggestions: include ground coffee/coffee filters for the coffee machine & provide at least salt and pepper and hot sauce. On the other hand, this very sweet host provided eggs, milk, cereal, and a couple canned Starbucks!! Would DEFINITELY stay here again if in Miami!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay! The location is perfect - tons of restaurants, bars, and shops in walking distance (the Grove has changed a lot since I grew up but I welcome a lot of the new additions). We were grateful that the Airbnb was gated with a parking spot, and we were pleasantly surprised how quiet the nights were despite how close we were to the heart of the Grove. Carlos and his assistants were extremely responsive and proactive at offering services such as RoomBox (we didn‚Äôt take advantage of what they had to offer but it was nice to have the option). Also, it was awesome to have access to a washer/dryer as well. We would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carlos and his assistant were attentive and helpful. The place was perfect for our stay. We enjoyed long walks and the accessibility to great restaurants and shopping. We would definitely rent from Carlos again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Carlos was a wonderful host and this location was perfect for my trip. So many options of things to do and a vast array of restaurants near by. The place is gated which felt private and cozy. It‚Äôs beautifully decorated and very clean. Bed was comfortable and I appreciated the washer and dryer. I‚Äôd love to come back and stay again. Highly recommend!

Individual parking space. Double entrance to single unit villa. Would recommend anyone stay here‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll enjoy it. Very clean. Enjoyed walking to food and night life."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is wonderful!! Recently, I have been reluctant to use Airbnbs because you just never know what you are going to get. Especially with regards to cleanliness. But this place was immaculate. It was super clean and the nice way they have it decorated makes it feel fresh and like you are staying in a high end hotel. The location is also awesome. We really enjoyed being able to just walk into town, especially as parking is such a pain in Coconut Grove. I emailed to ask a question and the hosts replied right away. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great! Very clean, private, and allowed us easy access by car to everything we wanted to do in Miami!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heavenly stay! Beautiful modern bungalow, part of a fourplex of detached cottages. Comfortable, safe, quiet, private, very clean and thoroughly appointed. Perfect for couples. Ideally located within Coconut Grove. Easy access, off-street parking. A lovely two-block stroll from the heart of the downtown. Rapidly responsive, completely unobtrusive host. This is kind of place where you cry a little on the morning of your departure. Thank you, Carlos."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Pretty spot a walk away from everything.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Carlos‚Äôs place! The location is unbeatable‚Ä¶so close to tons of great shops and restaurants but also quiet and secluded. Carlos and his team were very responsive, helpful, and friendly. Looking forward to staying here again in the future!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The place was as we expected it to be - nice, clean, comfortable, good location. We arrived in Miami early in the morning and I think 4pm is very late to check-in, so we went to the Biltmore for a night. Carlos did try to arrange an earlier check-in, but we were already at the hotel by then. I also think the policy of no unregistered guests extremely draconian, not even a friend is allowed to drop by for coffee, hmmm. But overall I would recommend this place to others, if they do not mind the isolation."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Carlos and team were super responsive and the apartment was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very cozy and comfortable. It‚Äôs located in a great area, close to restaurants and shops but still on a very peaceful street so it‚Äôs very easy to rest.

I totally recommend this Airbnb."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay here - great location and the space was comfortable. Carlos was helpful and communicative.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Having an enclosed gated quad of other friendly guests was comfortable. Communication with Carlos asking for any needs that could be met was frequent and positively met. Two TV's in close proximity with two controls was a bit of a trick to control and finding desired stations was not easy. A single bowl kitchen sink made it hard to wash dishes. Every room area was very clean and fresh.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Airbnb is in the coconut grove, minutes away from coco walk and short drive to key Biscayne. We enjoyed our stay."

I Highly recommend it.
Just minutes walk to good restaurants but nice and private away from the hustle and bustle.

Privat parking and gated property provides a safe environment.
The cottage was well furnished and clean."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location near shops and restaurants while in a private enclave. Second time staying here and it always is a pleasure. We rented two places side by side which was so convenient. Easy parking, clean and all the amenities you need. Host was so communicative and helpful too. Thank you for a wonderful stay in the Grove!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is with out a shaodw of a doubt the best airbnb i have ever stayed in. Being in Miami you expect the best and the whole team here went above and beyond to make sure my needs were met. I dont want to spoil too but I will share the owners were proactive in checking in to see if i needed anything. It turned out i needed washing detergent and they had a afresh bottle deleivered for free. There was everything you would expect in the home flincluding blender which was excellent.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely house! Super clean and white, with great A/C & kitchen supplies, and great internet connectivity for remote workers.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay. The place is renovated beautifully and the backyard is gorgeous, the butterflies were a nice touch. Richard and Jose were very responsive and happy to help. Note that 1 bedroom is separated from the main house (still on the property) - it even has its own kitchen so great for privacy. Beds were very comfy and the bidet was the cherry on top."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. The garden and the pool were the highlights.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great little place for a family trip!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host was very responsive to our needs and quick to respond to questions. The house was pristine and tidy with all the essential amenities. The back patio was gorgeous, and the pool was kept clean despite recent storms. The house sits in a quiet neighborhood, which was perfect for our family trip that included an infant. The location entailed some driving to get places, but that was not a problem for us."

The common areas were clean and well-appointed. We had one question about how to turn something on and Richard popped right over and helped my parents figure it out.

Thanks again, Ricky, for making our stay truly memorable!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place and amazing host. We had a small hiccup during our stay which was out of the host's control but Richard and Jose went above and beyond to take care of it. Book without any hesitation!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved walking into a very clean home that smelled wonderful . We totally enjoyed our stay at this Airbnb and would recommend. We would have definitely gave it 5+ stars but the third bedroom was separated from home which was a tad inconvenient. It was nice with its own bathroom and kitchenette.
Also the other two bedrooms were really, really nice but need tvs. An easy minor up.
Overall, we will definitely keep it on our radar for a return visit."

The location is close to almost everything no more than 18- 27 minutes out for night life Miami Beach/Downtown/Biscayne area, very spacious open and CLEAN which was very important to us I have OCD and I felt like I could relax here also adding it smells so fresh and clean as soon as you walk in, I appreciate the eye for design on this house the interior decor including the external was so beautiful yet not too much going on it truly felt like an oasis. Host was very accommodating and extremely prompt with response, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience! There are some lizards around but it‚Äôs Florida so it is expected and they do not bother you. I recommend booking, it is absolutely worth it & I look forward to booking with Ricky and Jose again!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really fun place. Very private back yard with lovely pool, beautiful plantings, gorgeous palms over part of the pool to give some shade, fun deck area with a large covered area for sun protection. Really functional interior. We ended up not using the separate suite that has its own entrance because just didn‚Äôt work for our family with three kids under age 7, but it would be a very good set up for other parties surely. Location is great for getting around to all parts of Miami. Most everything you care to see or do is no more than 20-25 min drive. An absolutely great place to stay while in Miami. Thank you, Ricky!"

The rooms were well equipped and there were plenty of towels. We will definitely stay here again next visit."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is very clean and the beds are very comfortable. There are 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom inside the house and to one side is the third room with its own bathroom however access to this space is on one side of the house, it is a mini independent apartment, eye: to take into account especially if you go with children and want a third bedroom. The pool with very nice temperature and the very nice garden, however you must have a car to get to the tourist areas of Miami. Bring mosquito and bug repellent as there are a lot of bugs around the big garden. Check-in and check-out time is very strict, there is no early check-in, no late check-out. For the price it's a nice house."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was our good fortune to have chosen this property for our family spring break vacation. The property itself was as advertised: Modern, clean, with a tropical atmosphere and close to all amenities (shopping, beaches, activities and attractions).

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and relaxing! Incredible backyard and a lovely home. We had a terrific time and Ricky was very helpful and responsive when an issue arose. Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Richard and Jose were just perfect from beginning to end. So accommodating. Such a beautiful spot that they have. Would definitely go back.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ricky and Jose‚Äôs place was awesome. We spent most of our time in the lovely oasis in the beautiful spacious backyard with swimming, parrot watching, and in total relaxation mode. The modern house was nicely decorated, and we especially loved the comfy beds and black out shades. We were very central and 20 minutes or less from South Beach, Bal Harbor, Wynwood and more. We took our kids to the seaquarium, found a great little Korean restaurant near by as well as amazing Italian at Osteria. Ricky was very responsive, kind and accommodating. We hope to be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, well-cut and furnished home with a nice pool and beautiful, lovingly landscaped garden. Ricky is a great and helpful host, everything worked out wonderfully and we will definitely be back! Our first choice in Miami!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, like staying in your own tropical jungle. Accessible to everything north and south in the greater Miami area. The hosts were fantastic and easy to reach."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really, overall the house and hosts were great. We especially enjoyed the pool and backyard and quiet street. Pool was my highlight.
Our challenge was we didn‚Äôt realize that the two main bedrooms would be so small. Pretty & comfortable but no room to hang in.
The description was not misleading but we assumed there would be a way to watch in bed like our previous rentals. So if u wanna chill and watch you would need to go to the main room and sit on the pink arm chairs or on the blue couch.
This house is best for teens and couples.
Not ideal for children. No bedroom space for a crib and no bathtub.
The 3rd bedroom (suite) is not attached to main house. Different entrance‚Ä¶ so again works for teens or a couple, but not safe for children.
Summary, if you don‚Äôt watch in bed, and if you don‚Äôt use a tub, and are happy to hang out in main room, this house is perfect!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is one of our favorites in the Miami area. Our second stay here was better than our first and our first visit was perfect. I look forward to booking for a third time in the near future. Everything is better than advertised. We loved it.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful stay at this oasis. I cannot say enough about the backyard. It is truly a paradise. We saw beautiful birds, the pool was nice and warm, and the hammock was so peaceful looking up at all the coconut trees! It was also nice for my husband and I to have a private suite with the rest of the family next door. We loved our stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tanglewood is a magical oasis in the Magic City. location gives access to all things Miami in a short car ride. the gsrden and pool is a place to decompress and enjoy a natural setting in a super comfortable home. we loved our stay immensely! thank you - we'll be back
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely hosts. The home was spotless and exactly as photographed. Internet worked perfect. Backyard was bliss. Highly recommend! Thanks for hosting us!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was truly a beautiful home! I really enjoyed my stay and the host was sooo awesome with communication. I will most def be staying at this home again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Absolutely gorgeous and great location. The pictures don‚Äôt even do it justice. Host was very responsive. Allowed us to check in early which we really appreciated. Would highly recommend and would return.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean house with an amazing pool! The bird sanctuary was beautiful! Seeing a flock of green parrots while swimming in the pool was epic, and the hosts were really accommodating! Def recommend!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Unfortunately we arrived just when Hurricane Ian made landfall and this caused issues that required maintenance to the property that could not be fixed with us staying there. However we had three amazing days in this place. Beautiful backyard with parrots and butterflies. Enjoyed the salt water pool and charcoal barbecue every day. The house it self was very modern and well equipped. Richard and Jose did an amazing job to make us feel welcome and did everything they could to sort out the situation described above.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything about our stay here was a total delight. We were looking for a nice pool setup and this exceeded the expectations from the photos. The pool is wonderful with a great sun shelf and the yard is beautifully landscaped with gorgeous palms and flowers everywhere. With the large covered back patio we were able to to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful landscaping even during the occasional rain shower. The home is beautiful and elegant and the beds were incredibly comfy. The hosts responded to questions immediately and went out of the way to make sure we knew where everything was and had what we needed. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful but we got ubers into downtown Miami easily and it was just a quick ride. We will absolutely be returning!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place. Truly feels like a home away from home. Plants amazing. Bedding and mattresses/pillows are so comfortable. Kitchen is flawless. I spent my mornings with coffee and the sun by the pool.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are thinking of doing a Air Bnb in Miami this has to be the choice. The host was amazing , actually arrived a little to early and he dropped me and a friend off down the street at a great local lunch spot .
Not something alot of people would do . The house is exactly as pictured . We loved the pool , the nature surrounding it and the location. You are in prime location to all the great areas in and around Miami . I know i will be returning , just a matter of when ! Thanks for everything ! 10 out of 10 !"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent hosts. Fast communication and good location
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home. The backyard is an oasis. I enjoyed my stay for my girlfriends birthday. This house is a must stay at least once. Host are very accommodating. I had an issue with the Wi-Fi the host came and fixed it and didn‚Äôt make me feel like it was an issue at all. Huge plus.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing host do everything to make your stay comfortable. the Airbnb itself was spectacular clean roomy quiet beautiful pool amazing yard and a short drive from everything will definitely book again very happy with this Airbnb I wish I could give it a higher rating than five stars
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed here for a girls trip (5 of us) and had an absolute blast!! The house is beautiful, clean, and well stocked and the whole outside space is AMAZING! Exactly as pictured. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was beautiful!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay and plan to rebook the first chance we get! Very quiet, clean, and refreshing! The hosts, specifically Ricky was very communicative and friendly. We definitely recommend the Tangleleaf to 10/10."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was awesome! House is exactly like the pictures. The backyard was my favorite part of the house pool was warm and swinging on the hammocks watching the sunset was definitely a vibe! i‚Äôll be staying here again the next time i travel too miami.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This property was AMAZING and everything we hoped it would be. The back yard was the perfect setting for relaxing and spending time with the family! Definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Miami area!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"If I could give property 10 stars, I would! This property represents EVERYTHING Miami. I am in awe how beautiful and peaceful this property was. There was so much life in this property, from beautiful plants, butterflies, parrots, we even got to see an iguana passing through. Tall palm trees and coconut trees... this was far beyond my expectation. This property was top 3 of all my experiences with AirBnB.
The hosts were AMAZING!! Very considerate, communication was top tier and nothing but kind from start to finish. Anytime I visit Miami the future, fingers will be crossed that this property is available.
Do I recommend a stay here? The answer is YOU HAVEN'T LIVED UNTIL YOU STAY HERE!!
HUGE THANKS TO THE HOSTS ü•∞"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home has a wonderful pool and backyard full of tropical trees, plenty of birds and lizards to entertain the kids! The neighborhood is quiet and communication was great."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,I loved the home me and my friends enjoyed every minute of our stay . The back yard was lovely . We almost stayed in the pool the entire trip. Be ware of ants on the counter top don‚Äôt put anything on the counter.
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Truly a tropical getaway! Looked exactly like the pictures, with plenty of room and an amazing backyard. If you‚Äôre on the fence, definitely choose this one, you won‚Äôt regret it."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is my 2nd time back here! The house is lovely. The heated pool is the star, although the large living / dining area is great too. Bathrooms are very well updated and clean. Kitchen is large / spacious. Location is very central !
We would def come back for a longer stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time here for a girls trip! The house is beautiful with an AMAZING outdoor area‚Äîit felt like an oasis. The house is well stocked and so comfortable. The street is nice and quiet too, it‚Äôs really a peaceful spot. It is about 30/40 mins away from downtown Miami/South Beach so keep that in mind but the Ubers back and forth weren‚Äôt bad at all. Had an awesome experience!!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the best time at Richard & Jose‚Äôs place. It was the perfect space for our 2 families to relax. Every inch of their home was well thought out and we thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor space and pool. They were very responsive and really went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable. Would highly recommend booking with them, I know we will be!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was PERFECT!!! Everything was clean, the beds were so comfortable, and the backyard was a dream! We seriously couldn‚Äôt stay out of the heated pool, it was perfect. I think our favorite part was the butterflies, and the entire backyard smelled of honeysuckle. Seriously, the landscaping is so thoughtful and really made the backyard so tranquil. Would definitely stay again!!!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house with a beautiful backyard. Nice quiet neighborhood in a central location. Definitely recommend!
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Four friends stayed here for a long weekend and loved it! The house has a nice open layout. Kitchen is well stocked. Pool is a great size and heated to the right temp. The beds were also really comfortable. The third bedroom is a studio apt with its own entrance which was a nice surprise for the couple that was with us. The only thing the house is missing is a proper bbq. There is a George Foreman outdoor grill, but couldn‚Äôt get myself to use it."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home/space is one of our favorites in all of our travels. As soon as you open the front door the space opens up and greets you with so much natural light. The beautiful Art covers the walls and the furniture is as comfortable as the beds we slept in. The kitchen is practical and convenient while the dinning area is stunning with windows that allows you to admire the backyard from within. The backyard is probably the highlight to our stay with a heated pool, butterfly sanctuary and hammock that will put you straight to sleep under the Florida sun. Theres so much more but we‚Äôll let you discover it all for yourself. We can‚Äôt wait to get back. Oh and I cannot forget to mention how gracious our host were to us, answering our every call and request. We can‚Äôt stop thanking them for sharing their homes with us."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location- 15-30 mins from beaches, great restaurants, airport, and downtown. The home is beautiful and backyard is resort like in a quiet neighborhood."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was just as advertised but even better! So clean, spacious and airy! The interior was amazing, the backyard was a tranquil oasis, a convenient location to everywhere in Miami!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family had a fantastic stay at Ricky and Jose's house! It was the perfect spot for our family of four (though more people could stay comfortably). The pool was so warm and was in such a beautifully maintained backyard. Lots of lounging options around the pool. And we ate breakfast and lunch outside at the table under the tent every day. (Dinner would be great there, too, but we went out to eat.) The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was very well-equipped and easy to use. Location is great -- just 20 or so minutes to Miami Beach. We also went to the Everglades which is about 30 minutes away and the Miami airport is about 20 (in no traffic). Ricky was very available for questions. Overall it's a fantastic house!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We will definitely be back, from the beautiful private back yard to the welcoming home, and heated pool! What more could you need. Ricky and Jose were fantastic!"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay here, spacious and has everything you need. If you prefer a more private and seamless check-in though you should know when we got inside after a long drive, wanting to just settle in and relax, I could see someone at the front door who was there to give a tour of the place and explain everything. Personally I prefer to read house instructions to make the stay feel private. Apart from that it was great, the hosts were very communicative and kind and made sure everything was all set."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house at a perfect location! Clean, large and has everything you need for a perfect vacation!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Richard and Jose were incredible hosts. The place was perfect and they even purchased a pack and play for our infant.
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Richard and Jose are very welcoming and responsive hosts. The beds are comfortable and the house is very well kept.
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing villa in north miami, I really enjoyed my stay‚Ä¶the host was very welcoming and friendly. Strongly recommend üëåüèº"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Great pool and yard. It was a pleasure to stay there.
Thank you"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay in this beautiful oasis home in Miami Shores. It was one of the most stunning outdoor spaces I‚Äôve ever seen. The beds were comfy and the home was super clean. My only feedback was we had a hard time figuring out the ac/heater and we happened to stay on a really chilly weekend - but aside from that magical!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is just as described, beautiful and gorgeous backyard and pool!
Host were great!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was impeccably clean and pretty comfortable. The pool and garden are outstanding - beautiful landscaping and a nice large covered area to get out of the sun/rain. We loved the outdoor shower too. One thing that surprised us was the third bedroom and second bath are not connected to the rest of the house - you have to go outside and around to the side of the house to a separate entrance to access them. This didn't cause problems for us, but might for others. Another surprise was that the kitchen countertops are all covered with a clear plastic sheeting to protect them, which we found really unattractive and kind of a pain to work on. The kitchen is moderately well-stocked with pots & pans, etc. The location of the house is not particularly convenient to anything, unfortunately. We were surprised what a project it was to get to a beach - more than once sitting in traffic for 40 minutes to get across the causeway. But if you just want to relax around the pool, this is a great choice!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Richard And Jose‚Äôs house is an absolute gem. They are kind and responsive hosts; the house is beautifully designed and very comfortable; and the backyard is just stunning. The covered patio, the fully fenced yard with beautiful tropical plantings, the saltwater pool, the outdoor shower‚Äîwe loved spending time in this secluded and peaceful outdoor haven, soaking up the sun. The energy of the whole place is very restful and restorative. Also, I know Miami well and I appreciated the location: it‚Äôs a quiet street, with friendly neighbors, but you‚Äôre a very short and easy drive from culinary and cultural destinations in Wynwood, Little River, Design District, etc. Perfect if you want to be close to a lot of activity but also want to avoid dealing with a lot of city noise and tricky parking. My husband and I have stayed in many different AirBnBs around the world and this is one of the absolute best. I can‚Äôt recommend Richard And Jose‚Äôs place highly enough."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at the wonderful tropical house with a lovely garden and a great pool with amazing animals (parrots, birds, squirrels and butterflys). Richard and Jose are definitely hosts we can recommend!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. Wonderful vacation with family this break
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great house with an amazing pool, large kitchen, and super comfortable bedrooms! Richard and Jose were quick to respond and easy to work with. My only complaint was that they have a grill listed in under their amenities - they do technically have one but it is a small electric grill which was not very realistic for grilling for the group. Overall, had a great experience and would definitely recommend this airbnb!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This home was a dream. Private, clean, relaxing, and in a quiet neighborhood. Richard and Jose were available via text whenever I had any questions. The heated salt water pool made my stay extra special. I would definitely stay again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing and beautiful place. The hosts are very sweet and accommodating.
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"House is clean, and well taken care of. Not in favor of the location but it‚Äôs just due to places we wanted to visit on our stay, which were 20 min drive . Property is pretty, nice pool, palm trees and flowers. Beds are comfortable."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jose & Richard's House was amazing! would 100% do it again and recommend! they had a binder full of beaches, restaurants, and conveniences listed! they were responsive and couldn't have been better! (:"

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Richard and Jose‚Äôs house was amazing! The pool, grill and backyard was everything. We had everything that we needed. My friends and I had such an amazing stay! Great location, middle of everything, although it‚Äôs closer to Wynwood than South Beach, but Wynwood is definitely where it‚Äôs at. Great communication and they were so nice!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was beautiful- the backyard was to die for with the parrot sanctuary and butterfly gardens. Richard was very nice and friendly, he came by the house to walk us through everything and he was available via text when I had questions. There's also an awesome little cuban cafe a few minutes from the house which we loved! Will come again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful! The pictures give a very accurate description of the house. We loved everything about it and the hosts are very helpful with any questions.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"I loved Richard and Jose AirBnb , the description is a little off but we still made it work . I loved the pool with the night lights they had off because the mosquitoes were definitely out. The living room was fire , and also the kitchen I love the counter top. The bathroom was giving me rich vibes with the shower on the ceiling. And the neighborhood was quite and peaceful. We slept outside , it was that peaceful. Once I return to Miami I will definelty book this Airbnb again. And Richard was so nice and down to Earth I love it . If your reading this , just know you will get your money worth . Thanks , nyesha üòå"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,I really enjoyed my my stay at this beautiful oasis. It was definitely a home away from home. Everything was clean. Richard and Jose responded to every message in a timely manner. They were even so nice as to putting our groceries inside that were delivered as we were out and about. I would recommend to anyone and would stay again if I‚Äôm ever back in Miami. This Airbnb made my trip so much better.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,6 of us stayed for a weekend. The pool was perfect and the rooms were very comfortable. We would stay again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay and you won't regret booking with Ricky and Jose.
The home is well maintained, beds were comfortable, and the kitchen has everything you would need to cook.
The backyard is incredible and they also offer pool floats, which was a welcome surprise.
Communication was excellent responded quickly to any questions. A+"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This home was extremely beautiful and clean. I can say that this was the best Airbnb ever. The location was in a nice area. Ricky was awesome and very welcoming. I can‚Äôt wait to come back. Thank so much.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Don‚Äôt think twice, book it! Such a great stay! Ricky was very welcoming, walked us through the property and was quick to respond to the questions we had asked. The property is as amazing inside as it is outside! Loved the little mini suite, kids loved the pool and the butterfly garden, great for couples and families! Good location close to everything, the one thing is the mosquitoes, they‚Äôre terrible so be prepared. This is an amazing stay, would defiantly book again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place is MAGICAL!! an absolute dream for anyone who wants to be near the big city of miami, but looking for a little private retreat as well! we enjoyed the pool and backyard so much, pictures just dont do it justice! Best airbnb we have stayed at by far. And the hosts are incredibly helpful and friendly through the entire process. cannot reccomend enough!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It‚Äôs an amazing home. My family and I felt right at home. It is beyond clean, beautifully updated and modern home. We had everything we needed!

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Most amazing Air BnB I‚Äôve stayed at. The pictures honestly don‚Äôt do this place justice. Great location and great price for what you get. I will book again and again here!

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Ricky and Jose are the best hosts I had by far! They know all of the spots in Miami and are so so gracious and generous. The pictures do not do this home justice and you will not regret it!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So much to say about our host and his beautiful home .. but to keep it short .. Richard made our stay amazing from the home tour and flower education in his garden‚Ä¶ to checking in on us to make sure we were okay .. I would definitely add his home to my favorites ‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This listing is absolutely amazing. I haven‚Äôt been to a spot with such an amazing back yard and pool area. My trip wouldn‚Äôt have been the same without this spot. Great host. Great location. Highly recommended!

2017-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I did not know you can make friends on AirBnb! Ricky was more than our host, he became our friend during our stay and having him around during our stay made our vacation complete. His place is more than perfect for 4, the pictures posted are exactly what you will get! His private back yard is HUGE and the pool is so beautiful. He even has a coconut tree at the back of the yard! I found at his place the coziness from my home and during my 3 weeks stay it truly became my second home. His home description is 100% accurate. I would rate my stay at 6stars but 5stars is max! Thank you Ricky for making our vacation perfect!"

I would definitely stay there again.!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great airbnb! Smelt so amazing as soon as you walk in. Hosts were very helpful when we needed them. Everything is close by to this airbnb. Parking is definitely 1st come 1st serve & it‚Äôs a bit tight spaced. We had to ask & pay the hotel next door to park. It wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue but other guest parked over the yellow lines. Overall loved our stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable structure, room as shown in the photos is clean, check-in was very clear.
The Hosts were very kind, sometimes I was messaging to see if we needed anything.
Recommended property."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying at this airbnb. My favorite thing about it is the proximity to everything. Another great thing about this place is the free secured parking. Although there is no front desk you will sometimes run into the housekeepers who are so kind and pleasant.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,instructions were clear. It was easy to park and get to our room. Hosts would message us every once in a while to make sure everything was as it should. Good value for money.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Centrally located with easy access to different destinations.
The check-in and check-out instructions are quite clear and easy to follow.
Clean and tidy room. The place with a clean smell.
One detail to consider is the lack of elevator, but it does not affect the stay in any way."

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Located on a busy road and is a little louder depending on the room. There are many restaurants all around and a good public transport connection to the city. The host is quick and easy to reach and very helpful.
The price was a bit high, but maybe it was at the music festival that took place there."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The place is a good deal for the money you pay. Room is small but just enough. It would only be better if bed wasn't that close to the bathroom doors. Room location is on the back of the house so it's not noisy. You have windows on two walls so ventilation of the room is good and you have enough natural light. I like clean design of the place and perfume smell in the corridors. We always had parking spots available. Host was very responsive and helpful. Location of the building is near bus station. You have a lot of places around where you can eat and drink, gallery and park with weekend market where you can go :) You have iron and hairdryer in the room. And you always have clean towels and other toiletries available."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It‚Äôs a great stay and great communication.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect helpful easy to communicate
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite lacking an elevator, this 3-floor hotel offers a good location that's close to almost everything you need to go. The rooms are clean. I guess no noise insulation, which could be disruptive at times. While the area may seem a bit sketchy, we found it to be safe during our stay. However, if you have mobility issues, be aware that navigating the stairs can be a challenge. Room changing might also be a bit tricky, but the staff probably works to accommodate requests. Overall, this hotel is a solid choice if you are not that picky."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good communication with Mine, very helpful in my stay, she was always there on the slope .. Recommdado ."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Miami for two days and could easily leave our suitcases in the apartment despite very early arrival. Check in and out was also smooth, flexible and stress-free. Highlighted is the lovely communication! In the meantime, they asked about their well-being and the helpful answers weren't long in coming!
Thank you for the stay, I would recommend to anyone!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay at
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything. Only complaint is the hallways is a bit smelly/way too strong of a smell for us. Like heavy axe spray. Everything else was simple and great.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was really enjoyable. The hosts were extremely helpful, the Airbnb charmingly decorated and nothing was missing. An all-round successful experience!
Thank you for this great experience!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it was good. On the other hand, never had internet connection. My primary tool is my computer, so I always need internet connection. Hope they can fix that."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay at Treehouse Hotel. The room was clean and the bed was really comfortable. The little working desk was a nice added touch so you can have a separate place to use your laptop. I would definitely stay here again.

2024-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The photos on Airbnb do not represent the actual place! It‚Äôs a different room entirely. It‚Äôs also not a boutique hotel. It‚Äôs an old motel which has been partially renovated but still has a motel vibe. There was a stench in the hallways. The bathroom was not properly cleaned. Not worth the money, could find better options for this price, as well as an accurate description. The location was pretty good. Bianca was very good at commentating and helpful when we needed her, the was the plus side! Side note: they are also offering future discounts at the end of your stay if you leave them a 5 star review, which could be why their reviews are so high."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At Mine was an excellent choice. The room has the ideal size for a couple. My wife and I need a central, easily accessible, and welcoming place to sleep; At Mine met all of these requirements.
Its rooms are as described and shown in the pictures. Bianca's service was phenomenal from start to finish.
As a final detail, but not least, I should be grateful that they have a safe and spacious package that they provide it at no cost. On our next trip to Miami, this will be our first choice."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super responsive and proactive hosts; checking in throughout the stay and just overall kind and helpful. Room was as shown in pictures. The bed was so comfy. Bathroom was a bit tight but met our needs. We were in a room facing the main road which made it quite noisy so we used a white noise sound on my phone which helped tremendously. The entire building was clean and smelled so good everytime we entered. Location is central to many things and easy to get around. We loved the gym a few blocks down and the ramen spot open until 5am! Will love to return to this stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I must say my stay was peaceful and I was very comfortable and cozy. The host daily messaged to see if I needed anything and to ensure everything was going well daily. I would definitely stay at that location again but on the First floor‚Ä¶. Lol‚Ä¶. Well worth it!!!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved loved loved my stay! Everyday they sent a message to check in and make sure we were ok, I have never had that. The place was clean, very close to all areas we needed to go, and friendliness was top tier. I will definitely be back and recommending others."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. A little expensive especially just for one night (cleaning fee was more than the room itself) but the room was perfect
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect place if you are traveling solo for a couple days. Clean and quiet environment. Hosts are very responsive and informative. I definitely would book again.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! Truly a home away from home with top quality guest services. 11/10 will come again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an exceptional experience at Mine's Place hosted by Nancie! Right from the start, the communication was outstanding, and Nancie proved to be an incredibly accommodating and welcoming host. The accuracy of the listing was spot-on, capturing the essence of the space perfectly ‚Äì from the cozy ambiance to the well-appointed amenities. The location of Mine's Place was ideal for my visit, offering easy access to local attractions and conveniences. The space itself was meticulously clean and well-maintained, which made my stay even more comfortable.
Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Mine's Place to anyone planning a visit to the area. Nancie's hospitality and the charm of the place made my stay memorable. I'm looking forward to returning in the future. Thank you, Nancie, for making my stay so pleasant!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was fantastic üòä
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was extremely easy. The room was just like the photos, clean and plenty of space. Everything you need for a quick stay. There isn't a front desk employee but they are extremely responsive over the Airbnb chat. Didn't have any issues during the stay, everything in my room was fine. The hallways smell a bit musty but it's an old building so that's kind of expected. The AC in my room was great, very cold and you can easily adjust with a remote. Bed was comfortable. The location itself isn't in a tourist hotspot but you're a 10-15 minute drive to busy areas. You can hear a lot of traffic driving by during the daytime. Obviously less noise at night but keep in mind the walls are thin (it's an old building). Don't expect a high end hotel here but it's a good value for your money in Miami."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great stay for like a 1-2 night stay, lots to do nearby. Great restaurants and not far from the beach and other attractions. Host was quick to respond to any of my questions. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone and definitely putting it on my favorite list."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place looks as listed and was comfortable and clean for this solo traveler. I felt safe getting in and out as the place has security cameras posted all around. The hosts are incredibly responsive and helpful. I had a small issue and Bianca, Niccola, and Franchesca went out of their way to accommodate me and make it right. When I need to travel back to Miami I will be looking for a space hosted by At Mine."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay definitely would book again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place for an overnight stay üòä host is very kind and responsive. Great restaurants nearby.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The At Mine or space responds exactly as described in the listing. We were able to easily lock the vehicle in the parking lot at the bottom of the property with side entrance. There is a minibar and microwave on site, which helps small meals and snacks. I would definitely stay in the apartment again. Thanks"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bianca and Team were phenomenal! always going above and beyond during our stay! the place was spotless, the bed was so comfy! the apt is equipped with all the essentials that you need! thanks for having us!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All excellent
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Its not exactly a boutique hotel as described more like a 3 star motel. The rooms have a fridge and microwave but nothing else like any cutlery or cups and not provided on request either.
However the bed was comfortable and the room was a decent size and its located on the bus routes so it worked ok for me."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bianca was a very responsive host, good communication. This is a 3 story building with 8 rooms on each floor. Our room was located on the 3rd floor towards the main street. Here are the pros & cons you need to be aware off:
Pros:
- Silent mini-split air conditioning in room (negated by noise level coming in from street)
- located close to bus stop for using public transport
- spacious room
Cons:
- No elevator, lugging 2x50 pound suitcases up two floors might not be for everyone
- Single pane windows let all the street noise in unfiltered, it is like sleeping next to the road.
- Bare bones: 2xbath towels, no hand towels or wash cloth, no cutlery, plates, cups or any other kind of dishes, so if you want to use the provided microwave you need to bring your own
- ""window"" in bathroom was a piece of glass without frame, meaning it could not be opened.
- Carpet on staircase very stained/worn down.
- you are being asked to dump your trash in yard container, despite $69 cleaning fee"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was very good, with restaurants, pharmacies and amenities around. We had some inconveniences, but nothing that would affect the stay. The host was always very helpful and quick to help us. I recommend it!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stay at Bianca‚Äôs place only for two days but the experience was amazing! The place was clean and comfortable, the housekeeper is very friendly and gentle, she tells us some recommendations near to the hotel.
Bianca‚Äôs a very friendly person and responds very quickly, the communication was very good and helpful.
I definitely recommend this place."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host was completely responsive!!! She was always checking up on me and when I had an issue with the AC, maintenance came immediately and fixed the issue. Very sweet."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first place we stayed at, on Biscayne Blvd smelled of must and mold. We communicated this to Bianca and she proactively provided us a room at The Julia to accommodate us regarding the room we were staying in. She was wonderful and super helpful, even went above and beyond to make our trip better since we didn't sleep much the first night.
My biggest complaint personally would be that the rentals smell like an Abercrombie Fitch store which really irritates my nose. If that's not a problem for ya, I think this is a great place to stay.
Thanks Bianca."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Conformable stay
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing thank you
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect choice! Place is well located and kept squeaky clean!
Its located in a way of many Miami busses so you can leave your car at the back and enjoy Miami without worrying about the traffic!
Hosts are very attentive, helpful and lighting-fast responsive!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the location is a short drive from everything. It takes about 15 minutes to go almost about anywhere I needed to go.
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AirB is good if you are young but not for my age (56) I found it a bit poor for me,I found the room for 2 people too small and I really didn't get Zen from the place on the contrary.
Too bad it wasn't clean when you entered while the cost of cleaning is overly high it's really not worth it.
Furthermore, I was happy with Netflix only the Television is really not in a good place ,I got neck pain .
My son had chosen this place for him it was good (17) but for me he didn't like it.
Furthermore, the location is easy to do with the bus and there is plenty of parking space ."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hosts responded fast and provided a lot of information about the stay. They checked in often and were helpful.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The beds leave you wishing for more. View is beautiful. Construction going on from 7-6 isn‚Äôt
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The location and view is beautiful. You get a balcony with a great view of the ocean as well as a nice view of the other luxury buildings. The apartment was clean and neat. The only gripes I have is that all of the mattresses were sinking in and not comfortable, and the toilets would not flush unless you opened the tank and manually assisted it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home close to public transport. Aeration a little noisy to sleep but the accommodation was very nice, comfortable and functional.
We enjoyed our stay very much."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah and her family were so helpful, nice and responsive! The place is beautiful and loved having the security of the gates! Thank y‚Äôall for the use of your beautiful home!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Even better than the photos! The home was so cozy and the pool was so relaxing. It is so convenient to the stadium, I wish I had bought tickets. But even though it was close, it was pretty peaceful. Deborah was so hospitable and welcoming. She really thought of everything a person could need and she made some great recommendations."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah‚Äôs place was great! Just as described. It was cozy and just perfect for two people. It‚Äôs in the heart of downtown so there is lots of city noise and activity. Surprisingly, the bedroom was very quiet, despite the busy road and surrounding area. Deborah‚Äôs instructions were very detailed. Be prepared for a quick entrance and exit as the driveway is on the corner of a relatively busy road. We used the pool and it was just perfect. Deborah was very friendly and responsive. Overall extremely happy with our stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks to Deborah, the appartement was even better than on the pictures, ultra clean and comfortable.
I 100% recommend this place for every couple."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we would not hesitate to recommend Deborah's place. It's exactly as per the listing. We felt right at home.
Deborah's local recommendations were perfect. River Landings was also very close and the Mexican food there was great.
Thank you Deboah for use of your place and being a great host."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a lovely place to stay for a few days. We enjoyed being there from the beginning, but as we got around and saw more of Miami (and Florida) we realized how special it was. A couple of things to be mindful of: getting in through the gate is a bit tricky the first couple of times because it faces the corner of a busy street. You can hear the traffic from the pool area. The kitchen is on the dark side. But the pluses are many. Despite the previously mentioned noise, we loved being by the pool. The setting is very tranquil. Was nice for swimming, too. The vegetation is tropical, attractive, and sheltering. There are a couple of beautiful cats in residence--friendly ones that like being petted. It's an easy drive from the place to Calle Ocho, and there's a Publix grocery story a few minutes' drive in the other direction (part of a fancy, multistory complex overlooking a canal full of yachts). You can walk one block to a Walgreens, if you need a quart of milk."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely two night stay. Would recommend this place. The bed was extremely comfortable. Very close to baseball stadium.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at Deborah's place and would'nt hesitate to return! The studio was easy to access, private, and very cozy. Deborah was proactive and responsive to questions and gave great local recommendations."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodation. Good connectivity to Miami Downtown with public transport or economical uber/lyft. The place is private, comfortable and beautiful. It is close to a supermarket, pharmacy and shopping center. It has everything you need to rest, cook and enjoy.
Deborah and Alex are very friendly and concerned about their guests. They helped us with everything we needed and made us feel at home. This is the second year in a row that we have stayed here and we hope to return next year. Highly recommended."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the place and its facilities, everything very clean and perfect for rest, it matched the photos, it was a spacious place with everything you need to cook, it was close to the international airport and with direct locomotion to go to the well-known Dolphine Mall and small havana, they were friendly to receive our bags before check-in. The spa service was not available but we enjoyed the pisicine without problems, they also kindly agreed to wash us a load of clothes at no extra cost."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well maintained Air Bnb with very nice owner and great pets :)
We will be happy to come back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything perfect, enjoyed our stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were very happy staying at Deborah's. Excellent communication, and the place is clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Even though there is some road noise, the enclosed backyard feels private and like a little oasis, with a pool and gorgeous plants. Deborah's very friendly cat visited us while we sat outside. Love that there is off-street parking available. It's about a one-mile walk to Calle Ocho, which we felt perfectly safe doing. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was a beauty. The room was clean, confortable and pretty. The outside too (with the swimmingpool and 2 adorables and frinedly cats). We like it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely place! My mother and I felt safe and comfortable right in Little Havana :) would totally come here again for my next trip!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very well located, pleasant accommodation, private parking. Quality bedding. Very clean and well-decorated apartment."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had good stay at Deb's place. Nice house and good location.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely loved my stay here‚ô° It was like my own little oasisü©µüå∫ There were kitties to keep you company and greet you üò∫ Deborah was an absolute gem üíé host and made sure I felt right at home. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a refreshing couple of days (hottub & pool)!! Amazing! Thank you! üíï
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very lovely place. Parking especially exiting the property is a bit harrowing as you're blindly backing out of property into the street. Bathroom has no window or ventilation exhaust fan...minimally a deodorizing spray should be readily available. It was easier to use Lyft pickup services than to back the truck off of property. Very close to (5 minutes) Little Havana's most popular strip (Calle Ocho). Excellent Cuban food, music and dance places on the strip. The queen size mattress could use updating as it was too soft and wasn't a good sleep for neither me or my girlfriend. A nice place overall!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host! Deborah was very helpful with giving me instructions beforehand and provided me with local places to visit during my stay. She even turned on the spa area in the evening when the pool was cold. She has two friendly cats that made it feel right at home. Very clean and felt even more safe with the host on site.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Deborah and her family were very welcoming and kind. I was very comfortable and at home in the place.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. Deborah was very responsive and had alot of helpful advice. Would definitely stay here again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at this lovely, clean and well equipped apartment.
Deborah, Alex and Patrick were friendly, helpful and very welcoming.
Great location, with lots to do and see a short drive away with calle ocho just about walkable.
Would recommend this place to others
Thanks for having us."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah was a fantastic host who provided clear and easy-to-follow instructions for check-in, great recommendations for where to go in the area, and quickly responded to any messages. Her home was clean, looked just like the photos, and was exactly as described. Beware that the bed is super comfortable - especially after a long night out - and you may not want to get up the next day, I sure didn't! Deborah's place is also centrally located, and getting around the city and surrounding areas with either a ride share or a rental was super convenient. I would book it again and highly recommend it to others looking to feel right at home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a fantastic stay. I really liked the area of Little Havanna, and we got plenty of good food recommendations from Debora and Chris. The apartment was lovely; comfy bed, private bathroom and kitchen, fantastic pool area, and parking for our car. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay in Miami and it certainly exceeded my expectations :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Perfect on every point ü§ó
Clean, nice, everything you need, swimming pool, convenience, location...
One without fail üôè
Frankly very well
Recommendation ++"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home, clean, comfortable, very cozy, well-equipped kitchen, beautiful environment with private terrace by the pool. A very beautiful home 25 min walk from the heart of little Havana."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a nice little hideaway. Close to all the big things in Miami but also far enough away from the noise. I‚Äôm glad to have picked this location the weekend.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I spent a peaceful and very relaxing two nights at this gorgeous, well-appointed and welcoming home. It was easy to find and to check into, with a lovely and very responsive host on-site. The pi√®ce de r√©sistance was the stunningly lush and tropical, very private swimming pool and spa area! We enjoyed using the heated spa in the evenings and the pool during the daytime as well as having our morning coffee poolside.
I will definitely return with my husband to this wonderful Airbnb when next I find my self in Miami!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay at Deborah's place! The apartment and the adjoining pool are a dream.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Would stay here again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay in Deborah's home. She has a beautiful home, everything was very clean and felt very welcoming. Deborah was very quick to respond to any needs and recommendations. We felt right at home. Thanks again for your hospitality!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Deborah‚Äôs AirB&B. Host was kind, cooperative and friendly."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although the place is clean and in a convenient location, I would not recommend it.
The bedroom was hot and smelled like mold. You don‚Äôt have access to adjusting the AC, and when I asked the host to turn down the temperature, the host came to our door and suggested tips on how to use the table fan instead of accommodating to our request. This made our stay uncomfortable. I was passing through Miami for a day so it was not worth going to another Airbnb, but I would not recommend this to someone who runs warm or dislikes asking multiple times for requests.
Other than this, the pool was nice and we loved interacting with the two cats outside our home, they were very sweet."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a nice stay in Deborah‚Äôs place. She is easy to communicate with and kindly helped us and did our laundry as it was almost the end of our US trip we were out of clean t-shirts üòâ. She was always there for us. We loved 2 friendly cats that we could pet üêà
About the studio:
A small molded odor in all parts of the studio.
The kitchen is quite dark as there is a door with a blind to separate it from the private part of the house.
The bathroom is very small.
The bed is very high, as I am not a tall person it wasn't easy to climb on.
The parking place: at the check-in, Deborah‚Äôs husband gave us very detailed and a bit rude instructions on how to park our car. We were told not to touch the lawn in any case. Surprisingly in the evening on game days (there is a stadium nearby) we were asked to park on the street which we refused since we had a rented high-end car, while the visitor's (clients) cars were parked on the lawn sic!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah is a great host, the place looks exactly as described in the advert. The instructions are very clear and it‚Äôs easy to get in/out."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really wonderful space and host - recommend it to anyone looking for a good location next to ball park or little Havana and greater Miami
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great time, in large part due to the wonderful space. We used the swimming pool almost daily and used ride shares to get around. Little Havana and Coral Gables were our go to spots when going out. We had no shortage of great food and things to do. Deborah and Alex were awesome hosts. We‚Äôd see them and lightly chat as we came and went or hung out at the pool."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex and Deborah are great. The studio is bigger than expected. Well located. The swimming pool is beautiful. All was perfect
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay for a week.
We used plubic transport in the beginning, bus nr. 7 and in walking distance to Little Havana.
She had great recommadations. and replied quickly to all my questions.
We had the whole backyard and swimmingpool for ourselves.
Very private place and kitchen was ideal for preparing breakfast and a light dinner."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this beautiful Miami Airbnb. We walked to lunch in Little Havana and easily took a Lyft to the waterfront for a museum visit and bay cruise.
Our main purpose was to attend three baseball games at Loan Depot park - just a two block walk. It was just perfect and the ballpark is beautiful.
Deborah was awesome, helpful, responsive and flexible. We can't wait to visit again. Thank you for a great week!"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was great for where I needed to be. But the fact that they entered the unit without my prior knowledge at least twice marred my entire experience. The first day when I got there I realized that there were no access to channels on the tv. I reached out and husband came, realized that the infinity app wasn't downloaded on it, offered to get it sorted it and I told him then and there that it was ok. He insisted and I said it's not necessary I'll hardly be indoors. He left and messaged that he'd come to fix it and I never responded giving permission to. When I returned later that night, the app was loaded. I said nothing. The next day I saw the wife and I told her that the wifi signal was poor. She said she knew router was broken and a new one was coming in that day. I said ok. Later that day she texted that problem was fixed. I asked if they entered without my permission because it was not necessary. She downplayed it but router in the unit was missing when I returned."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Deborah and Alex‚Äôs guesthouse.
My husband and I appreciated the gorgeous surroundings, spacious rooms, super comfy bed and well stocked kitchen during our stay. Lots of little thoughtful touches around the property‚Ä¶bug spray by the pool, extra USB ports for charging devices, spices/oils in the kitchen. Really appreciated all of those things! Parking was super easy to access and we loved that it was gated, so our rental car was secure at night.
The location was perfect for us as well. Just a few minutes from the airport and under 15 minutes from Port of Miami.
Thank you for having us. Hopefully you have availability the next time we are in town."

You have everything you need and the location is just fine.
The only negative is that you can hear the road and airplanes nearby, but earplugs can fix that.
I would recommend!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deborah‚Äôs place was such a treat to stay at. It was larger than the photos seemed and the pool area was a delightful place to spend the afternoon relaxing. There was a bit of street noise but she had thoughtfully provided a sound machine so we had no problem getting a good night of sleep. We hope to come back if we‚Äôre in town again!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this perfect little guest house!
The location is superb for getting around Miami, with plenty of local restaurants and essentials within walking distance. We drove from Orlando and found the place very easily and felt extremely comfortable that our hire car was safely parked in the gated property! For those unsure of tourists reviews on a location, we were visiting friends that live in Miami and they agreed that it was a superb location and a safe neighbourhood!
The guest house itself has everything you would need and is far superior and much more affordable than any hotel you would find in the city! Unfortunately we just didn‚Äôt have time to use the pool or spa as we were too busy during our stay but the area itself was lovely and even just sitting in our garden felt like an escape from the hustle and bustle! A special mention should be made for how comfortable the bed was!
Deborah‚Äôs communication was superb from the moment of booking and her recommendations were fantastic - especially the Ball and Chain bar! Check in was simple and whilst we didn‚Äôt need anything we felt confident knowing that we could ask anything whether it be advice or an additional request.
We would highly recommend this stay and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to return on our next visit to Miami!"

I would recommend a bigger TV..it was too small to watch anything. But we barely stayed in the room..we had too much fun exploring Miami.
Overall very clean and accommodating and I would definitely stay again when I am back in town."

They helped me accommodate two last-minute work/travel issues and I was able to stay two extra nights. The gated entry is very convenient and the pool is great! I felt like I had an entire side of the house to myself, and the bed was very comfortable. I was also amazed to not hear much traffic on a very busy road adjacent to the house. Such a great find! I'm in Miami for work frequently and will certainly request to stay here again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing little gem! The pool was spectacular, I didn't get a chance to use the hot tub, but I'm sure it was just as great. The house itself was clean, very organized, and has just about everything you need. the host was lovely and was nice to chat with and the cat on the property is the best greeter! The house is conveniently located near the airport and a small Uber ride or drive to all the fun areas! I'll definitely be returning to this little treasure üòä"

We had to move after the first night because the mattress is really soft and i had a back problem but he helped us very kindly with everything. The location is close to little havana which is great if you like to dance salsa, and 10min drive from Miami beach.
They have a nice little swimming pool. The room is large and there is a lonely planet about Miami available."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Deborah‚Äôs place. Check in was incredibly easy and took 2 seconds. The hot tub and pool were nice to have though we didn‚Äôt use it for too long. Location was good especially for Little Havana restaurants. One thing I didn‚Äôt notice in any other reviews is there is a Roku with access to all the streaming sites you‚Äôd need for a night in, and a fan and white noise machine which was great for sleeping. Good hot water and shower pressure. We didn‚Äôt use the kitchen much but it was fully equipped. We didn‚Äôt hear any noise from the street despite being by a busy road. I would stay again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Deborah's place. The guest house is lovely, and you can't beat the proximity to the airport not to mention the short walk to the ballpark if you want to catch a Marlins game. The pool and hot tub are also really special. Would highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay if you are wanting the best Miami experience because you will be centrally located in a comfortable oasis within the city.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is exactly what it looks like, a little paradise. For travelers attending a Miami Marlins game, it is two short blocks away. We also walked to Little Havana's Calle Ocho. The room is perfect for one or two people. It is comfortable and has a great kitchenette and access to a picnic table and pool. Lovely place to relax after a day out in Miami or Miami Beach."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay. Well appointed, private, clean, and cozy. Had everything we needed for a comfortable stay in Miami and centrally located for easy access to all Miami has to offer. I would recommend to others and would stay here again."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deborah was just amazing. My best friend and I went to Miami for short weekend vacation and our host made everything perfectly comfortable and easy for us while we visited. It was great to have easy access to our own pool area especially if we didn't feel like going to the beach and wanted to relax nearby. There was easy access to stores just around the block and everything was neat and tidy. Deborah went above and beyond to make us fee happy. She even lent us her beach umbrella for the few days we stated with her which was incredibly nice of her. I cannot recommend this airbnb enough! I will definitely be coming back when i next visit Miami.

The apartments is private, secure and a. short walk from the Cuban District for great nights out, restaurant and dancing. This home is spotlessly clean and well laid out with all the welcome packs you need, and a bed while is very luxurious, comfortable and a perfect nest to spend the night.
Deborah and family helped with everything on hand to answer questions and offer advice which really added to our stay. Thank you so much Deborah!"

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I 100% truly recommend this place who doesnt not want to be right in the middle of the South Beach chaos. It's literally 10 to 15 mins away from everything. About 7 mins away from the airport. Deborah really gives you the privacy you need. Having a pool and jacuzzi in the back was a nice treat. You literally was able to utilize it whenever in private. Place is clean, cozy, roomy. I didnt rent a car but parking is available if needed. I ubered everywhere and they came so quickly. I can not stress enough how great my stay was."

It is very peaceful and quiet at night and very bright sunny during the days. The hot tub & pool played a major factor on making the stay comfortable. The bathroom is also kept super cleaned.

Deborah was very responsive and friendly, I postponed my arrival several times and she was flexible, her welcome was perfect, I also had a breakdown with the fridge and she replaced it right away. She's available and makes things easy.
One of the best AirBnB I get a chance to stay."

The location was perfect as it was easy to go to work as well as visit more touristic locations at night. The private studio was pristine, extremely comfortable, and full of small details to make my stay more pleasant. Deborah and her husband are extremely kind and made me feel welcome the whole time.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would give this location 10‚≠êÔ∏è if I could. This was hands down one of the best places I‚Äôve ever stayed - that includes fancy hotels and traditional B&Bs.
Pros: close to the airport, most of my Lyfts cost under $10 - a ride from Little Havana was $5. The backyard was super luxurious and everything was super clean. There was nothing to want for at this location. This Miami Air B&B is a getaway in-itself! Don‚Äôt overthink it - just stay here!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don‚Äôt think it twice, just book it. We gave them 5 stars across the board - we stayed at a hotel for the first leg of our trip but didn‚Äôt feel relaxation until we came to Deborah‚Äôs house. The space is plentiful and nicely decorated. The other reviews are spot on, I wish I could have brought that bed back home with me! Deborah and her husband are very helpful and charming, were prepared with great food recommendations, and their home is the best launching pad for you to get to the best parts of Miami within minutes. We loved our stay- thank you!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deborah was a great host. Her beautiful home was just as pictured and she gave us much privacy. There is a dog on the property who we did not see but we heard the dog barking a lot. Deborah was the best I would stay again.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah is a very gracious and helpful host. If you‚Äôre on a baseball trip like I was to see Marlins Park, this is an excellent location.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deb‚Äôs place is exactly as described.
I was in town for a series at marlins park and you cannot ask for a better location. The pool and lounge chairs were an amazing amenity as well. Definitely one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in within air bnb. My flight arrived fairly early and I was able to check in early with ease. All communication with deb was extremely quick. Being in an area where there‚Äôs a lot going on, you are tucked away in a location with lots of privacy and amenities.
The room itself stayed pretty cool which was nice after being out in the sun all day. For those people that like a fan, there is one in the room as well. There is also no shortage of outlet/USB space.
I will be back to Deb‚Äôs for my next trip to Miami."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Deborah was a great host and the Airbnb was pretty close to all the sites that we wanted to go to, so the uber rides weren't expensive. Deff recommended if you're traveling to Miami."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Deborah is an amazing host.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah‚Äôs place is much better than I expected. The room has a separate entrance at the back. The room is very cozy and relaxing. The kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook. There‚Äôs coffee and sugar and there are other condiments if you want to do some light cooking. The bathroom even has a bathtub if you want to draw yourself a relaxing bath. There‚Äôs tv in the room and you can watch Netflix for free. The wifi is fast and reliable. There‚Äôs a pool outside with a hot tub - just let Deborah know if you want to use the jacuzzi so they can set it up for you in advance. They respect your privacy and they will stay out of your way unless you need help on anything. Deborah even prepared a portfolio for tourist spot suggestions, restaurants etc. She is friendly and very, very kind - we feel like her own family! She deserves to be a super host! We will definitely come back!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place very well located in Miami, nearby the airport and all accommodations, the house is extremely proper and so comfortable, Deborah was really helpful and provided us a lot of advises for gaining time in our trip in Miami, we will come back!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deborah was an excellent host and we really enjoyed our stay at the Airbnb. Peaceful and clean atmosphere...and only minutes away to the action.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really loved our stay at Deborah's. Deb helped us get settled in and gave us helpful (local) tips at the beginning of our stay. Her place is very comfortable/clean and has lots of space. It's really nice there is a mini kitchen to warm up food and make coffee. Deb's place is a great value and I would definitely recommend!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful accommodations and hospitality. Very clean. Great location and very easy to get rideshare from there. We will definitely stay again when in town.

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Deborah gave us great spots to check out. My husband and I HIGHLY recommend checking out a baseball game if your fans and go to Big Pink you can uber there it was amazing! The place was great to stay at and the bed made me never want to leave!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My friend and i had soo much fun at Debs bnb she really goes out of her way to make you comfortable. The pool was awesome we even left our floaters for the next bnb-ers. And she‚Äôs very knowledgeable about the whole area and most importantly we felt safe. Thank you Deb!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiance and I visited over MDW. We wanted something away from the Miami craziness but also nearby so we can check out the scene. The house itself is beautiful. We had an early flight to MIA/late flight back home and Deborah was very accommodating and held our luggage while we went to explore. She gave us some tips on places nearby. If you're okay with walking, Little Havana is not too far. Uber and Lyft is super affordable to get around. Overall, we paid $4-$10 to get around. This includes going to Miami Beach and Wynwood. The studio itself is very comfortable and cute. Even though the studio is part of the house, Deborah and her family gave us privacy. The pool is perfection. There were days we couldn't make it to the beach so we opted for the pool. We would definitely return back!"
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and good amount of space for belongings
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deborah‚Äôs place was wonderful! Great location. Everything was 15 min or less to get to so the Uber‚Äôs were pretty cheap. Her place was super clean. The decor was beautiful. The bed was so comfortable and soft, best sleep that I‚Äôve had in a while! She has everything you can think of that you might need. She was so kind and so thoughtful. Definitely a place worth staying at!"

Thanks to Bianca and Nicolo!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bianca, the stay was great! I really enjoyed it. The accommodations were perfect and you can't beat the location. Great value! The only suggestion I have is to ensure that the entry instructions include hitting the check mark button after you've entered the door code."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great find for a stay so close to the beach. It is up north too so if you want extra quiet at the beach all you do is walk two blocks and you're there. The unit is small but good for a few days. The only issues we had was the noises of people slamming doors and such, things you can't really control. Otherwise this place is a great."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved staying here for a week! I woke up to a lovely view of the water from my room everyday. The hotel has close access to Mid Beach, a beautiful rooftop lounge, and an excellent brunch restaurant on the main floor. Definitely hoping to visit again soon!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Tremendous value for a perfect stay. The host and staff were so accommodating, welcoming and pleasant to deal with! The cafe is amazing and I would highly recommend this wonderful place to all travelers. If we find ourselves back in Miami we will be sure to stay again!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The service was immaculate and the response time? Out of this world !! They are so quick to help you with your needs I love it! I definitely will be back thank you!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect for a relaxing getaway. 5 minute walk from the beach and close to a couple of cafes and restaurants. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Miami.

No service.
No way to reach an employee or caretaker outside the receptionist's hours.
No amenities in the room, not even a plastic glass!!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay! Definitely would will book again , was skeptical at first before coming but everything was exactly like advertised right next to the beach , fine dining downstairs, parking right in the back for way cheaper then the garages ! Overall beautiful scenery and great place to stay and I absolutely loved the rooftop my favorite spot in the whole place !üíï"
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Very alright stay for what we paid.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was clean, the view i had from my room was great, ONLY downside was the linen was barely accessible, every time i went to get new towels there wasn‚Äôt much left, but other than that, this is a great place to stay"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we first got there, the room felt humid and moist. Overtime the air conditioning started to help. Other than that, the view was different from what we expected. Our stay was nice and easy, staff were very friendly and helpful. The overall cleanliness needs to be evaluated for health purposes and the atmosphere needs to be fresh and clean when people first arrive."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was very easy. The hosts were responsive and answered very quickly. I loved the restaurant they had downstairs as it was very convenient especially in the morning for breakfast. The walk to the beach was literally a block away which I loved. And the location was perfect as there were restaurants, liquor stores, and pharmacies near by. Only 10 minutes from South Beach too!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb location is excellent. It is a 2-5 minute walk to Miami Beach. Miami Beach is quiet and more family friendly. However, if you would like to go to South Beach you can walk or take an Uber. The host is very responsive and Meka at the front desk is awesome! Collins Ave has lots of restaurants. Check out the Lincoln Mall and Lincoln Farmers Market for great fruit. We enjoyed the cafe in the Airbnb hotel. The food smells amazing and they have great smoothies. We will be back soon!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, short walk from the water, about 5-10 minutes drive from South Beach."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Very nice place! Check-in is very easy and the host responds quickly to messages. The hotel is well located, close to the beach and good little restaurants. It's really a good quality-price choice, especially for miami beach."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Udlandy was at the front desk and an incredible help! She truly made this experience better. Thank you for the great service and hospitality! Perfect location and more affordable than other spots. Plus the restaurant was FABULOUS!

Great for family friends celebrations you won‚Äôt go wrong.
Thanks guys see you again soon"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in Miami Beach
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location and very clean building, beach nearby, restaurant on premises. host is very responsive on application, would definitely recommend."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At mine is a well-managed, very nice establishment. The owner himself ensures the satisfaction of every visitor. When an incident occurred, he handled the matter personally, and resolved it immediately. When we had a concern about our first accommodation, we were offered another Room and were moved without a problem. And by the way, they have a wonderful newly open attached restaurant, which serves delicious entr√©es."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, close to the beach and stores close by to pick up you beach kit and the goods"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Nice place to stay, very responsive & always available via chat. My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù is the door. I felt like anyone could give it a good push & break right in. Other than that, the front desk is friendly & the restaurant downstairs serves great food."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Walking distance from great restaurants and about 1 min walk to the beach!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, comfortable beds, and clean room! The host responds right away. Great stay!"
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Musty and Damp- but great spot and great host communication. Super friendly staff and great spot with CitiBikes available to ride everywhere.. But yeah. Extremely musty and damp- left clothes and hair smelling. Staff brought in a dehumidifier which helped but the smell is just everywhere so even though they were willing to change our room I don‚Äôt think it would have mattered. If you just are looking for a place to lay your head and be outside most of the time and are on a budget this would be a spot for you if you can handle sleeping in an aquarium and loud AC/dehumidifier going constantly. Staff was really great- just the building is musty and damp.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place will stay again
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, easy check in, good communication and loved the location"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was good. The room does smell musty when the A/C is not on as other people have mentioned. Place is really good location and the beach is walkable distance. Parking is limited and have to pay for it.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a must stay! Great location and easy access to the beach and local attractions. Would definitely recommend it. Loved the hospitality of the staff, specially Udlandy! She‚Äôs an excellent staff member. Very friendly and communicated promptly. Will be staying here for our future travels to Miami."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host. Super recommended
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a good stay.
Pro‚Äôs:
+ Clean room with a cafe right on the premises.
+ Host was attentive and friendly and stayed in touch with us via the app.
+ AC/ heater worked well.
+ Modern decor with everything well placed.
+ Mini fridge and safe in room
Con‚Äôs
- No deadbolt or safety lock on the door to prevent anyone else with the code from entering.
- Entry door gets stuck halfway open and bathroom door struggles to close.
- Shower door leaks water out onto the floor.
- No ice machine anywhere on the premises.
- Tv remote had issues with volume controls not working half of the time. We literally had to unplug the tv twice to get them to work again.
Still a good value but hope to see some repairs in the future."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and clean. Very helpful and friendly staff. Great view of the canal and great location. Overall, i recommend this place. The only downside was a musty smell, but wasn't too bad. Furniture is a bit worn, but everything worked well. There's a super cute, and delicious, cafe that opened in the lobby."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful location! For a very busy Pastor on the go 24/7, this respite and this location was just what I needed!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great except the parking situation is awful. Literally no free parking anywhere and good luck finding somewhere to park in the first place. The entire hotel smelled thick of mildew. Everything was damp. Maybe that‚Äôs just because of the location and being so close to the water? Idk but it was overwhelming. The hotel itself tho is very unique. It was clean. Towels and sheets are self serve. No one brings you more. The hosts however were super friendly, checked in consistently and were super helpful. Wouldn‚Äôt bring the family here but a cute place for a couple."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Very friendly staff and walking distance to the beach.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this Airbnb met our expectations, offering the convenience and comfort typically found in a hotel room. We felt safe throughout our stay, which was a major plus. One of the highlights was definitely the rooftop area, where we enjoyed great views of Miami. It provided a perfect spot for relaxation and taking in the scenery.
The location was good ‚Äì nestled in a relatively peaceful part of mid-beach, while still granting easy access to the vibrant South Beach area, which is just a short stroll or Uber ride away. Additionally, the beach was incredibly close, requiring no more than a 5-minute walk to reach the sand. This made our beach outings effortless and frequent.
Overall, our stay was great, thanks to the excellent location and responsive hosts."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"For us, this place was better than advertised, and we had some pretty high expectations given the other reviews. The location was even better than what we had hoped for, and the pictures of the room were accurate. South Beach is a (beautiful) 30 minute walk away, but you also have everything you need on your doorstep ‚Äì the beach, shops, restaurants, caf√©s, you name it. If we come back to Miami, this is going to be our first pick."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very private. Pretty top deck.Small but convenient
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at this property! I had a minor issue at check in, but it was resolved very quickly and professionally. Great job!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a peaceful stay, please book!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,For the location you could not ask for a better value really. We had a really nice relaxing peaceful stay with everything we needed. Would recommend to anyone and will likely rent again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At Mine was a perfect stay for our short 3 night trip to Miami. All the listed amenities were provided and whenever we needed extra towels before heading to the beach, we were free to help ourselves.
The hosts were very friendly, communicative, and proactive in making sure we had everything we needed (special shoutout to Bianca who assisted us throughout our stay).
The place is located in the Mid-Beach area so it is far enough away from the chaos of the South Beach area but close enough to get to popular restaurants and bars. There are convenient cafes nearby and Bon Bouquet Cafe is located in the lobby of the building (it just launched on the day we were leaving so we didn't get a chance to try it but it is super convenient for anyone staying here for a quick breakfast/brunch). While there is no direct beach access connected to the property, the beach is easily accessible right across the street. Overall it was a great stay and highly recommended!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,GREAT location-convenient to restaurants/stores and the cruise port (abt a 25min drive)!! And the most comfortable bed!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfy and clean room. Good management always checking in and making sure we are enjoying our stay. Only downside was that there wasn‚Äôt much to do around so you have to Uber everywhere, but if you like a calm and quiet environment this is for you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great find!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay At Mine‚Äôs. Niccolo was very helpful with any request and was in the building daily to check things were running well. He always asked if we needed anything and helped us find the things that weren‚Äôt included in his amenities. Very nice clean room. Roof access was great for enjoying a quiet night. We got everything we paid for and enjoyed our stay.

They helped us with more bath supplies when we needed it and sent us recommendations. The room was the same as the photos, the sheets and mattress were pretty clean and the air worked perfect. The bathroom was also clean and looked new. Downstairs they are making small adjustments at the front desk and it looks like it will look great with chairs and tables to eat or be there. The location is phenomenal, walking distance from the beach, supermarkets and restaurants. We would definitely come back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the Hosts! Very responsive and hospitable. Respectful, kind, friendly and attentive towards my needs and questions. Loved the room!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a unit on the first floor for two nights. Mentioning the floor as the building appears to be under renovation. The bedroom including bed was very clean. There was nobody on-site at the hotel during the day except maintenance and cleaning folks but management was responsive through Airbnb.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good and safe place
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a room in a hotel that appears to be undergoing renovations. It is a bit strange at first - the first floor is under construction. But the room was small and clean and the bathroom was well kept. The hosts are very responsive.

Cons:
- Small apartment for 2 people. Not viable if there are 2 people with one more kid.
- Biggest problem being walls are not soundproof. One can hear neighbors talking even at regular conversations. For all 4 nights I spent, the neighbors angrily banged the wall and even screamed at us even though we were talking at regular voice level. This was very unsafe. Not suitable for family.
- I stayed for 4 nights, if we request for cleaning, then there is an extra $30 fee per cleaning. The billed $69 cleaning fee is only for one-time before check-in. So it‚Äôs a problem for longer stays where we need to pay extra for cleaning.
- Not enough towels and soaps provided in the room. Need to explicitly request for it. But yes, they did provided quickly on request."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 minute walk to the beach. No free parking. The parking lot next door is $42 per day! The place has all the essentials covered, no problems. There was a bit of an unpleasant odor in the halls though. It was as nice as a basic hotel."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 2nd time staying at this air BNB. I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed it the first time. It‚Äôs located in a great spot which is mid beach Miami. It‚Äôs only a couple miles from south beach and right across the street from the beach. If you are here for a few days, just Uber because parking is some blocks away. The manager is very responsive and will check in with you on how your liking the air BNB."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank You
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,It‚Äôs a really good and quiet place
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great value! I stayed at the Venezia for 22-days and it was a good experience. I would highly recommend them for extended stays of experienced travelers. The value is really great and I felt like they went they extra mile to check in and make sure everything was OK with my stay. The rooftop lounge is a hidden gem and an amenity I came to appreciate a lot more over time. The rooms are comparable to a 3-3.5 star hotel (similiar to a Cambria). The location is perfect. The Venezia ultimately checked a lot more boxes than I expected when I booked my stay - book with confidence. The one critical thing I would mention is if you have sensitive allergies you might want to test out the viability of your stay first as this building is an older building (with a quality face lift) on the canal.
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Depending on the room you receive I believe matters a lot. The room I got was bad. Musty, very damp, smelly. It‚Äôs sad that was my room because the at mine host was very nice and helpful and I appreciated how fast they responded. Great host not a very clean environment. Great location though. Felt safe even as a 20 year old girl."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very happy with my stay. Lovely rooms and great location. Excellent communication and service from the team!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very caring staff & room was clean. 2nd time staying there during a layover and it‚Äôs close to the airport and bars nearby. I love the check in process too.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The staff was very helpful and nice , helped solved any problems I had.
The airconditioning installation might be loud in some rooms though.
Good location, far enough from clubs etc to let you sleep, but close enough to reach it with free buses (15mins) leaving from the stop 50m from the hotel or take a long walk (1h).
Good stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very amazing, and caring staff! Great location, literally a block or two away from the beach! The instructions were very clear, and things were very smooth. The most amazing part of my stay was the staff, by far! So kind, and so customer centric. I really appreciated each and every staff member I had the pleasure of encountering."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall, the staff (Nancy at the front desk) was super friendly and very accommodating. Great location. Was able to walk to the beach and dinner; I also enjoyed sitting on the rooftop to read. The only issue I had was the smell of mildew and mold that was visible on the ceiling of my bathroom and it was very humid/muggy in the room. The air conditioning never really shut off so it was always running. And then there were the not so friendly guests that were also staying at the time that I came in contact with‚Ä¶ but the price was decent so I can‚Äôt complain too much."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"A block away from the beach, good place. You get your moneys worth"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was amazing! I appreciate the fact that the apartment was well priced and there were no additional payments on checking in as I had with my previous encounters in Miami. It‚Äôs in a strategic location - a two minute walk from the beach and great restaurants for fine dining. The views from the rooftop are breathtaking and the ambiance of the entire building is an amazing sight. Definitely would recommend it for anyone looking for a convenient short/long stay for you and your partner while in Miami.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a greater time staying here. Liked to boutique hotel concept updating original buildings. Everything was very walkgable and enabled us to enjoy mid beach and south beach.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Will come again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I had a great time during our stay. Check-in was flexible (we ultimately arrived earlier than anticipated) and the host was responsive. When we got to our room, we noticed something that did not meet our expectations, and after we brought it to the attention of management, we were able to quickly change rooms and even had an upgraded room. Everyday the host checked in on us in the morning to see if we needed anything which was so nice and helpful. We were also able to get fresh towels easily. The location is great because there is a cafe/convenience store nearby if you need anything and Ubers/Lyfts are affordable. Also during our stay there were contractors looking to make improvements so the building has nice amenities and upgrades. Our bed was also super comfortable. Would recommend for anyone looking for an affordable place for a quick getaway in Miami!"

There were other small things that made me not be able to give 5 stars, like the smell of the hallways (especially), lobby, etc. The tissue quality was terrible and we didn‚Äôt even have enough.

Would go again."
,,,"First issue was the AC, they do not cool the room enough on the third floor. We had to purchase a fan and that barely helped. The owner did send maintenance but these are just old AC units. He also did switch our room, the second room was maybe a couple degrees cooler, luckily we had purchased the fan. Second, there was other people‚Äôs hair on the showers. You can notice the showers haven‚Äôt been scrubbed. There was mold under the shower mat as well. Third was the sheets and pillow cases have stains on them, very visible yellow stains. There is mold under the sink and everywhere. The space is much smaller than expected. We had a big cockroach in the room which then makes you question is there more roaches anywhere else and makes the stay uneasy. This is not at all like the pictures. The seller did have great communication overall but since I left there has been no further communication on how to resolve this."
,,,"Lots of noise/ Noisy
Mucha clarity/ a lot of clarity
Broken window, so more noises and a lot of clarity came in since one of the windows, it had no blinds.
Broken window and without blackout
Dirty bathroom and lots of mold
Dirty bathroom, mold
The location is good, but it's impossible to spend the nights there, in fact I left earlier
Impossible to sleep there"
,,,"Don‚Äôt be fooled by the overly edited photos and low pricing. This place was horrible. Dirty lobby and stairs, no elevator, sketchy neighborhood, and super thin walls. Sleeping here feels like you‚Äôre in a parking lot next to a highway and train tracks, because you are. The windows and walls are so thin that they might as well be open air. You can hear people in neighboring rooms and CONSTANT traffic, horns, and motorcycles outside. The bathrooms were also old and dirty with stained floors and room smelled musty. I left after the first night of no sleep and booked a vacation rental. Before I checked out, the management agreed to give me a refund then changed their mind after leading me on for 11 days that they were ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù it. This was the worst hotel experience I‚Äôve ever had in Miami and I‚Äôve been traveling there for ten years. Make sure to check the online reviews for Treehouse Studio Hotel before booking and you‚Äôll see what I mean. Mostly 1-2 star ratings. Avoid at all costs."
,,,". 1. THERE IS NO HEATER AND ONCE THE AC WAS TURNED OFF IT NEVER WORKED AGAIN 2.The shower and sink is not completely cleaned. 3 There are NO washcloths. 4 There seems to be a smell of mold but it‚Äôs tried to be covered up with bleach. 5. There are cracks and discoloration on the ceiling, it‚Äôs tried to be covered by paint or wall paste. 6. The carpet leading up to the room was absolutely filthy. 7. Window seal in the bathroom is filthy 8 This is unequivocally not what was advertised."
