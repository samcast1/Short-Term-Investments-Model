2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, beautifully decorated, clean, and cozy BNB. Every we needed (and more) was well marked and easy to find. The attention to detail and caring touches were spectacular. What a fun place to stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and cozy home, very clean and the easy parking. Loved the heated bathroom floors too!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay here was truly the most perfect airbnb experience. Not only was the home itself so beautiful, it was decorated with intention, with small touches like heated floors in the bathroom and dimmable lights throughout, it was so comfortable. Plenty of spots to sit with friends and talk, or just rest. The best vibe. We were in town for a concert at castle theater and it was very close by and the neighborhood felt safe for 3 girls.
The hosts were the best hosts I’ve ever had, they had the music from the band playing on an Alexa when we walked in, mood lighting in the living room, and ice, snacks, and refreshments available for us. We felt very taken care of.
They were also very accommodating when we asked for earlier check in since we had taken the early train in from Chicago.
I absolutely cannot recommend this place an enough! We will definitely return here next time we’re in town for a concert!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I were hesitant about the area but were amazed at how beautiful it was once we stepped inside their place. The decor was something both my sister and I are partial to (Black Beauty), it was like walking into a museum. We each had a bedroom, with a TV, which was very comfortable and spacious for unpacking. We were able to dine in the living room at the cutest table for 2. Although the couch was a little uncomfortable, we enjoyed the room's high ceilings and beautiful lighting. The deck was extremely inviting on a sunny day enjoying coffee and breakfast outside to a glass of wine in the afternoon. The walk downtown was a short distance for a little shopping or dining (a few store owners were friendly). We would stay here again while visiting family. Michelle & Mark were very responsive when I had a question. Thank you both again for our stay as it felt like home."

Once again I do apologize for forgetting ice cream bars in freezer and tea and juice in fridge..If in area again definitely will book again if available 😊"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this for the price and location. I wanted to stay within walking distance to some restaurants and bars, and this it was. We enjoyed walking downtown and enjoyed dinner and some drinks. We listened to some live jazz as well.
The unit itself was so perfect. Tastefully decorated, and everything you might need. Plenty of options for your tv viewing.
We enjoyed sitting on the deck and soaking in some sunshine. Thank you Mark and Michelle for sharing your home with us."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Just stayed for a night. Ran into some issues with the smart lock at checkin but it was viciously cold so we think that affected it. Mark and Michelle were responsive and go to us within 10 minutes to let us in. The interior was as described. Homey with some snacks stocked for us which we appreciated. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay! Even though we had trouble getting in and believe it was due to the subzero temperatures interfering with the lockbox, Mark was very attentive and came right out and helped us get in. It was a great stay and a beautiful place. We would Definitely stay there again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The apartment was very eye-catching with a unique theme. We loved our stay and would definitely come back!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mark & Michelle’s place is beautifully designed and comfortable! It’s centrally located and near everything. We have stayed at Mark & Michelle’s other Airbnb homes many times and so when their other place wasn’t available, we reached out. They kindly recommended their newest home to us. We were thrilled to stay at Black Beauty because we knew it would be super clean and that Mark & Michelle would be extremely responsive, should anything be needed. Thank you for hosting us once again! See you this summer for our next visit to Bloomington!
Peggy"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is really great because it’s a large apartment with lots of open floor space. No carpeting so it feels clean. Also, it’s in an interesting, old, and walkable part of town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location and communication with the host were stellar! The home was well maintained and comfortable, while maintaining its historic build. It was nice to have such a walkable neighborhood for exercise and accessing nearby businesses.
If you’re looking for a place to work from, know that the desk area only had one available electrical outlet nearby and no nearby 3-prong outlets within reach. This presented a challenge for working and plugging up tech items, which were important to my stay.
Overall, I enjoyed being here and would book again for a work-free visit."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Greg and Celeeste's listing was perfect! We were in town to see a show at Castle Theatre and it was just a short walk through a lovely neighborhood to the venue and back. We thought there might potentially be a sound issue with it being on a street corner and sharing a lot with a bar, but not only does the bar close at 10pm, we did not have any problems with street traffic. It's a beautiful old building that felt cozy and unique and would happily stay there again. Thank you!"

You could literally eat off of the floor. The decor in the home is beautiful. Bathroom was squeaky clean as well. The kitchen was an added nice touch even though we didn’t really use it. It’s very close to downtown and some restaurants. Very well lit easy to find and I felt very safe here. I will definitely be back to stay at this property again. The bed is so extremely comfortable that it has been the best night sleep I’ve had in months!!! if you were on the fence about renting an Airbnb you do not need to be worried about this place!!! If I could give more than five stars I would!!!

2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great, well-furnished apartment in a charming, historical building. The bed was very comfortable, 2 large TVs in the living room and bedroom!
My only complaint is that the building sits on a busy corner with lots of traffic throughout the night. Obviously this is out of the control of the owner.
Greg provides more than adequate detail and communication."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location right by Schooners and Grove Street Bakery!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a treat to stay at this Airbnb. It was in a beautiful, old brick building with original architectural elements. The decor was great and there were thoughtful touches especially in the kitchen. We liked being next to a bar and grill but also easily got downtown in both Bloomington and Normal. The neighborhood was pretty and we felt very safe. The building door was locked and the apartment door was locked as well- requiring one key and one code. The owners provided great instructions about building entry and also what the apartment included in terms of amenities. As soon as we arrived they checked on us to ask if all was ok. We were very happy with our choice."

The decor is beautiful, the work space is functional, and the location is very convenient. There’s a nice restaurant right outside the building, and there’s a Jewel-Osco grocery store less than two miles away.
The apartment is spacious and well-appointed. The fact two large televisions in the unit is unusual for an AirBnB this size, and that definitely adds to the enjoyment.
I do a fair amount of traveling to the Bloomington area for work, and I’ll definitely be re-booking!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! Went for a little weekend getaway and it was a cute space. It’s upstairs obviously and the parking is behind the building, so take that in consideration when unloading. The building also shares a parking lot with a bar, but we didn’t really hear too much noise. There is another tenant as well we heard a little bit but not much. This location was perfectly placed near all the breweries, shopping and restaurants we wanted to do. Thank you!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very charming little apartment! The bed was wonderful huge for just me - 5'3"" 130lbs. I LOVE the sitting/front room area. I even kept the big curtains open to enjoy watching the local comings and goings. I did have a bit of a difficult time figuring out how to get in and then up there but frankly that's really more of a me issue lol. A tip for travelers in general: Bloomington does have hard water so if you're skin is sensitive, be prepared."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rad affordable space in a neat place! Modern and comfortable furnishings. Temperature steady and cozy. Quiet neighbors.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very helpful hosts and in a great location. Good space for work and a very comfortable bed. I enjoyed being able to walk next door to get a bite to eat at Schooner’s or pick up a pastry from Grove St Bakery first thing in the morning. I also really appreciated the clear expectations on quiet hours because there are long-term tenants in the building. I love Bloomington and this was a great spot where I could walk downtown or to adjacent neighborhoods to visit family, much more easily than if I had got a hotel room."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Sandy's place was a truly enjoyable experience. First and foremost, we would like to express appreciation to Sandy for her exceptional assistance throughout our stay. The house was so cute and we loved the dog toys set out and the dog bowls. The dogs loved playing in the backyard. Sandy was helpful and attentive, ensuring that all our needs were met promptly. She was very complimentary of how well we maintained the house, which made our stay all the more delightful.
While the house itself was impeccably clean and thoughtfully furnished, we did notice a slight hint of cigarette smoke upon entering. Possibly from previous renters? We are particularly sensitive due to allergies.
Despite this minor observation, we loved the house. It offered ample space and provided all the necessary amenities for a comfortable visit. Its convenient location allowed for easy access to nearby attractions and amenities, enhancing our overall experience."

I loved everything about our stay and we highly recommend this home.
I am so grateful for all the detailed information and instructions from the host, she is the best host and the nicest.
Thank you so much.
Sincerely,
Isabelle"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home. We had one small issue and Sandy addressed it immediately. We had a very enjoyable stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sandy thought of everything for her guests. There are board games, coolers, and even scissors!
Who would have thought that stocking scissors would make my day, but here we are.
The plants in her place were well kept and added to the beauty of her home.
There was a coffee bar, and I read the History of Bloomington book while I sipped my morning coffee, VERY relaxing!!
Sandy was also extremely gracious about me completely forgetting the checkout time. It was very much appreciated.
She doesn't have crazy rules, she keeps a clean and nice home, and she thinks of things to make her guests lives easier including a portfolio of menus for local restaurants and info on things to do around Bloomington (and scissors).
If you stay with her, then show your appreciation for her efforts by stripping beds, washing bedding or have it in the dryer, and having all your towels in the washer. I also took the trash out, had dishes in the dishwasher, and wiped down counters.
Thanks again Sandy!"

2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Sandy's place was well stocked and very homey. However, someone broke the rules and smoked in the living roo. As soon as we walked in the door, we could smell it. It wasn't so overwhelming to have to leave (we are very sensitive to it) but noticable and took cooking something to rid the smell some. Everything else about her place we loved. She was very accommodating."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Loved this house! I was in town for a graduation and wedding and it met all my needs. It was a convenient location, plenty of space, the house was well stocked and clean. The host was very nice and responsive and she was wonderful to work with. She had coupons, local things to do, clear instructions for the house, and had covered every detail perfectly to make the stay comfortable and easy. Very nice private back deck to relax in the evenings. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place! Probably the best stocked Airbnb we have stayed at. Numerous thoughtful touches. The sunroom was awesome! Bed in master bedroom was very comfortable. Fenced yard was great for our pups. Would definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Stewart House will go down as one of my all-time favorite Airbnbs. Sandy is a super responsive host who has gone above & beyond to provide a like-home atmosphere with an over-abundance of amenities, a clean house, and fast wifi. The area around the house is safe and friendly, and I will 100% be staying here again in the future."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place for our family (including furry member) to relax and enjoy our daughter’s college graduation. Great layout, relaxing and beautiful sunroom, secure backyard for the dog. Very clean and inviting!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sandy was a great host! Super cozy home and larger than expected! We had a great stay!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Sandy's house was so quiet and comfortable. The house had everything we needed and then some. Sandy was a friendly and responsive host.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my visit to Bloomington. The Stewart house was an excellent location! Near family, and within walking distance of Miller Park. I felt right at home at the Stewart house the moment I went through the door. My favorite room in the house was the sunroom. Full of light and plants and very comfortable. I was most impressed with the motion detector for the light in the bathroom. No fumbling around for the light switch in the middle of the night! I will stay at the Stewart house on my next visit to Bloomington. Thank you so much Sandy!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing stay! Sandy thought of everything and was extremely flexible and hospitable. Will definitely stay again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, comfortable place to stay. Appreciated that it had coffee, drinks, and snacks available. It was close driving distance to everything too.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandy's place was perfect for the two of us! Our favorite was the recliners! She had toiletries readily available if you forgot anything.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Sandy's Place was great! The house is very roomy and had everything we needed - looked just like the photos. We loved that we were able to bring our dog. Sandy is very responsive. We will definitely be back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the first time I was traveling alone with two very large dogs (130lb and 80lb) which made the fence in yard priority for me. I have stayed at many airbnbs before and she made me and my dogs feel so welcome... I was also very comfortable and not obsessively concerned about dog hair being left behind.
I am not very tech-savvy. She left very clear and instructions for the TV. (For which I am grateful because I would have probably not been able to do that on my own. 😆)
She has a lovely home and a wonderful sunroom!!! 🪴
My daughter met up with me there and we enjoyed our stay very much! Kitchen was very functional and we made several meals together.
Our visit was mostly to catch up and hang out.... We really didn't leave the house much so I can't say much about the area. I had no concerns for safety though.
We loved the large bathroom. (I could not get the bathtub drain plug to hold water so I just improvised.)
Thanks for the lovely time!
Sarah"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was great We left a few things at home no need to worry cause she had everything you need The bed was comfortable and relaxing Will be returning If you're ever in Bloomington Illinois the Stewart's house is where you need to stay
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was really impressed. It was very clean yet comfy at the same time. Plenty of room, very peaceful, tucked away in a quiet neighborhood but close to a nice choice of restaurants. Wished I could’ve stayed longer. Will definitely check its availability on my next trip here."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great sisters weekend
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Well maintained house and yard. We always have issues finding places to stay with our dogs, and Sandy's place was very accommodating!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Sandy's place for four nights. The communication was polite and fast.
The (entire) house is in a very quite area of Bloomington. There is an auto shop in front of the house. But it was closed or quite the whole time. The accommodation comes with a large parking spot in front of the garage, which wasn't able to use.
Inside everything is a little old but it instantly felt comfy.
The downside was the hair on couch, kitchen and in the bathroom. Also the microwave was super dirty and the buttons were sticky.
A big(!) plus for the good internet and the nice TV with a lot of channels and streaming services."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a nice quiet place to stay. I was made to feel right at home as soon as I walked in the door. Very neat very clean and very hospital
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is GREAT! Four minutes from Grossinger Motors Arena. It's the perfect place to stay for IHSA State and ISU events. Sandy is very responsive. The house is huge and is very clean. It has a cute sunroom with a fireplace (with a heater insert). The kitchen is FULLY stocked. The bathroom is large. It has great water pressure and lots of hot water. The mattress is a memory foam pillowtop. We slept great. Donut the Wonder Beagle loved the backyard. We kept him on a leash just in case he could find an escape route. Lots of parking on the driveway and on the street. Sandy thoughtfully provided a dog food bowl, water bowl, toys, and a cage in case we had problems with our cage. We saved approximately $400 by staying at Sandy's place instead of a hotel and using the kitchen. It's in a very safe, quiet neighborhood. We will definitely be back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Of the many AirBnB's I've stayed in, Sandy's preparation for guests demonstrated the most thoughtfulness. Everything from instructions on working the TV to the single-serve hygiene products in the bathroom to the nice welcome note.
The location was easy to find and close to downtown Bloomington as well as to Veteran's Parkway. Both locations offer great places to eat, shop, etc.
Not just clean but ""comfortable"". I felt right at home. I could LIVE in the sunroom!!! So relaxing!
I was able to work remotely thanks to the easy connection to wifi.
I have a dog with extreme separation anxiety. It's really difficult to leave him behind when I travel. Thanks to Sandy's pet policy, I didn't have to. He enjoyed the visit as much as I did.
It's clear Sandy is invested in guests having the BEST experience. And I did...and would visit Sandy's place again in a heartbeat!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Sandy and the place was great!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Kevin was great. The house was awesome also! I had to stay for a couple months for work. Looking forward to rent from them again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"5 stars all the way! I'm impressed by the quality of the home, appliances, amenities, furniture, etc. Even the siding and porch are of the finest quality.
This is clearly a home where the hosts invested significantly and with care. And ""home"" is the accurate term. I immediately felt relaxed and welcomed with the considerable thoughtful touches.
It's a safe, lovely neighborhood, centrally located, with easy access to shopping, dining, etc.
I immediately recognized the scent of a clean house which is very nice considering I never experience that in my own home! 🙂
I'm grateful the host permitted my dog to stay as he enjoyed exploring the big backyard and neighborhood."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great house in a great location! We had everything we needed. Great communication with Kevin throughout the process, including ensuring we had everything we needed after check-in. Highly recommend! I will be staying here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place. Extremely clean, comfortable and in a very nice neighborhood."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Kevin’s place was as described on the pictures and the location was 15 min away from University area. The only reason I’m giving this place a 5 starts is because:
1. The host asked under additional request to start a load of laundry. Even tho we paid for cleaning fees. When I asked he responded they usually get behind with this and they ask the guest to start the laundry for them. Be aware of this requirement since you will need to make extra time to complete the request before checking out.
2. After removing the pillows liners we realized that the pillows had a lot of dog hair sticking to it (short black dog hair). This can be an issue for people with allergies. We literally sleep holding pillows with somebody’s dog hair and stained pillows. Not my dogs hair (my dog has long hair and he doesn’t shed - he is a Japanese Chin hypoallergenic).
3. The towels provided looked very used/old. Bring your own towels. Shower towels should look in a good condition. They needed to be replaced."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place and owned by great people ! Lovely furniture, very cozy , had an amazing kitchen and the master bathroom is completely upgraded. Totally worth it and One of my favorite homes I stayed at while in Bloomington for a few weeks."

2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, everything updated. Only thing I would ask, is for tv’s in the bedrooms. Otherwise, great place to stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay. Unfortunately, on the last day of my stay, the front door lock automatically unlocked the front door while I was cooking breakfast. It was around 7 AM on my final day, but I did not like the feeling of not being secure in my airbnb. I'm not sure if the host has a remote switch to unlock this door, but nonetheless, the door unlocked on it's own doing, and I did not like that very much. Everything else about the stay was fantastic. Thank you!"

It is within an easy ride to the Constitution Trail, which was a bonus. We would certainly recommend it and hope to return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this property to anyone! It was exceptionally clean and clutter free, very tastefully decorated and even better than described. The directions were very clear and Kevin was very quick to respond to any questions. We were visiting our son at ISU and it was very easy to access any place we needed to go. We will definitely keep this property in mind when visiting our college student."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My sister and I had a terrific stay at Kevin’s home. Everything was impeccable. So well laid out and squeaky clean. Beds are comfortable as well as linens. Kitchen super well appointed and the shower in the master bedroom is absolutely the best! Don’t hesitate to book this house. Kevin is very responsive, kind and always made sure we had whatever we needed. Thanks Kevin and Marilyn for a great stay. We will definitely be back!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very nice house . Meet all expectations.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very close to State Farm main corporate campus, a Jewel grocery store and a great new YMCA. Attractive, fully rehabbed vintage bungalow with terrific outdoor spaces: inviting front porch with seating, plants and overhead fan, and back patio in a well shaded yard with dining table and lounge. Comfortable master bed. Comfortable leather couch and cloth armchair. Kitchen is well outfitted and easy to use. Amenities very thoughtful. Great place for 1 to 4 people, especially a family, as the second bedroom has 2 single beds."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice house in a quiet neighborhood. Pretty setting. Very easy to find and is a nice location within a short drive of most everything in Bloomington. Owner is right next door so is able to respond quickly to problems. It was great!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have stayed at a lot of airbnb in Normal/Bloomington and this is by far one of the nicest. Kevin was very friendly and responsive.

We also enjoyed the well taken care of backyard & the quiet neighborhood. Looking forward to my next visit!"

The space is super well-kept. The kitchen, bedrooms, and bathrooms were spotless and had everything we needed.
My friend and I were in Bloomington for the weekend attending some trainings/classes nearby. I wish we hadn't been so busy during the stay so we could have enjoyed sitting on the back patio and front porch a bit more!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Loft was as advertised and perfect for graduation weekend. There are some good walkable places to grab a bite & a drink. Checkin instructions were thorough…we didn’t have any problems!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a lovely stay and in a great location. Lots to do walking distance. The host was responsive and helpful. Would stay again if we’re ever back in town! Thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed staying at this loft. It was easily found and very walkable to fun shops, parking was free and close, and the loft space was nicely decorated and clean. Even being right in town, it was amazingly quiet at night, which we appreciated. We definitely would love to rent this place again when we come back to the area to visit family."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying at The Loft. Great parking set up and easy to check in and out. Jessica was great at responding to my questions and helping me out. Will keep in mind for future when I drive that way again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,we love the Loft! really nice & clean place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’re downtown people and enjoyed our stay very much. It’s the kind of place you drive by and say out loud “I want to stay there” then you realize you ARE staying there.
Jessica was very clear about the parking but I’m not gonna lie, Bloomington has extremely difficult to decipher and strict parking rules. I got 3 tickets during my 5 night stay, but the tickets were $10/ea ($30 total) so I just paid it online. Frankly the tickets are cheaper than most parking lots.
Bathroom was solid and everything worked. If you’re there for First Friday you’ll have a blast checking out all the art studios."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really cool little studio apartment with plenty of space for one or two people. Great location right in the heart of downtown Bloomington. Had everything I needed. Would definitely stay again and would definitely recommend!

Easy check in and check out, and host was responsive when we had questions. Would stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"It’s a wonderful place and Jessica is a wonderful host. When I travel to Bloomington it’s always the first place I try to stay. Thanks Jessica, I’ll always look forward to returning. Until that day…..Rodney"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed 3 nights at the loft for an event that was in at The Castle, and I loved it!
The space is huge, and has everything needed for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
Jessica (host) was fantastic, I needed help with something and she responded within seconds and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable.
Very happy to give 5 stars, this place is great!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed while visiting relatives in Bloomington. Walking location in downtown near shops, restaurants."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place for a trip home! I’m walking distance to lots of local shops, clubs, and coffee shops.
Parking was the only thing that was interesting but she communicated where would be the best places to park. Great experience!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Jessica’s Place for out of town guests who where attending an event in downtown Bloomington.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Will use during next years homecoming.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay during family weekend at ISU. The natural light from the skylight was so nice and we really enjoyed the layout with the bedroom separated by some stairs. It was so comfortable and clean and the bath towels were so fluffy! Host Jessica was so communicative and checked-in a couple of times to make sure all was well, which was appreciated. We felt right at home and hope to stay here again sometime. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so good I wish Airbnb had a ""Better than 5 Star"" rating. Very clean, very comfortable, and incredibly convenient.
First of all, if you're coming to Bloomington for a show at The Castle, just stop looking and book this place right now before someone else does. It's such a quick walk to the venue and to all the great bars, restaurants, shops, and cafes downtown. I was here with friends for a show at The Castle, but when it ended they had to drive back to their hotels in the outlying areas and all I had to do was take a nice stroll back to the loft. The parking is very convenient less than a block away and I loved exploring the area.
And if you do want to check out the breweries and shops and restaurants around town and in Normal (and you should), it's a very easy drive.
This is a gem--I can't recommend it highly enough."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"One of the best hosts I've ever had, the loft is beautiful and the location is an amazing location in relation to downtown. 10/10 recommend for anyone staying in the Bloomington area.
Thanks a million Jessica!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great! The only thing is parking is a little difficult - you have to move your car before 11 AM if you are parking at the garage! And you can only park there once a dance so if you're not leaving the place often you have to move around your car every 90 minutes. Other than that it was great!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This property is my favorite place to stay while in Bloomington - quiet, simple decor, comfortable bed, consistent wi-fi, responsive host, simply terrific. I really enjoy and take full advantage of the walkability to downtown Bloomington. Overall, a terrific stay!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Right in the heart of old downtown. Can walk for breakfast, lunch, dinner there. Lively and active area, always something going on. Live bands, food, farmers market on Saturday, shops, coffee…me and my son loved it. We went out every night and day. Never bought groceries…lol, always ate out. Worked good for nearby baseball tournaments. Was nice with keyless entry set up too."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have been better. We had a weekend convention at grossinger arena so we parked and we’re able to walk the whole weekend. When we finished for the days we could veg out at the loft. It’s SO perfect and adorable and comfortable. Perfect

The home was well stocked but I’d make one recommendation: provide soap/body wash. Otherwise, Jessica provided all the essentials and a very comfortable place to stay."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I very much enjoyed the stay!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place has to be the best location for staying in downtown Bloomington. Lovely loft like space. My only concern is the white carpet which looks nice but doesn’t seem practical for guests coming and going. I got tired of taking my shoes off and on every time I entered the apartment. Otherwise a fantastic place to stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica’s place was as described and very nice inside. For being in downtown Bloomington the apartment was quiet at night even over the weekend. The design inside is well done and check in and check out was efficient and clear.

The place has a great artists loft vibe (which it apparently once was!)
Airy and bright
Really comfy bed
Cool skylight gives great natural light.

Covered public garage parking is just a short block away but there is loading zone short term parking right in front for in/out convenience.
This loft worked out great for me and I would definitely stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great studio apartment right in the middle of downtown. Within walking distance of Common Ground, Lucca Grill, coffee and everything else. Internet was fantastic with a small desk if you need to do some remote work. More like this, please."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jessica’s place was great. Located steps away from downtown shops and restaurants. The place was very clean and beds were comfortable. We couldn’t ask for more.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was a great host and we really enjoyed her place. It is right in the center of all the action in Bloomington
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft is the perfect spot for a cute stay in Downtown Bloomington! It is centrally located to all the action and you are steps away from the charming downtown scene. The loft itself was very warm and welcoming, and was just right for two people. I recommend stocking up on some groceries/supplies because while Downtown Bloomington does offer several places to eat, the scene can be a bit quiet on weekends and late at night. The loft has a fridge and microwave, so you’ll be set having a place to keep and reheat tasty leftovers and midnight snacks. Fortunately, you are less than a mile walk away from a Wal-Greens and other shops.
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and the Loft was the cherry on top of a wonderful weekend. Our trip was made all the better by Jessica! She is very friendly and responsive, so you are in very good hands with her.
If you’re looking to stay in Downtown Bloomington, book the loft and enjoy a charming downtown scene with tasty food and friendly neighbors."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jessica's place was super cute! Super comfy couch and bed, and very clean. There's a bunch of bars and shops in walking distance."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for one or two people! Very cozy and quiet, and super close to several fun restaurants and shops in downtown Bloomington. I'll be coming back!"
2022-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,"The street the BnB is on is a little sketchy.. upon arriving I was asked for money and people sleep in the parking garage. However it is only a block away from Main Street with a fabulous little bakery called Ivy Lane and awesome food at Reality Bites.
The temperature is super inconsistent, but it adjusts pretty quickly.
Be prepared the fridge/freezer is a little small.
The loft area is amazing. The bed was comfortable. The desk was great to work from and had such a cute light. The closet had a lot of space. There is a collection of games, but no table to really play on.
Jessica made up for any negatives. She was extremely responsive and super attentive to our needs. Offered to clean, restock and exchange towels during our stay. This was amazing and I have never had this prior at a BnB."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jessica is a great host, her place is very clean and in a good location. Would stay again."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won't find a better deal in town. The loft is clean, spacious and well kept. The parking garage is a 20 second walk, it's free, and there's always spaces available. Jessica was especially responsive, pleasant to speak with, and is respectful of privacy (especially important for an Air BnB host). Highly recommend, especially for such a low price."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing host!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was a pleasure to work with and very thoughtful. The loft is a perfect place to relax but there is a wonderful work space if you have a few things to take care of. I would absolutely stay in this place on another trip.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jessica is an amazing host! The space is very clean and the bed was so comfy! Your stay will feel warm and welcoming, and the location is perfect DT! There a couple cute bakeries and coffee shops in the area and all walkable. The perks are great too, free parking and cable. You’re also central to alot of restaurants nothing is more than a 10 minute drive!
In addition I would say the space is child friendly too!! Everything is tidy and well organized, we stayed with my 11 month daughter and there was plenty of room for our pack n play and she loved going up and down the stairs! Jessica was so understanding the entire stay! Look no further, and you won’t regret your stay!"

The dart board, air hockey and ping pong table was a blast with the family. Thanks for hosting us in your beauty home. We'll be back when in town with the family."

Liked the location of being within minutes of shopping and restaurants. I would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough about this property. I am an out of county attorney and I was on trial in McLean County and needed a place to stay that was close to the courthouse. Brady was extremely attentive to my needs and I will be contacting him in the future when I am on trial in McLean.

We had to do some food preparation for an 80th birthday party and the kitchen could not have been better! The furniture was comfortable…especially the linens on the beds.

1 out of 5 stars if you’re a light or moderate sleeper. Four way stop on a constant, very busy intersection. If you can sleep with earplugs or if noise doesn’t bother you, this 2 bedroom duplex is awesome."

I’ve lived in the community for 35 years and have recently left due to retirement. It was wonderful to come back and stay in the “campus cottage.” I would highly recommend this place for anyone that wants to experience Illinois State University, Wesleyan University and the town of Normal.
A cozy Airbnb that feels like your “home“!
Thanks to Mark and Michelle for making this a great trip!
We will be back ❣️"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came in for my son’s graduation. The place is adorable, clean and in a good location. Wish I would have brought my fur babies. The fenced in back yard would have been perfect for them!"

Comfortable bedding & sitting areas made it feel like we were home away from home.
Thanks for hosting us! Hope we head this way again sometime!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Mark & Michelle's AirBnb! The place is super cute & feels very homey. It is an excellent location & everything is super easy to navigate. Would 100% stay again if I find myself in the area. Thanks!!

We were in town to watch our son play baseball at Illinois State University and everything about the place was perfect for our needs. We stay at Airbnb's quite often and felt that at this price point, Mark and Michelle's place was the best we have experienced! Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This little place is adorably decorated. Absolutely everything is labeled so clearly (cupboards, lights, controls, etc.) that there was no time wasted wondering where things were or how they worked. SO helpful! Nice touches included separate dog towels for muddy paws, a supply of snacks, water and coffee, and best of all: the recommendation for Rosie's restaurant! A quick 6min drive for a delicious dinner. The neighborhood was quiet, perfect for walking.
The only thing short of a 5-star review is the (queen) bed which was maybe a little older, and tough for our older bodies to sleep soundly on. Probably not an issue for younger travelers, though!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a last minute trip to Normal for a family matter and decided to Airbnb instead of getting a hotel. This home was perfect for our overnighter and everything published online matched our stay. This home was very clean, cozy, and thankfully close to our services. Thank you for making our stay easy ;)."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Campus Cottage exceeded my expectations! As an ISU alum this house was very fitting. The place was immaculately clean and the decor was so beautiful. The bathroom was stocked with all of your basic amenities and had heated floors. This place was very spacious and even had a basement with a washer and dryer. The host were very responsive and the directions for check-in and check-out were very clear. The fridge was stocked with water and soda. There were snacks and other kitchen amenities provided for you to enjoy. I did appreciate that everything was labeled for easy access. I didn’t get a chance to enjoy the backyard but it would be a great area to relax and enjoy the outdoors. I would highly recommend campus cottage to others. Thanks again Mark and Michelle for a great stay! I felt right at home and will for sure book again in the future.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I just can't say enough how charming the little cottage was. I've also never had more thoughtful hosts in every detail from notes to snacks to board games and any comfort you need (extra blankets, pillows, etc). I didn't bring my dog but they have a cute highly fenced yard, as well as doggie towels, leashes I think, bowls, etc .
I'm so excited to stay there again in the future, and may even check out their other properties if I get more family together!
the reviews are legit. class A hosts here!
❤️"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time back on ISU's campus. Mark and Michelle were excellent hosts.

Every inch of this awesome little home has been thoughtfully decorated, appointed, labeled and includes everything you might need and more - way more. It is like the Property Brothers created the best AirBnB ever! Comfortable, cozy, inviting, snacks, drinks, an entire cabinet set up to make waffles, an M&M filled gum-ball machine, cool lighting, stuff to make our little doggo happy, fun and useful things everywhere. I only wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you for ruining every other place we’ll ever stay!"

I had access to their WiFi so I could watch my Netflix shows & they recommended a great restaurant where I ordered a pizza & had it delivered. Michelle was very accommodating when I asked for a one hour later checkout time since I had stayed up late binge watching my favorite show. I was really impressed when I noticed that their bathroom floor was heated. They thought of everything! 😁"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay! Your home was comfortable, cozy and well appointed. We loved the enclosed back yard and beautiful flowers. Thanks for the M & M's! Our grandson was a chef at Rosie's so we appreciated that menu. The doggie rags and accessories were a surprise. Love the heated floor in the bathroom.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I came to do some househunting and explore the town, and could not have asked for a better location. The EV charger was so nice, they have a 220v plug right where you park.
My only complaint is the front stairs up to the porch. They're a bit awkward heights and I stumbled more than once trying to get up them, granted I've got arthritis in one of my knees. I just kept the front door locked and only used the back door."

If I had to describe this home in a few words I would say it was cutely decorated , comfortable beds and furniture, convenient location and amenities and cleverly setup to maximize the use.
Michelle and Mark have taken the time to label where everything is and provided the basic essentials. There home had a college vibe but very tastefully done. We will definitely plan on staying here again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my second time staying at this location and like always I had the best time. I had an issue with flights but Mark and Michelle immediately helped me extend my stay so I wasn’t stranded. Not only did they extend the stay but even updated me on the yard work they had already scheduled for one of the days I had added due to the plane situation and offered to reschedule and asked me if I was comfortable. The place is a 1000/10 just like the host! Next time I’m in town I would love to check out their other locations and you should too!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mark and Michelle’s place was absolutely perfect! So cute, has absolutely everything you’d need, and is the most organized air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. For example, I was going to make coffee and at first couldn’t find the k cups. Then I see a label next to the keurig that literally says “k cups are on the wall behind you.” 😅 amazing! Also, can’t forget to mention the bathroom! Heated floors and a lighted sink- fancy! Definitely will try to stay here every time we visit Bloomington-Normal!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mark and Michelle's campus cottage was perfect. They should be designers of tiny houses. It was exactly and described. It was immaculately clean and so many thoughtful touches left for us like bottles of water, soda, ice, coffee, snacks, games, extra towels and blankets.

Greg was also one of the best hosts I’ve had with air bnb. He was very quick to respond and checked to make sure check in and the place met expectations. When we first got there (relatively late at night), the fire alarm was chirping from a low battery. I messaged Greg to let him know and within 10 minutes or so, he had taken care of the issue. This is a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place in Bloomington."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Only stayed for one night and I didn’t go out in the neighborhood but the cleanliness of the place and the historical yet modern style decor made it possible to relax and rest and also it felt safe.
The house is shared but the apartment is private we didn’t interact with other guests.
The kitchen is very well stocked and every utensil was squicky clean. The layout is a bit unusual but it flows. The bathroom and bathroom linen were pristine. Host communicates well and fast. Definitely recommend and I would stay here again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Greg was flexible and responsive. The space exceeded expectations. Definitely recommend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,great host and great apartment!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was beautiful and better than expected. It was very clean. Communication was easy and they checked to make sure everything was good after our arrival. The door has an electronic lock with code and it was super easy to let ourselves in. Wifi information was provided in a convenient location inside so our kid didn't have to bug us for the information. They provided extra blankets which came in handy with the cold weather. We are from Florida and not used to such low temperatures. It was easy and quick to warm the space. There were smart tvs there that we could use our own streaming services on. The beds were very big and comfortable. The place was decorated so well that we took notes for our own house. We loved the artwork and decorations. We didn't need to rent a car (we flew in) because everything is in walking distance. It was great! We will definitely use this host in the future.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Greg was a responsive host with a clean, modern place with easy access to what we needed in Bloomington"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friends and I were in town for a concert at the Castle Theater and wanted to find something that was walkable. Not only is this location walkable, it also neighbors a great local bar and restaurant.
Greg and Celeste are experts in hospitality. From their proactive and friendly communication to their dedication to ensuring we had an excellent visit, I feel that this exceeded the hospitality of many hotels. Getting in the space was a breeze and it didn’t feel like we were responsible for a bunch of chores upon leaving as with many properties.
As far as the property itself, it exceeded all expectations. This is one of the few times where what you see in the photos is what you get in person. The photos show a pristine, modern, luxurious space. Unlike other bnb experiences, it was as clean and fresh as advertised. This made for such a comfortable stay and it’s too bad we didn’t stay longer. There is beautiful decor, state of the art appliances, and cozy bed linens. Highly recommend!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful place with some elegant vintage touches. Easy place to find and parking super easy, bar right next door if you're hungy or need a drink."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Really nice place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Repeat customer for a reason! Wonderful place to stay!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,it was wonderful! would definitely recommend
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was the perfect cozy spot for a weekend away with a knitting friend. The couch was a perfect set up for hours of comfortable crafting. The kitchen was well stocked. Even though we dealt with below zero weather, the house was still comfy and cozy. I'll return to this house if I happen to need another weekend away soon."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place and it was beautiful. The only quirk was the second room being open to the living room. But we didn’t need that privacy so it was fine but others might not like that. The house was exactly how it was advertised so that was great.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a girls night in this Airbnb and it was fabulous. Beautifully decorated with original woodwork and modern touch. Extremely clean! We will definitely be going back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts definitely made sure we enjoyed our stay. There's parking right next to the secured (fancy locks) entrance so we didn't have to walk far and we felt safe. The apartment is exactly like the pictures. It was clean right down to the sparkling silverware. Has taller ceilings with two king beds. The bed with the big columns/posts is firm and the one with the grey cover was like sinking into a cloud! Big tv's, wide reclining sectional, fancy/modern appliances, mix between ultra modern and charming old victorian style. Fluffy towels, incredibly soft blankets and sheets, coffee bar. I honestly thought for the price I paid that I would get there and something would be wrong.. but it was perfect."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is cozy, warm, perfect mixture of modern and old 1800 charm. The Hugh beds, original fireplaces, and period furnishings mixed, with a modern bathroom, and kitchen make this home relaxing. It is walking distance to downtown Bloomington restaurants, cafes, shops, and Constitution trail. Greg, added a couple of well placed holiday ornaments, to really make our holiday home away from home even more special. Thank you and we hope to stay here every year."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Greg and Celeeste’s. The apartment is beautiful and we felt so at home, the Christmas decorations were a great warm added touch as well! Communication was great, ease of check-in appreciated and value for the cost excellent as well. We will definitely book again with Greg when we are in town!"
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our only complaint would be we couldn’t stay longer. This is an older home that’s been renovated. They’ve kept some of the original charm with some of the hardwood floors, beautiful fireplaces and hearths. This place is beautifully decorated, updated appliances and amenities. It was next door to a great place to eat and socialize. A little street noise because it’s on a corner but not enough to bother us at all. We had issues figuring out the tv’s. But that nothing to complain about. It’s a great place, the price was more than reasonable. They have it listed as a “Luxury Apartment” and it was. Better than a hotel for sure. Our hosts were pleasant and more than ready to help."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, friendly hosts, and very well kept"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay for business in the area. Convenient location
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home was easy to find, especially with the check in instructions including pictures. The movie themed space was a lot of fun and made our stay feel like a vacation. It was also very sweet of them to leave small snacks and beverages. We loved that we could easily walk downtown to the Castle Theatre as well. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mark and Michelle were wonderful hosts. Very flexible and accommodating. Their property was beautiful and immaculately clean. 10/10 recommendation from us!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay in one of Mark and Michelle's homes and we were again delighted. Their homes are perfect -- great location, amazing decorations, every amenity and brilliantly organized. We will absolutely stay with them each time we are in town."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Probably one of the cutest AirBnb’s I’ve stayed in! The theme was so cute and I loved how it changed slightly from room to room. ALSO everything is so clearly labeled that it’s obvious they really thought about everything (e.g., a sign asking if you’re too hot or cold and where to find the thermostat). They have little extras stocked in case you forget something. It was truly a nice stay for the couple of days that I needed."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place! Easy access. Has everything you need.
I appreciated the welcome snacks!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"what a great place to stay. very comfortable & quiet, close to restaurants or groceries. we would love to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our first experience with an AirBnB, and if they're all like this, we'll never stay in a hotel again. We were walking distance from the downtown. The apartment is in excellent condition and has a nice layout. It is well-furnished with new appliances, a nice bed, and so many little extras it was like family set it up for us. It also has a very fun theme with many cute little touches and an Alexa for music. So easy to get there and get inside. It was also very easy to work with Mark and Michelle (even though we were probably annoying as first-timers). I had a question about the central air control after we arrived and got an IMMEDIATE response. (Also, the AC is very nice -- kept the temp perfectly throughout the apartment and was whisper quiet) The neighbors were very quiet too, or else it's just got great walls. We didn't here a peep the entire time. It was very comfortable and relaxing. Can't wait to stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of the nicest AirBnB locations I have ever had the pleasure to rent. I was sorry I was only staying one night. The hosts went out of their way to make sure that everything a guest could possibly need was available. There were so many thoughtful touches. I really enjoyed staying in this apartment. Thank you to Mark and Michelle for a wonderful stay.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent residence, would definitely stay again. Residence was close to many activities and things to do. Loved the privacy of the unit and felt right at home."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was the perfect spot for our visit to town to see a concert. The apartment is just like the pictures. All the little touches made it so nice. And it was easy to walk to the Castle Theater and to dinner.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We usually stay in Normal but decided to try Bloomington and was not disappointed! We enjoyed our short stay. The decor was fun! The furniture was comfortable. And we liked having a private spot to park our car. Highly recommend!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space was so fun and the amenities were incredibly thoughtful. The bed was comfortable and the airbnb comes equipped with an Alexa. Only complaint is that the walls were thin so you could hear neighbors, but thankfully we could use the Alexa as a sound machine which drowned out the noise. Mark & Michelle were communicative about an item we left behind and were very accommodating so we could get it back. Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was perfect and had everything we needed

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I absolutely LOVED this spot!
Pulling up, the neighborhood was dark and seemed sketchy. I also had a hard time seeing the apartment number, but all of these things were more of a ""me"" problem because I arrived later than anticipated. Had it been daytime, my perspective may have been different
The parking space and apartment number were very clear and helpful. The apartment space itself was very absolutely adorable! The layout was very open and spacious. It was very clean. The theme was on point, and the little messages from the hosts had me smiling.
I loved that the TVs were set to welcome me and that the hosts included snacks and drinks. It just felt good. I am disappointed that I had a very limited time there and hope to find another reason to visit with my partner and son.
I've never stayed in an AirBnB before, and these hosts set the bar extra high."

The place was immaculate, true to online photos and location is perfect. Everything is a 10 minute drive. Franklin Park is within walking distance.
I grew up in Bloomington, moved away 25 years ago, to Florida. I remember this house and always loved it. I came back to sprinkle my brothers ashes near our moms grave. He was killed in a bicycle/vehicle accident in Florida.
I needed peace, this place was perfect.
I had a couple friends pick me up and they wanted a tour. They loved it as well.
Bloomington is a hidden gem. People are kind and genuine. Lots of great spots to eat.
And now, this awesome airBnb. I will definitely rebook as I do come back quite often.
Thank you to my hosts.

The ENTIRE rental was decked out in movie themed decor. Examples include posters of pulp fiction, a Jaws shower curtain, and a stage light accent piece!
Everything in the rental was clearly labeled, whether it be the remotes that turned on colored LED's above the kitchen and behind the TV, or the laundry closet where guests can place their dirty towels.

It's located a couple blocks away from downtown, so easy to find restaurants and spots open most times of day, and the main drags are walkable. The apt was quite large, and the separate bedroom quite roomy. It was nice to have little snacks, and they had a yoga mat (a nice Gaiam one, I might add) available after I inquired. The porch was nice for sitting and having coffee or take-out. There was a mixup one day with parking onsite, but there is plenty of parking on the residential street, so it wasn't a problem. I would definitely stay again."

Great place, comfortable and spacious with lots of style and features. Highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great amenities - anything you could ever want in a place. Everything labeled and I. It’s place - a lot of thought has gone into this place. Couldn’t be happier with it.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolute gem in this quaint Midwest city. We loved the theme and attention to details. Bed was clean and comfy and I loved that all the drawers and cabinets were labeled!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,This was the second time I stayed in The Spotlight Studio. I had a very comfortable stay. I also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood & to the downtown area. Mark & Michelle are great hosts!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even though we were just in town for a night this was one of the best AirBnb’s we’ve stayed at! We’re already talking about coming back for a little staycation. I HIGHLY recommend this hidden gem in Bloomington, IL!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Mark & Michelle’s “Spotlight Studio” is by far one of the cutest & most fun Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. It’s like hanging out at your (cool friend’s) place. It’s super clean, comfortable, and has everything you need. They even have some special surprises! The neighborhood is safe & walkable and there are cool things to do nearby."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"An excellent place to spend the night. We look forward to rebooking Mark & Michelle's place again to have a weekend ""in"" to spend time watching movies and having popcorn. The place was perfect for two and we will return!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Im convinced Mark and Michelle are my movie cousins. Their place is a hidden gem. The space truly takes you to the movies. Everything you need is right in the home. It is close to the downtown Bloomington area. The small touches and welcome notes make this stay special. You will have a great stay. I'll be back for the Indiana Jones and Star Wars collection alone.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Totally enjoyed our time here!! Wish we would have booked for longer. The place is very clean, updated, and decorated to perfection. The hosts were kind, responsive, & welcoming. Additionally, we were overjoyed at the small details added to the room such as the popcorn buckets filled with snacks & m&m machine. The location was perfect for everything that we planned to do. A short car ride was all that’s we needed to get to downtown & to view the close by historic neighborhoods.
Truly a great place!"

Hope I can visit again in the future.
