2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! My friend and I felt right at home and loved every minute of our stay. I travel to this area frequently and will definitely book again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Pam was an excellent host. Her home is quaint and was relaxing to stay in. We were able to bring our dog and he loved the use of yard. We will definitely book Pam’s place again.
2024-01-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Pam was nice and communicated well. Enid is small so location is pretty central, but to be honest we did not enjoy our stay. We were skeptical upon pulling into neighborhood. Very run down area. The outer appearance was quite concerning. There were three cars parked in drive next to home. Inside was clean, but very old. Furnace does not heat bedrooms unless doors are left open. The furniture felt like sitting on plywood. The beds were comfortable, but they were so squeaky I thought I was going to wake my baby every time I moved. The shower is tiny! You couldn’t turn around without opening the curtain. I’m not trying to be rude. Like I said, Pam was a good host, but the home does not meet rental standards, in my opinion. We would not recommend or return."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Charming old home, clearly remodeled and excellently done. Very detail oriented and kind host. Cozy atmosphere.
Found a couple nails poking out of the floor in front bedroom so something to be mindful of if you stay here. It is an old home."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved how easy the process was from the beginning and how responsive Pam was whenever I had any questions.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cute & comfy! Worked so well for our family of 4 plus 2 doggos. Clean, comfy beds - we often kept the sofa pulled out so it was a big lounge sofa! Pam has done a great job with an older house, setting it up to be such a relaxing spot to come home to after a day out."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice home and host
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything good.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay. I was impressed with how quickly Pam got back to me when the door wouldn’t lock as we were leaving the first time. (We pushed the Yale button as directed, and waited to hear the locking mechanism. It took several tries, but it finally locked.) Pam checked in with me before arrival, during our stay, and after we checked out. Super helpful and accommodating! Excellent host!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is an older home that made me feel right at home! Wanted a place to get my mom out of her normal surroundings and this was great! She came over to visit and loved it! Only a few minutes from my mom's house so the back and forth wasn't bad at all. Pam responded quickly, no matter the time of day. She communicated very well. The decor was great, the atmosphere. My pet ended up not coming but he would have loved the back yard. This place owes us nothing except to be available next time we visit! Thanks again Pam!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house to stay in while in Enid. Right across from the High School which worked out great for us as we were attending a football game.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pam’s house was the perfect place for me to stay while I was in town visiting family. It is an older house in an older neighborhood, but Pam has fixed up the interior of her house and it was very welcoming. The window a/c units kept the house plenty cool in the Oklahoma summer heat. Every amenity needed was in the kitchen, plenty of towels in the bathroom, and lots of fluffy pillows on the beds. Next time I travel to Enid, I’ll be sure to check to see if this home is available for me to stay in."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Easy check in, comfortable and and clean."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Older home in older neighborhood but both were clean and safe. Very close to Enid high school. I was initially concerned when I saw there were windows air conditioning units (it was 103 degrees outside when I arrived!) but there was a unit in almost every room and the house was very comfortable. Loved the claw foot bath tub! Bed was very comfortable. Kitchen has a few older home “quirks” like oddly placed switches and plug ins, but easily figured out. Pam super friendly and responsive to all my questions."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed while waiting for housing at Vance AFB, and it was just what we were looking for!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was the perfect house for our stay in Enid for two couples. It was quiet with empty lots on two sides. Two driveways made it easy to park our two vehicles. The house was clean and comfortable. Pam was super responsive and we’d definitely recommend staying here.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host, clean house."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Pam's place was perfect for what we needed. We were in town for business and was able to bring our dog with us. The back yard was great for our dog to exercise in a fenced in area. The neighborhood was quiet even during school hours (high school next door). We were never disturbed. Communication was amazing and any questions we had were answered. Definitely recommend and will stay here again!!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Comfortable stay, quiet neighborhood."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable home with everything we needed for our stay. We had to unexpectedly make the trip to Enid and found the home just as listed and in great condition. When we had to extend our stay they were very accommodating. Thank you for helping us during our difficult time.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Pam’s place was perfect! Pam was very responsive and friendly the entire time we stayed. Pam allowed us to check in a little early which worked perfect since we brought our baby along. We made the mistake of not following the instructions when leaving the house and Pam had her aunt come help within 30 minutes. Her aunt was just as friendly and made sure we got back in the house even though it was late. We enjoyed the cozy living area and kitchen! Everything was clean and exactly as advertised. We will definitely be staying at Pam’s place the next time we are in Enid. Thank you Pam for your amazing hospitality!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was great. We felt safe as this house is by itself, but near a high school with a lighted parking lot. We were able to walk on the track at the high school. The bed was very comfortable and we would stay again."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"On a recent visit to Enid, we stayed at Pam's cute home. It was perfect for us. We were in town for activities at Vance AFB and Pam's place is very convenient to the base. During downtime, Pam's place was the perfect place to relax, fix a meal and chill. Pam's place is also convenient to the rest of Enid. We enjoyed visiting the park and seeing the wonderful Christmas decorations. If you are in Enid for activities at Vance AFB or just passing through, I highly recommend staying at Pam's bungalow."

2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, this was a great stay. It was close to everything and felt super safe. It is right by the school, so if you come during the week just be warned that you will be awakened by the marching band lol. The house is pretty old and it shows. There’s no central air nor any fans in the bedrooms, so just be prepared that it will be a bit hot when you get there. Could use a little renovation, but overall I liked the house!"

I was able to comfortably live here for about a month and didn’t need to purchase any soaps/laundry supplies/kitchen items. The place was fully stocked and nicely decorated.

The house is just what I was looking for, it was perfect. A short, five minute drive to the hospital. Even shorter to the downtown area. Minutes from Callaghan’s, Axe throwing, breweries, Cafe Volare for brunch and Napoli’s for Italian. Less than ten minutes from Walmart and groceries. House is COMPLETELY stocked with dishes, appliances, pots/pans, coffee pot, even a blender for smoothies. Even supplied basic cooking spices, condiments, detergents, ziplocks, trash bags, q-tips… every detail was taken care of. Was easily able to cook full meals. Stepped right into the house and had everything needed to live for weeks.
Gorgeous, magical back yard area. Loved the hanging chair. If visiting from out of town, make sure you visit the event Center a couple miles away, Gloss Mountain and crystal digging at the Salt Plains."

It was my happy place. :) I will definitely stay at Chellsie’s properties next time I’m in Enid if they are available."

In all our travels around the world staying in Air BnBs we have never been in a home that was as clean, warm, and inviting as Randy’s. This place had everything. This place was outfitted to a T. There wasn’t anything we needed that Randy hadn’t thought of in advance. Randy has gone the extra mile. He has added all sorts of soothing accent lights in and outside the property. The backyard is private and relaxing. Even a small area to chip a few golf balls. Randy was very proactive in communicating with us. If we had a question we always got a quick response. His “Welcome” book is very extensive and informative with many photos. We enjoyed several of the recommendations around town. We were visiting and helping with grandkids on this visit so to come back each evening to Randy’s place was just what we needed to recharge. Don’t pass this place up if visiting Enid and/or the local area. We’ll be back. Thanks Randy."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If we could give Randy's Airbnb 10 stars we would! It was exactly as described in the listing, immaculately clean and well stocked, and beautifully decorated.

Although he lives next door, he respected our privacy & asked when it would be most convenient TO US for him to come over to water the plants outside or cut the grass. We had a 2-day drive from PA, & it felt so welcoming & peaceful when we arrived & during our stay. The back yard & patio were so enjoyable to relax in, and the yard was very private.

The extra items provided by Randy were super helpful and really saved me in a pinch. the beds are very comfortable and have multiple pillows, so there is sure to be one you will enjoy. all of the extra lighting really made the place seem like home because you could customize almost every aspect of the place. The TV in the living room was amazing and HUGE. All of the couches reclined which is a big deal in my book! and don't get me started on the backyard! the chipping area is amazing and made for a fun activity to do while you are in between work or other activities. the back porch was very comfortable and well kept like the rest of the property. Every single area of our stay was absolutely fantastic. not a single complaint! (ps.Randy and his wife are perfect!)"

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Place matched description fairly well. I didn’t realize it was a duplex at first - but Cynde explains that in her description. Neighbors were loud and used a lot of foul language. There is one drive way and neighbor takes it up with a large truck, so plan to park in street. Price was about the same as the holiday inn - so for one night it might beneficial to stay in hotel. Overall it’s ok place to stay and host was very responsive."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place for a quick getaway with the kids. it seemed like it hadn't been lived in for a little bit before I got there, so it was a little stagnate, but that's a quick fix. Cynde was very sweet and was there to help!"

We did not want to stay in a hotel because we had a 5 weeks stay and our business project required to get up at 5 every morning. Since no AirBnB with at least 4 bed rooms was available in the area, Daniel arranged the dining room with some seperators, so we almost had some kind of 4th bed room. We had some minor issues but technicians were arranged instantly. Plenty of coffee was provided, as well as detergent and dish washer tabs. Internet, TV workes as needed and the nearby Wal Mart made it easy to get something to eat if we got home real late. Not only for us a great place to stay but also for families."

The bed linens were very comfy, the towels were fluffy, and there were even beach towels conveniently located near the back door by the pool! We traveled in late May, and nights were still a bit cool. However, we were still able to swim since the pool was heated! So convenient! Daniel was very accommodating and quick to respond anytime we reached out to him. In fact, we were looking for a muffin pan one morning, and his response to our question – he dropped pans off at the door for us within 5 minutes! The spacious home is conveniently located close to a grocery store, pharmacy, and several restaurants! Having a washer and dryer was an added bonus, and the home was stocked with laundry detergent and dryer sheets as well!

I had everything I needed (fridge, washer/dryer, stovetop, jacuzzi, outdoor seating, much more) and the location was great. You get the peaceful, rural view sitting in the back overlooking farmland, but are also just 5 minutes away from all the urban conveniences! The space was very clean and the hosts are amazingly accommodating. The neighborhood was a perfect, safe place for my evening jog. I loved the privacy of the unit (fenced and self-check in). I’ll definitely be visiting again, and would recommend to anyone!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"SUCH a cute place! The great thing about it is you drive through a typical residential area to get there, but once you arrive and get a glimpse of the backyard view it’s like you’ve been transported to a totally different place. Each night was like a front row seat to the prettiest sunsets. Loved the swinging bench and fire pit. Hot water and AC work great. Comfy bed. Super spacious. Neighborhood was very peaceful and a very short drive to Walmart and plenty of convenient stores. A lovely little getaway for a great price!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Brooke’s is a great host! Even better than the location. The location is great. Like 5 min to everything. And Brooke had great suggestions!
We loved the space. Felt at home and was beautiful!
Brooke even went above and beyond and even brought our kids tissue paper when she found out our kids were having runny noses.
She is fantastic!
The only thing that stopped us from giving a five star on the location is:
1) There was no grill as advertised.
2) That we got a nail in our tire from their remodeling which they said they would make sure to fix.
3) The back porch and garage back door locks were not great. If someone stayed next to us I would wonder if they could get in. Also we didn’t love the shared backyard with another unit which will be one day another Airbnb. I am sure they will put a privacy fence and hopefully will fix this. They seem like great people.
But this is a great deal and even better host! Don’t let those very small things sway you from booking."

We were in Enid sooner than anticipated and reached out to Sarah to see if we were able to check in an hour sooner; she responded promptly and allowed us to, which was great!
My only complaint, which is minor, is that the hot water ran out somewhat quickly in the shower. I showered for about 10 minutes and then the temperature began to drop quickly. Since we were not spending the bulk of our time in the rental, this was minor.
Overall, we would stay here again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic place to stay.

I communicated with the host about 5-6 hours before we arrived about extra blankets or a blow up mattress since my children are older and might not want to sleep together anymore. He was sure there was not extra cover or a mattress but would see what he could find on a Sunday. When we arrive he had secured a brand new blow up mattress, sheets, blanket and two extra pillows. The private garage (that we were allowed to use), elevator and private entrance were an extra bonus too!! Y’all go ahead and book. You won’t be disappointed. Be safe out there."

Good location, and the property was very clean."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, lots of space, tons of dresser and closet space, beautifully furnished, good location. The shower heads are nice and high, so tall people will fit, but the height is not adjustable. Nice large kitchen space, but not alot of cookware, which was fine for us because we didn't intend to cook anyway. Everyone who visited us while we were there commented on how amazing the place was. The owners were friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay the again."

We had an issue with the door code and they were there within 5 min to help out. There were several restaurants and bars within walking distance. Definitely recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was in a beautiful neighborhood! With little ones, it was very convenient to walk to the large nearby park as well as the walking trails. The house was spotless and oh so cute! When we needed a question answered, Allison responded immediately. Definitely the Airbnb to stay in if you’re coming to Enid, Oklahoma! Another family in our group also rented an Airbnb in Enid and it was nowhere near what we got at Allison‘s place! It had three bedrooms and two baths, but the trade-off for that extra bath was not worth it. It was dreary, run down, not clean, and not decorated or accessorized at all. And yes, the rate per night was slightly cheaper but you pay for what you get!! In the future if we return to Enid, we know exactly where we will be staying! Thank you Allison!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We cannot imagine a better experience than at Allison’s house. The home is exactly as presented. Everything works properly. The home is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood convenient to downtown and everything on W. Garriott Dr.

Aroma machine was a nice touch. TVs in all rooms and in main room with a well stocked kitchen. The list goes on, absolutely the best AirBnB we’ve stayed at. We’ll definitely be back when we return to Enid. Thank you Allison."

Having a separate work space was fantastic, and the bedrooms being separated means you won't disturb a travel partner who goes to bed early and gets up early. Easy in & out access to the home, great neighborhood, and convenient central location. Allison made sure we had what we needed and was responsive to all communication. Thanks for a great stay!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family visited Enid for a family reunion. My husband and I and our 8mo old, as well as my sister and her 3yr old spent 6 nights at Allison's home. The location is great! The neighborhood is super walkable and close to a park and many great restaurants and stores. Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations, so much so we didn't want it to end! Allison's house is beautifully decorated and no stone was left unturned in making our stay beyond comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer as well as the fully stocked kitchen was essential when traveling with kids. We enjoyed trying all of the Young Living products Allison provided, and I appreciated the low tox feature of the home with the cleaning products used. Everything was spotlessly clean! The provided bathroom amenities were also great and made our stay extra special. All in all, it was abundantly clear Allison takes pride in providing her home to her guests and wants them to feel well taken care of - we sure did!"

The modern furniture was suitable for the younger kids to lay on and relax. The contained back yard was great for the grandkids. We are so pleased. with everything.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Allison is such a welcoming and kind host who made sure to provide more than enough for us during our stay. The beautiful home is in a quiet and equally beautiful neighborhood filled with friendly neighbors. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would stay again if we visited again. The price for this Airbnb is more than fair and made coming home to it after a work day something to look forward to. The kitchen especially was something my wife and I loved with all its fully stocked cabinets filled with everything from tea and coffee to sharp kitchen utensils and stylish kitchen ware through out. Massive Roku television with one in each bedroom and such comfortable king size beds. The office area was great to get some online paperwork done as well. The outside area we occupied every other day soaking sun listening to the songs of the neighborhood birds and drinking our tea/coffee. Thank you Allison!
