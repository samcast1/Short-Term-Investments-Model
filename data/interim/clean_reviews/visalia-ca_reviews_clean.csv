2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Paola’s space is so beautiful and homey! I couldn’t have asked for a better stay in Visalia. Close to all the great shops and restaurants downtown Visalia! Highly recommend trying out House of JuJu downtown Visalia for some yummy food and sweet staff! The home is very spacious for a 2 bedroom and a great backyard. The kitchen was so cute and had everything we needed and then some! The pool was a dream also! 10/10 💗
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place is neat. Spacious and welcoming. It is about 50 min away from Sequoia National Park. I personally loved the kitchen but my 2.5 year old was so happy when he stepped inside and saw the basket with stuffed animals. I really appreciated the gesture. Thank you.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I want to thank the host for having my family and my daughter's friends over. I am from Visalia and I was looking for a house in town to just celebrate as a family of 6 (4 small kids under the age of 11) My daughter just wanted to swim I found this place perfect for what I was looking for. Love the house clean and very welcoming I felt at home I used the kitchen as if I was home I made Mexican food called huaraches with tinga de pollo my daughter's favorite food felt comfortable cooking there. The pool all the kids loved the pool I loved that I still was cooking and keeping a close eye on the kids swimming. The house was amazing they had extra blankets my kids just fell asleep on the comfortable living room carpet watching movies tired from swimming all evening. The beds were super comfortable. I already recommended this place to a friend of mine I would love to return and maybe rent it all weekend to enjoy the pool a bit longer.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had such a fun time! My friend and I were just wanting a place to swim for 1 night and cook. I was very impressed with how well the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook our food. The pool was beautiful and warm! Very clean house! My feet weren’t dirty when walking around the house! Beds were big and comfortable! All the towels smelt amazing! I have nothing bad to say! Thank you!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely fantastic stay and host! I booked very close to check-in as it was a last minute stay but I instantly regretted not booking for longer when I arrived! It was quiet and beautiful. Lisa had the place ready for me in no time and it was clean as a whistle! It is on the smaller side so if you have some height to you, it may feel a bit cramped. BUT, needless to say, I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We spent 2 nights in the trailer with our 11-year-old daughter who enjoyed the experience!
We enjoyed the cleanliness and all the comforts available in the caravan. Heating, hot water, functional kitchen and even Netflix TV!
Good location to reach the Sequoia . Many shops nearby. Luckily we hadn't booked in the park because the snowy many roads were closed. But we were still able to enjoy!
Hosts are very responsive to every problem and are always ready to answer any question you may have. Communication is really easy! Really a lovely couple!
Thanks for the delicious oranges!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The little RV was in a great location for me. It had everything I needed, thus no reason to ask for anything. Owners are super nice . It is very quiet location. Overall 5 starts. I had not stayed in RV before so was a little surprise the bathroom is so small but it worked out just fine. Restaurants and grocery stores a half mile away. I have to give it a 5 star. I’ll be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Miss Lisa is absolutely amazing! We will definitely be returning. My husband and I brought the kids from out of state and have been staying in hotels until we get a house. We finally decided to try an air b&b as the hotels were absolutely horrible. To say that Miss Lisa made us feel right at home would be an understatement. Very accommodating, very responsive, and very proactive! We will not be staying hotels any longer. The only reason we didn’t extend our stay is because it had already been reserved. I can’t recommend Lisa enough!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lisa and Tony made me feel very comfortable right away. Lisa brought a plate with fruit 🍑 to welcome me.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for one night as a couple with a young kid, and it was perfect. Had all the amenities we needed, and was quite an adventure for our 5-year-old who'd never been inside an RV before. Good value and very friendly host."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is a reason why Lisa is super host. ❤️ She is very well versed with camper aesthetics 😍
That beach high security bench lamp to cozy bed, everything is very peculiar and beautiful❤️ I and my husband stayed in this camper for 2 nights when we visited Sequoia national park. This camper is really very cool and near to Foothills visitor center of SNP.
I would highly recommend this place😊
Thanks Lisa."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend selecting both this unit and the host! The RV was very cozy, clean, private, and the price is quite hard to beat. Had all the listed amenities -- hot water, heater, stovetop, all worked great."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Lisa's place! We particularly enjoyed that it was as described. Nice, clean, and private. One thing to note, we had accidentally broken one of the windows. Lisa and her husband were very understanding and took immediate concern about our safety. We explained how it happened, and they were more worried about if it affected our stay than about the window itself. A huge plus with us!! We all came up with a solution to rectify things and parted on a high note. We really appreciate how they handled the situation. We would be excited to come back and enjoy a stay again! Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice little trailer has everything that one or two people need. Clean, good value, quiet and private, with a responsive host. Toilet and shower work good, plenty of hot water. Amenities list was a bit understated, the unit actually has a good heater and towels. the only thing missing that I would like to have had was a top sheet on the bed. I recommend Lisa's place and would stay there again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my boyfriend loved this place for a very super last minute trip we did. Our first time staying in a RV and it was one for the books for us.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, stylish and spacious! The space has everything you need to relax, cook a meal, or shower. Deene was friendly and provided extra perks like snacks and wine. I definitely recommend this place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place. Great location.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deene's unit was supurb. We would definitely return next time we're in the Visalia area. Deene is a hospitable host with clear communication and excellent follow up. So many Airbnb offerings raise unrealistic expectations and then disappoint; not so with Deene's unit. It EXCEEDED our expectations... It is impeccably decorated, well-furnished and squeeky clean. It is located on an immaculate manor property in a beautiful neighborhood. Highly recommended. Thanks Deene!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very comfortable and convenient. Hospitality was great.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Deene's place was a true GEM! It has been masterfully curated and is a place that I would consider staying at again if need be for work! That being said, we did have some hiccups here and there with the wifi (2.5-35 Mbps) that made working from home inconsistent, but we did our best to work through the problem together; this was just a minor inconvenience that shouldn't be an issue if you bring along your mobile hotspot or use your phone as a hotspot. You can also work at the wonderful Component Coffee Shop; their breakfast burrito is a MUST! Also, this is a GREAT spot if you are a traveling nurse or locums physician. Quiet, peaceful, private garage and entrance, and a 6-minute drive to Kaweah Delta! Deene was exceptionally responsive, a gracious host, and made sure I had all I needed (laundry, coffee, towels, toiletries etc.) I highly recommend it if you appreciate a high-quality resting place while exploring Visalia and Sequoia National Park."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Deene is the ULTIMATE host! She is friendly, responsive, thorough, accurate, kind, generous, and offers excellent information about the local area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very happy, you will not regret it, the place is beautiful and something that I really appreciate is the cleanliness and this place was more than clean. Thank you very much!

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,I rented this place for a family vacation and it superseded any of our expectations! we'll definitely keep this place in mind to rent again.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sabrina was really great. Excellent communicator and detailed with check-in process. Easy checkout process. The place was beautiful and very clean and had everything you’d need to cook up some things/store your food. My friend and I rented for a few days stay. Was very comfortable and peaceful neighborhood. Only 2 things I would recommend is:
1. Maybe a little firmer mattress for the rooms. My friend and I stayed in two different rooms and both of us had the same issue with our neck/back cramp due to the mattress being too soft.
2. Since there isn’t really a “communal” lounge area, maybe put a sitting chair in rooms 2 and 3 as well like room 1 had. Would have been nice to sit and relax during our down time without having to sit at the dining table, on the bed, or having to intrude my friend’s space in room 1 lol.
Lots of stores nearby to buy any essentials and restaurants/coffee shops close by.
Overall excellent home and would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was here for a quick stay before driving back to LA from the NPs. The check in was smooth and easy and Sabrina was kind enough to let us know ahead to use the map on the Airbnb to avoid confusion. The place is pretty strategic as there’s a Target nearby to stock up some essentials if you’d like. The place was clean and tidy. There’s plenty of restaurants nearby too, mostly fast foods for quick bite. It’s definitely recommended and worth a stay if you are planning to visit the NPs and do not wanna stay in the park area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place. Perfect location on our way to Sequoia.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sabrina is responsive and kind. We loved the location in a nice and quite neighborhood, will definitely book again"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect stop on our way to the Sequoias! Sabrina was a great host with treats and signs to welcome us. The kids loved the LED lights in the room and the massage chair was relaxing after a day of hiking and sight seeing. Thanks Sabrina! The kids wished we could stay longer good amount of space for the 5 of us! Thanks we hope to come again soon
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Even after putting the location into google maps, our gps still routed us to the wrong location. The owner was amazing and helped us reroute to the home’s location. The place was amazing and just what we needed!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super nice and comfortable everything super clean fences of everything I loved the area where the house is located
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are not from the area, you may get lost: but they mention that, in their description that it is a new build and addresses may not have populated. Once we were able to find the location, it is SO BEAUTIFUL and felt at home immediately. The primary bedroom allowed my brother and I to hand out, but not be cramped and the kitchen area gave exactly what we needed. Beautiful home, lots of space and would definitely book again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Initially this place was a little confusing to find but remembered she sent us directions through message. Once we sorted that out, it was super easy to find. Great stay, everything was new and super clean! Fridge was super clean and it was nice that there was a little fridge inside the master bedroom as well. The home itself is in a gold location if you need to go to Starbucks or target. Would stay here again!"

Thank you for a lovely stay Sabrina. Xx"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was perfect for us. It is modern, simple and comfortable. We slept well and although the kitchen is smaller, we were able to feed our family of 6 when we needed to cook a meal. Sabrina is very responsive and helped us with a specific baking dish we needed."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was great although I needed to buy a pot , skillet , pans bowls etc"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here for a wedding and it was a good stay. Wouldn’t recommend if you have young kids though. We had a toddler with us and it is way too small and the stairs are not ideal! Also, read the details about how you only have access to the top portion of the house."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful , new, renovated, and comfortable home and stay! Great host and stay!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really great place! Everything was new and comfortable. Nearby parks and grocery stores.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My friends and I were visiting the area in need of a single overnight stay after a birthday party in Tulare.
Rather than cram ourselves into a hotel with 1 room and 2 beds, we found Sabrina’s clean, modern 3-bedroom was a better use of the money!
The location is safe, parking easy right on the driveway and the home is practically perfectly inside and out.
While the bedrooms were all well equipped with comfortable beds and TVs, this home does not have a common space to lounge so we ended up having our morning coffee sitting around the master bedroom. Not a deal breaker for us but might be important to others.
The kitchen was compact but immaculate. While it did have the full capacity for preparing food, it was lacking a Brita filter or other method to be confident in sourcing drinkable water. The tap water was safe to brush teeth and shower with but had an off-putting taste to it so that was the only drawback.
Overall, it was much better than a hotel. Thank you, Sabrina!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing home, can't say enough great things. 5 stars for me & the family. What a treasure. So glad I was able to book this stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Reuben’s place is everything you want an Airbnb to be: really nicely presented with nice furnishings and fit out, an incredibly well-stocked kitchen (both for staples and implements) and a whole host of really thoughtful touches (bottled waters, snacks, plenty of towels for enjoying the hot tub.).There are so many places to sit and relax throughout Reuben’s house. Just a wonderful set-up. We felt right at home from the moment we arrived.
We used Reuben’s place as a base for exploring Sequoia and King’s Canyon National Parks: while there was a fair bit of driving to and from the Parks, we thought it was a great base from which to visit the Parks. And Reuben was super responsive to any questions we had.
We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Reuben’s place to anyone visiting the area."

I can’t say enough good things about this space. It was just perfect."

The house is so beautifully designed, with lots of well-thought out components.
Rueben & his wife are exceptional hosts - they really went above and beyond and were very generous with both their time and how stocked their house was.
The location itself is really good. Super peaceful, safe and nice to walk around.
If I am in Visalia again, I will definitely try stay here, without a doubt.
AirBnB should allow for 6 stars for hosts like Rueben & his wife :)"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I usually don’t write reviews. This place was impressive enough that I decided to anyways. Close enough for us to enjoy the national parks, we picked this place because it seemed homey, had additional luxuries, and had the air of a good place to relax after some longer days on our feet. Not only did it meet these expectations but it excelled in every way. With personal touches, luxurious comfort, modern amenities, and a beautiful aesthetic, this place was worth every penny and more. Reuben is clearly a detail-oriented host who cares about his property andguests. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Sequoia NP or the Visalia/Fresno areas. Excellent stay and we will hopefully be back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank You for such a wonderful place to stay! Your home is simply amazing and you are fantastic hosts! We had a memorable time and felt spoiled the whole time by every detail you carefully thought out!

You certainly won’t get bored here. Everything was well detailed and easy to find. The beds were super comfy which made for a great resting spot after hiking in Sequoia National Park. What you see is what you get, so book this gem!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fresh out of a Christmas movie… I couldn’t have been happier when we walked inside - felt like I’d stepped in to my kinda heaven. It was decorated for Christmas beautifully, and tiny attention to detail everywhere was phenomenal.
So many amazing outdoor areas to make use of.. and we did.
Beds and pillows UBER comfy, good powerful shower, heavenly stocked kitchen…. Honestly it was dreamy.
Huge amount of shops nearby.
The 90 minute drive to Kings Canyon was so worth it.
Didn’t eat out so can’t comment on all the restaurants.
Hosts were incredibly efficient, friendly and helpful."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow - this home is a true home. Immediately upon entering we felt like we had entered a fairy tale and fantasy land of the ideal home. Cozy like a winter cabin on Christmas Day with children and bunnies spreading mirth.
Loved everything about it, including the hot tub and the bikes and the baking amenities.
If you’ve ever watched the “Cute House” video, this home is “Cute as sh!t!”
Rueben was super responsive and helpful and any resists or questions we had he immediately responded.
Would definitely stay here again and will tell our friends and family
To stay here"

We felt right at home and only wished we could have stayed longer with all the wonderful indoor and outdoor amenities (comfortable seating and beds; plenty of comfortable outdoor furniture for our enjoyment.) Did I mention the swing, treehouse, hot tub, fireplace, and the goodies and treats? Very safe neighborhood and walkable to multiple restaurants and coffee shops.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough great things about Bearheart Lodge. It was definitely my favorite place I’ve ever stayed. It was even better than I expected from the photos and description. It’s so warm and welcoming, and the host went above and beyond to make this one of the most memorable birthdays I’ve ever had. My only regret is that I wish I had booked an extra day or two, so we had more time to enjoy this magical place! I would love to return, and maybe even make it an annual trip!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the most well-equipped places we’ve ever stayed! You could easily make Thanksgiving dinner here without needing to bring any kitchen supplies. The interior of the home is much bigger than we understood from the pictures and has well over 60 seats around the house and outside, giving you many options to either chill with friends and family or break into smaller groups for a bit more privacy. We almost cancelled all of our National Park plans just to hang around the home instead!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house! Looked exactly like the photos, maybe even better. The kitchen is incredible. Hosts were super helpful and always responded very quickly. Hope to book again :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is by far our most favorite place we've stayed at! Reuben and his wife were very helpful, friendly and very responsive. We went to Sequoia for our anniversary and unfortunately had car troubles while up there and Reuben gave me a great recommendation to take my car and get it serviced. He even offered to take me and bring me back. We truly appreciate everything. Not to mention the beautiful house! It was very cozy and clean. My wife said she loved the vibes and attention to details that went into it. We hung out in the tree house and even took a golf cart ride around the neighborhood. Definitely recommend staying at Reuben's place and we will definitely be staying here again in the future"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Reuben’s house is in great location, 10min from groceries and restaurant, also 50min from Sequoia national park.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for our visit the Seqouias. Reuben’s home is like a mini paradise tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. It’s located right off a road full of restaurants and a gas station, all conveniently placed within a 30 second car ride. When we first parked, we were amazed by all the beautiful decor and lights. Reuben’s attention to decor and detail were immaculate. The second we opened the front door, we were greeted by soft jazz playing on the tv, ambient lighting throughout the entire house, and tons of free snacks and amenities. 10/10 would recommend!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wow. Let me say, I have stayed at many Airbnbs and am also a host, and Reuben knocked this one out of the park. We were his first guests and I am thoroughly impressed with the job he did with the place. Not only did he turn a home into a fun space with a tree house, little details and Easter eggs to find, access to his golf cart, and canoe, but the house was stocked beyond belief. As if that wasn’t enough, Reuben was also a very friendly host who checked in here and there and was proactive of our needs in every sense of the word - we felt truly taken care of. I would give Reuben 11/10 stars for his accommodations! Thanks Reuben!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, no complaints! It was clean and had all the amenities to get us through the weekend. The bedroom was so cozy and very clean. The neighborhood was lively and walkable. There was no natural lighting in the home, other than in the bedroom, if that’s important for you. It was only a 20ish minute drive to the front entrance of Sequoia. The hosts were super easy to reach and responded very quickly. Overall, really happy with our stay!"

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Visalia and easy to get to anything in the city as well as Sequoia Nat’l Park. The space is “shotgun” style, and though plenty of space is offered, one should know there is only one window on the property which is located in the bedroom at the end of the property. The internet was extremely slow, so if one is planning to work from home while staying, it can be difficult to do work that requires a lot of bandwidth; I was clocking roughly 3-5 Mbps (i.e., Teams, WebEx, etc.)
The place was stocked well and we would consider staying again if ever in the area!"

Check-in was seamless and easy to access. Very basic amenities, so bring what you may need or want, ie coffee. There is no outdoor furniture of any sort to enjoy the beautiful backyard so bring beach chairs! Also the play structure is worn and could use some love. Other than that we had a great stay and would gladly stay again! Stephan was a responsive and accommodating host!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay in Visalia at the house. Spotless and clean, very quiet neighborhood. The backyard with play structure was the main attraction for my little ones! Stephan was attentive and answered some questions we had right away. The furniture is clean and comfortable. Only cons for us- The bed linens were a little scratchy and seemed cheap, plus the kitchen was bare bones in terms of cooking supplies. There was also a Febreeze plug in that was so strong we had to unplug and air the house out. But those are very minor details compared to everything that was great about our stay."

We stayed with a large group of 7 adults and 2 small children. Everyone was very happy and full of impressions. We felt at home here, and will definitely return to this house in the spring and summer when we go to Sequoia Park again. Thank you very much!!!! You will forever remain in our hearts!! 🫶🙏"

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was a short walk away from our family members home, so it was a perfect place for our family unit to unwind with our newborn after the daily festivities.
I could see how the cold floor tiles would be imperative during the hot summer months in keeping you cool! The backyard oasis appeared serene but not recently used. There were many spider webs, a non working fountain and the gazebo umbrella was badly torn on one side but the bushes are well manicured. My kid kicked a left soccer ball around for a few minutes.
We did not make use of the stocked kitchen or the bunk beds really but the 3 bedroom house was extremely spacious for our needs this time around.
The garage door did not work, so you must park in the driveway. The stove was missing two knobs, but we didn’t have a need to cook.
The kitchen sink water gets extremely hot, so beware when you are washing dishes/hands.
Check in was a breeze. In order to lock the front door/when you leave, you must push the Yale button"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Amber’s house worked out perfectly for my quick trip up to central valley! I enjoyed her very clean house and she even left a bed out for my pup! It was in the low 30’s at night so I was glad I brought my small space heater because the house is older and it gets pretty chilly! Amber also had a small space heater in the closet if you needed one. Fenced in front and backyard was definitely convenient! Overall it was a great stay! There are quite a few homeless people around but they don’t bother you. I look forward to booking one of her houses again soon!

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The property corresponds to the description and offers the amenities as indicated. The street and environment of the property looks very well maintained. Unfortunately the house is a bit noisy, so you can hear passing cars or ambulances of the nearby hospital even with closed windows and shutters. Communication was proactive and friendly."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ambers place is very nice and clean. It is decorated very nicely just like the pictures. The place was very cozy and only 1 hour from Sequoia National Park. It was also only a 5 minute walk from downtown Visalia. Definitey would come back to this airbnb.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house is so cute. It's very comfortable and homey. We had spent four days in Yosemite and Sequoia National parks. It was so nice to park our cars and be able to walk in to town for dinner and dessert. I would definitely go back or recommend it to someone.

We recommend !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a great home base for exploring the nearby parks. Amber’s place is conveniently located in historic Visalia, walking distance to downtown and a close drive to restaurants and shopping. Amber’s home is comfortable and welcoming."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber's house is beautiful! It looks so small and pretty outside but it's really very big and there was a lot of space for my family of 4. Plenty of little touches that improve the holiday: games for the children, coffe, tea and milk and everything for a relaxing time. Absolutely perfect!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love this house!!
This was by far the cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed at. The house was immaculate and stylish in its decor. It had all the cozy amenities we required for our many nights in town. The town itself is quaint and charming, it has multiple unique shops, breweries (sequoia and Barrel House were favorites) and restaurants (Gorilla Quesadilla was delicious!!)
ALL walkable by a few blocks from the bungalow.
Visalia has so much pride in their town/community you can tell by how clean and well maintained it is. Everyone we encountered was extremely kind and welcoming and helpful with local activity recommendations.
We traversed to both Kings Canyon and Sequoia for some day hikes and were pleased to be so close to the entrance (40-45 min to Three Rivers/Sequoia entrance).
I cannot say enough about this house.. it was the welcoming oasis we needed for our West Coast outdoor adventures.
I would definitely recommend!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home within walking distance of main street with lots of food and shopping. Stayed here while visiting Sequioa National Park and had a pleasant stay.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was quite magical there, you can't go wrong."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was hands down one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at. It was exactly as advertised and the house was beautiful. The location is right near the restaurants and cafe’s, which was very convenient for us. We drove about 45 minutes each morning to the sequoia park entrance. It was well worth it! Can’t recommend enough."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great relaxing time with a family of 4 here. Traveled to and from Sequoia.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a perfect stay at Amber's home. Her home is super-clean, stylish, and very cozy. Our family of 4 had plenty of room to spread out and feel comfortable. Location-wise, this was the perfect place from which to access both Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. We drove 1.5 hours to the Giant Trees section of Sequoia (though the entrance and foothills section come up after only driving about 30 minutes) , and we drove 1 hour and 20 minutes to the Grant Grove section of Kings Canyon. If you visit Kings Canyon, definitely do a horse ride at Grant Grove Stables; this was a highlight of our trip! Our family actually preferred these parks to Yosemite. Not only are the crowds more manageable, but the weather is cooler and more pleasant...and the sequoias are awesome! The drives to both parks are scenic and beautiful. Visalia is a convenient location with a great Walmart Super Center for any supplies you may need. We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Convenient walk to restaurants and close to Sequoia NP. Very clean and a welcoming home like feel. Front room does get a bit of noise from traffic, but manageable."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amber’s place was just what we needed as a jump-off point to King’s Canyon National Park. Her location is within walking distance to downtown restaurants and bars. The house is quaint - everything seemed newly renovated, and the AC works great. We found her house comfortable and well laid out. If we ever visit the area again, hopefully Amber’s place will be available."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amber's place was wonderful. Obviously inspired by the decor style of Joanna Gaines, the home feels open, warm, and welcoming. It lives so much larger than its actual square footage. It has beautiful hardwood floors, seemingly original. The kitchen has everything you need to cook any meal. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. It was great having access to a washer and dryer. The house is located on a quiet street near the historic district. We walked to a nearby restaurant for dinner and then to another spot for ice cream. Thanks to Amber's brochures on the local sites, we knew we were also walking distance to the Sequoia Legacy Tree.

Amber’s place was a gorgeous, well decorated and stocked home away from home. It was so nice to relax in the comfortable living room and watch shows at night after being out all day. My husband enjoyed playing Galaga on the old Nintendo. While the home appeared small from the outside, it was incredibly spacious! I couldn’t believe how lovely it was inside, maybe the most well decorated and clean Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! I loved Amber’s framed house rules and tips in the kitchen. I also loved the body wash, shampoo and conditioner bottles labeled in the bathroom. I wish more folks would do that! It looks so nice and is a great touch! We walked to the downtown area for food and drinks a few times and had an easy drive up to sequoia national park. I loved Amber’s place, an amazing Airbnb experience!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean, had a lot of great amenities, and the neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant. The spacious layout of the house was perfect for 5 of us, including a 4 year old. The backyard/patio area and grill made our evenings very enjoyable.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall it was a great experience and rental.
However, the one glaring flaw was the cleaning fee cost, coupled with requiring the guests to empty the trash and other cleaning.
We washed all our dishes, emptied all the trash picked up after ourselves and were still left with a140$ cleaning fee and a 65$ service fee. That put the fee’s at more than half of total the rentals cost.
The place was great, we were happy with the location and the accommodations. The only part that was a disappointment were the fee’s for cleaning in relation to the what was required of the guest."

Kitchen was very nice with lots of counter space and everything you needed. Gerrit was super responsive via messaging and initially introduced himself in person upon arrival.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific place. It was larger than expected and very clean and bright. Great backyard space and the location was very good also--close to downtown.
However, this Airbnb stood out from others where we have stayed because of the great hosts! Unexpectedly for the hosts, the power was shut off by the electric company for several hours one morning (without any notice to them). They quickly were able to get a generator over to the property and restore power so that our stay was not really impacted at all.
We highly recommend this home and the hosts!"

The place was walkable to downtown as well as other restaurants and services in town.
Gerrit was a great host. He lives right across the street and while we only saw him at check in, I know he would have been there if we needed anything. Check out instructions were clear and sent the day before. Check in was also flexible and easy.

The layout of the kitchen was also very comfortable and functional. It felt like home!
With a 6-year-old, we sometimes have to do laundry while traveling. The washer and dryer made this house very convenient for us.
The neighborhood was really lovely, having jogged on most of the streets. It was quiet and safe. Parking was convenient. We had a great weekend, using this house as our base camp for day trips to Sequoia National Park to the east."

If you're thinking of booking let me help you make that decision. The home is recently remodeled with modern and stylish finishings. The entire space has been tastfully decorated. The floor plan makes the space feel big and open, so much natural light. We were a party of 4 (+ and infant) and it was more then enough space for us all to be super comfortable. If you love to cook then this kitchen is just what you need, tons of counter and storage space and everything you need to make a full on meal. We cooked all of our meals each day and it was a breeze. The appliances are high end (bosch) and worked wonderfully. The backyard space is to die for, gorgeous bistro lights are strung over the backyard making for the perfect night time ""chill"" spot. We spent time out there each night. The host has provided some thoughtful touches throughout making the stay that much easier. The hosts were super responsive and easily approachable for any questions or needs. I come to the area often and we won't stay anywhere else moving forward. I look forward to seeing the success this space will surely have."

The bed was also really comfortable (and I’m picky about mattresses). We really appreciated and made use of the recommendations guide as well. Our only regret was that we forgot to sign the guest book. Definitely recommend staying here if you want a quiet stay with a kind host that’s near enough to the park.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very cosy tiny house! The outside space with the jacuzzi is great, we really enjoyed spending time outside. The sofa bed wasn’t super comfortable to sleep, but it was OK for one night."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to stay not too far from the Sequoia National Forest. We loved the little amenities that were offered like the games and the jacuzzi. Having a fridge readily available was also a very nice perk. The luxury towels were also very nice! Overall, the stay was amazing! Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My husband and I had a wonderful stay with our 2 small dogs at the Tiny House. It was the perfect space for my pups to run around in. The neighborhood was very peaceful and the hot tub was the perfect way to relax after hiking in the snow and rain. Andrew and Tori are fantastic hosts. There were small extra amenities and thoughtful touches added to home when we arrived. There was even a binder of suggested activities and restaurants which came in handy when the weather deterred our original plans. This place was definitely worth the stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very easy check in and messaged back quickly when we needed them! The place was very clean and the hot tub was definitely the best part!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! I haven’t booked much airbnb before and didn’t expect to pay for two days worth for one night. The hosts were always very responsive and the hot tub was a huge plus compared to other local stays. It’s still quite a bit of a drive to the Sequoias compared to let’s say a spot in Three Rivers, but we ended up choosing this spot because of the great vibes that the photos presented. They had coffee for us to make and a fridge with stocked condiments. I’ll be returning for sure in better financial situations!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this tiny house to spend New Year with my boyfriend and be in close proximity to explore Sequoia and Kings Canyon. It was everything as seen on the pictures and then some! It was perfect for our couple retreat to Sequoia. It was clean, tidy, and had all the little touches and amenities to make our stay perfect. We loved it! Andrew and Tori are amazing and hospitable hosts and we would love to go back to the Sequoia Tiny House one day!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"So cool to put us up for the holiday <3 We arrived to a very warm and welcoming tiny house. Love how responsive Andrew and Tori were throughout our stay. We really felt like we could be ourselves with our fur babies <3 The hot tub was total R&R (worth the price) and the fire pit was…fire!! The neighborhood is chill, quiet, and clean. And very easy access with locked gate and door. But hands down best part is, they take fur babies!! Will stay here again for sure<3 Thank you Andrew and Tori:)"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our time at the tiny house! It was so clean and cozy. So many thoughtful details - champagne glasses, blanket sized towels, and a super comfy bed. The outside space is gorgeous, too! It was the perfect place to stop on our way to Sequoia.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at Andrew’s place! This was a one-night stop on a road trip for us, but I could easily have stayed longer. Really thoughtful touches from the hosts and a super clean, neat space. 11/10 - thank you again, Andrew!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I went here for our anniversary, and to explore Sequoia. We’re big campers, so this was a luxury experience for us. The tiny house felt ample for the two of us, and the hot tub was very simple to operate. While we went for Sequoia, Visalia was also a fun town to come back to and enjoy a meal after a full day of hiking. (That said there were spaces closer to the park, which Andrew was quick to let us know about).
Incredibly responsive to any needs we had, and proactive to make sure I’m everything was good, I would highly suggest this space."

Would definitely recommend staying here, especially for a couple's trip!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tori and Andrew’s place is clean and cozy just like seen in the pictures. They’re fantastic hosts too - accommodating and quick to respond. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay here very much!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was so far the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. The house was very clean and comfortable. The photos don’t do enough justice for both the home itself and the backyard. It looked even more amazing in person. Both Tori and Andrew sent clear instructions and made sure throughout our stay we had everything we needed. After hiking in sequoia, the jacuzzi was perfect. Overall we enjoyed our stay and highly recommend that anyone in the area book with Tori and Andrew :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"These are the details that make an AirBnB special. Tori and Andrew's tiny house is full of loving touches! It's the perfect hideaway after a day at Sequoia NP!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was AMAZING! after driving 2200 miles from home, I couldn't have asked for a better place to relax for the night. It was super clean and for the square footage, it still felt roomy and not clustered.
Andrew and Tori was very kind and responsive. I would 100% stay there again, and id recommend anyone looking for a relaxing, private little getaway to do the same."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the tiny house - it is very lovingly decorated and there is everything you need. Andrew and Tori are very friendly and take care of themselves perfectly :)
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house was the perfect little getaway. It was conveniently located to the national parks and easy to get to from Fresno airport.

Tori and Andrew were great hosts and provide many thoughtful touches to make the tiny house feel like home. Also the bed is super comfortable and luxury towels are a great touch.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house has everything you need and the thoughtful touches from the host really made it feel like home! They’ve done so much with a relatively small space, and the outdoor area is beautiful! Hot tub and soft towels were a highlight! Thank you to Andrew, who was very proactive in checking all was ok and we could have stayed longer! Would recommend to anyone and the location was perfect for a day trip to sequoia"
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Andrew welcomed us in a very friendly way. Arrival is well described. The accommodation was clean and nicely decorated. Some things could have been a little better processed (e.g. Silicon joints and mounted shelves on the wall in the bath). Unfortunately, we were probably there at the insect time, there were an incredible number of mosquitos in the area, which unfortunately ruined the experience at the hot tub and in the really nicely decorated outdoor area. However, Andrew had provided and had insect spray ready and attached screens to the windows."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place to stay! Very clean and exceeded my expectations. Close to Sequoia NP. Would love to come back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was perfect! My wife and I stayed during our wedding weekend. Andrew and Tori welcomed us with a gift. They knew why we had come and that made us feel extra special. The place was clean and exactly what we were expecting. We would definitely stay there again.
They were responsive and even offered early check-in. The process was smooth and easy. Gave pictures and clear instructions.
I would highly recommend staying in this tiny house!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute place! Just has the vibe of being on vacation. Hosts are super friendly and responsive!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny house was the perfect choice for us! Close enough to Sequoia National Park. Great size. Super clean, plenty of linens and towels. Very modern on the inside, and the hot tub was great after a day of hiking! Hosts were super nice and responsive and let us check in early! Would recommend :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Tiny House is beautiful and comfortable. It was clean and for us it was honestly very toddler friendly, beds and couches were safely climbable and the majority of the amenities provided were well out of arms reach, any cabinets that could be opened were easily blocked with our luggage.
The hosts are communicative and honest, make sure to read the entire house manual though because the visit we had from billy the bluejay at night definitely gave us a little scare.
For anyone traveling with kids or toddlers this place is absolutely amazing, however it is 45 minutes from the Sequoia’s (which the description is transparent about) PLUS it takes nearly 2 hours to get to the General Sherman Tree from the Entrance so definitely plan with extra snacks and entertainment.
Overall we just loved our stay, we felt so at home. Everything was so clean, detailed, private and calm. I could not possibly say more good things but this place has good reviews for a reason!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tiny House was perfect!! So cozy and clean!!! Our main objective for the trip was hiking in Sequoia. The park entrance is 45 minutes away so just be sure to add in your drive time to the trails. We started with Moro Rock trail and it was about a two hour drive in total from tiny house to the museum parking lot and then a 3 mile hike to Moro rock but the drive once you’re in the park is beautiful. Andrew gave some great hiking recommendations and we loved the hot tub after a long day of hiking. The tiny house is great if you don’t want to stay close to the park where there is a lot of traffic and people and the bed was SO comfy!!!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy place! Exactly as described and shown in the pictures. Tori and Andrew were helpful in every step. The only issue was the toilet got clogged right after the first use and wasn’t usable for the entire stay. However both Tori and Andrew did their best to help us resolve this. Would definitely go back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Short but great stay. Such adorable tiny house and the little gift was very cute, definitely a memory from our stay.
Keeping the door closed is a tip to avoid mosquitos inside during summer."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Tinyhouse way surpassed our expectations! Each detail added so much! Super comfortable, and cute, and very well decorated. Beautiful outdoor as well. Andrew is a great host, helped us get comfortable and was super accommodating. Definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay! Thank you.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is the definition of cute! The back yard was so magical, especially at night. We felt so relaxed and wish we chose to stay longer."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Andrew’s tiny house is amazing!!! Nice and peaceful after some busy days traveling. The hot tub was relaxing, the ambience inside the home was tranquil. Excellent patio seating area outside for winding down. Loved the decor inside and the lux bath towels were amazing! Andrew was super responsive and answered all my questions quickly and in a friendly way. Would have loved to stay a couple more days to enjoy the tiny house more!!! Thanks Andrew!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, very clean and comforable. Wonderful hot tube under the stars. We had a nice time in Andrew's house. It's very small, so better for two or three people, but it's fine also for four. Andrew was very reactive and he comes immediately when we had a small problem with the main door.
Definetely very nice."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely space! Our hosts were amazing! After a long day's travel, we were able to check in early and catch a nap before heading up to Sequoia National Forest. After a day hiking with the giant trees, we were able to relax in the hot tub, kick back, and unwind. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend their place to anyone staying in or traveling through the area. A+++ Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was perfect and hidden. I didn’t notice anything.

This place had a bunch of nice touches and the hosts were great. Hope to be able to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous private spot on the edge of town but so quick to get to everything. Everything was better than the pics and description. I felt welcome even before I got there, with Andrew reaching out to make sure I knew how to get in and had everything I needed. They even had relaxing music and the electric fireplace on to set the mood! Loved staying here and will definitely be my go-to spot the next time I'm in the area!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A perfect tiny house for our quick Sequoia birthday trip. This house had all the lovely touches and more spacious than it would seem. Adorable backyard space for evening wine and relaxing. They even left us a little birthday gift. It’s about 45 min to drive to Sequoia but we didn’t mind because we could drive through starbucks, get gas and stop at the grocery in town on the way. Also Andrew and Tori were wonderful communicators. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The place was clean and had everything we needed for our trip to Sequoia National Park which is just a 45 minute drive. The hot tub was just what we needed after hiking all day. We felt right at home!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, very clean accommodation with very neat decor. The exteriors are very nice and the hot tub is a real plus.
This accommodation is quite small so suitable for a couple without children. Do not plan to cook as there are no cooking stoves."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"All about the details!! Andrew & Tori did not miss a beat with this Tiny Home Paradise!! Everything you need for the perfect, peaceful getaway with easy access to Sequoia & close to downtown Visalia. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & are already talking about making a trip back!

Simple check-in, check-out, and instructions. It had all the things we wanted to feel like a special getaway. Very open and well-designed space that had us in awe of what you can accomplish and enjoy with the right design.
It is so neat that this quiet, tucked-away space was right in the heart of town. The hosts were very thoughtful and it was a memorable place to spend our anniversary. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great cozy tiny house separated well from the host's residence. The place is located in a peaceful township of sorts, very close to Sequoia when the highways open up. Hosts are very responsive and gave us a squeaky clean home that was well equipped with everything we could ever want. Foldable tables inside the home and the patio are a nice touch. It's definitely on our list to visit again with 2-3 people."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great 2 day stay at the tiny house. We had 3 people and although compact, the accommodations were far better than any hotel room. The bed was very comfortable and we used the hot tub both days after long hikes in Sequoia National Park. it is a very private setting and we only needed a few texts to know exactly how to get in and how to leave the place. Highly recommended!"
