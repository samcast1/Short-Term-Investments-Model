2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a short 5-day stay - I wanted something other than a mouldy hotel and this place was lovely. Hunter was friendly & helpful + gave clear instructions for check-in.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All good. Thanks.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at Hunters. We did have to work remotely during our stay and appreciated the one work place. Would have been helpful to have another table but we made it work. Beds and linens were comfortable and was refreshing to have towels that weren't thin and worn out from previous guests. Check the kitchenware, several plates, glasses and silverware not cleaned well. That, of course, is not reflective of Hunter but more so the previous guests. Should the cleaning people have to spot check that? I don't know."

The area was so quiet and beautiful after being in the car for 10 hours. We loved seeing the kids next-door and across the street playing outside, it made us feel at home and safe. Neighbors were friendly. You can tell Hunter really took pride in the updates and charm of the house. It was the perfect size for my husband, our son, and myself. We were super close to the gas station and a Walgreens (we needed some sinus medication once we got there). And checkout / cleanup was super easy and low maintenance.

Immediately upon arrival we could see how manicured the lawn and surroundings were, so we knew the inside of the home would be the same. We surely were not disappointed! We did have a question for Hunter even before arriving, and he was very quick to respond. The inside of the cottage was decorated so cute, well-appointed, and had all the necessary tools we needed to prepare our meals. Having dinner on the back porch and enjoying the beautiful backyard while we had dinner was a real bonus! We absolutely would stay at the Coldwater Cottage again if our travels take us through Anniston. Thank you, Hunter!"

A great find!! Thanks for a great stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Previous reviews pretty much said it all, indeed this is a great two bedroom Airbnb. As I was working from home during my stay I especially appreciated the high speed internet (about 200 mb/s download and 20 mb/s upload speeds), and the dedicated workspace. Can’t beat the fenced in backyard and quiet neighborhood when traveling with a dog either.
The host also provided recommendations to check out in the area, and he was very responsive and communicative throughout my stay. 5/5 across the board from me."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is on a main road, but set back a little. We didn't have any problem with the noise or privacy. The kitchen had decent quality dishes and utensils and was well stocked and easy to cook in. The bathrooms did not have shampoo or soap in the showers, or any blow dryers. Overall, it was a lovely house and a comfortable stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute stay!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Overall it is a nice historic house with nicely done updates on the kitchen and bathroom. The only problem was that one of the fans in the master bedroom didn't work and 2 of the bedroom doors did not lock. Be aware of the half bath because you will be locked in if you close the door and need someone to let you out. I messaged Hunter about the door locks and fan but did not received any response. There were cornhole boards but no bean bags to go with it. Sorry kids. Overall it's a nice house and close to the center of town but just needs some attention to the basics from the property management.

2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cute house, well maintained. Everything was clean and the kitchen was well equipped. The beds were comfortable and loved that the bedrooms had ceiling fans.

We were caught off guard by the lack of soap, shampoo, toothpaste, paper towels, toilet paper, etc. The pictures are nice but the house is 100 years old, along with everything that entails. Bidets are a nice touch. It is right off a main road. And I mean right off the main road. All of the beds are saggy and super unsupportive. It was adequate for a basic stay for a few of us guys, who’ve roughed it plenty (after a trip to Walmart for supplies)."

The house was just what we needed.

Love the big old tree in the yard and the old cemetery across from the neighborhood was a bonus for us history nuts. Both sets of neighbors were quiet lol. The roads were quiet at night as well.

Not only did Travis greet me upon arrival, but he was also gracious enough to assist me in bringing heavier items from my car. I was so appreciative for his hands. The beauty of this home is much desirable. I could not help but to comment well cleaned it was. During my stay, accidentally locked myself out and Travis turned what would have been a very stressful situation, into an easy fix. I love the property. The location of the house is perfect, and the neighbors/ neighborhood is exceptionally quiet. I would love to visit again in the near future!"

I wanted a cozy place to stay for myself, my daughter, my sister and her husband. Gwen not only communicated quickly, but the place was so perfect for my sister and I to enjoy morning coffee and cry before the funeral. The night before check-out Gwen sent us a message that she blacked out the day not wanting us to rush checking out. It wasn’t just a warm and cozy place…the host went above requirements to love on my family in our grief.
Highly recommend this location and host.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Gwen were outstanding hosts and communications were very responsive. We traveled from Iowa to visit our daughter in Anniston, Alabama and didn't want the hotel scene.
Everything was perfect for us. We even met them in person (at our invite) and they truly care about the upkeep of their home. We offered one suggestion about placing a king bed versus a queen bed in the master bedroom and they informed us they would be doing that!
We are sometimes hesitant to be guests at an AirBNB as you never know how the pictures and stated amenities will be until one arrives.
Jason and Gwen deserve the accolades of being Superhosts!
We look forward to staying again if it's available the next time we visit.
We own a Rock Shop in Iowa and our tag line is ... Rock on! This home is a rockin' it.
Thanks for everything!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay, and, even though tiny, everything was spotless & comfortable. The outside sitting area is beautiful, and it will be even nicer once the trees that are planted get established. We were so close to downtown, and there is an awesome plant nursery right down the road with a huge selection and great prices. The self storage is right next door which we hadn't planned on, but there are trees planted that will help with that in time. Beautiful skies, and we were able to see the stars at night. Would highly recommmend this for a couple or someone who is needing somewhere to stay for work in the Anniston/Oxford area."

We loved the home; it’s been beautifully redone and is very tasteful. The space was immaculate and clean and crisp, while also being comfy and cozy! The beds were all fabulous and the pillows and bedding were nice as well!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place with all new finishes. Bedrooms and bathrooms close together so all have easy access. Great nights sleep. I love AirBnBs for family travel. Everyone gets their own bed and own room at a price comparable to two hotel rooms. It is so much easier and more comfortable to be in a lovely home like this together.
Don’t let the map scare you off. A place between two highways may make you shy away, but I can assure you that it is a comfortable neighborhood tucked back between trees/hills. You can hear the highway, but it is just a low hum that is almost unnoticeable, even from outside."

The only hiccup we experienced was of our own doing when my oldest son accidentally locked us out in the middle of the night.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My entire family thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It was plenty comfortable for my family of 6. The pricing was competitive with local hotels, and the house was much more comfortable than anything that a hotel could offer. Julie has really put a lot of effort into having everything a visitor could want. It is an older house, but has been fully remodeled inside, so everything is in good working condition, and the house is immaculately clean. There is plenty of room for kids to run around in the back yard. The kids really enjoyed the Nintendo system (they wish that there was a second controller, but they were plenty happy with what they had) as our kids really hadn't played video games before so they spent most the time at the house playing Super Mario brothers. They also loved the quirky string chair. The neighborhood was very quite and convenient to lots of restaurants and the interstate. If we ever return to the area, we would definitely look to stay here again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For a family of 6 looking to explore the Oxford, Anniston, and Talladega areas, this is perfect. There were four adults in our group.
We were unsure what to expect after we received Julie's phone call saying the previous guest had left a mess and they weren't sure they could fix it all by check-in time, but they did. I couldn't tell anything had been wrong until switching a light tripped the breaker. I called Julie right away and we figured out how to resolve that problem and it didn't happen again.
We didn't cook there as we ate leftovers from restaurants and snacks, but the kitchen is fully functional and we appreciated the water and ice machine on the fridge.
Nearby in Oxford is a huge entertainment place where we raced on go-carts and played laser tag. We didn't have time for mini-golf, bowling or the other things that were at the event location.
We also took a trip to Cheaha State Park and hiked the trails."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s place was clean and she is very accommodating. However, If you plan to be there for several days just make sure to carry extra essentials, toilet paper, paper towels and dishwashing detergent. Her supplies are very scarce"

The house is so cute, and the neighborhood is easy to find! Close to Walmart, all the good shopping spots! She responded quickly anytime I had a question, and provided above and beyond my expectations! We showed up to snacks, fully stocked coffee bar, and she even had a basket of in “case you forgot” which had anything you could think of! Lint roller, razors, hair spray, you name it and she has thought of it! Thanks so much Julie! Next time we are in town to visit, you know where to find us! The Glen Davis Place ❤️ 🏡"

The entire experience was Southern Hospitality at its best! From easy to forget essentials to all the resources needed for enjoying time with family both in-and-out doors, Ms. Julie had everything we needed to feel right at home. The Glen Davis Place was clean, the beds and couches more than comfortable. Everyone, from our 4 year old granddaughter to our 86 year old father, felt right at home. The property grounds and surrounding neighborhood was beautiful. We kept the windows open and enjoyed spending hours each day either on the front porch greeting neighbors or on the back patio just enjoying the scenery. Every time we visit, this will be our “Alabama home” as my son has so affectionately named it. We look forward to our next visit and are grateful to have found such a gem."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I found Jill's home when looking for a place to stay during a business event in Talladega. I had cut it close thanks to my procrastination, so all our locations during previous stays were already booked. She provided clear and simple instructions, which allowed us to find the home on the first pass.
Jill's work renovating the home was excellent *kudos* to her! The home may look small, but it is a very comfortable and clean home in a quiet neighborhood; it felt safe. The home is perfectly situated to allow you to get to either Oxford or Talladega easily, and it is conveniently located with restaurants or grocery stores just a short drive.
I recommend her home if you're going to be in that neck of the woods; my only hesitation is that by doing so, someone else may grab it before I do the next time I'm there. Don't procrastinate. Her home is a gem!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I made a 13 hour drive down to see my fiancée for a week while he’s away at work. When I got to the house it felt just like home.

I loved getting to meet them and we will definitely be staying again anytime I come down while he’s working in Oxford! 💜
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at Vamsi and Maya’s place, and it was wonderful. They are so accommodating and always communicated with us while we were there.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved this Airbnb stay so much! We stayed here for our Thanksgiving trip with family, and I booked it for the location, the fence, and the fact that Vamsi allows doggies! (: It was one of the most comforting, clean, and cute Airbnbs around! The beds were SO comfy and warm, and I had GREAT sleep each night. (: The dogs loved the backyard, and Vamsi was always on top of the communication! The office was especially nice for getting some work done! Also really convenient that Vamsi had Netflix, Disney+ and other subscriptions for us to watch as a family! (: All in all, would 100% stay here again! It was perfect for what we needed/wanted, and Vamsi was the best host!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very accommodating and professional. Great place to stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay - the home was exactly as pictured/described. It was very clean and we most appreciated the fenced backyard for our pups to burn off energy after a long day of driving. The house is on a busy road and you can hear the road noise in the main living area. The master bedroom is in the back of the house and you couldn’t hear it there which was good. It is noted in the profile when I looked again in detailed description.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a great host! We had a personal scheduling issue and he worked very hard to try to help. He proactively reached out more than once to be sure we were comfortable.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was by far the homiest and nicest Airbnb we have ever been to! It was beautifully decorated for Christmas, it had a huge beautiful backyard that made waking up in the morning so peaceful. The beautiful wooden deck with the huge backyard (enclosed) was peaceful. Vamsi was so helpful, kind, friendly, fast to respond to any questions. The inside of the house was BEAUTIFUL! It looked recently renovated, the heater worked well for winter. When we arrived (at night) the place was easy to find as it was lit up, unlike other airbnbs we have been to. This neighbor was safe, yes it’s on a main road but I couldn’t hear the traffic in the house. You can tell the owner put a lot of thought and care into this home. We even arrived to snacks and waters, which was nice after a long drive. Shampoo and body wash and plenty of towels. The couch and recliner were comfy, they have plenty of games for families. Cant wait to stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is just what my little family needed.Beautiful, peaceful place.Felt like home,host was very accommodating and just a joy to deal with.Would stay again!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place and area. Close to anything but still in a quiet area. Loved the fenced in backyard and back patio. Vamsi was very quick to respond to my texts. Home was very clean and was provided more than basic amenities. I.e. laundry soap, seasonings coffee & filters. We brought our own but ran short the last day we were there & these items came to the rescue so we didn’t have to shop again when we were focusing on packing.
I will definitely recommend and book his place again when I back in the area!!
Ps, ladies… keep in mind that there is only 1 TV in the home should you be traveling with others who insist on watching sports. :)
Thank you Vamsi for your hospitality and opening your home to us."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Vamsi was a great host. He is so nice and friendly. His home was so welcoming. It was clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed. We will definitely stay there again.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in for the race weekend. Everything worked well I'm a little bit older saying that! would have preferred a little better mattress.

The house was perfect and only 7 minutes away from publix and Target. It had a fenced-in backyard for my girls to run and play in when it cooled off at night. I will definitely be telling family and friends about this house if they need somewhere to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The accommodation and hosting were excellent. I would definitely be back if I'm in the area again. Vamsi was very responsive even to late night questions. I'm glad I stumbled on this listing. It added to the enjoyment of my first visit to Alabama.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for our visit to the area. Oxford has a lot of retail stores and is only a 10 minutes from this home. 2 bedrooms and another room that can be used as a office. Internet ran perfect. TV in living room has a lot of apps/streaming options.
Kitchen has everything but a dishwasher.
The two bathrooms had plenty of hot water in showers.
Outdoor gas grill was awesome.
Car port parking makes it easy to load/unload under cover if it is raining.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really a wonderful place close to Cheaha State Park. The place had all the amenities we needed, including sharp knives! (Why don’t most Airbnbs have those??) Our only issue was that the place had a lot of air fresheners, but Vamsi was very responsive and we simply removed them for our stay. The place was extremely clean, with lots of thoughtful touches (including an electric tea kettle) and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We’d definitely love to come back!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was very clean and smelled great.. the shampoo and body wash that were there for us to use was a big help, as well as the hair dryer and laundry detergent.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Vamsi's home exceeded our expectations! The home was lovely, clean and very comfortable. It was the perfect place to stay for my husband and I as we traveled across Alabama. We enjoyed the lovely deck and back yard as well. I can't recommend it more highly!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Vamsi's place was the perfect place to stop on our very long drive across the country! It had everything we needed to make a simple cooked meal for ourselves and unwind after a long day on the road. Vamsi kindly left us a bottle of sparkling wine and snacks, which was very helpful. Our kids really enjoyed playing with the card games and coloring in the coloring books. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were nicely stocked with toiletries (like shampoo and body wash). If we need to stop through Oxford again, we will definitely stay here!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place. It’s a house in which we could comfortably live. I came away with new floor fever for our own house because Vamsi’s place has been recently updated. The furniture is comfortable, and the whole place was so clean. A welcome basket of goodies awaited us at this quiet location. The motion detector lighting in the carport and in the house made returning at night a breeze. We will definitely look to book this house again at Thanksgiving next year."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As a teacher, I will say this place earned an A+. It was affordable, spotless, and very conveniently located. I was extremely impressed with the appearance and scent upon arrival and could see we were provided with many necessities for our stay. We were able to enjoy two simple and peaceful journeys to Talladega National Forest for hiking; it was less than 20 miles away. Many restaurants, gas stations, and stores are located within 5 - 10 minutes, which was a major convenience for our getaway. I have ZERO complaints and would definitely recommend this listing to others. Also, I would book this place again. Score: 100% : )"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice home! Very clean! Well worth it
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Short story: BOOK IT! The owners have gone to great lengths to make this home welcoming and relaxing. We would stay here again.
Long story: This home is nestled in a beautiful country like neighborhood. The neighborhood felt safe! It’s less than 5 miles away from a variety of restaurants, shopping locations and the highway. The home is very clean and welcoming. We arrived in the evening and it was already dark outside. It was a pleasant surprise to find that soft lighting was on inside the house and ready to receive us. Check in instructions were easy to follow. House rules were posted with helpful info. There were even instructions on how to use the thermostat. Bonus points for a fridge stocked with condiments one might need, soap, lotions and q-tips provided. Cozy decor, books, and board games make one feel like they’re visiting old friends. My only regret was not arriving earlier to fully enjoy all that the home has to offer including the cutest most relaxing backyard. The owners are very quick to respond and very friendly. My boys were ready to move in and call it home! Can’t say enough good things about our stay here!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of this cabin is beautifully made with real wood, updated open concept rustic farmhouse feel. There is ample room, comfortable furniture, and excellent wifi. Outdoors is surrounded by beautiful countryside. The area is quiet, peaceful, and private. Getting in and out is super easy. If you're looking for a laid back relaxed unwinding atmosphere, then look no further. Gas stations and country restaurants are a 5 minute drive away. There is ample parking that generously accommodates vehicles with boats, trailers, etc. The kitchen is big enough to prep food and cook easily. Be prepared to bring your own spices/seasonings, food, snacks, drinks, etc. Pots/pans and dishes are aplenty. The AC/heat unit works quickly, easy, and the airflow from room to room circulates well. Your kids (and you), will love the high speed internet and wifi here. The bedroom comes with extra pillows/blankets and even a box fan (which was a lovely bonus). This was such a lovely relaxed stay for us."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot for us!

Jason and Reagan responded immediately when I had a question, they are friendly and personable, the place is immaculate with beautiful decor. If I ever need a place to stay in Anniston, I will absolutely look into their place first. Thank you Jason and Reagan!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect location in between Annistion and Jacksonvillle. Slower paced and relaxing place

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely be back. the place was off the beaten path a little but actually very close to many parks and small towns. We had a great time dining and shopping at the many picker places. The home was super clean and comfortable. The linens were soft, and the bed was very comfortable. We had a few questions for our host, who replied right away. The area was well lit at night, quiet and relaxed. We would highly recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I loved the size and location of the unit, along with plenty of parking. Great place to ""stage"" for our motorcycle and hiking day trips. This area of Alabama is beautiful and it was perfect for us. We appreciated the white noise maker as the walls are thin. Reagan was extremely helpful working with us to figure out the DirecTV box as the internet is not quite strong enough and reliable for streaming TV. The washer and dryer were fantastic and beyond convenient, as well as the kitchen as we cooked in every night. We are looking forward to staying again if we are ever in the area. Big thank you to Reagan and Jason."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Place was awesome beautiful and peaceful area clean and spotless five star rating for sure will be back definitely
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely amazing! So cute and cozy; a perfect place to get away. It is going to be hard to stay elsewhere because they set the bar high! The hosts were helpful and responsive. Thank you for creating such a peaceful place for your guests!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Nice place!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful place. The dogs were very welcoming. I couldn't say enough how beautiful this place was. I definitely recommend this place for people looking at a peaceful place to relax.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Although our stay was short and sweet, they helped make it just that! We would definitely stay here again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for a 5 week clinical rotation and overall I had a great experience. Reagan and Jason were wonderful hosts and were always ready to help if I needed something. The place is brand new, decorated well, and very well taken care of. Only downside I would say is that the cell service can be spotty at times because of the location. I have Verizon and found that FaceTime was very laggy but phone calls usually worked. This airbnb is located in a very quiet area, not surrounded by too much but Oxford and Jacksonville are only 15-20mins away. The walls to the airbnb are really thin but I used a fan and it seemed to block out most of the noise if there was someone staying beside me. Overall I would stay here again if I am ever in the area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My wife had a three week stay in Unit A and had a wonderful time. All the needed amenities were available. The unit was clean and comfortable and made the stay enjoyable. Just bring some food and settle in for a wonderful visit. The hosts were always available to assist in any needed concern and were very courteous to deal with. The location is in a wooded area and extremely quiet. This lends itself for a relaxing stay away from the normal hustle and bustle. The internet works well, however cell service from this location can be challenging at times. In all, we look forward to a return visit in the near future without hesitation."

,,,"It’s very unfortunate that I cannot recommend these hosts. They were very difficult and tried cancelling my reservation as soon as I arrived. Some of the things they said to me and also did in this matter was a huge violation of my privacy. Thankfully, everything was resolved through AirBnB’s discrimination support team and the hosts were informed of their violations and were educated further on the policies."
