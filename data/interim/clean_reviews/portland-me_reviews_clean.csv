2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay a lot of things to do in waking distance. Located in the heart of downtown
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great time! Charming place to stay in a great location.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great neighborhood to stay in. Lots of beautiful victorian houses and walkable to shops and restaurants and about a 15 minute walk to Old Port. The porch was nice too for relaxing while taking a break from all the walking.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a cute little apartment in a convenient location close to the west end. Perfect for our family, very cozy. We enjoyed hanging out together on the porch."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Host was helpful and offered an earlier check in which was a nice surprise.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool spot. Clean and was right where we wanted to be as first time visitors to Portland.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, had everything I needed. The location is fantastic, easy walk to downtown and a bunch of fantastic restautrants"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cozy spot in the heart of Portland. Host was super about being available for any questions or issues. Cute apartment with a comfortable bed… quiet side street.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and a super responsive and helpful host! Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful place! Everything was easy to use and set up so nicely
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place and very well located, host very responsive and helpful. Definitely, I would recommend their condo,if you want to explore Portland."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Steve, the co-host, was extremely responsive and great to communicate with! We enjoyed our stay in Portland :) The condo needs to be renovated which is why I’m giving 4 stars not 5."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"The apartment is cozy & nicely appointed, the location quiet and safe. It would have been nice to know more about parking before booking, better to judge whether a hotel with parking included would better suit us. Detailed information in the unit about the city & advice & a map about parking were helpful. Nonetheless we had to circle the area several times in the evening to find a spot and then move the car in the morning to avoid a possible ticket. Parking in the near-by garage costs $40/night. This of course isn't controlled by the hosts for whom we have only praise. We appreciated the coffee, tea, snacks, and even more Steven's immediate responses to our communications. We had difficulty regulating the temperature, but found many extra blankets and comforters, so were not cold. We would not recommend this venue to guests planning on using the sofa-bed, which is decidedly uncomfortable. We very much appreciated Steven's extending our check-out time, a generous gesture."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and clean place, super close to arts district and walkable to a ton of restaurants!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing location. You’re right next to everything. Shalini and her husband were super attentive, quick with communication, and gave great recs."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Pleasant stay. Very clean and nice area!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot excellent hosts!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cool and spacious apartment (loved the brick!) walking distance to anything in Old Port. We had a question about check in and the host responded immediately even though it was very late. Would stay again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location for easy walking to the State Theater and everything else that Portland has to offer. Communication was terrific and place was very clean. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location near Portland shops and restaurants
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shalini’s place was perfect for our quick 1 night in Portland. Cozy, comfortable and within walking distance to downtown. Very clean space, and responsive host and co-host!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a home base in the city walkable to the east end, west end and old port. This was a perfect location for that. Cohost Steve was proactive with messaging and responded within 5 minutes when I had a heating pump question (he was very kind, considering I hadn't read the detailed instructions that were left before I texted!)."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"what a great location! it was easy to get everywhere we wanted to go either by car or on foot. parking was a little tricky if we got back around dinner time but we were able to find a spot in close proximity without needing the garage that's nearby. we had a hard time with the lock box but figured it out after a few tries. we also had a hard time locking the keypad from the outside and we could've used some more instruction there. the place was clean with plenty of linens and blankets, a huge smart tv, and a great sized fridge. we traveled with our preschooler and infant. Steve was incredibly responsive and helpful. it was a great stay!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very tidy, great location. The exceptional communication made us feel welcome. Price was great for the location.
The bed felt uneven, and though the mattress itself was comfortable, the odd unevenness was not ideal.
Despite that, would recommend!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Pros: The location is great and Steve was super quick to respond when we were struggling to locate the correct unit (it was dark, cold, and rainy… so we appreciated the responsiveness!). The unit is small but highly functional.
Cons: The bed is uncomfortable and loud/creaky and temperature was a challenge to regulate in the unit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Walkable to downtown restaurants. Neat old Victorian feel!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a charming little place in the heart of downtown. very walkable and close to many great restaurants.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed one night,Cute spot & walkable to restaurants and shopping. We didn’t have issue finding street parking either!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space and located close enough for a 17 minute walk to old port! Shaking provided helpful information about parking, food recommendations, and made check in/ check out so easy! The space had everything we could’ve needed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay, would visit again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,I only stayed one night to see a comedy show but the place was near everywhere you’d like to be in portland it was more cost effective than the holiday inn and can accommodate 2 couples quite well idk how the pull out couch was but if you dont hear people complaining in the morning it was probably pretty good. Next time i go to Portland i will see if this place is available.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was exactly as listed. Very easy and close to everything. We took Ubers at night and it was only 4-5$ due to how close it was!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is so much cozier and more comfortable than the pictures depict! It is central to everything and the place was so charming!
We were not able to find parking, but comfortably and easily parked at the Westin up the street for $40 a night.
There were so many blankets and the heated blankets were such a great bonus.
Had the most wonderful time!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super charming, very clean and close to everything. Definitely consider this spot if you’re visiting Portland!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Host's provide clear instructions for check-in/locating the place as well as a plethora of recommendations on things to do/see in the area.
Convenient location and walkable neighborhood!
Parking can be tricky which was clearly detailed by hosts - recommend using the public lot at the end of the street for ease!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location to explore downtown Portland. Easily walkable to a number of restaurants, bars, coffee shops etc. More than enough space to relax and a nice private porch as well. Street parking took a few extra minutes but wasn't that bad and we used our car multiple times throughout the stay."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, good a/c, lots of amenities, clean. On the downside, bed is creaky and uneven and stairs need a better handrail."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super location and very well decorated
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"lovely home and very good location.
we adore portland and felt safe....parked easily and enjoyed all the moments of our stay. thank you so very much!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Amazing location. Loved the front porch, super quiet ans private."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place in a terrific location!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Shalani's place is well sotuated to walk to concerts at State Theater as well as walking to great restaurants on Commercial Street and that area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Host was proactive with communication and provided great local recommendations and parking suggestions/tips after check in. In a nice location in the arts district and ~20/25min walk to other desirable areas for Portland. Parking was a bit tight arriving later in the afternoon when residents are coming back from work, would recommend arriving earlier and parking before 3pm if you can."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot and walkable location. Perfect hub if you don’t have a car to be able to explore the surrounding area. Peaceful porch to sip coffee on. Hope to be back!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"We were happy with the super convenient location! We could definitely hear sounds from the adjacent apartment and the upstairs flat so we were a bit uncomfortable with talking in the living room part. The shower was nice, as well as the AC! Ultimately it was a convenient location to use as a bedroom to explore Portland from, but if you want to lounge in the Airbnb, you might feel somewhat imposing on your neighbors life."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed here multiple times now, I think either 3 or 4. It’s cute, cozy, simple, all the amenities, and the host is great. One thing I love is how quiet it is there, for being right in the middle of the city. The outside porch is incredibly sweet and private and comfortable. This was, however the first time I’ve had to leave my parking spot, and then try to find parking later in the evening (around 11pm). That was a lesson learned. I ended up parking in a handicapped reserved spot because I couldn’t even get into the parking garage down the road. I didn’t sleep well worrying about it, and then got up early to look for a better spot. Luckily check out is late, so I went back and had a nice long morning nap. In the future, I will either only stay here if I’m only going out on foot, or I will leave my car and uber out.
Thank you again for sharing this space! I’ll be back again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was so beautiful my fiancé and I just kept saying wow how beautiful this place is. It’s so cozy yet so elegant. The host was so amazing especially when we had to leave a day early. There are no word to describe how amazing they were. We are so appreciative with their kindness and their flexibility. I most defiantly recommend.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Shalini was extremely helpful with us needing an early checkin due to a wedding and was very accommodating. Thank you!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This condo was well stocked and in a great location in Portland Maine.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great find! The place was clean and comfortable and did not disappoint. Everything we needed was there and more. The little touches like the snack basket, local guides and personalized recommendations were terrific! Our host was super responsive during check-in and check-out and even magically appeared to assist when we had a small issue with a door. One of our best AirBNB experiences - we would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic stay!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the area you want to stay to really enjoy Portland. Once you park, everything you will enjoy (food, drinks, art, music) is within walking distance. Don’t worry about too much planning; their welcome book is on point for food and drink recommendations. We moseyed our way to Pai Men Miyake, sauntered to a show at the Space gallery, then hit up choice drinks along Congress Street, and happily headed home. Yes home! The hosts thought of everything for a cozy comfy stay. Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was a great airbnb for exploring Portland. We were able to walk most places which saved a lot on Ubers. The condo is comfortable and perfect for a home base while exploring Portland.
The place was clean and the AC was amazing, especially after walking around all day.
If you have a car parking can be an issueand you may have to pay to park, we did a few times.
The Hosts were very responsive and accommodating. They even game us gift card to a local restaurant because there was last minute construction on the street the day we got in.
We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place to stay in Portland, perfect for a couple! Was close enough to walk anywhere we wanted to go. Steve was extremely helpful, even offering to drop off umbrellas since the weather was not cooperating! We had no issue with parking, always found a spot on the street. Thanks again Steve!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed our stay for two nights while visiting Portland. Quick access to Congress St and can still walk downtown.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Cute apartment on a nice street in a great neighborhood. Queen bed in the bedroom was very comfortable and hosts were exceptionally quick to respond when we needed them. A couple issues, though… apartment was pretty small (just two rooms, really: one bedroom, and one room for everything else), which was fine for a couple nights but would be tough for a longer stay. Foldout couch was not super comfortable, but that’s typical of foldout couches. There were instructions not to flush anything down the toilet besides toilet paper, which we followed to the letter, but still had to plunge the toilet four times over the course of two days. We also had allergy problems from the dust (although frankly we are pretty sensitive and have allergy problems in most air bnbs). Lastly, parking is pretty tricky, as the street parking is heavily restricted. Other than these minor issues, we had a pretty comfortable stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shalini’s condo unit has old world charm with all of the modern conveniences. The 2 rooms were spacious and well appointed. The porch was great to have as an extra room. We sat outside after a long day and it was very relaxing.
The house manual was very helpful with some great area recommendations.
We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"the condo was nice private and had everything you needed
the only thing is parking is terrible."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location! Parking was the only challenge, as all of the street parking was filled."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Victorian Condo was just as described. Comfortable and perfect for a one night stay. I appreciate them allowing for one night stays. Walkable to all of downtown and Old Port Portland. Restaurants a few blocks away.
Steve was very helpful in picking us up from Amtrak and taking us the next day via lighthouses to our cruise ship. Very knowledge and very nice. Special addition to staying in their condo."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in Portland! A walkable distance to many shops & restaurants & to the waterfront
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was perfect
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location was excellent, very close to many restaurants and a short walk to the port. It was easy to find the apartment and the check in was very simple and straightforward. The apartment was clean and everything was where it was supposed to be. However, there isn’t much shampoo and conditioner for many people or for a longer stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we have spent time in quite a few Airbnbs. this is well worth the price. walking distance to so much of Portland. great coffee shops, restaurants, dispensaries. Hiked in Freeport which was beautiful. would definitely recommend and likely would stay here in the future. the chowder at Gilbert's is amazing. tandem coffee is awesome too.l"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very satisfied. Able to walk everywhere. Cozy apartment. Beautiful neighborhood.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a beautiful and peaceful stay! The owners were very helpful and kind, would stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we loved our stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very nice place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice apartment in the center of town. We liked the balcony where we could eat our meals. Very good communication with the host who did everything to accomodate our wishes. We like Portland and surrounding state parks. We would like to visit again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay! The apartment was very clean and the hosts were welcoming and friendly. Small and cozy space great for exploring Portland.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place! Co-host Steve was so responsive and always communicated with us from ck in to ck out! We walked everywhere from condo. We definitely fell in love with City of Portland! We will be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We did a quick overnight for a friends wedding with our 1 month old. Steve and Shalini wee accommodating with an early check in as feasible and had a pack and play in the apartment for us to use. The apartment was clean and well stocked with complimentary food and beverages. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place did what it needed to. It would be good for a couple but with 4 adults it was tight. It’s a cozy apartment with things we needed but the bathroom was tight especially the shower. There was room for the provided air mattress and pull out couch. The location is decent and you can walk almost anywhere within 20 minutes. Parking was tough but the host guided us to available spots and told us the best places to keep the car. There was a book with recommendations as well as a basket full of snacks. Something to note, the outdoor patio is next to another residents bedroom so you have to be quiet. There’s also no smoking on the patio. I would stay here again."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a great little apartment that is exactly what I needed. I love the location and the host goes above and beyond to be helpful and friendly. This was my second stay and have it booked again for a later date. Definitely happy and would recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We walked in and there was a lovely song playing in the kitchen! The space was warm and welcoming! Such an amazing place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was cozy and clean, and the hosts were very responsive! We traveled here in March and the heated blankets on the bed were a nice touch. Snacks and coffee were left for us to enjoy while in Portland. Just a fair warning street parking is available but not always easy to find. So close to the State Theater and some great restaurants, too! Thanks for a comfortable stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,fabulous all around. will stay again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A quiet and comfortable space 1 block away from great shops and restaurants. Perfect.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The local is hard to beat; right within walking distance of the PMA, shops and lots of great restaurants. Steve (co-host) reached out to us several times to make sure everything to was going okay and gave us flexibility with checking out. We didn’t end up needing anything but if we had it’s clear there was accommodations for that. Overall a great experience, we could easily see ourselves coming back here in the future to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Extremely informative, helpful and very accommodating! We were so very happy with our experience."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a weekend in Portland! Quiet neighborhood and was able to rest but walkable distance to great places to enjoy town.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The kitchen was small and lacking a bit but it was a cute apartment. The porch was very peaceful. Parking was hard and annoying sometimes. Steve was very responsive.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time. Unit was very nice
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and fantastic host. Affordable and adorable. Highly recommend!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a wonderful time in Portland, Maine. I would request this place again."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"We stayed for 1 night with 4 people and it was perfect! The neighborhood is full of beautiful brick buildings and it wasn’t noisy at all. We parked on Deering St. no problem and at no cost! You’ll see the number of the apartment on the front facing Deering St, but the entrance is right around the corner on Avon St :) The electric blanket was AMAZING (nice touch) and all of the amenities were there; first aid kit, light snacks, extra towels and linens, tv if wanted. Very clear instructions and flexible with check-in. We walked everywhere - lots of recommended restaurants, coffee, convenience stores nearby and a 20 minute walk to the water - it wasn’t bad, though, because there is so much to see on the stroll down there! Our friends said the pullout couch wasn’t bad, either. Would recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent host, got to talk to him at the end of our stay, lovely guy and a beautiful place."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a beautiful little Airbnb in a great location. Walking distance to many greats spots. Extremely nice and proactive hosts and very responsive. Everything was clean and comfortable and very homey. I’d definitely come back!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect place to escape to, and even better to be so close to everything! Once we parked we could walk everywhere we needed to be. Since the place is among other homes, we felt like we got the experience of being in the city without feeling like tourists."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little space in a great location. Close to restaurants/businesses/venues but also has a peaceful vibe. We went to a show at the State Theatre and it was so close and convenient! Cute little porch. Communication was specific and informative, friendly and welcoming! Thanks for providing a sweet little space for a night to the city for a rural maine crew. Great start to the New Year!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very helpful host. Extremely responsive. Definitely will use the place again in the future

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic little apartment, would absolutely stay again!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great recommendations, comfy bed, and close to my favorite breakfast spots!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A very cute place that was walking distance from a bunch of great restaurants. Lots of charming and thoughtful details inside plus some much appreciated snacks! It would have been nice to get to spend more time there. I had to book last minute due to an unexpected flight delay and they were very accommodating and got back to me very quickly to assure that I had what I needed.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely apartment that’s charmingly decorated and filled with nice touches for travelers (we really appreciated the snack basket and restaurant recommendations!). The location was perfect and we had no trouble finding street parking nearby. Would definitely come back again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely wonderful location! This condo is perfectly appointed and adorably decorated! Communication with the host was clear and helpful. We hope to return!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely little condo in the heart of Portland. They are not kidding when they say it is in walking distance to everything!
Small little touches made us feel like we were right at home.
We were traveling with a baby and this was the perfect size and they provided a pack-n-play.
Super clean and well stocked kitchen amenities."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome location! Clean and lots to enjoy!

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Pros:
Good location, walkable to all main attractions of Portland
Comfortable Bed
Cool historic building
Cons:
Apartment is much smaller than pictures lead you to believe
Finishings are mix matched
Parking is challenging
Porch is adjacent to another apartment’s window and can’t be used in the evenings
Host did not respond to message about an issue
Check-in was delayed by host
Overall this was a place to stay, cleanly, and a good location. However, due to the overall experience I would not stay again or recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, convenient location, we would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful old neighborhood. Great location you can walk anywhere and bus lines run right down the street. Parking on street is tough to find at night but we had no problem during the day. Porch was very cute.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was fantastic and the location is spot on. It’s a cozy place in the arts district and walkable to everything. Host was great and allowed us to check in a little early and drop off our bags. Comfortable and spacious enough for the three of us visiting from the south and traveling through Maine. Highly recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space is beautiful and conveniently located right where you'd want to be if you were coming in from out of town. The check-in info was thorough and clear, and the home itself was clean & bright."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2022-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"This place is very conveniently located; however, there are stains in carpets and thick dust on some furniture. We also reached out to the co-host with a questions about check-in, but he never responded. We were disappointed with our stay here."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"This condo is PERFECTLY located, within a short walking distance of tons of restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is beautiful to walk through, and pretty quiet despite being so close to a major thoroughfare. The only big challenge was the street parking, which was constantly full, even on the street that the host suggested. The condo itself is pretty tiny but had everything we needed. It was clean, functional, and cozy. The bed is extraordinarily creaky."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment had everything we needed including some great local information from our hosts. The porch area in particular is a great touch. Many thanks, Tristan"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This location is perfect for walking to old port and experiencing Portland. They had marked maps with recommendations to the waterfront. Both the host and co-host were very helpful when we had an issue, and responded very promptly. Thank you!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute place, although in looking back on pictures it was smaller than it appeared. It was clean and had what we needed. Great location for walking to restaurants. The host was very nice and timely in communications."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"+ Amazingly walkable and quiet side street location, ease of parking,
lovely porch, great communication and attentive host, price for the area.
- A smaller space, especially traveling with a kid, decor could use a bit of a refresh but is totally functional."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, well-appointed, such a pleasant place to stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location for walking distance to anything in central Portland & Old Port. Tons of thoughtful & personal touches like a list of restaurant recommendations. Coffee on the porch was a delight!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location. Close to so many great places to eat. Super cute space and sitting out on the porch was delightful.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We came to Portland just for a night on our way up to Bar Harbor. This apartment was perfect, and we wish we had more time! We were a short walk to everything in town, lots of snacks and amenities on arrival to make our check in more comfortable. We would stay again on our next visit!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and charming little airbnb in a nice neighbourhood !
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful apartment in Portland!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Accommodating hosts as well! We were able to check in a bit early as we arrived sooner than anticipated. The walk to everything was short as described. I’d definitely stay again. Thank you!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place - perfect location - well-provided Kitchen - Parking is available but not always right outside the door. There is a good spot to unload and load up after your trip however. Comfortable and everything you may need to explore Portland
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"By far the prettiest and cleanest air bnb we have stayed in! Lovely neighborhood with beautiful homes and churches, parks, etc. around the corner. The condo itself was so cozy, everything felt brand new and as if decorated by a true professional as far as furniture, colors and comfort. Immediate response whenever we had any question, great location (we were able to find street parking right near the house however Westin parking garage right around corner), and a fun walk to the piers. What a wonderful, quaint down town with lots of little pubs, restaurants, shops, etc. and brick or cobblestone sidewalks and plazas, outdoor bars/restaurants with live music on the water. Only a 15 minute walk downtown (if you go the right way!) but fun to get lost and wander too. Even though cost for one night is on the high side, it is less expensive than any hotel in the area, with so much more to offer. Highly recommend Shalini's place!!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little apartment in Portland, a good walkable location from most sites. Ice cold AC in each room, and the porch was nice to hang out on as well."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location for our short stay in Portland. Shalini was communicative and easy to reach.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Well located, clean, cute. Easy check in. Parking is a challenge, but there are garages, so if you don’t want to fuss, just pay for the garage."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The condo was cute and cozy and located in a beautiful neighborhood of Portland! It was walking distance to a few great spots we checked out, like Hot Suppa and Tandem Coffee Roasters."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Shalini’s place was perfect for our family. The space was clean and comfortable. She even left a basket of some little treats for us which was such a nice touch. Her response time to our questions, when we had them, was very quick.
We were able to walk to many things. The location was great. We would stay here again, should we find ourselves in Portland again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Shalini’s place is a great, located in a quite neighborhood about a 5-10 minute walk to downtown area with tons of restaurants and bars. The apartment itself was clean, well supplied and had everything we needed. The outdoor patio was a great touch and enjoyed sitting out there early mornings. Overall we had a great stay in Portland and would recommend this place highly."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot was the perfect mix of near everything and relaxed. The neighborhood is charming and quiet, but it's only a block from Congress St., which is one of the main drags through Portland. The porch and the small touches inside the unit gave it a truly homey feel. There's great restaurants nearby. Easy check-in/out. Can't say enough good things about our stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! I'd stay again
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely no complaints. Steve was great and was super sweet when there was some confusion on checkout. Lovely apartment.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute and cozy place for our first time in Portland! Finding street parking outside the house or nearby was easier than we expected. Lots of restaurants within walking distance. The hosts were very accommodating and always responded quickly.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was our favorite on our 20 day road-trip. What a beautiful ambiance Steve & Shalini provided! We walked in to some dean martin/frank sinatra playing which is my fav! Such a cute set up! Communication was great. My 1 year old just started walking and grabbed the light fixture and it broke. I told him right away and his first response was to make sure he was ok. Sometimes it can be hard to travel with kiddos but Steve made us feel confident that he understood! We also like circulating air and always need fans. He didn’t have one available but he brought us one to make sure we were comfortable! This was at like 10pm too. The location was close to everything and we so enjoyed our stay. Also do yourself a favor and go to The Holy Donut and get the cinnamon sugar blueberry donut. I literally wish I had one right now! This location was close to Old Port where it is located and easy to get to. We would stay here again if we ever returned. I will say the only downside is street parking but we were able to figure it out!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful home. Perfect location!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay in Portland was great. The apartment was well-stocked with necessities and some nice surprises. It was super clean and comfortable. If you drive, be sure to figure out the parking situations. It was an unexpected expense for our vacation, but it was no fault of the owner. It’s the city."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was so cute, I even loved the music playing as we walked in the door. Great location, cozy, clean, and even cuter in person then in the photos. You can really tell a lot of love went into this little home. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location and very clean place to stay while in Portland! The host communicated greatly and had great response times. We were able to walk or Uber (very short and cheap Uber) to the main streets, and the location was safe. I would stay here again if I am ever back in Portland!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great ! Beautiful place, clean and well located :)
We had a lovely stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here! Such a great location with a quick walk to the Old Port and awesome coffee shops, restaurants, and bars nearby too!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay! Great location, very nice space that is quiet and tucked away from Congress, but easily walkable to all the restaurants and shops. Definitely will be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great little Airbnb! My family and I stayed for a week. The location was perfect and so central to everything, and there were so many great little touches (snacks and coffee, toys for the kids, etc.). Communication was quick and easy and Shalini made sure we had a great stay. We’d definitely return!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The condo is small but adequate for 2 people. It is located about a 20 minute walk from the port area and very close to restaurants and bars. Parking is bananas in Portland and there is no parking space included with this listing.
Overall it’s a nice place in a good part of town."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place!! My boyfriend and I had such a great experience at this lovely home. Everything was extremely clean and we appreciated the little touches like the music playing when we walked in and the abundance of snacks :). We really enjoyed the cute little private porch out front. Perfect location for walking into town. All around it was perfect!
2022-05-01,4,Stayed about a week,"I had a great stay here! The place was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The apartment was in a great location, so close to great restaurants and shops. Recommend!"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"In a great area, would recommend"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Shalini’s place was exactly what we needed. We walked most places, it was well stocked with all the essentials."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The unit was perfect for the two of us for a weekend getaway to Portland. Cozy and in a good location to walk to all the things downtown we wanted to see.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Adorable place! Loved being there. Very quiet overnight.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cute stay in a great location! When I got there I immediately checked to see if this place was available for an additional night, that’s how cute it is! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In real estate they say important is Location, Location, Location. Well you can't get a better spot than this AirBnB. Add quaint Maine charm and great hosts and you just can't go wrong. This small 1 bedroom apartment has everything you need. Great sleep and didn't even mind when the weather turned cold and wet - everything we needed was already provided or only a short walk away. On that note - there is no need for a car. We walked everywhere and only got an (inexpensive) Uber for travel to a neighboring town.
Shalini was incredibly prompt with any, and all communications; though we didn't need anything it was nice to know there was a person right by to address any issues that arose. Shoot, they even worked to have us picked up at the airport--how's that for service."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a fantastic place to stay. Highly recommend it!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded expectations, parking was not an issue just use the garage it’s super close! The house was amazing and so close to everything."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Parking is on the street

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great spot in a GREAT location, close to everything. We were able to walk to Old Port and enjoy great food and drink. The apartment is super cozy and had everything that we needed for our stay. We made sure to arrive before it got too dark so we were able to easily park a couple blocks away on the street and didn't have any issues. We are already looking forward to our next trip back to Portland!!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shalini has a great place. It is a well-designed place and very comfortable. It is close to the central part of Portland. A quick walk away from many things. Self-check-in, too."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Shalini was wonderful to communicate with! The space is in a fabulous part of town with easy walking access to some of my favorite spots in Portland. Her welcome guide was chalk-full of fantastic suggestions. I look forward to staying here again.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing location, very comfortable spot! Such cute decor and setup!"
2021-10-01,3,Stayed one night,"Pictures misleading.
Looks modern and Fresh in photos but in reality charming but too much clutter and stuff. Books out in rain on porch. New heating remotes, back with batteries taped and falling off. Didn’t feel entirely clean. Manager person never responded to my texts and parking is a nightmare. We lucked out last minute or we would have just left.
Prepare to park 5-10 blocks away."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Nicely furnished in a great location!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely little apartment in a great location (aka close to Tandem Coffee)! Check-in was easy with all the directions and pictures Shalini provided. My sisters and I were just staying the night in Portland but it served all our needs. Definitely recommend!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in Portland!
2021-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,It is a nice looking place and in a nice neighborhood.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, great location. Parking is a little tough, though, so keep that in mind if you’re driving."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Her place is conveniently located to the center of the city. The space was the perfect size and the bed was very comfortable. Street parking is a challenge, but we were expecting that."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay in for Portland! We were right at the end of the downtown strip and was able to walk the entire city in a casual stroll.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location, very walkable to lots of great stuff in Portland! Parking can take some patience, but otherwise a great place to stay in Portland."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very comfortable place, excellent communication and preparation, really enjoyed our stay. Only a little parking game issue to be aware of but worth it to be here."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and cool space with a well stocked kitchen! Convenient, quiet and quaint! Great reference information!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect apartment in a great location.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay in Portland - cute rustic vibe and so close to everything in walking distance to shops, restaurants, the pier, etc. The condo had everything we needed for our visit!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little spot! Walking distance to everything and great reviews for food in the welcome book
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay here last week - so comfy, convenient and many thoughtful amenities. Excellent information provided about the apartment and the area. Located on a quiet leafy side street just steps from town. Great porch for a quiet drink with a book before dinner. Walked to dinner at Fore St. Very comfortable bed. We will be back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,thumbs up
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Super apt within walking distance to lots of great spots.
2021-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"While this was a very cute and cozy stay, there were two things that were a bummer as we stayed.
1) While there is free parking. It is only from 5:01pm to 8:59am M-F. So this is a little misleading. If you’re staying multiple days, you’ll have to find a place for your car between 9 and 5 on the weekdays.
2) The bed is actually a full. Not a queen. This was the biggest let down for us as we have a queen at home and felt a little cramped.
We enjoyed our stay and the hospitality was great."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is very cozy and well appointed. A quiet neighborhood that is well located for everything in Portland!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This one-bedroom condo was perfect for a weekend in Portland, where I was attending a close friend's wedding. It was super clean, charmingly appointed, and had all the amenities that you could want. On top of that - the location was really terrific; most things I wanted to do were a short walk away. And, communication with Shalini was easy; she was very responsive whenever I reached out. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cool and welcoming place to step into! We were greeted by the sound of Dean Martin on arrival, what a nice touch! This family are definitely seasoned AirBnB hosts, if you think you've forgotten something--they've already got it on hand for you! This family truly know how to host and I bet their family gatherings are a blast!! We were lucky enough to stay for one night on our way back from Acadia, and after days of hiking and the great outdoors, it was so lovely to sink into a big comfy bed. We found parking on the street close by, their strategic check in time made it easy to park the car for the night. The location was great for us to walk down to Old Port and back (we are NYers and used to walking but it would be an extremely short car ride too), but still quiet enough for a great night's sleep. The side porch would be lovely with a cup of something and a book mid-day. Def stay here, they will take care of you :)"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great place in a great location. With a little bit of effort you can walk everywhere, or Uber downtown for about $10. Parking wasn't too bad - found a space a few blocks over. Condo is a touch in the small side. I imagine it would be tight for anymore than 2 people. it has everything you need though. Front porch is a great spot for coffee and cocktails. I would stay here again"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay in this charming house which is centrally located in the heart of Portland. Shalini, our host, provided us with lots of great tips. There's a lot of great dining options nearby and the Old Port of Portland is not far. The only minor issue is that street parking was a little difficult to find (I still managed to get parking a couple of blocks away) but thats to be expected given the central location and there's lots of public transit nearby"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"5/5 would stay again! Great location, great access - everything was top notch."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Shalini’s place was in a really wonderful part of Portland right by the center of the city. The place itself was very cute and very easy to get into. Shalini was very responsive and a great house! Would highly recommend.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Shalini's place is very nice and easy to find. The parking is a bit tough as there is not much street parking. It may take some patience to find the free spot. Shalini is very responsive. The place is super clean and has everything you need.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute spot — has a lot of charm and character and is well maintained and very functional. Was perfect for two of us staying for the night. We were able to walk everywhere though it was a little far (20ish minutes to most places).
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great location, communicative hosts, and all in all a nice little pad in a wonderful neighborhood."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Shalani's place is exactly as advertised. We LOVED the location, which is central to everything. Their welcome packet gave lots of tips on local restaurants which was very helpful. We would absolutely stay there again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great apartment, comfortable & convenient, the only problem is parking, in fact parking is a problem all over town. Walking & Uber is a better choice."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Thank You Debbie and Brad for sharing your piece of heaven with us.
We were 9 days in paradise, a vacation we waited for since our honeymoon 39 years ago.
Hope to be back to Maine and 4 Loveitts in a couple years.
God Bless you both,
Nancy and John Faskel🥰"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect spot, we will certainly be back again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best AirBnB that my wife and I have experienced. The view was absolutely spectacular. Waking up to view the sunrise and sitting out with a cup of coffee was so peaceful. The space was perfectly clean. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazong and peaceful location.
Some great recommendations
The hot tub was well needed after our travels."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Unbelievable view. Convenient to everything you need and more!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Debbie’s home was amazing and exceeded expectations. She has many extra personal touches throughout the Airbnb which was also one of the cleanest Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. We absolutely loved the waterfront view, walkability, and peacefulness. Great host and home!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely stunning. Even better than the pictures. The view at sunrise and at dusk is so relaxing. And the hot tub with the sound of the waves is amazing. Everything in the Airbnb is so thoughtful, nothing missed!
A few things to note (not deal breakers for us, but might be for you):
You can hear the owners above you when they are talking/walking, noise definitely travels. But the movement was so seldom it was never a problem.
The bed is very soft and kind of caves in. With two people, we kind of fell into each other while sleeping."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There is no overstating the beauty of this stay! Just wow! Debbie was so kind and left great instructions. She had a book full of maps, personalized recommendations for the area, and even left us refreshments to make us feel at home. We spent the evenings listening to the sounds of the ocean from their hot tub and woke up every morning to see the sunrise right from bed. I will DEFINITELY be staying again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The view was amazing! Felt right at home and loved ending the day in the hot tub. Such a special spot.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful and relaxing spot! Couldn’t have asked for more. Gorgeous sunrise from bed & patio and relaxing clean hot tub.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The pictures on the listing do not do this place justice when you see the view it is absolutely incredible. Debbie was so helpful with instructions and local recommendations. I also especially liked the binder with a bunch of local spots as well as people who have stayed there with there reviews I will definitely be staying there again when coming to Portland
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time back to Debbie’s home and hopefully will not be our last. Thanks again for a peaceful stay at your beautiful home.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Debbie’s place! Beautiful views, thoughtful amenities, comfy bed, and lovely hot tub! Perfect place to rest and relax! Would stay again in a heartbeat!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. The view right from your bed is absolutely breathtaking. The hot tub is overlooking the water. It’s a 3 minute walk to the most beautiful beach. But what I loved most about this place was how much I felt at home and comfortable there. I do solo travel a lot and it’s always hard to get a good night sleep, but not at Debbie’s place. It’s a little slice of heaven for sure. I will be back!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay with Debbie was exactly what we were in need of, peaceful with lots of welcoming touches and an unbeatable view of the ocean surrounding us. We spent an equal amount of time enjoying the restaurants in South Portland and the Old Port, which is just a quick ride over the bridge."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay! Debbie's place was so clean and beautiful -so many little touches that made it the perfect getaway. The hot tub with the sound of the crashing waves did not disapoint! The sunrise was breathtaking with no need to even get out of bed! Check in was so easy and Debbie was a wonderful host. We would love to come back. Scratch Bakery was a nice walk in the morning a day some of the best bagels and pastries!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay at Debbie's place. We loved it so much we had to return. Debbie is very friendly and had so many helpful resources for things to do in the area. We love the location of this AirBnb as well as the amenities and the view. We will definitely be back and have already told all of our friends about it as well.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's place was perfect for a weekend getaway with my husband. The location and the view are absolutely breathtaking, directly overlooking the ocean and hearing the sound of the waves was perfect. We enjoyed the hot tub and we even got a little snow! The space was very clean and had all of the amenities we needed. We knew there wasn't a full kitchen which wasn't a problem as we enjoyed several local restaurants. Debbie was very welcoming and made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. There is some noise from the living space upstairs but certainly not terrible. We very much enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Debbie's place to anyone!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed in South Portland for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. Debbie’s place was exactly what we had planned for and needed to relax and have a quiet weekend by the ocean. Space was very clean and she provided so many helpful amenities if needed. Will definitely hope to stay here again in the future
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed for the weekend in February. The view is absolutely beautiful and enjoying it from the hot tub is even better. It’s about a 15 minute drive into downtown Portland and scratch bakery is a 2 minute drive. Debbie was responsive, accommodating and welcoming."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Booked this for a night getaway for my girlfriends birthday - it was truly spectacular. Location, views, it has everything. Debbie was a wonderful host and so thoughtful, all the little details inside the space were very well done. Thank you Debbie!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"we were so grateful to find Debbie's place on our search for a quick overnight getaway close to home on my week off of work. I want to give more than 5 stars. What a treat ocean front, peaceful, private, hot tub and near Portland which is packed with fun things to do year round. Debbie's place was tastefully and thoughtfully decorated in ocean themes which made for a very relaxing stay. She literally thought of everything that you might have needed for your stay. We had lunch at Luke's Lobster before checking in along with a stop at Night Moves Bakery and Bug Light. We enjoyed the Hot Tub at night, watching the Fishermen come back in and then again in the morning before our check out. The sunrise views from inside the bedroom and the front porch were magical. We will be booking again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Debbie's house is gorgeous and peaceful, and she is a very friendly and responsive host. I highly recommend staying at her place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Debbie’s home was my first AirBnb experience, and she set the bar very high! Her home is very beautiful! The views are breathtaking and inviting. Her instructions are concise and the location was easy to find. She is communicative and has a warm personality. She goes the extra mile in ensuring her guests feel right at home, and can be seen throughout the entire space. Her list of recommendations is expansive and holds great suggestions. Overall, I had an amazing time here and would love to go back soon! Thank you Debbie!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay! I’m so happy I got to stay here for a small getaway it was exactly what I needed and the view was amazing. Debbie had so many amenities available which was so sweet. She even wrote happy birthday on the board for our birthday trip!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,An Amazing spot for an overnight getaway. I wish I had spent more than 1 night. The morning sunrise over the ocean was beautiful and the views from the hot tub were just as beautiful. The suite is well set up and loved the assortment of coffee available! Debbie was also very responsive and quick to reply to any messages. I look forward to staying again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely suite with picture windows showing the ocean!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. It was perfect for a quick relaxing weekend getaway. Can’t wait to come back up
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Brad’s place was wonderful. It was in a beautiful location, easy access to downtown Portland, near restaurants and coffee shops. Debbie and Brad are so helpful and friendly. The hot tub was a great touch, even in January.

Watching the sunrise on a cold December morning from the warmth of bed is an experience we should all enjoy once! As well as a dip in the hot tub on a chilly winter night.
Debbie shared lots of things to do and made many restaurant recommendations. All were delicious! We highly recommend this place for a couples getaway!"

Debbie had the place stocked with any product you could need along with snacks and drinks. She has really thought about every detail, even swimsuits for the hottub. The neighborhood was local and very safe. Debbie has recommendations of things to do and places to eat at. Must eat at Scratch bakery and get the Seasalt Bagel (Debbie recommended) we loved it so much we went every morning. When we come back to Portland we will stay here! Thank you Debbie for being the #1 Airbnb we have ever stayed at."

The actual space is WAAAAAY bigger than the pictures! Everything is listed and organized. Incredibly kind and precise!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far our FAVORITE stay at any Airbnb! Booking with Debbie was a lovely experience. She was kind, accommodating, quickly responsive, and provided all the information we needed. She made it very easy!
The unit and the grounds were everything we hoped they would be. Just perfect. We wanted to be right on the water with a view of the sunset and moonlight.We were wowed! The unit is lovely with its coastal colors, Maine accents, and it’s views. It is true to Maine in its simple elegance. We watched sunrise and the boats that come in and out of the bay. We explored local lighthouses and flew kites on Crescent Beach. We experienced local bakeries and dinner at Fore Street Grill; so worth a visit! Beyond all of this are the little touches that make a BIG difference. The bathroom is fully stocked with just about anything you may have forgotten to pack. She provides recommendations for food and recreation & extra swimsuits, robes, local craft beer sampler. Amazing! A++++ stay TY Debbie"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Debbie’s place is remarkable! The view is spectacular and beyond peaceful. Be sure to sleep with the shades up to see the beautiful sunrise! Debbie provided a list of recommendations and clear instructions on all the amenities. It is obvious the amount of effort and love they put into this place and it doesn’t go unnoticed! Thanks for having us!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was just amazing, the views are ridiculous. And they have everything you could want, as well as an amazing binder of anything to do/eat in Portland"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so beautiful! Terrific hosts! Gorgeous view! Lots of things to do in Portland but the location feels so small town. A nearby beach and 2 lighthouses within a short walking distance. We tend to go to different places on vacation but we might have to break our ""new places only"" rule and return to Brad and Debbie's in Portland."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend at Debbie’s place. There was a ton to do, lots within walking distance. The binder Debbie has created for her guests was very helpful! We had a fantastic dinner at David’s 388 and enjoyed a local brewery and bakery.
The space was clean and comfortable. The views were incredible and the sounds of the waves were mesmerizing."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the place! Great location right on the water. Many things to do within walking distance from the Airbnb- lighthouses, parks, Willard Beach, bakeries, restaurants, and shops. Comfy bed. Debbie was great with giving suggestions on places to eat. We loved watching the cruise ships, sailboats, and lobster boats right outside our window. The hot tub was perfect to use at the end of the day after all the walking and sightseeing we did in South Portland and Portland. We are definitely planning to come back the next time we visit Maine."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an incredible stay. Everything was absolutely stunning and very peaceful. Debbie is a wonderful host and went above and beyond with recommendations. She truly thought of everything. Watching the boats go by while relaxing in the hot tub was the best. We highly recommend Debbie and Brad’s place. Hope to come back again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debbie’s place was just perfect for a quiet weekend away! Listening to the ocean waves crashing was so relaxing and we were able to see a couple of cruise ships come by which was also cool. The rental is spotless and quaint. Will definitely stay here again
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's house, porches and grounds were beautiful! The views were exquisite! We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our trip was a bit stressful but when we arrived and I saw the views, all that melted away. Debbie’s place is extraordinary - the views on the outside only surpassed by the beauty of the inside space. So many windows overlooking the bay, beautiful light and exquisite decor and colors inside. I am an artist and photographer and I wanted to just live here, it was so nice. Everything was clean, organized, well thought out - perfect. The highlight of our Maine trip was staying here, taking a two hour sail with Portland Schooner and the hot tub at night at the end of each day. I highly recommend this stay as a getaway and home base for Portland."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our favorite spot on our trip. Could not beat the views and sound of the waves. 100% would recommend for anyone needed a peaceful stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location has a beautiful view and is a quick and easy drive to all the local spots! Debbie was a great host and had lots of recommendations in a binder with things to do. We forgot swim suits for the hot tub but she had back-up suits in the room which was great! We loved our stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the most amazing Airbnb! The views are breathtaking, and the room is so cozy! Hosts are fabulous and so thoughtful. We cannot wait to come back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"I absolutely Love this Airbnb and it was so great to stay here again! The views of Casco Bay and the cruise ships saiing by are amazing! Debbie and Brad are always so hospitable and they always make you feel so welcome....it is so peaceful and relaxing to sit out on the newly renovated porch and look out at the beautiful views of Casco Bay, the large cruise ships, tour boats, sail boats and schooners sailing by...the view of the sunrise is breathtaking! The bedroom is very comfortable and the sun shines right into the bedroom as it rises! The hot tub is so relaxing with the beautiful views of Casco Bay right in front of you! The landscaping with the flower garden is absolutely beautiful...thank you so much again Debbie and Brad for always making me feel so welcome and for giving me the opportunity to stay in your beautiful Airbnb!
Michael"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simply put, this was hands down the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Debbie and Brad clearly put an immense amount of work into making their guests’ stay special. Most of the other reviews for this Airbnb accurately highlight most of the amenities. You won’t regret staying here. It truly is a hidden gem."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's place has the perfect ocean view for a romantic getaway! We had ample privacy despite the hosts living in the house. We loved hearing the ocean crash outside the window, watching the sun rise & the birds--we even saw a cardinal couple our last morning. The hot tub was great & the Keurig and mini fridge was appreciated. This was the first Airbnb I've ever stayed at without a microwave, but the listing made that clear!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely would love to have the chance to stay here again! It was so peaceful and inviting!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was a once-in-a-lifetime type of venue! Really, it was a spectacular location - so peaceful and original! We absolutely loved it!! It will probs be our only time in Maine so we felt lucky it was here!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"With such a breathtaking property and a view that really could never get old, who's thinking about the small details?
Debbie and Brad, that's who!
The thoughtfulness they put into this property blew us away and, on several occasions, saved us time and money. Their restaurant and activity recommendations made for a great trip as well. One of the best—if not the best—airbnbs we’ve stayed at! Highly recommend. Thank you!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debbie’s home has the most amazing view! It is also nestled in a cute neighborhood near the beach and lots of other fun attractions. We had such a great time!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third year in a row staying here and we have zero regrets. Debbie is very helpful and courteous and we feel right at home every time. The only debate with our vacation was whether or not to add an extra night and we are so glad we did. The room is immaculate and everything you need is thoughtfully placed in the medicine cabinet. The view is astounding, there is nothing like sitting on the patio watching the sailboats go by, the bay is beautiful. We have never needed anything but Debbie is super communicative and always in touch to make sure everything is fine. Ubers are also pretty accessible so downtown is an easy drive in if you want to grab dinner. South Portland also has it’s own establishments and some are within walking distance. Willard Beach is a quick walk through the neighborhood, a very beautiful area. The hot tub is fantastic to relax in at nighttime. We hope to be back one day, this place has set us off on a lifelong journey of traveling. Thank you very much!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debbie’s place is magical! Such a fantastic place to relax and enjoy the views during our Portland trip. Such a joy to stay here!

The location is fabulous with easy access to Portland and southern Maine. We had a great time just relaxing on the porch and enjoying the hot tub. We wished we could stay forever!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. So clean, comfortable bed, well stocked with everything we could have possibly needed, and the view was spectacular!! Very private and peaceful location. We wanted to move in and never leave!! Great hosts that were available if we needed them, but we didn’t because the place was perfect!! Can’t wait to go back sometime soon!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful and exactly like the pictures. Very comfortable bed. Breathtaking views. Nice outdoor space for reading or just relaxing as you listen to the waves hit the rocky shore below. Hope to return again next year.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely amazing breathtaking views of the water, and even though it was in a neighborhood you felt secluded and it’s all very private. Debbie was very responsive to text messages directions were precise. We absolutely loved our stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! So peaceful and comfortable.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The most beautiful setting with stunning views relaxing on the porch! Debbie's place exceeded our expectations with its beauty. She has thought of everything as a host. Personally I love a hot tub and expected to be in it about four times in our two night stay. It is a great hot tub, but we so thoroughly enjoyed just sitting in the comfortable seating on the porch and patio that we used it only once. Debbie has decorated beautifully inside and out. This place was money well spent. You will not be disappointed ... except when it's time to check out!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Debbie’s! It was a beautiful location that was quiet and peaceful. The place was very clean and well taken care of. You can tell a lot of thought was put into every little detail. We will most definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is book it now, it is worth every penny. The view is spectacular, the hot tub overlooking the ocean, the sunrises it is truly a piece of heaven. I have traveled all over the world and seen some beautiful places and as far as Airbnb‘s are concerned this is in my top three Debbie was a wonderful host, offering any recommendations for local restaurants and things to do you were just a short Uber ride to downtown Portland which has so much to offer. Thank you Debbie for a wonderful stay. We will see you soon.!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely gorgeous view!! You couldn’t find a better spot than this. Debbie was very communicative and helpful. We’d love to come back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a treasure! With only a few days in Portland, this offered a beautiful scenic view, easy walk to a beach, and restful atmosphere. 15-20 min and affordable to Uber, and even within distance for Uber eats and other delivery services. The hosts are delightful! Will definitely return and stay here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location with incredible views. The hosts were very helpful and friendly, would definitely stay again next time we are in Portland!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The view was exactly as pictured, super close to a beach, Portland Head Light and a short drive to Portland/Old Port. We enjoyed walking around their neighborhood and to Scratch Bakery. The hot tub was also very clean and so relaxing with an amazing view. The room was a bit more noisy than expected with foot traffic and host activity overhead, but would still recommend. They offered nice touches and amenities, too. We felt welcomed and enjoyed the beautiful location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was truly perfect. A hot tub retreat between a full day in Portland and going out to dinner cannot be described. The commute to downtown Portland was a few minutes AND we were glad to retreat back to this quiet, beautiful, well appointed home away from home. Whatever we might have forgotten or needed was right there! Absolute value for the price ."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Deborah and Brad were great hosts. Their place has an unbeatable view of the water and they provided tons of great recommendations of things to do. It was very nice to be able to get out of the city to relax after a day of activities. Highly recommended.

I knew I made an amazing choice.
Debbie had a nice message on the note board. She thought of everything... complimentary local beer & wine. Coffee & Tea.

The room and her home were very clean and comfy. The view was incredible while soaking in the hot tub. Debbie recommended a lovely restaurant for dinner which was phenomenal.
I feel very fortunate to have found ""paradise"". Memories to last a lifetime!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give this ABB ten stars I would! Fantastic place! Amazing location! Great hosts!

We were only in town for one night, but wish we could have stayed longer and would definitely love stay at Debbie’s place again next time we’re in Portland. It was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable, very easy to find and check in/out of, and had wonderful personal touches that we really appreciated like the snacks, coffee/tea, and local beer! Despite it being chilly we loved being able to use the hot tub and the view of the stars was wonderful! Even better though was the sunrise. Seriously. Holy moly if you stay here it is absolutely worth it to set an alarm for the sunrise and watch it from bed. Can only imagine how magical this place would be in the summer months too! Debbie was great to communicate with, and provided lots of great local recommendations as well."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Second time visiting Debbie’s little home away from home. Enjoyed the hot tub with gorgeous maine covered snow and ocean to look out on. So close to Portland so of course we had to hit some breweries too. Easy checkin and amazing stay! 10 stars!

The hot tub was also a treat on a very cold winter night - thank you again to Debbie for hosting us. Your hospitality and the location is a dream, and we would go back in a heartbeat!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment I arrived I felt welcome! The property and accommodations were even better than the pictures. Everything was tidy and clean and the hosts were helpful and informative- absolutely no issues! Bed was incredibly comfortable, linens were crisp, great WiFi connection, nothing was missed! The view was absolutely fantastic, especially waking up to the sunrise. There were so many thoughtful touches it is impossible to list them all, including helpful instructions (with pictures) and an incredibly informative welcome book. The space was roomy and well appointed but my favorite spot of all was the hot tub! I went in 5 times over my 2 night stay - the view of the ocean and sound of the waves crashing was my happy place. Quick walk to a local beach, short drive (it was too cold to walk) to yummy restaurants, all in all a fabulous stay!"

We even had a chance to see the local beach and some light houses. The guest suite itself was also bigger than it looks and had everything you need to feel super cozy. The small extras like wine and local beer in the fridge and snacks was a very thoughtful touch. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. This was an incredible little hidden gem of an AirBnb! Highly recommend."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,What a lovely- truly wonderful place. There is love and care put into the space and… a glorious view and beautiful and restful place - a great neighborhood too. One of the owners came out to meet us on our last evening. Debbie is a gracious and kind host.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view sunrise I'm the room , ocean from your bed"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Debbie's place is a little slice of heaven right on the ocean. The view from the bedroom is absolutely incredible. We were able to sip coffee and watch the sunrise right from our bed. Stunning!
She has thought of every single detail and nothing is lacking. I cannot recommend her place enough. Treat yourself!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's house is incredible. The ocean view is awesome and watching the sunrise from bed is fantastic. Highly recommend. Debbie went above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable and you have everything you need. Also, the neighborhood is nice with great food options."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing stay! The view was unbelievable. Debbie put so much thought into every detail and you can tell she really cares about her guests! Would definitely recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing, one of the best places we have stayed in"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debbie and Brad were amazing host and very thoughtful. The view from the house was stunning I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was there. They helped guide us with leaving maps for us to learn our way around. The beach is only within walking distance which is a perfect walk to explore the neighborhood. Downtown Portland is only about 13 minute drive and the lighthouses are only a few minutes away.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will wake-up to dramatic sunrises in this cozy space. Spotless, comfortable and everything you need for a peaceful and beautiful stay in South Portland. Debbie is a welcoming, informative host who takes pride in making you feel right at home. Everything we saw, ate and drank was a yes!! We even cold plunged at Willard Beach! Stay here!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"You MUST experience the magic of this unbelievably beautiful place. Debbie is an incredibly detail oriented host with many helpful recourses and thoughtful amenities. We felt very well taken care of! The view from the backyard is worth the stay alone but throw in the hot tub, short walk to the beach/lighthouse, and short drive to the downtown area. I would choose this place 100x over!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can absolutely say that Debbie’s home was absolutely amazing! The views were amazing! The room was great and the bathroom was spotless. we were a quick 10-12 minute Uber ride from downtown Portland. The hot tub was also great and the views were amazing. Also this location was near all the light houses in south Portland. We’re already planning to comeback! Thank you Debbie!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location with the most thoughtful and accommodating hosts. Debbie has taken time and great care to make her space warm and welcoming to her guests. Would most definitely rent this space again and recommend it to anyone traveling to the area.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Coming in after dark and finding a cold beer in the fridge made my husbands’ day. Watching the sun rise over the ocean with hot Keurig coffee in bed was also a treat.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debbie’s place is fantastic. My wife and I highly recommend staying here and would absolutely do so again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a must stay if you’re visiting Portland! Quick and easy drive into downtown Portland. The views and comfort of this stay are unmatched!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was exceptional: the view, the setting, location, and the small details including a local beer chilled the refrigerator."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is nothing short of fabulous! Perfect for a getaway and the ultimate relaxation! Just a short drive from downtown, but I promise you that you won’t even want to leave! Debbie is an amazing host who is so incredibly thoughtful and really makes you feel special when you walk through the door."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Hi Debbie and Brad! I want to thank you both so much for your hospitality and giving me the opportunity to stay at your beautiful Airbnb once again! 🙂 This is my third time staying there and I absolutely loved everything as always! I loved your greeting on the white board as I walked in the first day. Everything is so clean and the the bed is so comfortable to sleep in. The large windows in the bedroom overlooking Casco Bay is fantastic. The views of Casco Bay, the sunrises, the full moon, the ships that sail by (especially the large cruise ships!) are amazing! It is so peaceful and relaxing to sit out on your beautiful porch and take it all in. I also loved relaxing in the hottub. It is in a perfect spot to relax and look out at the ocean. Your landscaping is so beautiful with all of the colorful plants and flowers. Thanks so much again to you both and I am looking forward to my next visit!
~ Michael"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Brad's place is absolutely beautiful, and perhaps the best AirBnb in Portland. Checking in and out were a breeze. The welcome board, snacks, and refreshments were a lovely touch. The views from the room, deck, and hot tub are stunning. What a perfect spot to catch the sunrise- we're so happy we had a clear morning during our stay! The hot tub instructions were very clear and it only takes about 45 seconds to read and follow- perfect for relaxing both before and after dinner. The only sounds we heard during our stay was that of the ocean waves crashing against the shore and rock cliffs, the occasional birds, and the breeze- all of the sounds you'd hope to hear during a vacation (we may have heard the cats wrestling at one point, which just made us laugh for a second). Having the option of either having our windows open or turning on the air conditioning was great. They have room in their driveway for a rental vehicle, and getting in and out when needed was easy. And, their home is only a 12 minute drive to downtown.
We caught Brad at the perfect time as we were about to head out to explore for the day, and he made some great recommendations, our favorite being Scarborough Beach. We visited a few other beaches, some of which were free and some which you pay. Scarborough was $10 for each person, but well worth it for how large and sandy it is. You can really spread out away from other people there and feel like you are the only ones there.
I could go on about all of the reasons their place is so perfect, but just read the other reviews here and look at the pictures if you need any more convincing. This is one of those gems that we want everyone to know about but also want to keep secret to raise our chances of it being available the next time we adventure to Maine.
Thanks so much once again, Debbie and Brad!
-Greg & Alexandra"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean very private awesome view of the ocean hot tub was very nice and clean everything inside was perfect such a nice place! Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The views from the window and porch, especially of the morning sunrise, are spectacular. We didn’t venture into the hot tub, but perhaps on our next trip…."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spot is probably my favorite Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. The view of the bay, the sound of the waves hitting the rocks, the sunrise… and the ability to enjoy those views from the bedroom, the porch, and the hot tub… it’s just a perfect place. Highly recommended. And Debbie was a great host, she welcomed us and introduced herself upon arrival, but aside from that we felt like we were in a secluded paradise.
While it’s just a short drive to the more bustling spots in Portland, there are also some great local spots in South Portland, some even in walking distance."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie was an excellent host. The listing was exactly as promised. She truly thought of everything, including a personal welcome note, guidebooks, beer and wine, coffee, tea, water, extra toiletries. There were even umbrellas and ponchos and bathrobes. We have stayed at 5 star hotels that didn't have this many amenities. One thing we overlooked was that there is no TV, which isn't a huge deal unless you're like us and watch TV to fall asleep. Just make sure to bring your tablet or other streaming device so you can watch via the wifi connection.
We would gladly stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect spot for peace & quiet but nearby enough to the hustle & bustle! The description & photos are accurate. So beautiful. Debbie was an excellent host and checked in to make sure things were going well. There were nice little touches to make us feel welcome. Would definitely stay here again!!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great and perfect location and host!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place was just remarkable!!! The ocean view is breathtaking and even better in person than it appears in the photos. We also loved the area of South Portland. It is so close to Portland and the popular Old Port but feels slightly more secluded and provides a true local experience. Several bakeries and restaurants are within walking distance as well as a beach and a few lighthouses which we thoroughly enjoyed. Truly one of the best airbnbs I have had the opportunity to stay in and I hope to come back as soon as possible! If you are debating booking Debbie and Brad’s stay - do not hesitate! You won’t regret it!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property is beautiful. The views, the space and the design. I wish I could bottle it up and bring it home. We can’t wait to go back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Breathtakingly beautiful! Debbie and Brad are perfect hosts.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am a AirBnB host (a very picky one too) this is the BEST AirBnB we have EVER stayed at !!! Everything is better in person …. The AirBnB , the view , Debbie !!!!! We walked to Scratch bakery and had lunch and then walked on the beach to the Spring Point Ledge lighthouse ….you must take the $5 tour !!!!
We did not want to leave !!!! 1000% book this place …. It will be the highlight of your trip !!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view and a reason alone to stay here. We were close to everything in South Portland and downtown Portland. I wish we could have stayed longer. Highly recommended for spectacular views.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely love Debbie’s place. This was our second time at her Airbnb and we love it! She is so accommodating, check in is super easy, and lets just talk about the view and the garden. A++ . Let’s just say I had a tear this morning when we had to leave. Thank you for an incredible stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to unwind and relax after spending a few days hiking in Baxter. The property is absolutely beautiful with amazing views and personal touches to make your stay a memorable one. The location was perfect - solitude, yet only a short drive to anything you would want to explore in the Portland area. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the area!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re reading this — just book it!! This is one of the best airbnbs we’ve ever stayed — the view! Pictures do not do it justice — breathtaking. Quaint apartment with thoughtful touches & all the comforts (extra swim suits if you forgot yours!) Debbie is a fantastic host, you will not be disappointed!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for a couples visit to Portland. The view is amazing. Host has everything well planned and communicated. Ice cream, donut shop and good eats walking distance. Walkable beach is OK. We found ourselves spending most of our time here: relaxing, reading, and hot tubbing. Highly recommend for the amazing scenery of waking up to an amazing sunset! Thanks again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This property is amazing! The views are unbeatable and it’s in the perfect location. We stayed for 5 nights and it served as the central location to everything we wanted to see and do. Looking out to the water every morning and evening was such a meditative way to start and finish every day.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is simply the most beautiful AirBnB we have ever stayed at. The photos in the source listing give only a hint at the views. Whether from the comfort of the bed or sitting out on the porch one is surrounded by views of the water, islands and boats making there way back and forth. Debbie is a gracious host and the guest suite itself is nicely decorated and very comfortable."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie is a terrific host, everything was perfect. This is a fantastic place for a couple looking to get away - quiet, scenic, no television, just boats and beautiful oceanfront views - a great place to relax and enjoy some time away from the usual stressors and daily news. Wonderful!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location with spectacular view of the water. Spacious bedroom with lots of natural light, full size bathroom, and an entry area with a mini-fridge and coffee. Many wonderful local food and small markets close by. Quick walk to a small local beach and short drive to several lighthouses including Portland Head. Also easy 15 minute drive to South Portland Commercial street area with lots of shops and restaurants. Our Host was very friendly and checked-in routinely via text to make sure we had everything we needed and were comfortable. Overall a really wonderful experience!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Debbie is the sweetest host ever! She made it the perfect stay for our honeymoon! The location was perfect to walk to lots of things and go to Down town Portland. She even gave us a ride to the train station when we couldn’t get an Uber! She’s very thoughtful and this was the perfect stay.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic is the only word for this location. Host Debbie and Brad are exceptional. Views are something you will not want to leave. Great home base for visiting Portland and South Portland yet giving you privacy and solitude. This is a 100% correct move for selecting a Airbnb.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was amazing to be able to return to this paradise. We stayed last year and we were compelled to come back. Everything is taken care of for you and Debbie and Brad could not be nicer people. Brad is great for conversation and his parting gift of Bissell Brothers beer did not go unappreciated! Anyone should be lucky to stay here, the views are unmatched, the hosts are incredibly thoughtful, you don’t want to leave. We hope to be back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing views! Very relaxing and quiet. The sunrise from the bedroom is a must! Short commute to downtown.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,They thought of everything which made our stay very special. If you forgot it she had it. Very relaxing few days.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic property and accommodation with a spectacular view located very close to Portland! We highly recommend it to anyone staying in South Portland!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Photos don't do this place justice. If you're lucky enough to find it bookable, just do it."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Sublime!!! Definitely one of the most beautiful places we have stayed. Everything was perfect…gorgeous home and property, tastefully decorated and the views are stunning! Watching the sunrise from our bed was heavenly. There is so much to do and see here. Our hosts were the best!! Only regret that we didn’t stay longer!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible hosts, beautiful views, great location! Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Along with everyone else's reviews, Debbie’s house was absolutely the best Airbnb we have stayed at. We did not want to leave! From the stunning views, the spotless house, the little notes and tips and recommendations provided for first time visitors, the list goes on. Everything exceeded our expectations, you have to stay here if you are planning a trip to Portland, Maine!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and Brads home is beautiful as shown in the pictures. The location is breathtaking and so relaxing. The yard is beautifully landscaped and adds to the beauty of the home. The space is very welcoming and the bed was so comfortable. Debbie and Brad were both available to help with any questions we had. The home is within walking distance of Willard beach and a short drive to downtown Portland, where there are a lot of shops and restaurants. I highly recommend staying at this home. It is in a quiet neighborhood yet close enough to a lot of things to do. You won’t be disappointed."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such an incredible stay Debbie and her husband were beyond amazing hosts! The room was spotless and the view was incredible especially in the morning watching the sunrise. I would highly recommend staying here if you get the chance!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING….the location, views, sounds, and hosts! My only wish was for a longer stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is just heaven!! By far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. We are already planning our trip back!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with spectacular views! So many things to do and see! It was one of the cleanest Airbnb's I have ever stayed at. Debbie welcomed us with a very sweet note on the bulletin board and complementary beer and wine. We couldn't have asked for a better place!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect weekend getaway to Portland- Absolutely cannot beat the stunning view of the bay! Debbies place was very clean and full of small amenities to make our stay comfortable and feel like home. Only a short 15 minute ride into downtown Portland. Easy to walk to local shops and see the local sights, including lighthouses, parks and beaches. Loved our stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a view! The property is stunning and so relaxing. We had everything we needed on site and it was easy enough to drive over to downtown Portland.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's place is wonderful. So clean, nicely decorated, and the personal touches to ensure their guests are comfortable are above and beyond any Air B&B I have ever stayed in (which is many!). The views are stunning and even better taken in from the hot tub or deck for the sunrise or sunset. I will definitely be back for a visit!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely wonderful view in a cozy spacious room. You get way more then what you’re paying for at this Airbnb. I was pleasantly shocked by how much Debbie provided during our stay and how prepared the room was for our arrival.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and amazing view . Perfect little getaway to relax for 1-2 people .
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! The views were absolutely stunning and it was only a short drive to downtown. We really enjoyed the use of the hot tub as well! Debbie was an incredible host and we hope to visit again soon!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Debbie's place is magical. The views are absolutely second to none, and that hot tub is the perfect place to spend time! Debbie had a sampling of local beer & wine in the fridge when we arrived, which was really a nice touch. She also had everything very well labeled for ease of use around the suite. One thing to note is that there is not a kitchen, only a mini fridge, so that's definitely important to take into consideration when booking. There's also not a TV, but I can't imagine why you'd want one with Debbie's location! Highly recommend."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's space was so perfect for our 2 night get a way. It was so cute, comfy and clean. The view is amazing! Even though it was cloudy while we were there we woke to a beautiful sunrise right out our window. The hot tub with a view of the ocean was awesome after a day of walking around Portland. It is a short drive to Old Port and all kinds of restaurants, which Debbie has a book of menus and recommended restaurants etc. We had a nice dinner at Scales if you like seafood. Becky's dinner had a great breakfast with homemade food. There were a couple places we didnt get to try because they were closed, but maybe next time. Willard Beach is a nice beach to walk around and there is an old fort and lighthouse. Debbie & her husband were readily available if we needed anything but also gave us our privacy. We hope to come back and stay again. you won't be disappointed if you stay here!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie's studio has a fantastic bay view, great accommodations and is well appointed. The hot tub and gardens brings a wonderful sense of peace and quiet but is still close enough to downtown Portland to enjoy and explore the city. We would highly recommend Debbie's place to any traveler who is looking for both the excitement of the city and the peace and quiet of a beach side home."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place to stay for the most part! Beautiful space with everything you could need in a bnb! Perfected located to all there is to do in download Portland with many restaurants and shops easily walkable! Having free parking was also a plus. Alice was wonderful and responsive and answered all our questions and issues when we reached out.
The space is beautiful and welcoming and wonderfully decorated. We thoroughly enjoyed it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great apartment. What a decor!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was very comfortable and located within walking distance of everything in downtown Portland.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, great location! Had a great stay 😊"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most fabulous airbnbs -- or homes, period-- I have ever been in. Better than the photos. An architectural gem. Super central. And the stairs are not bad."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks to Alice for offering this great apartment. Location was excellent for walking to restaurants and a lot of the areas of Portland we wanted to be. This might have been the first AirBnB that we stayed at so far which truly met the expectations from the photos, even perhaps surpassing our expectations on how cool of a spot it was. Super clean place, interesting architecture, fabulous light from all the windows and skylights, great views of the city, still felt like we had a lot of privacy, and the private deck was a highlight too. Would definitely want to stay here again next time we find ourselves in Portland."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I spent a vacation with my partner in Alice’s place, overall a 10/10 super comfortable and cozy, very clean smell as well, and the location had many fun activities around such as restaurants and more!! I love forward to staying here again sometime in the future!!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular! Clean, spacious, great vibe. Great location."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the most special spaces I’ve stayed in. Had an absolutely wonderful time here and would recommend to all friends and family. Thank you so much for our first memorable trip to Maine!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alice’s place is so unique and charming! We had a great time and would definitely stay here whenever we return to Portland. Thank you Alice!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! So clean, beautiful, and close to restaurants and a good walking neighborhood. It was so nice to see the city wake up in the morning and go quiet at night. I think I got a suntan during the day and definitely a moontan at night while in the apartment! The views are from every angle! Definitely a come back spot!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Phenomenal location and accommodations. Alice’s place is easy to settle right into, you’ll hardly want to leave the place… but when you do the little piece of Portland that surrounds her place is great, friendly, and delicious! We were able to walk everywhere. When we come back, we will be looking for Alice’s place to stay at again! Thanks Alice!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I visit Portland as much as possible, and this was our first time staying at Alice's place. LOVED IT! Usually I like to spend much of my time walking around the city, dining out, etc. This visit was different because I found myself content with just hanging out in the apartment: reading, enjoying the sunlight and city views, and cooking. It felt like my home away from home. We hope to return for a longer visit!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable bed, close to everything in the Old Port. Would recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice’s place was exactly as pictured and described. We loved being so close to great restaurants and shops all while having the ability to relax in such a beautiful, warm apartment. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great stay. Gorgeous space with so much beautiful lighting
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is such a great spot for those visiting Portland! Right smack in the middle of town, easily walkable to all the major attractions, and truly an architectural beauty. Alice accommodated an early check-in, which was super helpful. Definitely will make this a go-to for Portland trips."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful gem of a loft well situated in a walkable area! The space is peaceful with beautiful views of the downtown area with many windows for a bright and airy vibe. On-site parking is a breeze since this is on the top floor of a building with offices.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pictures does not do this stay justice! This place is absolutely stunning both day and night! The place is so cutely decorated and furnished! Coming from Utah it was so awesome to stay in the heart of Portland with places in walking distance! If we ever come back to Maine this is where we will stay! Thank you!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beautiful! Very well decorated and in an incredible location close to downtown and old port. We walked everywhere but was thankful for parking so we had somewhere safe to leave our car. If a sensitive sleeper, the light shining into the house at night is bright and it was noisy. However, I think this place is worth it for the location and place itself! It was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in. Would highly recommend and would stay again :) !"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great location. Look forward to staying again in the future. We had a great time.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best place to stay!!! Bright, airy and clean. Super comfortable equipped with anything you need. Details in the apartment are all exceptional. Best location for a visit to downtown Portland. Would definitely return as we frequently visit Portland. Don’t look any further . Book it now !!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is accurately described as an architectural gem! What a cool space, tons of light coming through skylights and big windows. Even in the cold of winter, the location is so close to downtown that we walked everywhere we went the whole weekend. Would absolutely love to stay again the next time we're in town."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place! Perfectly located in the Old Port. Alice was responsive and helpful! Would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, had a great stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Alice’s apartment, and I don’t think we would stay anywhere else when traveling to Portland.
The location is perfect- situated where all of downtown and everything on the west end is well within walking distance. We parked in the assigned lot when we arrived (for free!) and didn’t move the car at all until the end of our stay.
The apartment itself is truly wonderful. Beautiful views over downtown Portland through the massive windows, very thoughtful little details throughout the unit, comfortable furniture, and all the amenities of home.
My only “know before you go” for this apartment is that the memory foam mattress is very firm! My partner and I found it very comfortable, even though the mattress we have at home is softer- but if firm is decidedly not your jam, this may be helpful to know.
I would recommend anyone traveling to Portland stay here!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolute gem. Loved the space with all of its natural light and thoughtful furnishings. Simply gorgeous. Can’t wait to return!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cozy spot in a wonderful location! A short walk to both the Old Port and West End.
Alice was very communicative and accommodating. Check in and check out was a breeze."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my goodness. I struggled to write this reviews BECAUSE I wanted to keep your place a secret and yet I want EVERYONE to know what a perfect place you have in the historic district of Portland. We LOVED everthing about your place EVEN the stairs up to the unit. Close to everything we wanted to do, PERFECT place to enjoy the crazy wind and rain storm and very comfortable. We will definitely stay at your place again and again. Great size, fantastic windows and views, lovely kitchen and comfortable couch. Bed was DIVINE!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved everything about Alice’s place! The pictures don’t do it justice! It’s beautiful and the location is amazing. Alice is wonderful and her communication is great. We hope to come back often! Thank you for having us!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, super clean will stay here again when we return to Portland!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had so much fun at this place. It's unique, lots of interesting and funky little details. The light was beautiful. so many windows. We could see the moon and the stars from the big windows in the bedroom. We parked the car and walked almost everywhere because the unit is so centrally located in downtown Portland. Comfortable bed, great shower, cool kitchen. Even a little private patio that we didn't get to use because it was so cold. But with nice weather, the patio would be such a cool place to hang out because of the view. Fabulous coffee shop is right around the corner. Be mindful that there are stairs to get from street level to the unit, then stairs up to the unit once inside the front door. But the views once you get up there are so worth it. Highly recommend this place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest Airbnb’s that we’ve ever stayed in.
Beautiful apartment, well designed and maintained, spotless and very clean. Directions (& instructions) were clear,concise and easy to understand. Neighborhood was busy during the day but we felt safe walking around from morning till early evening when we returned.
Location was perfect for shops, museums and other attractions.
As others have mentioned in previous reviews the city lights at night made it a bit of a challenge for sleeping (mask anyone?), especially when you’re not used to ambient light streaming in from street lights and other sources. The bed was comfortable, kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed and the living room was perfect for watching a movie or gazing out over the street scape while having morning coffee.
All n all the apartment was an A+ and we would definitely come back again…which we hope to do in the near future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was beautiful and very clean! We loved staying here. Good location and lots to do nearby. Alice was very communicative throughout our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alice's place was beautiful and comfortable. The area is full of things to do and places to eat. Everything is either within walking distance or at max a 15 minute drive
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have been more satisfied with our stay
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"awesome place for a stay of any length in portland. this is a lovely neighborhood and we walked to everything we wanted to do and see within the city. the apartment is roomy, modern and gorgeous and pictures do not it justice. made it hard to leave and see our friends and the sights!
only thing to consider would be if you have difficulty walking or getting up stairs, no trouble for us but those with movement challenges might find it to be a lot of stairs.
thanks again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's clear that the owner (whom we met briefly during our stay) put a lot of love into the design and renovation of this apartment, from the sun ray pattern of the wood on the landing, to the organic stone details on the bedroom sill. Note for people who, like myself, didn't fully think through the ramifications of all those lovely windows: the bedroom gets light in the morning *and* at night (because: city). Bring a sleep mask! Also, if you like to cook, make sure you bring any special equipment you might need. I really enjoyed this unique stay."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so beautiful! There are a ton of windows and so much natural light. The decor is gorgeous. The location is totally perfect, super easy to walk to restaurants and activities. Alice is a wonderful host - always responsive and very friendly. We 100% would love to stay here again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean place with a top notch location!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our third stay at Alice's place & we look for availability to stay here everytime we come Portland 10/10 recommend!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and great location!! We would stay there again!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and cool space; we would highly recommend it with a couple very fixable tweaks. Only light in the bathroom that worked was a small one in the shower. The listing mentions shampoo, soap, etc., but they were nowhere to be found. Otherwise, a great spot to stay in Portland."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to spend a few days in Portland. It's a very well designed space, and the decor and furnishings are both interesting and very comfortable (you don't always get both!), with lots of storage and lots of light. The location is convenient, and easy free parking is a big bonus."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely top floor walk-up apartment with great light, charming character, and modern finishes. Super convenient location plus on-site parking is great.
Make sure to read all the instructions and rules in the host messages to avoid charges!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, funky fun space….. hope you don’t mind stairs!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb was so awesome that my husband and I got takeout and watched a movie on Friday night instead of going out! Very cool views and prime walkable location. Just bring a sleep mask as the windows are very bright in the morning! Would love to stay again in the future.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very walkable area. Highly recommend Georgeous Gelato for a sweet treat!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location to spend time in Portland! Great restaurants all walkable! The Airbnb was gorgeous and comfortable. We loved it all!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place with interesting architecture. Central to everything in Old Port. Great location and beautiful space.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos don’t do the apartment justice (and the photos are pretty nice). The location is well located for walking to restaurants, the waterfront and shows.
Alice is a wonderful host who is quick to respond to questions and provided helpful information to make our stay perfect!
A great home base for your next adventure in Vacationland!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible Airbnb in the perfect location!
Alice was super friendly and accommodating. We can’t wait to stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Right off the main area so it wasn’t overly crowded or loud but was a 3-5 walk to everything. Place was bright and open which made great waking up in. Our first trip to Portland went well staying here.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very beautiful space, amazing location, very close to all the restaurants in the area with the advantage of being on a quiet street
I enjoyed every moment of my stay and felt relaxed
Parking was easy , it was behind the building which was perfect
Alice is very sweet and helpful"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, lovely space, appreciated the washer/dryer, onsite parking and amenities. Excellent communication with Alice. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Would return again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. I’ll definitely be staying here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space is lovely and close to great restaurants, pubs, and activities to explore in Portland. The apartment was clean and well organized. It also had a homey feel to it which doesn't always happen when you stay at an Airbnb location. The decor was done with an artist's attention for detail, which made our stay that much more enjoyable and relaxing. The space has a tremendous amount of natural light and great views of downtown. There are several flights of stairs, but we had no problem getting our belonging up and down. The available outdoor patio was wonderful and a great spot to relax. Alice was responsive to any questions we had and provided clear instructions before we arrived. You will certainly enjoy your stay - I know we can't wait to go back!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying in Alice's beautiful loft apartment. The loft was clean, spacious, had plenty of storage and a very comfortable bed and couch. The apartment is in a great location and had off street parking, which is always a plus. We would love to stay again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy space just the right size for a couple or individual get away. The shower was one of my favorites thing here. So roomy and it’s beautiful. I didn’t need it but there was a nice little office area. I also loved the open concept of the main rooms! And the decor and deck! We had a great stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing space! We loved our time there - quiet, excellent views of the city, perfect location, well-equipped, and comfortable. We highly recommend to anyone visiting Portland."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice's place was great. The apartment was clean, well organized, and exactly as described in the posting. We have already discussed coming back and using this same location. It is close to multiple hubs in Portland and plenty of parking.
Absolutely would suggest to anyone.
Our only complaint, although it is already well documented, is that you will wake up with the sun. Bring an eye mask. All of the windows are absolutely worth it"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wishing we had booked a full week here! Felt like locals - and with all the delicious food around we really needed the stairs/workout! Even with my husband in a boot, what seemed like a daunting penthouse was actually super maneuverable! The private deck was lovely for morning coffee and evening cocktails (and people watching). The bathroom was like a retreat - the beautiful shower with skylight was magical. Absolutely lovely space"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome apartment and great location. I have been to Portland a bunch of times and this was one of the best locations. The included parking was amazing.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely apartment…actually a one bedroom. Tons of windows and skylights. Nice furniture.
Location is wonderful. Five to 10 minute walk to heart of this amazing little city. Parking included a huge plus. Recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice’s place was in a great spot of Portland walkable to anything you want to do. So many restaurants shops etc. Our only complaint would be, like others said the AC didn’t make it to the bedroom to cool, while we tried to leave the windows open, it’s in such a happening spot it’s hard to sleep with hearing all the noise from bar hoppers. Super cute and eclectic. Loved the location!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The home was clean and bright. It was a little warm in the bedroom and there are lots of windows that make it very bright early morning but we liked the location a lot.
Lots of stairs if that is an issue."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location close to Old Port ~
Beautifully and uniquely decorated; bright and spacious
Alice was a wonderful host - would stay again!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location and architectural design is awesome. The host could really make this a great place to stay by incorporating nicer linens, maybe clean the deck, add flowers, more towels, and dishes in the kitchen. It is the bare minimum and I expected more for the price."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice's place is an architectural marvel with many interesting artistic details to savor. There are outstanding restaurants steps away. It's only a few minutes from the airport. We saw a great outdoor concert at Thompson's Point, also less than 10 minutes from the AirBnB. We would definitely return."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Overall an enjoyable stay, and would definitely return outside of mid-summer.
Pros:
- Great location; walkable to many restaurants, bars, and shops, as well as the waterfront.
- Lots of windows made for good views and ample natural light.
- Very modern feel and was spacious for two people.
- Well stocked kitchen (though we didn't actually end up cooking)
Cons:
- Stuffy/toasty; the A/C doesn't really reach the bedroom and the windows do not have screens, so the bedroom was hot at night.
- Some of the furniture did not match the pictures (e.g. no lounge chairs on the deck, though a metal patio set instead)"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing!! Insane location, walkable to everything and easy parking! Highly recommend this place, so unique and the private deck with a view is a huge plus! Alice was great :)"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Overall loved the place. Great location!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A modern penthouse apartment that feels like it's up in the clouds. We only spent two nights, but it was comfortable and had great bars & food nearby. It was kind of a fabulous chic apartment stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome apartment right in the heart of old port, so much to do in walking distance. Wish this was my apartment!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"First impression was it was hot. Our days in Portland were in the upper 80s and humid. The AC in the main area could not keep and doesn't reach the bedroom. There are only blinds on the windows around the bed so you can't draw shades to cool the apt or for privacy in the main area.
It also needed a deep cleaning. HOWEVER, the location somewhat makes up for all of that. You are a short walk away from all of the action yet on a quiet side street. Being on the 4th floor gives a safe treehouse feel and as we settled in our appreciation grew. It's a crafty, cool, and original designed space."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"100% would stay here again.
Incredible location and views.
Perfect spot to either relax or work. Located right in the heartbeat of the city."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very clean and pretty cool Airbnb. We would stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pictures were an exact description. Quiet area with great views and within walking distance to Pubs, restaurants and downtown. Nice balcony to sit too!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous, unique spot close to all that Old Port has to offer!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice was a fantastic host! She proactively sent a very thorough message detailing how to get into the building and house rules to follow. She was sure to give us her cell number if any issues came up (none did). The listing was exactly as described, it was actually even more amazing in person. My Husband and I chose this listing for our 1 year wedding anniversary celebratory trip to Portland. We absolutely loved the space. We will 100% book this listing again in the future when we return back to Portland! The location was beyond perfect. 10/10"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is lovely and has such a charming feel to it, and the location makes it so easy to explore the city on foot. The only thing I’ll say is if you’re sensitive to light when you sleep bring an eye mask as the apartment has awesome light, but is very bright in the morning.
Alice is super clear with her instructions, and very proactive. Overall an awesome stay and host, thanks again Alice!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is indeed an architectural gem -- we loved all of it. Place was immaculate, bed, couch and chairs were all super comfortable, kitchen was fully functional and it was super quiet. We had read that the unit was filled with lots of natural light and not super dark, so that was expected. Can't beat the location, perfect walking distance to downtown and waterfront, Eastern prom, etc. Would highly recommend and would totally stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing apartment and location! Had so much fun on the balcony, and surroundings were very walkable. Would definitely recommend staying here :)"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Incredible location. I loved the place. It was just what we were looking for.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the best place we have ever stayed with air bnb. It’s a great location. Easy free parking, close to so much coolest place ever, I want to steal all the plants.
Go eat at EvenTide, get a beer and sit out back and view the harbor at Liquid Riot, have breakfast at Becky’s Diner"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location was great for walking the whole weekend. Plenty of parking. Airbnb was clean and spacious. Loved the windows. I wish the bedroom windows had drapes. Sun woke us up at 6 am both days but loved everything else. Would stay again
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and convenient off-street parking, would recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Alices’s place was an amazing experience. The design and architecture of the apartment is outstanding, and the experience of staying there enhances the Portland experience. The location is perfect, as we could access the downtown, old port shops and restaurants, and the waterfront very easily all by foot. There was a very unique antique shop a couple doors down that is definitely worth checking out. It was also nice to have easy off street parking. Alice was quick to respond and very helpful, and our lockbox check in was streamline.
If your going to Portland and this is in your budget, i highly recommend it, as I think this must be one of the coolest places you could stay to enjoy the city."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve honeymooned, spent anniversaries and birthdays here. This place is the perfect spot to experience Portland."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful space within walking distance to everything. Great quiet neighborhood as well. As mentioned in previous posts, the stairs are no joke (especially for those of us from Florida and/or flat land!!) and the apartment is VERY bright. Beautiful for sunrise and sunset but not great for sleeping in. Many comments on the comfortable bed (and it was) however, to note, it is very FIRM. We had a wonderful time and would recommend to friends and family."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Calling this an architectural gem is 100% accurate! The inside was wonderful and had all of the items we needed in addition the view (it is on the 4th floor). Alice was super helpful in making check-in and such easy and flawless. We will definitely return - lots of places to eat and see within 10 minute walk!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment within walking distance of many restaurants and stores. Loved how the space is used and decorated. Private terrace was perfect for us.
Highly recommended."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This rental is in a great spot in Old Port. It is a few minutes walk from all of the great restaurants and bars in that neighborhood. We have stayed in Old Port a few times and this was by far the best accommodations we’ve had there. Alice was extremely nice and her place was better than advertised. We stayed there with our 4 month old daughter and had ample space to setup a pack and play for her to sleep in and space for me and my wife as well. We will definitely be booking this rental again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is stunning, the location could not be better within walking distance to everything. The bed is super comfortable too !"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice's apartment was absolutely beautiful and looked exactly like in the photos. There is a ton of natural light throughout the apartment, and the architectural details made it even more special. Even though it's just minutes from Old Port, the area is very quiet after hours and I didn't have any issues with noise. I highly recommend Alice's place!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was more beautiful than we expected. The skylights and windows made the apartment really special.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was better than expected! Walking distance from restaurants and activities. 10/10 would recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! This apartment is stunning and even more beautiful than the photos. We loved our stay and ended up spending our last night in the apartment just to enjoy the view. Definitely recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Home was exactly like listing, very clean and comfortable. We throughly enjoyed our stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an awesome stay here and would highly recommend. It was a peaceful, tranquil apartment yet had easy access to downtown restaurants and activities. Beautiful surroundings in the apartment with plants, decor and every detail was thought of, making it the perfect getaway."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The absolute perfect spot to do a walking tour of all Portland had to offer.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely spot. Amazing value. And a perfect location!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! It’s just as described and close to so many fun things to see in the city.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"hands down my favorite place to stay in Portland and perhaps my favorite Airbnb experience! Alice's place has such a wonderful, welcoming energy that puts you at ease the moment you step in the door. Very quiet, very comfortable, well-positioned in the city, and somehow more gorgeous than the photos can convey! I can't wait to go back!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Perfect walkable location to restaurant and bars. Very sunny spot.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place! Great location. Short walk to everything we came to do.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, right in the middle of Portland! Would definitely stay again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alice's place was a great spot for our weekend getaway. She provided excellent instruction which made it very easy to check in and start relaxing. Everything we were looking to do was walkable and the apartment has great views of the city. We will definitely be back.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to relax and unwind while you explore Portland Maine.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alice was quick to respond to questions and was helpful. The place is very clean and unique. Good location in close proximity of many things to do. Would stay here again.
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Pretty apartment and convenient location.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and unique space in a convenient location! Highly recommend.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice's place in Portland was amazingly beautiful, well-maintained, conveniently located and highly functional. Everything was so well-designed and artistic. I was there for several cold, blustery days in January on a work-related trip and rarely ever needed an Uber to get to the meetings and restaurants I needed to reach on Commercial Street, even though it involved stepping over a lot of snow and ice. I would look to stay at this place again if I came back.
One of my only small issues was with using the lockbox to get inside. There are two in addition to the coded door lock, so it was a bit confusing as to which code went where. But once you get the hang of that, it was no big deal. Another small issue was that much of the place is glass, so city lights shined in all hours and it was never fully dark for sleeping purposes. But again, you adjust. Lastly, there are few stores within walking distance, so be sure to bring your own soap and shampoo.
Highly recommend!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have the opportunity to come to Portland, don’t miss it. This lovely apartment made it all reachable and enjoyable."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was beautiful and looked exactly like the photos. Within walking distance to Old Port shopping and restaurants. Short drive to grocery stores. Conveniently located and very, very nice."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I generally look for just a place to cook and sleep. This air bnb was unique with the open concept kitchen which I appreciate and the amazing lighting. Watching the sunrise and set from this apartment was a particularly satisfying. That being said the bed was memory foam and the bathroom/shower was beautiful. 10/10
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was even prettier than the photos. Location couldn’t have been better. I see myself returning here in the future!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place and a great location! Very clean, comfortable and unique. Alice was super helpful and responsive. We will definitely recommend it to others and we hope to return again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous place. We loved the views and the style. Alice was a great communicator.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay at Alice’s property in Portland Maine. The location was perfect and the unit was very cool and in a great location. I would recommend to a friend or family member.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location to be able to walk all around Portland, and such a cool, unique, clean space! Will be back!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the second time staying in Alice’s loft. It’s one of the most chic airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in! Great views of Portland and super cool space. Very clean and neat place! Will definitely book again!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was great!! The home was nice, peaceful, and clean the building is very quiet and the location is great! Beautiful view of the city and an awesome view for the sun rises and sun sets! Definitely would recommend this home for a stay for someone else and definitely would love to stay again if had the chance!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This condo was nicely designed, exceptionally bright and pleasant. Skylights gave both light and great views. It's high enough to be quiet and peaceful. Thank you Alice!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Beautiful city.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space, fantastic location, great host. Had a great experience, and will recommend this property to any friends visiting. Perfect location for our vacation in Portland!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Wife and I we absolutely delighted with the studio apartment; it was perfect! The place looked brand new, impeccably clean and the architectural features were amazing. It's truly a place that we would love to stay at again! Thank you for such an awesome experience!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alice’s place was a perfect spot for us to spend our “mini moon”. It was walking distance from restaurants and bars and easily accessible. The natural light in the place was beautiful. We would definitely stay again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at this well appointed loft space🥰it is one of our favorite stays for sure. The openness, plants, lighting, and windows make this space dreamy and comfortable. It’s always perfectly clean, and no clutter. We love how close this is to everything downtown Portland has to offer. Walkable distance to venues, top restaurants and bars, museums and shopping. Very safe overnight parking which we love in a city setting."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came for my birthday week and had the most amazing time! This apartment is gorgeous and homey, we didn't want to leave! Perfect location to walk around and explore. Alice gave me the best rec's for food and things to do in the area! Worth every penny and can't wait to come back again!"
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Alice’s place is as described. It’s beautiful and well appointed. The location is great and the shower is too tier. Alice does prompt you with additional charges that can be incurred if you ruin things or don’t follow her homes rules. I hadn’t had that before and it rubbed me the wrong way, especially when paying top dollar. It’s a great place though- enjoy!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this AirBnB for your stay in Portland. The location allowed me to walk to almost everyplace that I wanted to go. Alice’s place provided a unique place to stay with all the amenities that you’ll need. Communication was clear and I enjoyed every minute of my stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We LOVED this place. Perfect for two. Convenient and classy. Gorgeous windows.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, sun filled apartment right in the middle of Portland. Easy check in and great to have off street parking."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Alice’s place was a wonderful space flooded with natural light and beautiful plants. The location is within walking distance to just about everything! I was glad I read the reviews as there are no shades in the bedroom and it is very ,very bright in the morning. I packed us sleep masks and it was fine. The only con I had was the earlier then usual check out time, Before 10am and she stated she would be there at 10am
Sharp to start cleaning. So if you’re a late sleeper while on vaca keep that in mind. Otherwise it was a great experience."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is really cool...the architecture and proximity to downtown were worth the price to stay. As indicated by others, there are a fair amount of stairs to climb (so be prepared), bring a sleep mask (as the bedroom gets bright early), and the bedroom temp cannot be regulated but these aren't detriments by any stretch...just things to be aware of. You won't be disappointed!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a rental well worth visiting. The light throughout the apartment is beautiful the views are excellent. The apartment is architecturally spectacular and very clean and comfortable.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A gorgeous apartment with tons of character and natural sunlight. very comfortable bed! excellent location.
clean, quiet and had all the amenities you could need. easy check in/out. can't wait to go back to Portland and stay there again!!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Picture perfect location quiet easiest parking views for days - a true fancy tree fort like experience !
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not sure you can get a better location in Portland, you can walk to everything bars restaurants shopping, you name it. Alice is a great host and super communicative. Apartment is very cute and we loved staying there"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location, pretty much walkable to the major attractions in Portland. Unique and very cool decorations and design. Lovely art gallery with equally as lovely owner on the bottom floor."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Alice’s place is awesome. Had a fantastic stay. Location is excellent and the place itself is tremendous. Alice was extremely quick to respond to our questions. Look forward to our next stay!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay! Location is astounding and the apartment is beautiful! Great communication as well!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Lots of homes are beautiful. Lots of homes are in a great location. But there’s a level of care and comfort you cannot manufacture or stage, and that’s what I felt the minute I entered this truly special place. Light and plants filled every corner. The views are uplifting and quirky. The deck is a respite after a filling meal or a long walk around town. The details reveal just how much work was put into making this a home.
I’ve spent a lot of time in Portland but never had a home base there. This made me feel like a local, and I loved every minute of it. The kitchen is great with tons of room (even if the stove befuddled me, Alice sent me a video that helped). The living room is incredibly comfy, and the shower is something out of a spa.
Really did not want to leave. I’ll dream of my next stay here often."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and lots of natural light. Easy access to everywhere you want to go!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lots of natural light, beautiful views of Portland, lots of space for two, comfortable bed and Alice was really easy to communicate with. Would stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very thoughtfully designed apartment, as you can see from the photos. Easy walking distance to great restaurants and the historic wharf area. So many clever decorations and amazing woodwork. Someone put a lot of love and thought into incorporating the old and the new. The possible negatives for some people are the stairs and the bedroom is extremely bright( we brought sleep masks) but it was still challenging. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat!"
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is quite beautiful and you couldn't ask for a better location. 2 blocks to Commercial Ave and 2 blocks to Congress St.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home in a great location
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfectly situated in between downtown and waterfront. The loft itself is incredibly beautiful - we were amazed!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very gorgeous place. Extremely unique compared to other places I have stayed. Would highly recommend if staying in Portland.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location! On a relatively quiet street while very close to everything downtown. The place itself is tops! Amazing accommodations and loved hanging out on the private deck!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We greatly enjoyed our weekend stay at Alice's. Its location was perfect and gave us great walking access to much of the peninsula. The apartment itself was clean and well appointed with plenty of space to relax and enjoy the beautiful views. Check-in and check-out were easy and Alice responded quickly to messages and accommodated our needs perfectly. I would highly recommend a stay at Alice's lovely Portland apartment.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect place to stay in Portland! It is within walking distance to everything we wanted to do, off street parking and beautiful. It is immaculate! The patio is lovely.All questions were answered in minutes.Very quiet. We will be back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised, beautiful sun filled place in a great location. We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location, suite has a very unique design to it, and the host is great and communicates fast with any questions that you have. Check in and out is very easy."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location and design! Hot days and nights are tricky as A/C works in main room but doesn’t get to bedroom well, and you’ll wake up to full sunlight early (no shades) but I loved that :)"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, beautiful place, wonderful host. Will be back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a unique, beautiful space in a perfect location. Very clean and special design.
Just a couple things to note for those inquiring about the space.. It is a couple of flights to get up to the apartment. It’s no joke if you aren’t used to stairs daily. And the bedroom gets very bright, which is not a bad thing.. but be prepared to not really sleep in. We even brought eye masks but they didn’t do the trick very well. The only other thing to comment on is the bedroom was pretty toasty since the AC unit is in the living room/kitchen space. I’m sure it’s not that bad during other times of the year, but we picked a very hot season so it was just a bit too warm back in bedroom. The living space did not have that problem at all.
However, even with those couple of mild things to note, the apartment was breathtaking and unique. By far the most unique Air B n B we have stayed.
Very clean and beautiful. The exposed brick is very lovely. The shower is very nice. We loved all the windows and the greenery! The kitchen is very grand and beautiful as well, although we didn’t end up using it because of the far too many restaurants to eat out.
The spot is in a perfect location to all the amazing restaurants. It’s just a tad off the main strip of the busyness, so it is pretty quiet and low key, but close enough to not miss out on anything because it is all pretty much in walking distance.
Thank you for the lovey stay! It was gorgeous!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable apartment in a perfect location!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t wait to come back! Amazing location and such a great vibe in the apartment. The outdoor space and parking are a huge bonus. Host was fantastic - easy, awesome experience!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and central location to the rest of the city--cute interior design with modern and rustic decor; was nice that there was air conditioning in the living room (we visited during a heat wave) although the bedroom didn't have an AC unit to our knowledge so was just a bit hotter than the rest of the place.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came to Portland for our 25th anniversary and could not have dreamed of a better place to stay. The location is perfect—we walked everywhere. The apartment is even more beautiful than the pictures. Alice was a great host—easy and quick communication!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice’s place is perfectly located in the old port area! Walking distance to everything you need!! Beautifully decorated, we felt so comfortable in this space, we’d stay again in a heartbeat!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"you can not beat the location, and everything inside is as gorgeous as you'd wish"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful property. We are a couple travelling and working and there were separate spaces for us to be very comfortable. Great location to access most things and the home is equipped for cooking and ordering in easily. It’s a couple of flights up to the penthouse so you need to be prepared for that, but the apartment is worth a few flights of stairs."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a stunning unit and even nicer in person than the pictures reveal. It was spotless, comfortable, and has a ton of natural light (worth bringing a sleep mask unless you rise with the sun). A very short walk from pretty much anything in Old Port.
Great communication with hosts for everything from check-in to parking."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice’s apartment is great. It is large, clean and has everything you need for your stay. The apartment has beautiful views, a large private terrace and is a short walk from all the great restaurants, bars and attractions in Portland."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location! Definitely the reason this Airbnb is the price it is! Wonderful location!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice’s place was perfect for my husband and I’s stay in Portland! The apartment is bright, extremely clean, and central to so many restaurants and things to do. While we did rent a car for our other travels in Maine, we did not need one while in Portland because of how walkable the apartment was. We also loved the balcony area to enjoy the beautiful weather. Highly recommend to any other couples looking for a fun getaway!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perhaps the best Airbnb I've ever had. Great apartment in a great location with parking and a private deck. The apartment was spotless and bathed in natural light. It's within walking distance of almost everything and yet separate from the bustle. To top it off, Alice was very responsive and helpful. I'm looking forward to returning next time I make it to Portland."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay in Portland!
The apartment is a piece of beauty and was a great spot to call base during our trip.
Would definitely recommend :)"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in the city and close to a bunch of fun things to do!! Lots of vintage shops around and good eats.

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t recommend this place enough to anyone visiting Portland. It’s a perfect spot to be able to walk everywhere. You should definitely try the standard baking co, gross, green elephant, and bite into Maine."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,So amazing!! Perfect location and such a cute house. 10/10 would stay again!!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, neat apartment."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice's place offers beautiful views, lots of natural light, a very comfortable bed, and a relaxing atmosphere. It's the perfect location for exploring downtown and old Port since it's walking distance to both. Alice is very responsive and clear in communiaction, which made planning our stay very easy! We'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking to explore by foot or Uber since it's so close to museums, restaurants, bars, shops, and breweries. We also loved how unique the space was and how easy it was to park and check in."

Everything was accurately described and I really appreciated all the small lovely details that made the space so unique!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! We walked everywhere from the loft apartment. It was also nice and quiet at night as most other occupants of the building are businesses.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great unit in a very walkable area of Portland. Definitely more secluded and quiet for a relaxing weekend for 2.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was amazing. Better than the pictures can show.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Alice's place is quite spacious, and it's located in walkable proximity to downtown and the old port. We stayed in winter and still found ourselves within a comfortable distance to explore the city by foot. Because of previous reviews, I came prepared for the strong natural light in the bedroom by bringing an eye mask. If you are sensitive to light when sleeping I highly recommend doing the same. Overall, great stay and great location!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an awesome weekend in Portland and this space/location was perfect for us. Warm, safe, stylish, cozy, all around amazing deal. Easy parking and close to a lot of nice shops, bars and restaurants. I don’t see how it could get much better."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Angela's place! The decor was incredible and it felt like a treasure hunt finding all sorts of hidden gems (some quite funny!) throughout the house.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, peaceful, and very friendly and responsive host. Thank you thank you thank you. We had a great stay."

It was what we needed for our stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location! Host was great she went above and beyond
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angela's house was the perfect spot for our stay in Portland. The house was in a great location, easy to find and access. A nice, cozy space - we felt right at home with the fun decor and comfortable furniture. The laundry was a nice touch as well! We really loved the interactive fun of the bathroom fish wall! Would recommend to anyone coming to the Portland area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely little home!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time visiting Portland and staying at Angela's place definitely made things easy. Extremely walkable and in close proximity to everything downtown. I was solo so the house was the perfect size for me to spread out and be comfortable. Angela provided all the amenities and it was nice to find things available if needed. Also, make sure you paint a fish when you're there 😉. I'd definitely stay there again if ever in the Portland area in the future.
Josh"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I had a wonderful stay at Angela's place! Would recommend staying here if you are in Portland.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had the best stay at Angela's house! Our best Airbnb experience so far! Extremely clean house.. sheets, dishes, floor, and bathroom. Angela thought of every detail, with absolutely everything that would be needed and a little more. Perfect stay, with no adjustment needed ."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was shocked at how expensive lodging is in Portland, Maine, where I once lived. In that context, I was fortunate to find something at this price that had everything I needed."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Angela’s place is so well appointed! Laundry, ice maker, deck, funky furniture, and an extremely comfy bed. What’s not to love?! We definitely want to come back when it’s not raining so we can meet the kitties and make s’mores. Thank you for the delightful stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It's a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay in Portland. I would stay in Angela's place again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little cottage with easy access to downtown Portland. Only stayed a night but would be a very good choice for a longer visit.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Location was 30min walk from Thompson’s Point which is where we saw a concert, so that was the reason for choosing this AirBnB. This section of town is a bit run down, but we were able to walk to a lot of places (we like walking though). In all a decent place to stay. The bed was very comfortable! One thing to note, the bedroom window is on a busy street it’s a bit noisy at night."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Affordable place to stay near Portland, definitely need a car to get around but otherwise nice! It was well stocked and had supplies to make a bonfire."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was exactly as pictured and in a quiet, residential location that made an excellent home base for both Portland adventures and excursions to the beaches. Comfy and clean bed and linens and plenty of towels were provided. Small yet cozy house!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Extremely convenient and well worth the money.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cozy apartment with a nice backyard and some cute personal touches. We could walk to dinner and even downtown Portland (but we are hearty walkers) and enjoyed the close proximity to the farmer’s market. A nice hopping off point to explore.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Not far from downtown Portland. Quirky decorations made it fun and unusual. Clean. Responsive host.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cabin with lots of thoughtful touches! Angela is amazing!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We certainly enjoyed our stay at Angela's house. Angela was very responsive prior to, and during, our stay. The decorating is eclectic but we were charmed by it. The entire house was very clean and kitchen well appointed. The bed and bedding (sheets, pillows and blankets) were an amenity that stood out to us. Neighbors were very quiet and off street parking was greatly appreciated. We were able to occupy the house based on our timeline which was very convenient. We would certainly be comfortable staying there again if we are in the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We found the property quite sufficient and it was exactly as advertised and described. Thank you for the hospitality and accommodating us.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was super cute and perfect quiet neighborhood for the two of us. Great space and location in walking distance to many things.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I loved playing house in this adorably decorated space. The kitchen was perfect for breakfast and meals in. Washer and dryer was a big plus after beach days. Loved feeding and entertaining the two kitties that lived outside.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as advertised! Thanks for the hospitality.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location and house for a long weekend and even longer stay in Portland.
Bed is comfortable, bathroom, kitchen, and livings areas are great.
The outside space is perfect.
Angela is a great host and added little extra touches that didn’t go unnoticed like water in the fridge and copper mugs being chilled in the freezer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very fun decorations with everything you need! Comfy bed and access to laundry included :)
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and very convenient for our weekend at Thompson’s Point!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Angela was very responsive and the house was exactly as listed. It was a great place for us to stay while visiting family. A nice quiet neighborhood that is close to everything.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I only had a couple days to explore Portland, and where the house location is made it very easy to do so. From the begging Angela was a great host, very responsive, thought of pretty much anything we might need prior to our arrival (ie. maps, waters, blankets, etc.) My partner and I could not stop talking about how much we loved the house. I would recommend this to anyone who might be looking for a place to stay while visiting Portland!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angela was great, and we loved the house! Our stay was made, Angela set out a much of things that would make our stay easier. Loved the details! I cannot wait to come back and stay again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Angela’s home was the perfect spot to rest after attending a concert at Thompson’s Point. It was clean and cute. The fridge had waters in it which was a nice surprise. Angela was super responsive and friendly and easy to book with. I highly recommend for couples visiting Portland!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,everything was great!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a fantastic bargain for stating so close to downtown Portland. A cozy, eclectic little home with many little whimsical touches that just made you chuckle (an octopus chair, a dinosaur toilet roll holder), it was exactly as described. The local cats were quite fun to spend time with before heading off to the town center. Great price for an in town home that still felt private!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Angela was a wonderful and very responsive host. The apartment is cute with lovely decor. It’s clean and comfortable for 2. We’d definitely stay again next time we’re in Portland.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Angela had the place well stocked. Lots of stuff that we need to use she had. Supplied us with coffee and cream and sugar. And there was water in the refrigerator but I had my own. Only thing that was a little bad was the bathroom it is small and very cramped by the door. And the bathroom mat needs to be replaced and cleaned underneath. The location was great close to everything. Got to my destinations in 10 minutes. I would stay here again because of the location and place is very clean.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Portland! You’ll have the whole house to yourself and its exactly as pictured - appreciated the off street parking, washer/dryer, and cool decor throughout the house. And the location! Close to the farmer’s market, Portland Seadogs stadium, Holy Donuts, and more and only a 15 min drive downtown or over to the Portland Head Light which you should def visit!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great house to stay for the weekend trip we took to Portland, very walkable to downtown areas but also close proximity to a bus station that took us straight into downtown as well. All the amenities to make it a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angela is superhost material. She went out of her way to make sure that I had a great visit. When I arrived it was easy to park and get in with the code, and her space was sparkling clean and inviting.
I loved the creative house activities she suggested, such as gathering some flowers from the yard for a vase, and bird watching. The fridge was stocked with bottled water. It’s those small personable things, the attention to detail, that truly elevate the Airbnb experience and make you feel like a valued guest.
The location was very convenient, walking distance to the Sea-dogs stadium, minutes drive or Uber to everywhere and anywhere you might want to be in Portland, and close to the highways too. The backyard was large and spacious, wish I could have enjoyed a fire in the pit but it rained on my visit.
I highly recommend choosing Angela as a host! You won’t be disappointed."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location to stay. Close to downtown Portland, we were able to reach all of our destinations in a half hour, usually less.
Angela was very helpful finding the house and stocking it with all amenities needed. I was suprised at how much was offered!
If you're visiting Portland, it's a great place to stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Angela's place was great to stay for two people. Flexibility in checking in and out was great. Front door uses a keypad entry and automatically locks when closing.
The bedroom was comfortable to stay at. The split a/c existed in the living room and bedroom. There is a temperature vent as well in the bathroom, I did move the towels that were below there since I didn't want to create a fire hazard.
Driveway was great to use. I rented an XL SUV and it fits and wasn't cramped with the neighbor. The washer & dryer was great to use as well after a long day of sweat. I will come back for sure as the neighborhood is quiet and safe."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Angela was a wonderful host I would stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"great location to everything, quiet place to sleep!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved Marlene‘s place! Right in the heart of Old Port and situated on (in our opinion) the best street in the neighborhood. Her place was super cozy and comfortable. Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Marlene’s place. The location is perfect for exploring Portland. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly what we were looking for. Clean Airb&b and easy to check into. Right downtown for easy walking to everything we wanted to do and see. Easy check in. Responsive host. Would stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay with lots of clear communication. Lots to do in the city.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marlene is an excellent host. The location was fantastic with lots of cool shops, bars and restaurants around. The apartment was perfect for myself and my girlfriend and we enjoyed our stay. Marlene had a lot of great recommendations nearby and we were able to check out a few of them. We will definitely consider staying at her place again next time we are in Portland."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a nice place to stay! Marelene was great. Would recommend to anyone!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marlene was responsive to any questions during our stay. This apartment is in a busy part of town, and we stayed during a weekend so it was noisy at night."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect location right downtown in old Port. Will definitely be booking again in the future.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We know the Portland area very well but this was the first time we didn’t have an apartment to stay in. Marlene’s place felt like home. Excellent location to parking and walkable to so many places. Inside was simple and beautiful. We will definitely come back!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Totally a six-star experience. Very convenient to get in and out, beautiful clean centrally-located building. Place was gorgeous and comfy. Host was communicative and helpful. I had a car and parking was a bit of a thing; but I was away most of the days, and night parking was free after 6, so all good. Friday night parking was harder but manageable. Love Portland, lots and lots to do and see. Highly recommended!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great location, right in the middle of the action, could easily park the car and walk to many attractions. Parking is challenging and expensive. Apartment is cozy and clean and had everything we needed. Would stay again if in the area."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cutest and most accommodating stay ever, the apartment was very nice and had the upmost attention to detail. 10/10 would recommend!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Marlene’s loft in Portland, Maine! It was exactly as the pictures and description depicted. It also truly is steps away from all of the action! We parked our car and didn’t get it again until we checked out. Parking is a bit of a challenge if you’re trying to find something reasonably priced, but this comes with being in a city. We settled on a parking garage a couple blocks away. However, we truly loved our stay and Marlene was a fantastic host! Incredibly responsive, helpful, and proactive!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Marlene's unit in Portland. The location was great and we were able to walk to the water, restaurants and stores. We parked the car overnight on the street with no issues (after the meters expired). Very spacious, high ceilings, nice light and a very comfortable stay!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location! High ceiling loft, cozy, cute. Walkable to all of downtown Portland. Thank you Marlene"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"it was a perfect location. the only issue we had, which has nothing to do with Marlene's place, is that it was a bit loud in the early morning, i.e., people getting out of the bars. it kept us up for a while, but other than that it was great."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great location downtown and easily walkable to everything in the area! A little loud at night if you keep the windows open as there's a parking garage next door and car alarms were going off, but it wouldn't deter us from returning! The listing is exactly as it looks online. Truly can't beat the location!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Marlene’s place is lovely, clean and has everything we needed for a girl’s trip through the northeast."

So clean and decorated so nicely too. Perfect location to enjoy the Old Port. Everything was in walking distance, and only a block down the hill to get to the waterfront.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property in a GREAT location. Pretty central to all there is to do in the heart of downtown Portland. Although it is located right in the midst of things to do, the property itself was very quiet and peaceful. We had a great stay!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely stay in the downtown loft!
Pros:
- Perfect location: right in the heart of Old Port, walkable to everything
- Comfortable bed, nice kitchen, good sized bathroom
- Marlene is responsive and friendly
- Keypad to get into building felt safe
Cons:
- Like a lot of Portland, no central A/C. There was a free standing unit plugged into the area between the living room and bedroom but with it 85 degrees outside, it was quite warm in the loft. The instructions said there was only a heater in the bedroom, but there was a small free standing AC in there. We had to rig up the exhaust vent in the window but once we got that going, it cooled off the bedroom. I don’t imagine this is a big deal most of the year, but during the heat wave, it was critical to have the AC in the bedroom so a pleasant surprise there was one in there.
- Otherwise, I can’t think of any cons! It was a great stay and we would stay there again. Thanks!"

One thing I will say about Portland, parking is not fun… There are lots of expensive lots nearby as well as street parking that’s a pay by the hour (however we did learn a parking ticket is only $20 when most of the local garages are $40 for the day so wanted to post this as a psa)
Would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Portland!"

Can park the car in a lot and leave it if you just want to explore the Old Port and downtown Portland. We stayed four nights and only moved the car one time during our stay because we wanted to check out some lighthouses. The city is awesome and as inclusive as any place we’ve ever been. Everyone in town was incredibly nice. The modern loft had everything we could have asked. Great building, so clean, and all the amenities we needed.

They gave great advice about where to eat, what to do in town, etc. We 100% would stay at their modern loft if we ever return to Portland!"

The washer/dryer is a wonderful asset. We have grandchildren in the area and hope to visit frequently. We'll stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Vickie was so accommodating when we quickly needed a place for my dad to stay near us when he visited. She was responsive and helpful when he needed help with the TV and she even dropped by some Emergen-C - he was not feeling well. The apartment is adorable and small in the perfect way. Love the cheery red cabinets and how everything is labelled for ease of use and finding. Highly recommend, book if you ever find it available!"

Her AirBnB had everything we needed from towels, a hair dryer, coffee maker, coffee and even a recycle bin. She even texted us just to ensure we had enough creamer for our coffee. What a wonderful host!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay. Way more affordable than a hotel.
Hosts were welcoming and even invited us to their party nearby.
Quiet area made me feel safe walking around alone, even as a woman. (Obviously be more careful at night thought, as is the case anywhere).
The drawers and houses were organized and labeled so things were easy to find. I’d come back."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at Vickie's place. It felt very ""New England"" and being from the south we really enjoyed the experience. Vickie was very friendly and reached out early on to check on us and how we were settling in. The location was great for exploring Portland and the surrounding areas. The unit, even though close to a road, was quiet and restful during our stay. The only little quirk is that the house has roads on two sides and the intersection there is a little confusing. It's also a little dangerous pulling out onto the main road due to low visibility. Overall we loved our stay and would definitely recommend it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an absolutely adorable place in a wonderful location! Everything was perfect!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very homey and nice stay! Part of the hosts home but feels private since it’s completely separate. Briefly met Vickie she was super friendly and welcoming. Great location only about $7 uber to old port, and south Portland is quiet and safe feeing. Would recommend!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie's apartment is one of the nicest places I've ever stayed with airbnb, having stayed in them in several different countries and in various places in the US. Very comfortable and I really appreciate some of the things she thought of. I do a lot of cooking when travelling; because of celiac disease, it's hard for me to eat out. Not every kitchen is truly set up for the guest to actually cook, but Vickie's place had a nice assortment of pots and pans, utensils, as well as small cooking appliances. And something that not every airbnb place has: a washer and dryer! We had to leave a day early because a hurricane was on its way and Vickie worked with airbnb to get us a partial refund, which we didn't ask for and do appreciate! We look forward to staying with Vickie again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was as described. Cozy and clean and just perfect for me and my husband. Vickie was very attentive and a super host!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our 5 nights at Vickie’s place! We loved how conveniently located it was to Portland harbor district ,plus very close to the grocery store and restaurants. The apartment felt very private although it’s attached to the main home. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed. Having a washer and dryer in the unit came in handy. Since the weather was warmer than expected, having the window AC units was definitely needed. Vickie is a great host and we would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place in an excellent location. Very easy to get to city and beaches. Host was friendly and good communication. I stayed here with my mom and it was perfect for two. Door on living room worked well to give private bedroom space. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We has a great stay at Vickie’s! Clean and peaceful. At time of review there is a washer/dryer in the AirBnb for small loads, and that was super helpful to us as we went to the beach. Great recommendations, super responsive. Walkable to the beach and a bunch of restaurants, easy/cheap Ubers into Portland as well. Definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vickie was fantastic and very communicative. It was honestly one of the cutest Airbnbs I've ever stayed at- very clean and exactly as described! I'd stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Vickie was very accommodating, as we asked to change weekends from June to August since the weather was going to be so bad the original weekend in June. Everything was very clean and as described. Would definitely recommend staying here again!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie’s place is the perfect spot to experience Portland. The location is actually much better than just staying in downtown Portland! Easy to get to and from all the iconic places, but more comfortable and quiet at the end of the day. It’s homey, perfect for 2 people for a few days. All the details show that they take pride in making guests feel comfortable. Really appreciate her proactive messages and kindness in allowing us to use her space as if it was ours. Would visit again!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie’s place was a great spot for my family and I to rest our heads at the end of the day during a weekend trip to explore the Portland area. Vickie’s instructions and description of the space were clear and accurate - it was definitely cozy for four, but doable since we were all family! We were able to walk to lots of shops and cafes in South Portland and easily drive in to Old Port for even more food and shops. It’s a great, comfortable, affordable spot to stay while in town! Thanks Vickie!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay exploring South Portland from Vickie's place. It was a rainy few days but the sun came out for a memorable trip to Williard Beach. Cape Elizabeth was stunning as well. Vickie's place was comfortable for two adults sleeping in different beds. The kitchen was well stocked and the shower was clean with great pressure. The bed was very comfortable.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and functional place and convenient for accessing various destinations in the area. 10-15 min drive into the center of Portland.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Vickie’s place with my parents for about 5 days and nights. It was very relaxing, totally hassle free. Vickie had everything cleaned before we arrived and everything was in place. For 5 days we didn’t even have to ask Vickie for anything. Every supply was in place. Totally enjoyed my stay and if I’m there again would stay again."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cosy and cute. Bed was very comfortable and wi-fi worked great. Convenient off street parking and easy access into Old Port. Excellent communication with host!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay and a quick drive to downtown Portland. Would definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very receptive hostess. Vickie went out of her way to help with a couple of things that I needed while there. The small apartment provides everything you would need. Parking is off street which is great and the washer and dryer was the cherry on top. You would be remiss not booking this property!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Very responsive. Helped me with everything.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even though we ended up having to cancel our stay here, Vickie was responsive and very helpful. She was very kind and I could tell she cares about her guests’ satisfaction."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vickie’s place was so quaint and central to everything in Portland! Had a great stay.
2023-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,Vickie has thought of everything you would want to have a home away from home experience- from the kitchen and bathroom to ample seating and cable tv in the living room. Great walkability to restaurants and Red’s ice cream.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Vickie's place was wonderful! It's even nicer than it looks in the photos. Really quiet, a great place to stay for just one person, which was my case. I could see it feeling a little crowded for two or more over the long term - not because of the bed size or anything, just a small square footage - but totally fine for me. Vickie was a wonderful host--really responsive, shoveled the whole driveway during several snowstorms, and was just generally really kind. The area is nice too -- not too far from Rosemont Market, and if you feel like a 1.5-hour-ish walk, the Portland Head Light isn't far at all. I was there for six weeks, and can confirm, would have loved to stay even longer."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Vickie's place and rang in the new year in comfort. We'll definitely stay with her again. The place is charming, and tons of great stuff to do and see is within easy walking distance. We love SoPo!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a sweet little in-law apartment! Everything was as described and we had a nice stay, Vickie was kind and communicative. Importantly, the AC worked great, and we slept comfortably. The only thing to know is that if you’re planning to use the foldout couch and sleep 4 guests total, the main bed is not actually in a separate room, so there won’t be any privacy. But if you know that going in, should be fine."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Convenient location. Small place but well organized with a functional kitchen.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vickie is a fantastic host. Very easy check in and check out process. Her apartment has everything you could want for a comfortable stay and is a very short drive from downtown Portland

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to visit Portland and feel like you're actually living in town, this is the place for you! Close to downtown but just over the bridge, it's nestled in a quiet neighborhood. The apartment is spotless and has all the conveniences of home--even a washer and dryer! The queen-sized bed felt like sleeping on a cloud! My friend and I attended a concert in town, and afterward, it felt great to come home to our cozy little nook, make a snack, and settle in for a good night's sleep. If you'd like a home away from home for your vacation, you'll find it here!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie was very communicative and helpful with check-in and any questions I had! Would definitely stay here again as the price is incredibly fair, the place is clean, and is close to the old port and some really great restaurants!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vickie’s place is perfect for visiting Portland. It’s perfectly stocked for a morning cup of coffee or making some breakfast - she stocks the fridge with fresh eggs from her chickens! We typically stay in the old port so we were a little worried we’d be too far away from the city’s center but the 6 min drive was never an issue. Vickie is also very easy to communicate with and is available if you need anything. We’ll definitely be back!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb was a perfect location to stay as it was within walking distance of many local attractions and not far to take a Lyft or Uber to further attractions. Vickie had a helpful guide book to use as reference which was much appreciated and very thoughtful! The apartment itself was perfect and had everything a person could need for a couple days stay in the beautiful state of Maine! Thank you Vickie!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was great for people who want to balance the bustle of Portland with the peace and quiet of Maine. Busses to the city are less than 15min walk away, and the local attractions are maybe 45min walk away if you take your time. The area has plenty of interesting restaurants, historical sights, and scenery that was beautiful in late October. There was some construction going on outside the AirBnB that made travelling through the area a little confusing, but we were given a heads up and the construction workers were very helpful."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie was accommodating and everything was wonderful! Absolutely adorable place to stay for that quintessential ""Maine"" feeling! Super close to everything and it was exactly as it's pictured!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Very clean! Vickie was awesome and accommodating. She made us feel comfortable and welcomed.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location with easy and quick access to the beaches to the south and the city to the north. A lot of nice touches to settle in.

I would give Vickie's place a 10/10!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This a comfortable and cozy place to stay. It has everything you need for cooking and relaxing…..a very comfortable bed too. We loved the location as it is in walking distance of many good restaurants and coffee places. We particularly liked Scratch for coffee and pastry and David’s 388 Restaurant for dinner. Vickie is available to help if you need it. Excellent location for outings to the beach or Portland.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vickie's place is a steal. Great location close to Portland as well as the nice lighthouses and green spaces of the suburbs. Space was bigger than it looked. Vickie was gracious and communicative. Would stay again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very easy to get to. We were only in town for the weekend. It was great. It is in south portland though if you’re not aware of the area- it’s not walking distance to downtown. We had no clue there was a difference from south portland to old port, but in fact it’s about a ten min drive and over a Long bridge. We still enjoyed our stay. We were only there to sleep and it worked well for that. Comfy bed. Plenty of space. Parked right outside the place."
2021-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Easy check in and out.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie was an attentive and responsive host! Her property was extremely clean and well organized. It is the perfect spot for a couple looking for a quiet getaway.

The next time I travel to Portland, I will definitely be booking with Vickie!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for what we were looking for. Right down the street from a beautiful park with a historic lighthouse. The location is pretty close to everything. We loved visiting The Cookie Jar bakery nearby and viewing the local lighthouses. We event went to the grocery store and were able to cook a meal in this place. We highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great base for exploration in the Portland area. A wonderful neighborhood that was literally 5 minutes from downtown. Quiet and well equipped. The owners were very nice and as we enjoy cooking they had everything we needed. The best part were the local farm eggs they provided in the fridge, I think they were from the Yard Birds!!!! We would definitely stay here again!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an excellent stay at Vickie’s place! The home is in a great, quiet location in South Portland and is a very short drive away from Portland.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great, and the host, Vickie, kept in touch and made sure everything was going smoothly for us"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vicki’s air bnb is artfully and colorfully decorated. The place is perfect for two people, however was a little cozy for 3 of us. There was not much room left when the sofa bed was opened. Vicki is informative and engaging. She also left eggs and power bars for us. The shower has fragrant castile soap in a bottle. There are two chairs behind the hedge in the front yard for sitting outside. The neighborhood is residential and within walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops and DiPietro’s market which make delicious grinders. There are pristine coves with little beaches to swim in within walking, biking distance or a short drive.
We were there in a heat wave and there was an ac window unit in the living room, but we could have used another unit in the bedroom/kitchen or a bigger fan."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay here! Vickie clearly communicated check in procedures making our incredibly simple. :-) The place was great.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Vickie and her family could not have been more accommodating. It’s the perfect size for a couple visiting Portland and in a great location.

Our recent visit was during hurricane Elsa and we still had an amazing time because of her suggestions. We can’t wait to visit again.

The location worked out perfect, was across the bridge from the main part of the city which made for easy-short drives.

2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Small cute space about 10 minutes from downtown portland. Check in was easy and the option for parking in the driveway was a plus. Perfect for me and my mom to spend a few nights
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time in Maine celebrating our best friends’ wedding. Vickie gave precise instructions and directions and even let us know she “left the front porch lights on” for us when I told her we’d be getting in late. The apartment had thoughtful and lovely details, like hot chocolate & popcorn, antiques, art, and great lighting on the bathroom mirror (for wedding makeup- ha!). My ONLY qualm is on me, not the host- I’m 6 foot tall and the double bed foot post did not cooperate with my feet. No worries- throw all the blankets on the futon, stretch out, and sleep nicely in the quiet and replenishing atmosphere. Oh, and the guest book was delightful to look through! Thanks, Vickie!"
2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Vickie was kind and gracious. Her apartment was clean and welcoming. Love that she offered so many options for things to do. Enjoyed our stay.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little apartment with all the necessities, walking distance to a few local restaurants and coffee shops, and a short drive to downtown Portland. Added bonus (as a dog owner) of the cemetery across the street that doubles as a dog park to local residents. 🤷‍♂️ Keep Portland weird, right? Would definitely stay again."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"nice 1 bedroom w/ kitchen, bath and living room. It is a perfect location to see the greater Portland area. There is a short walk to a ""cookie jar"" with coffee and yummy donuts. Ft Williams is about 1.5 mile walk one way and so beautiful you will want to come back again and again. Vicki was very accommodating and answered all our questions promptly."

Vickie made sure we had everything we needed and the space is nothing short of darling not to mention SPOTLESS. The location is also amazing, less than a mile from the beach, a playground, gas station, bakery and ice cream shop all in walking distance. We can’t wait to come stay again!"
2019-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, decent pricing. Lots of amenities and personal touches. A little tight with three people, but two would do fine. The pictures don't show this but the main bed is in the kitchen area separated by the stove. Didn't end up being a big deal but it may be for others."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The in-law apartment was perfect for our family trip to Portland! We loved exploring the city just a quick car ride away and walking around South Portland was also a nice reprieve from the crowds of the Old Port. Vickie was a great host and we had a lovely trip.

It’s just a quick walk away from Willard beach (such a riot watching the dogs enjoy the beach in the morning) and has great coffee shops on the way. It’s only a 10-15 min drive to Cape Elizabeth or over the bridge into Portland. Vickie made everything super easy and convenient from check in to check out and everything in between."

Cottage Road leads to a wide range of rolling hills routes through the countryside."

2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Vickie’s. She was very responsive and, even though she was out of town, was able to quickly resolve an issue we had with some of the outlets. Her place was an easy drive into the city where we were able to easily find street parking. Vicky left fruits, coffee, creamer (including non-dairy, which was a plus for me). The kids especially loved the popcorn and Kind bars that came in handy for snacks. The place was well-Maintanence and clean. Would definitely stay there again."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie’s place was as advertised. It is in a nice neighborhood with food and breakfast just a short walk away, while still being in a relaxed area."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Vickie was a wonderful host & we can't wait to visit So Po again! The house is cozy and was perfect for my hubby & our dog. You're close enough to all the restaurants & shopping that Portland has to offer, but also far enough to enjoy the downtime. Willard Beach was in walking distance, and dogs can be off their leash between 7-9am & 7-9pm. Highly recommended if you have a playful pup! Willard Beach is also the spot that my guy asked me to MARRY HIM!! So, it will forever hold a special place for us. Another reason why we will definitely be back!
Thanks for your hospitality, Vickie!! Cheers!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying here! Its a cute little apartment and very clean. We enjoyed walking around the south Portland neighborhood. The proximity to beaches and downtown Portland was the main appeal. Having access to laundry and the full kitchen were both very convenient. I felt more comfortable staying here than in a motel/hotel. We had privacy, but Vicki was communicative and accessible. We had a great little getaway."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie was a great host and her place is in an amazing location just a short drive from the Old Port.

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect place to land after traveling for two weeks. Vickie’s place was so cozy and exactly what we needed. We walked downtown to a nice sushi spot on 40 minutes and grabbed some pizza down the road about a ten minute walk away. Would definitely stay here again!

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location in South Portland; takes 10-15 minutes to drive to Portland and the neighborhood is nice for walking the dog, getting coffee and bagels (Scratch Bakery), and feels very safe. The private suite is perfect size for a couple or small family (3-4), and is dog friendly. Vickie was always quick to respond and so very friendly. We hope to come back soon!"

The place itself was great and is essentially a private apartment that's a five minute drive outside of downtown Portland. The living room was perfect for our toddler to sleep in- would definitely recommend to someone traveling with a young child.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,MUCH better than any hotel I’ve ever stayed in. So many nice little touches. It’s very clear Vickie cares about the people who will be staying there.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie was an awesome host! She made us feel welcome, and was even sweet to our shy puppy. The space itself is more than enough for a couple. It has everything you need. Though it is NOT in Portland city proper, it is still only a few miles away in suburbia, which makes the commute into the hotspots easy! Thank you, Vickie!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vickie’s place was great! The space was exactly how it looked online. The apartment is also in such a great location. 5 minute drive from Willard beach, right down the street from Scratch bagels, and just a short drive to all of the phenomenal food in downtown Portland.

Lots of homey and convenient touches are included (snacks, fruit, condiments, laundry detergent, an AC unit, seltzer water in the fridge, ice cream in the freezer). The location is also great - South Portland is lovely AND you can get into Portland proper very easily. Vickie was prompt and thorough before, during and after my stay, and still managed to give me my space and privacy - something I really appreciated on this particular trip. Would highly recommend!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most thoughtfully appointed and furnished Airbnb’s we’ve had the privilege to stay in. Everything was as described, the location was great, and Jeannette is an AMAZING host. There were generous amenities, and everything was well-organized and spacious for cooking, sleeping, working, relaxing, etc. It really felt like you were “at home” or the guest of someone who knew us well and set up everything to meet our needs. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful host, peaceful surroundings walkable to all places. Enjoyed our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Airbnb was in the heart of East Portland Maine. 10-20min to walk to downtown maine. The pictures do not do this Airbnb justice; it has more space than expected & a relaxing atmosphere to absorb. This is on the first floor of a two story building - so you will hear footsteps. Would highly recommend spending the weekend in this breathtaking place with seagulls squawking & fresh breeze whipping.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeanette’s place is fantastic! She is a flexible, responsive, gracious, and hospitable host. The apartment is spacious, comfortable, well-equipped, and tastefully decorated. The location is close to local markets, cafes, restaurants, and just blocks from the beautiful Eastern Promenade. It is also walkable to multiple breweries and the amenities of the Old Port and Downtown. I recommend Jeanette’s place without reservation and fully intend to stay with her again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a wonderful weekend in Portland! Jeannette’s place was beautiful, clean, and inviting. The house was equipped with everything that we needed and very comfortable. Street parking was easy and always accessible. Jeannette does a great job giving local recommendations, most of which are within walking distance. Not only was Old Port about a 7-minute drive away, but you are also a few streets up from the beautiful water views of the Eastern Promenade. Would absolutely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot for a getaway in Portland! About a 10 minute walk downtown to plenty of attractions and restaurants. The place was very clean and safe. Would stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was so nice! We loved it for our girl’s weekend. Super clean and pretty. Nicely decorated and in a good location.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the second time I've stayed here. I would happily return. It is such a bright and sunny apartment with a surprising amount of space. The place is kept really clean and the kitchen is extremely well outfitted. (I love the glassware and plates - so pretty).
Munjoy Hill is a great neighborhood to stay in and this house is so central to so many different locations. Parking on the street is very easy. And the host had great restaurant recommendations! All in all a great stay!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Been coming to Portland for years, this was maybe the best place we stayed. I love the eastern promenade so it was nice to be a stone throw from that, then .6 miles walkable from all our favorite places.
Will stay here again easily.
Romantic getaway with out kids for a couple"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome Airbnb with great amenities and a super convenient location! Would totally stay again :)
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeannette’s lovely apartment was perfect for our stay. It’s spacious, light, well-designed and filled with attractive art. The apartment was spotless with a well-equipped kitchen. And the location was ideal. Although parking was abundant, we were happy that we didn’t need to use our car at all. A number of fun restaurants, shops, interesting attractions – and of course, the Eastern Promenade – were all within short walking distances.
Our visit coincided with some stormy weather, but everything was so close by that we hardly minded. And the apartment was so comfortable that we spent one cozy afternoon sprawled in the living room, reading and watching a movie. Jeannette is also a thoughtful host, and she responds quickly and communicates clearly, making everything so easy.
We’ve already promised ourselves another visit to Portland next year, and we’ll plan it so that we can stay in Jeannette’s apartment, because we can’t imagine a better spot."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We ended up here after another vacation rental had a major leak and we had to vacate. We booked and were communicating with Jeannette after just an hour, which was so appreciated since we were already in Portland, stranded.
She worked to get us into the property well in advance of check-in (we were so grateful)! The property is adorable and decorated with the most interesting artwork! The main rooms get lots of bright light while the bedroom offers room darkening blinds for great sleep! Everything is nicely set up, and everything you could need is available!
This property is easily walkable to most Portland attractions and restaurants (just know there will be some uphill on the way back 😊).
We loved Portland and will most definitely be returning and checking for availability here on our next visit!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Jeannette’s place. The apartment was incredibly clean and very well decorated. Parking close by on the street was never an issue for us and we enjoyed how quiet the neighborhood is. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful, charming place! Tastefully furnished and decorated, very homey and comfortable. You can’t go wrong with this neighborhood, which is quiet and has easy access to neighborhood stores and restaurants, Portland’s stunning eastern promenade along the ocean, and is even quite walkable to downtown. Street parking was effortless. There were many little touches we liked, including the availability of an electric kettle, a cute teapot, and a variety of teas in addition to coffee and coffeemaker. Highly recommend. We will keep this place in mind for all future trips to Portland!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Well decorated and equipped, the apartment was comfortable and convenient. The Munjoy Hill neighborhood is a great base for exploring Portland."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect ending to our anniversary road trip. The home was comfortable, spotlessly clean, and beautiful with plants and art. We had everything that we needed and check-in instructions were clear and easy to follow. The kitchen was well stocked and we enjoyed breakfast at home both days. Had dinner at The Front Room close by and it was delicious and fun. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it! Thank you, Jeannette!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful spot. Definitely felt even bigger than in the photos. Great quiet neighborhood. It’s a little far from the center of town so we took some short Uber rides when it was very warm out. Really close to eastern promenade that was gorgeous.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a special location as it is within walking distance to the water. Very clean and beautiful decorating.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great long weekend at Jeannette's in Portland. The apartment itself is very clean, and inviting with great natural light. Although we didn't spend much time at the apartment itself as we exploring everything the city had to offer, it was a perfect place for a couple to lay their head down. The location of Jeannette's is perfect, you're on the quieter side of Portland but still only a 15 minute walk to Old Port where most of the restaurants and shops are. Would absolutely stay there again."

Jeannette was a super responsive host - would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely place to stay and what a fantastic location, short walk to the water, very peaceful, and close to all things downtown. We enjoyed coffee in the morning on the front porch and we appreciated a pitcher of cold water in the refrigerator waiting for us. The interior was decorated so cute, it was homey and cozy, modern and just perfection. I love her plants!! We will absolutely stay here again and again. It was easy to get to and parking was easy as well. Great communication, easy to work with. We'll be back next summer and plan to stay here again! We rate this 10 out of 10!"

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Jeannette’s place was located near some prime real estate on the eastern promenade/east end beach. Go get some good food from some amazing food trucks and check out the view! Very close to the casco bay lines if you want to take the ferry to any of the islands. Place was great in a beautiful location.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot, close to Washington Ave., where my daughter lives. The living space was incredibly well appointed, including wall hangings, artwork, etc. Felt like home. Jeanette was very accomodating and responded to my few questions almost immediately. Next time I stay in Portland I hope to have access to their place again.
Lawrence N."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a much too short but perfect stay in this lovely home.

We want to spend more time in Portland since some relatives have moved there, and we now know where we will be staying. You will love this place!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jeanette was quick to respond. I needed to cancel the last day of our visit and there was no problem. We asked for an early check in and a late check out and there was no problem.
Beautiful neighborhood with a park overlooking the river could be viewed from the home. Cute markets, restaurants, and bakeries/coffee places within a short walk! A bit of a walk but not too much and using a path next to the water is Commercial where the Waterfront is (great shops).
We plan to check availability here first for our next visit to Portland.
Thanks Jeanette!"

I would definitely recommend this place."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We knew while just driving up to the space that it was going to be perfect. The location was more than expected and then some.

Jeannette was also very flexible and accommodating with any questions we had, for anyone looking to stay in Portland this won’t disappoint!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place as advertised. Within easy walking distance to great food and coffee.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jeannette and her husband are incredible hosts. I think they said we were some of their first guests, but they seem like pros at this point. My wife and I stayed for 2 weeks and sincerely enjoyed their cozy home-apartment. We loved everything about it and have missed the East End since leaving this week! Everything was great: towel service, the home decorating, the convenience--it's close to everything you could want. The place is cozy, yet roomy, very comfortable, and well stocked. Wifi is great for working from home with 2 people on video calls a fair amount, no issues at all. We would've stayed longer if we could've, and would 1000% percent stay here again if we ever get the chance. Do yourselves a favor and stay here if you can."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can’t say enough great things about my stay here. My wife and I were looking for a weekend getaway in Portland and this is the perfect house to do that. Check in/out was very convenient and Jeannette is great at communicating. We had our own private entrance and the location is just perfect. It is within walking distance to everything but is located in a quite neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying here.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a lovely weeklong stay at Jeannette’s home in Portland. The location cannot be beat! We were within walking distance to the beach, tennis courts and beautiful local park overlooking the water. Her home is thoughtfully designed and equipped with everything we needed for our stay. We cannot wait to come back to Maine!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jeanette’s apartment was great! The location was perfect in a quiet neighborhood in the East End, in prime location to walk to everything. The place was spotless with plenty of room for us. Check in was seamless and Jeanette was very communicative, even putting a guidebook of recommendations together for us. We highly recommend the place!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was super comfortable and convenient! My boyfriend and I visited Portland for the weekend and were very pleased with the location of the apartment and it’s amenities, it was perfect for just us two.

Overall a great experience with Jeannette and would recommend a stay here!!!"

We were able to walk everywhere without having to love the car- we walked to Jibe for spin classes to get drinks and food for any time of day, and did some sight seeing too.

Great warm shower! You often hear seagulls evening and morning so you know you are close to the coast. There is street parking that is manageable. The wifi is slower, however there is a built in Ethernet cord, so bring along a port and it works great! You will enjoy the space and neighborhood!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little apartment right in the center of Portland. Literally a few mins walk from Congress street where you can walk through the downtown area.
No onsite parking, but pretty easy to find a spot 1-2 streets away. The bed is comfortable and the apartment is really cute! Bonus washer/dryer!
On the smaller side but perfect if you're out exploring, and coming back to rest.
There's a restaurant right next door, so after closing, we could hear people chatting in the parking lot late at night. Bring ear plugs if that bothers you!"

2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great clean stay, host was communicative and helpful. Awesome location, walkable to a lot of what Portland has to offer. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was it was not always easy to find overnight nearby street parking and the spring st parking garage a couple blocks away will run you $28 for 24 hours."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leslie's Portland apartment was incredible. In a very cool/artsy neighborhood with a chill vibe and only about a 5 minute bike ride to downtown/old port. The apartment was perfect for two people and it was immaculate, very space efficient, and so comfy! It's pretty much everything you want in an Airbnb (i.e. laundry, little nooks for all of your stuff, fridge, great shower amenities, easy check in/check out). The outdoor space was such a plus...great place to wind down the day and have a glass of wine before walking to dinner on Congress street. Had dinner at Boda and was blown away by the delicious Thai food! Parking worked out for us since we were able to snag a parking spot on Pleasant street which has overnight parking (recommended by Leslie) and is only a block from the apartment. Kept the car there all week! Highly recommend Leslie's place."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Are you a solo traveler or couple looking for a Portland ME getaway? Then look no further than this listing; cozy, clean, can’t be beat location, aesthetic as all getup, and with two hosts who go above and beyond in communication and making their home feel like your home - you simply cannot go wrong!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,what a great place to stay. the location is perfect and the design of the studio was lovely - just enough room for what we needed. highly recommend.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute clean place and great location walking distance to everything. Parking was easy to find Both Leslie and Abigail were easy to communicate with and extremely helpful. Thank you!
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Leslie’s place was in a great location. We were a 15-20 min walk to old port area of the city. Street Parking with leslie’s handy map was super easy and free! And literally 1 block away. The studio was very small, but amazingly had everything needed packed into it, a washer/dryer, fridge, bathroom, and a small sitting area with a sink area. It was clean and airy and bright.
Now the only things that hindered our stay was the fact that we did not know the the door to our studio had no lock and there were other rooms or studios in the building, one in same floor, the other one floor down. This may not have been an issue but on our first night in portland, we left to go to duck fat and on our way back noticed that the back door with the keypad was wide open. We thought we had locked it but evidently we had not and the wind blew it wide open. After seeing this, my 13 year old daughter and I were a bit nervous about what we would find in our studio so we checked more closely and that’s when we found that the door to the studio can’t lock from the outside and the portable AC unit makes the window unable to close shut as well. There is a little patio set right below the ac unit which even I a 5’1” person could stand on the chair or table and climb in.
I understand portland, maine is likely very safe with low crime rates compared to Philadelphia where we are from but since I was traveling only with my tween daughter, we didn’t feel comfortable staying somewhere where the back door can open so easily and where the studio window can’t be closed and the door can’t be locked. I informed the BNB owner immediately and booked a hotel for the next couple nights and unfortunately she did not want to refund any of the amount so I reached out to BNB who luckily was able to help out some. I didn’t get a full refund but likely enough for a couple nights.
The location, price and cleanliness of the studio is great. Just please be aware of the above. Thanks!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Leslie’s Airbnb. It was beautifully and tastefully styled and included everything we needed for a comfortable stay! The location was great and we were able to walk to many restaurants in the area (which meant we could avoid paying for parking). We also found nearby overnight street parking quite easily each evening. The garden space was beautiful and we took advantage of that space multiple times throughout the course of our stay. Leslie was a great host! I can’t recommend this space enough!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a bright and comfortable little studio in a fantastic location: pretty much right downtown and only a short walk away the main touristy parts of town. Leslie was a terrific host who responded promptly to my (sometimes silly) questions. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy room in a great location. Easy walk to multiple breakfast, lunch, dinner and night life options. We left the car parked our entire stay and rode bikes everywhere."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little spot central to so much in Portland! I stayed here for a solo writing retreat and the space was absolutely perfect. The hosts were fantastic, responsive, and there were many thoughtful touches throughout the apartment. 10/10!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leslie’s place is wonderful! You can tell she and Abigail are an architect and artist by how thoughtfully the studio space is designed - we really appreciated how clean, bright and welcoming the space was. The washer and drier were a life saver and the binder of info and recommendations they provided was spot on. Most things we wanted to do were just a 10 minute walk away and at night it was quiet. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Thanks Leslie!"

It’s located in the most beautiful neighborhood and is walkable to many fabulous restaurants, bars, vintage stores and the water.
The space is small but perfect for two people. My boyfriend and I picked up breakfast early one morning so we could get an early start for a hike. We enjoyed eating in the breakfast nook. The patio was also a nice place to sit and lounge before bed.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a spot in Portland that’s clean and close to so many fun things."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing spot! Great location, walking distance to SOO MANY of Portland’s best. We had a great time and highly recommend this listing and the lovely hosts!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay right in Portland. It’s so close to everything and the apartment has everything you need to recharge before going out for more fun. I highly recommend this place!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest place ever! This is perfect little space for 1-2. Super cute, clean, and feels like home! Abigail has been so considerate and thoughtful with this space and has stocked everything you could need. Lovely stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at this adorably decorated Airbnb. It was very clean and had everything we needed. The shower was wonderful! Abigail was awesome at getting back to me quickly when I had a question. We were able to park near the back door and unload the car with ease. We then parked at the Holiday Inn and found that to be a relatively cheap option. We used the air conditioning unit each night which kept the room cool. If we did turn off the ac unit you could notice some outdoor noise but it was never an inconvenience as the unit was on during most of the evenings.
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location is really great, you can get to the touristy spots easily and the less touristy spots, too, tons of restaurants and cafes are super close, which is so nice. Abigail was very helpful and gave some great direction on where to eat.
They've made the outdoor space look very nice but on the other side of the fence is a parking lot with trash cans and the back door of a restaurant where the staff come on breaks to smoke.
Thanks for the fun stay!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great studio apartment. Wonderful location. Very clean. Had everything we needed.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leslie and Abby’s place was absolutely lovely. The studio was beautiful - very thoughtfully designed and had everything we needed. The complimentary tea and coffee were a nice touch. The place was immaculately cleaned, which was particularly important to me."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I’m not sure if I didn’t read enough but the parking situation can be frustrating. If you don’t mind walking 1/2 mile to most places find a spot and leave your car. This location is great. The apartment was clean and comfortable. There is no TV so if you like to watch things in your down time bring a computer or tablet. And there is no AC with the windows right next to a parking lot. Other then we really enjoyed our time with a great price.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay if you dont want to pay the crazy hotel prices in downtown Portland!! The place is beautifully designed and great for 1-2 people. Abigail was so responsive and helpful in suggesting places to go and provided a great map of where to park. She even left a binder with a ton of places for good food and attractions which was handy. Without AC, it was perfectly cool even on the hottest day with the provided fans. Would suggest staying here if you can nab it!!
The place is about a 15-20 minute walk to all the restaurants and shops. I will say we avoided congress street toward nightime because we felt slightly uncomfortable with the amount of homeless peoples. If you are from a city area yourself I am sure you would not think twice, but if that is something that makes you nervous just keep that in mind.
If you dont want to park on the street, there is a holiday inn garage a 5 minute walk away. I suggest consider parking in downtown Portland at the overnight garage by the ferry. Its 15 dollars for 24 hours, you can go in and out, and if you plan on spending most of your trip in downtown its nice to be able to go to and from to grab your stuff versus walking the 15 minutes back the the air bnb."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The best part about this place is the location. It’s very walkable to the Old Port Area and Congress St where all of the restaurants and shops are. The apartment was very clean and decorated beautifully. The downsides - all of which were accurately advertised in the posting - were that it’s quite small, had no AC (we were there over the July 4th weekend when it was in the 50s and 60s and the place was still very hot) and the parking situation is a bit tough. Overall the place met our needs and we’d recommend it if the above doesn’t bother you!"

2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at this modern, cute and clean Portland apartment! It is just as advertised, and located downtown where it is easy to walk to everything. The hosts are very helpful and responsive. We appreciated their thoughtful attention to detail with the apartment decor and high-quality, sustainable products offered. A head's up that with no A/C, we found it hot in the summer, and a bit noisy at night due to the location and restaurant next door. There is no parking at the apartment; we ended up paying to park for a few days in a garage down the street. We loved the extra outdoor table space as the apartment is quite small. Would recommend for a single person or couple; a great space for a weekend getaway!"

2024-06-01,2,Stayed one night,"The cottage itself was very cute and we liked Jen & Darcy a lot. The problem is there is not an outhouse here, it is an actual bucket with a trash bag in it that you need to empty if you pee 3x or go #2. They did not tell us this until a few hours before check in, too late to change our minds. It was somewhat comical but for me, very uncomfortable as I have IBS and was ok with going in an outhouse, but not a bucket!! This is not ok, especially for $200/night."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed the place, it was cozy with a rustic cabin vibe but with the addition of a beautiful garden and friendly hosts!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kind hosts, safe and quiet space. The dogs were super cute! A sweet spot to build a fire where we cooked hotdogs and marshmallows. Good proximity to everything and many helpful suggestions. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,It was very helpful they gave us recommendations for Acadia!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We felt so welcomed and comfortable as soon as we arrived at Jennifer and Darcy's place! The cabin was cozy and peaceful, and the whole property was beautiful (and impressive) from the garden to the cutest little outhouse. It was the first night of a trip for us, and we couldn't have asked for a better start. Thank you so much! We can't wait to return."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My fiancée and I stopped in Portland for a night on our way back from Acadia to Albany, NY. We had been planning to go out to Portland for dinner and entertainment, but after we got to the cabin we decided to stay in and enjoy the beautiful space.
I played with their dog Winnie, relaxed in the hammock, and did some bird watching at the bird feeder. We had a little fire which Jen and Darcy joined us for and they brought supplies for S’mores. Darcy whittled us some premium 2023 edition roasting sticks. We enjoyed hanging out with them and had a very relaxing night.
The tiny cabin was so cozy and the sound of the rain on the roof lulled us to sleep. They provided bagels and coffee for breakfast and we enjoyed sitting on the screened in porch and having a relaxing morning before hitting the road again.
We would absolutely stay here again, and may even plan a weekend trip just to hangout again in the future. The pictures don’t do it justice and the vibes are immaculate!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was absolutely lovely. It was evident this was an extension of their home. Sadly, we were only able to stay a single night. I would have loved to sit on the porch with a cup of coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening, sit and chat with Jen and Darcy and meet their puppy dogs. Parking and entry to the cottage were clear and easy. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying in Jennifer and Darcys garden cabin. Located in their gorgeous private yard, we enjoyed the quiet environment. Jennifer and Darcy were incredible thoughtful, open, and kind- they offered many recommendations for the rest of our travels!
The cabin provided a cozy bed, kitchen with all you need, and a gorgeous screened porch for relaxing.
Don’t be deterred by the outhouse bathroom. The outhouse is easy to use and clean!
We highly recommend their cabin!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Jen and Darcy were incredible hosts! We loved chatting with them and hearing their gardening tips! And the 4-legged friends were such a nice bonus. The cabin was so clean and cute and they provided delightful little amenities. 🥰 A weekend of rain was the perfect excuse to stay in the cabin all day playing games. We’re already looking forward to our next visit!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jen and Darcy's cabin was absolutely delightful. A big thunderstorm came through the night I stayed there; it was super relaxing to just sit out on their screened-in porch and listen to the storm while I read a book. Also, very cool that they provided some snacks for guests too. They are excellent communicators and give great recommendations for the area. I don't think the word ""cozy"" has ever been a more fitting definition than for this cabin. Will definitely be staying here again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely home. Lovely safe space. 💕 Thank you for having us 💕

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time staying with Jenn and Darcy! Their cabin was cute, a bit secluded, and super clean.

The hosts as well as their pets were very friendly and welcoming. We can’t wait to come back in the future!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer and Darcy were lovely and informative hosts. They gave us a tour of their garden and the vacation space. Their overview of the space and amenities was thorough. We especially appreciate their grace arriving late from our long drive. The dogs were super friendly! We would definitely return for another visit.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, close to all you want to do in Portland. Jennifer and Darcy are available with any questions you may have and will offer great suggestions."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can't say enough about this place. A unique and cozy little oasis, it's perfect for a place to touch down, or just spend some quiet time unwinding, working, etc. Jennifer and Darcy were extremely hospitable, and the process was clear and simple. Highly recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a magical place to stay, and Jen & Darcy were the best hosts!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough about our stay! From Darcy greeting us when we first arrived and telling us all the best local spots and things to do, to the cutest little space and unique little touches such as the craft beer and bagels! We found this to be a perfect location for our needs. I was able to get up and run in the morning down and around evergreen cemetery, really neat place to walk/run! I would 100% recommend this and hope to be back someday :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful wonderful wonderful!

Would highly recommend this little bundle of joy to anyone who wants to make their trip just a little better!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything about our stay was lovely and Jenn and Darcy are amazing and very communicative hosts. If an outhouse doesn’t scare you (and for what it’s worth, it’s very clean and is completely odorless), this place is so cute and very close to downtown. And it’s right next to a bunch of breweries, if that’s your vibe. I can’t recommend this place enough!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen and Darcy were hospitable hosts, friendly and helpful while also respecting our space and privacy. It was the first cold evening of the fall and the room had a heating element, hot coffee, and plenty of blankets to keep us warm. We thought the cabin and garden area were even nicer than depicted. The toilet/outhouse is not the automatic kind that you may be used to. It requires a few manual steps to operate. But if you’re open minded, all good. It was clean and well maintained. We would stay here again in the future."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, quiet, comfortable place. The bed was comfortable, garden and fire pit were beautiful, and the hosts provided bagels and coffee free of charge. Jen and Darcy are both very friendly and respond quickly if you need anything."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Jen and Darcy are amazing hosts and the cabin is just perfect. Little and cozy and impeccably organized. Having coffee on the screen porch in the morning with garden view is worth the stay alone!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A magical garden retreat just a stone’s throw from Portland’s amazing restaurants and shops.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer and Darcy were so accommodating and kind. I can tell that they genuinely enjoy sharing their wonderful property with guests.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My sweetie and I had such a lovely stay in Jennifer and Darcy's little backyard cottage. It was so quiet and cozy, both inside and out, and it made the perfect
little get-away from our Portland city adventures. We were able to check in earlier than expected and were delighted by the beautiful gardens and pathways in full bloom. So enthralled, really, that we had to rally to pull ourselves out of the hammock and back into the city in the late afternoon. Jennifer and Darcy were wonderful hosts and we hope to come back to this cozy, comfortable, and fun little shed again soon - and for more than one night!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was visiting Portland in order to take a certification exam, and had a very comfortable and relaxing stay at Jen and Darcy's place. They were kind and attentive hosts, and had some excellent recommendations for the area.

It's clear Jen and Darcy have put in the time and effort to make this stay a cozy relaxing getaway you won't forget!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer and Darcy were absolutely wonderful. Both were just a pleasure to talk to. We didn’t stay but an evening but totally enjoyed our stay. The cabin was so cute. Set in the back of the yard out looking towards their garden we didn’t feel we were in a backyard but in our own little spot. Would love to come back for a longer stay for sure. Nicely located to get around town
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was by far my best AirBnB experience. Everything about the cabin was thoughtfully put together and Darcy & Jen (and their animals) were amazing hosts. I am really glad I booked a longer stay per their listing suggestions - being able to sit by a fire in the evening and relax in the hammock, as well as walk through the gardens, was an absolute must and my favourite aspect of being in Portland. Would love to come back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely few days in Jen and Darcy’s garden cabin! They were gracious and friendly hosts and their garden and yard were gorgeous. The cabin was totally comfortable and had a bunch of thoughtful touches. It’s less than a half an hour drive to Scarborough Beaches and 15 minutes to the Old Port.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Garden Cabin experience is simply wonderful. The cabin is so cozy, it makes you want to cuddle up with a book. Or drink a morning cup of joe on the screened in porch while looking over the garden. Or if you’re like me - take a deep breath between bar exam days. It’s a peaceful haven for any person. Darcy and Jen are kind, caring, interesting, and generous. Totally respectful of your space or happy to get to know you. How it is advertised it is exactly how it is. 10/10 experience. Favorite Airbnb yet. Thank you!"

The fresh snap peas from their garden were the cherry on top :)"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen and Darcy’s garden cabin is a magical oasis tucked away in their stunning backyard in a quiet residential neighborhood. It was perfect for my solo getaway and would also be a cozy stay for two. The cabin is very well appointed and very thoughtfully designed and laid out—though it’s tiny, it really doesn’t feel it at all, and is very comfortable. It’s clear that Jen and Darcy truly love to host and care about every aspect of their guests’ stays. They made me feel warmly welcome at their home while also making the cabin feel like a private, independent space. One of the best Airbnb stays I’ve ever had—this type of hosting is what it’s all about!—and I look forward to returning and staying longer."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The cottage is really cozy and amazing. Jen and Darcy are really good hosts and will make sure to help you with any request. I am definitely staying here again.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,great little place
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cannot say enough good things about our stay. The cabin was the cutest and so cozy inside. We were slightly nervous about the rv toilet but there was absolutely nothing to worry about, it was so clean and easy to use. The gardens were magnificent, we watched so many birds on the feeders. Jen and Darcy gave the BEST recommendations for sightseeing/food in Portland. We will absolutely be back, and this time make Portland our destination instead of a passing town. We loved it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easily one of our favorite AirBNB stays to date! Jen and Darcy were so accommodating and so friendly. Their backyard garden area is a absolute oasis! You’re also conveniently located just outside downtown Portland which is easy to drive/Uber to. Highly recommend this stay — it’s the perfect fit for the true Portland, Maine experience!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jen and Darcy were wonderful, and their pets are gems. I know I echo everyone else who only stayed a night, but I wish it had be longer.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen and Darcy were wonderful hosts! The cabin is peacefully outside of town, and is a great place to be able to recharge and enjoy your vacation."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"There’s a lot to be bummed out by these days. I don’t even have to name specifics because everyone has five different ways they could fill in that blank. That’s why it’s terribly worthwhile to recognize when something is great.
Well, dear reader, Jen and Darcy are as great as it gets.
You couldn’t ask for nicer, gentler, or more attentive hosts if you wrote them in a fairy tale. I’m left in awe of their warmth and compassion. There is sincerely not a bad word I can say.
And if you’re curious about the cabin, why it’s even cuter than you’d expect. One of the few places I’ve been that fully lived up to my expectations. Very cozy and comfortable perfect for one or two people.
This review probably reads rather ridiculously. I certainly wouldn’t trust something with this many superlatives. You probably think they paid me. And I suppose in a way they did. They gave me a home in a time of great uncertainty and I can’t thank them enough."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,beautiful place & beautiful hosts❤️
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing hosts amazing place! It’s a no brainer, will 100% stay here again!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was by far one of the best airbnb experiences my husband and I have had. The tiny house was just so adorable, cozy and had everything we needed for our last night in Portland. There were so many personal touches and Jen and Darcy are just fabulous hosts. They are both very caring and kind and genuinely want their guests to have a great experience. There is a lot of care and effort showcased in the tiny house including personal touches such as the furnishings, as well as a coffee machine, toaster, snacks, PB&J, and a mini fridge which contained bagels, cream etc which saved us having to go outside for breakfast the next morning. It was a very unique experience for us both and we will really miss the house, the hosts and their adorable fur babies! If you are sitting on the fence about this, my suggestion is to definitely go for it and book several nights so you get to enjoy this cute place for a longer time."

The pups are cute and so sweet. We got to eat a couple yummy tomatoes from their garden and enjoyed local coffee with a bagel in the morning. The whole place is so cozy, we felt completely at home. Very clean. The front porch is fabulous for hanging out. Just an all around amazing stay. We also drove into Portland and it’s an easy, short drive from their place."

It’s an idyllic setting at the corner of their backyard with the lovely garden in front. It is very cozy with everything you’d need. Guests will have to use the shower inside the main house. Jen’s instructions for check in are easy to follow. The cabin is also a short drive/Uber ride to downtown Portland. We really enjoyed our stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Think glamping in a neighborhood backyard. Outhouse style toilet and indoor showers upon request.
If your still interested you'll find a cozy one room tiny house style space with screened in porch overlooking a backyard garden. There is a outdoor fire pit with chairs as well.
Reasonably quiet and protected space with privacy."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was very charming. A great stay, very peaceful and beautiful in the gardens. Jennifer and Darcy were very helpful in giving lots of recommendations."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin is easily the coziest place I've ever had the pleasure to stay in! The place is super clean, well organized, and decorated beautifully. The garden provides the perfect backdrop for a morning coffee on the porch. Jen and Darcy are super friendly, responsive, and flexible. Their two dogs are wonderful hosts as well! I would absolutely come back here the next time I'm in the area!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jen and Darcy’s cabin is a beautiful place to stay with everything you might need purposefully arranged to make great use of the small space. We really enjoyed our short stay. Jen and Darcy were accommodating, flexible and communicative and gave great suggestions for things to do in Portland. Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Garden Cabin is a lovely getaway hidden in a quiet area of Portland. Close to everything you need yet with a country feel. Jen and Darcy are wonderful hosts, and their gardens are beautiful to enjoy while having morning coffee. We can’t wait to come back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful! What a delightful way to spend our last night in Maine. Jennifer and Darcy were such a delight, so friendly, and so accommodating to us. Their dogs were cute and the back yard was stunning. It really felt like our own little (well, not even all that little) paradise. The screened in porch was also totally cute and necessary. We spend the morning drinking coffee out there.
The location was exceptional also. Very close to all the action. I would 100% recommend this to others and would stay here again if I was back in the area at any point."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the 2nd time my friend & I stayed at Darcy & Jen’s place and it was just as great as the first time! This is such a special spot and they are just lovely and friendly and helpful. We can’t wait to stay with them again next summer!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Jen and Darcy are lovely hosts! Great communication and attention to detail. This is such a cute and special spot. Like the listing says: it’s a bit of a “glamping” experience because of an outside toilet + sink and then shower in the main house (which we did not use due to our short stay)! But very clean and just what we needed for our one night stay. We wish we could have stayed longer!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer & Darcy's place was warm, inviting, comfortable and unique. We loved all of the personal touches and thought that went into the space. Would come back anytime!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place to stay! Came in late August and was greeted by such a bountiful garden of sunflowers and nasturtium. Jennifer and Darcy were very great at communicating, and the cabin was clean, peaceful, and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jen and Darcy’s garden cabin was amazing! Perfect landing spot after a long drive. They went above and beyond to make sure all our needs were met, and the cabin was super cozy and beautiful. It was so sweet to sip our coffee while gazing at the beautiful garden. Jen was very friendly and helpful! Highly recommend staying at this sweet spot :-)"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jen and Darcy’s place is truly a peaceful little oasis. We LOVED the garden the most but the entire place was just what we needed. Downtown was only a 10 minute ride and we didn’t have any issues despite the tropical storm coming in. They were very hospitable and had many great food suggestions! Thanks again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is not your average AirBnb, and that’s what makes it so special. The Garden Cabin is intimate, private, and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Jen and Darcy are AMAZING! We could’ve talked to them all night. The accommodations are so perfect. Beautiful backyard gardens, fireplace, hammock, screened porch. It was perfect. 10/10 recommend."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here. Jen and Darcy were extremely friendly and welcoming. The stay was better than expected and we can’t wait to go back.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing Airbnb! The garden cabin is the perfect size for two people, and it feels so cozy and comforting. The cabin was spotless as well, and Jen and Darcy offered every amenity you could possibly want for a relaxing weekend away. The garden itself is filled with plants and flowers, and gives the area around the cabin a ""hidden oasis"" feeling. Plus, Jen and Darcy made a fire for my partner and I to come home to after being in the city all night (plus s'mores supplies!) which was a great way to end vacation. This will my go-to spot for staying in Portland for the future, so stay here! You won't regret it for a second."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. Jennifer and Darcy are the nicest most welcoming people I’ve met on the east coast, and turned our trip around in Maine. They welcomed us with big hearts, the property was beautiful, the atmosphere was amazing and they invited us to use anything we needed for our night stay. If we knew how nice it was here, we would’ve booked our entire weekend stay here and explored nearby Portland. Can’t recommend this place enough, these people are so nice and the tiny home is a cool cozy place two stay for two or even one person. We were invited to share a fire and make s’mores, explore the garden, and have great conversation. Thank you both and if we’re ever in the area we’ll for sure let you know and try to rebook here. Take care yall! Oorahh"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jen and Darcy are wonderful and friendly people. Their tiny house doesn’t disappoint either! I had a great time staying there and lounging out back in their hammock. Would stay there again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was such a lovely experience! The cabin itself it outfitted nicely, but Jen and Darcy really go the extra mile, from the warm welcome to explaining the property to covering the smallest details and anticipating the most common questions. The garden is beautiful, the dogs are friendly, the amenities are tops. I could not have asked for a better stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jen and Darcy are excellent AirBnB hosts. Their garden cabin is the perfect size and allows guests to oversee their large garden, complete with sunflowers.
The cabin came equipped with everything you need (even coffee and a few snacks!). Everything is clean and neat and the showers are easily accessible in the house upon request.
Two cute and friendly dogs make the backyard feel like home.
Location is excellent- only a short drive into Portland, easy to reach by car or Uber.
This is a must stay place if you are looking to explore Portland, receive awesome suggestions of places to experience and meet two very welcoming and fun ladies! Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at the Garden Cabin! It was very cozy, clean and well equipped. We would definitely recommend you stay here, we wish we could have stayed longer! In addition to Jen And Darcy being wonderful, the garden was incredible!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time at Darcy and Jen’s cabin. The garden was gorgeous and in full bloom and the cabin itself felt extra special because of its personal touches. Jen and Darcy were kind and gracious hosts and made us feel at home. We would highly recommend this Airbnb and hope to return ourselves someday soon.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This Garden Cabin was a delight to land in after flights and taxi, garden lights lit my way through a grassy private space to a seriously thought out, comfortable and glamp-ing comfort. Wish I could of stayed longer. I could of stayed at a hotel, yet exploring unique spaces is far more authentic- this IS one of them. Highly recommend!!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best airbnb or vrbo I've ever done. Jen and Darcy are so sweet and welcoming and the cabin! We loved it.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a charming and magical place! Exactly as advertised and Jen and Darcy are great hosts. Lucky are the folks who stay here.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jennifer and Darcy have thought of everything. My 9 year old nature and puppy loving daughter couldn’t have been happier at the cabin. Our stay at the cabin was a highlight of our entire east coast tour.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Jennifer and Darcy are the nicest air bnb hosts we have ever stayed with! They are fabulous and their garden is beautiful!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and cozy spot and easy to get to downtown!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jen and Darcy’s little garden cabin is wonderful. A tiny little space with absolutely everything you need, set in a gorgeous private garden. Jen and Darcy are so kind and welcoming and very knowledgeable of the area. The space is tiny but their attention to detail and provision of little thoughtful things make you feel like you are at a 5 star hotel!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Jen & Darcy were great hosts! Very quick with responses and attentive to providing all the information you needed to know. The property is very lovely and all the personal touches in the cabin make for a very cozy stay :)
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and Darcy are the sweetest hosts. The cabin is very homey and quaint. They added lots of little extras like beer, snacks, and coffee. They were very quick to assist us with whatever we needed. And their pups were adorable!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jenn & Darcy's cabin is absolutely incredible. The words in any review could never convey the homliness, warmth and all-around good vibes this stay offers. The cabin itself feels so comfortable, the garden puts a smile on your face, and the care that Jenn & Darcy put into your experience is hard to beat for the money. From the snacks in the cabin, to the area recommendations, they've really put a ton of thought & care (and even more elbow grease; Darcy built a lot of the furniture in the cabin) into everything. Also being able to walk out into their garden or just sit and watch the birds fly in and out in the morning is something very special.
It's an easy 10-15 minute drive into downtown Portland and if you're from a city like us (South Philly) then you'll appreciate the lack of traffic at almost any time during the day (even ""rush hour"" is a breeze to/from this stay).
To top everything off, Darcy is a licensed Massage Therapist who has an absolute gift. The massages she gave my partner and me were absolutely amazing. She really knows how to pay attention to and take in your needs, aches, pains, and history to give you an incredibly tailored deep tissue massage that feels insanely rejuvenating and relieving.
My partner and I took advantage of their fire pit our last/3rd night there.
Finally, you'll be blessed to wake up to a rainy morning as the noise of the raindrops on the cabin roof are incredibly soothing and peaceful.
TL/DR: Don't hesitate to book this stay on your upcoming trip to portland. It has every as decribed/shown in the pictures AND THEN SOME."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The garden cabin was exactly as described with many nice touches like local beer and coffee. Convenient Portland location with friendly hosts.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fun, cute place to stay! Darcy and Jen and their dogs were so friendly."
