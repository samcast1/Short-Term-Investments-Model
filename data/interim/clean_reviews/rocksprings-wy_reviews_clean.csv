2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"There were a few things that needed attention:
1. Lawn was not mowed when we arrived and it would have been nice that it was mowed to greet us.
2.outlet in Master bath doesn’t work. I had brought extension cords so we made it work.
3. We ate several meals in and found that the most of the under the counter lights didn’t work in the kitchen.
4. There were very few washcloths so I went and bought more. We now have extra at home
5. There are several spices to cook with in the kitchen! check expiration dates before buying more.
There is a small table with 4 chairs in the dining row . They provided an extra folding table with extra chairs so we could all eat around the table together. It is in the house ready for use.
6. The ice maker was not hooked up so buy/ bring ice.

2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Place is as described, inside decorated nice, plenty of space for people inside the home, separate areas to give space, or some privacy to those who want it. LOTS OF STAIRS ! to move about anywhere in the house. Need more drinking glasses in the kitchen Outside areas not maintained at all.

2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"We would stay again.
But it would have been nice to let the kids play in the back yard.
It hasn't been mowed and the fence is broken."
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The reason for loss of stars is the backyard was not secure for our dogs. The description was that it was dog friendly, it was not disclosed that the back yard is not fenced separately from the neighbors yard and a small alley way that goes towards a park was open entirely. The home was nice and cozy. Comfortable beds and easy check in. The kitchen was only moderately clean. The only potholder available was dirty and there was a dirty keurig cup in the coffee maker and none for us to use. There were no linens in the bathrooms, we had to search for the linen closet to stock the bathroom. We were disappointed with our stay."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super nice house with lots of room. There were only three of us, plus two German shepherds, but could easily accommodate more. Restaurants and outside mall type shopping just a few blocks away. Hosts were super responsive. Home is a little close to a busy road, but there’s a fenced yard out back, which is good for the pups. When we cleaned up after our dogs, pretty sure I also cleans up after someone else’s, but since there was snow on the ground, it might have been hard to see. Overall, great stay."

Alas it was just me and my pup, who throughly enjoyed the big backyard. Ashley was gracious and forgiving when Ibooked the wrong date and showed up a day earlierthan she expected me.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great place to stay. very inviting fresh smell in the home, I know it's an abnormal feature to add, but it stood out as some places do come with a smell. rooms were very accomadating hist was always easy to reach, would reccomend. oh, and I really appreciated the boot remover strategically located in the mud room , helps an old fart out with removing the boots."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place with an extremely fantastic host. Dave is accommodating, welcoming and supportive/responsive of my random requests. I found this place last year and plan to visit/utilize this location as often as I can when I’m in Green River."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a place to stay in the Green River area, look no further. David’s lodge is fantastic!
David was a top notch host. He was a great communicator and assisted us with all of our needs in a swift and courteous manner.
The was lodge was in immaculate condition upon our arrival. It is beautifully decorated, spacious, and comfortable. It’s surrounded by picturesque views and comes equipped with all the creature comforts one could want and more. You really couldn’t ask for a move ideal lodging situation than this in Green River and beyond. 5-stars!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"David's place was just what we needed.
Quiet and close.
We would stay again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This was our stop between Denver and the Tetons. It was perfect. The river was nearby and we watched an amazing sunset. The space was great and we enjoyed the hot tub! We definitely recommend the lodge.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Excellent location! Awesome host!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and I stayed here on our cross country move. Everyone was comfortable and the hot tub was an added bonus at the end of a long day in the car.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,It was very spacious!!!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is awesome! No frills. Nothing fancy. But lots of space and a great hot tub! Very worth the price!
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Whilst we found the accommodation easy to find it is in need of freshening up and supplied with sufficient glasses & cups etc. Was quite far from town too and we were surprised by the immediate surroundings although the locals we met were friendly enough. Disappointed we couldn't use the BBQ which was in need of a major clean and the interior stairs are really quite steep. On a positive the hot tub was very welcome (although not private) and the host David was very easy to communicate with.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David was absolutely great and has a beautiful home he has opened up for sharing .
Thank you"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very comfy, cozy, and pet friendly!!! HIGHLY Recommend!!! 👍🏼"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Lodge was a wonderful stop on a long road trip. I’d definitely recommend it as the peaceful respite in a beautiful valley that it was. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again; David was proactive and attentive, offering us early check-in once he knew the place was ready."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay on the way back to Denver from Grand Teton! The hot tub was perfect; and everything was comfortable!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect place for us to land after a very long drive. There is a lush green lawn which our dog loved, and we greatly appreciated a soak in the hot tub. Thank you, Dave!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,David is a friendly host. His place is just as described
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our initial walk through when we arrived was nothing but “ooohs” and “ahhhhs”! The house clearly is capable of sleeping more than just the four of us.
The layout also included a separate room, desk, and stationary which was great for a few of us to sit down, connect to wifi, and get a little work done.
From a fully stocked kitchen, to very clean restrooms, to the common area, we all felt right at home. The clean and hot, hot tub was the icing on the cake after a long day of fishing at Flaming Gorge.
The BBQ setup worked seamlessly with our portable Traeger pellet grill. Cooking at night was enjoyable.
We brought a 24’ pontoon fishing boat which fit great in the driveway. Our Excursion fit with room right next to the boat.
We are already discussing another trip and will be booking this location.
We did not bring pets, but they are allowed. We could not tell that pets had even been inside, aside from the spare leash available in the entry way.
Bottom line. Book this!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Sweet little cabin, close to the river, great views..quiet neighborhood.."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,David was great and his place was what we needed. The location was the only drawback.

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Fun getaway for the weekend. Dave was very responsive and let us check in a little early which was great! The hot tub worked and was the perfect temp when we got there. The fireplace was a nice touch and had clear directions for use!
Quick note! We didn’t have service when we got there though so make sure you have the keypad code saved! Wi-Fi worked great once we got in, but we had to pay for Wi-Fi at a gas station down the road so we could see what the code was to get in haha"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot to stay in quite, little Green River. Warm, cozy, and welcoming. Thanks for a great (albeit short) stay!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Comfortable stay for our family and pets
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at David's place! Very cozy and we loved the hottub! It is so nice to find a place that allows the family dog to come along.
The 4th bedroom with the futon is a loft, not a totally enclosed room, but we didnt mind at all. It got a little cold upstairs but a space heater was provided so that was nice.
Two of the beds werent great ( they sloped inward) and several of us woke up the first morning with sore backs but we were able to fix that by putting the mattress on the floor and slept great!
The place is as pictured and we had a really enjoyable stay! I would definitely come back for a quick winter getaway with the family.
Thanks David!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great! Enjoyed our stay!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I’ve stayed in hundreds of airbnbs and this was one of my favorites. Greeted by such a warm and cozy vibe. The hot tub was perfect and the backyard was perfect for the pups too. Just be sure to wear a helmet in the kitchen the counters bite!!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"GREAT PLACE!! Lots of room, beds, etc. loved it."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great quite place to stay. Great communication.
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was nice and comfortable. It was a very hot day and we were greeted by a cool air conditioned home. The house is located in a rural/suburban neighborhood between Green River and Rock Springs. The neighborhood is old with a mix of homes and mobile homes, but is quiet and we felt very safe.
Downstairs there is a very well appointed kitchen with modern appliances that are in good condition. The counter tops are old but while we were there a contractor stopped by to take measurements to replace them. The washer and dryer are very nice. The living room is large with a huge screen tv and several streaming services available. The furniture is newer and comfortable.
The living room is divided into two levels with 1 step between the levels. This turned out to be a problem for us. I accidently fell into the lower lever and hurt myself. This is a problem that should be addressed. A simple railing between the levels would make the rental much safer.
The upper level has 4 bedrooms, 2 of which are air conditioned. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable and connected to a full bath.
The back yard is lovely. Well landscaped, in good condition, and private. The hot tub is a great asset.
The owner was quite attentive and took care of the two minor issues we had very quickly. He appears to be committed to making this rental as pleasant and comfortable as he can."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable stay. Clean hot tub. Good communication.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect relaxing home after spending days hiking in grand Teton and Yellowstone. Area was quiet and seemed like a close nit community. We had everything we needed and the hot tub was the cherry on top!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"David’s communication is STELLAR. On top of that, he is genuinely kind."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"perfect for 4 adults and 2 kiddos under 3.
amazing communication from owner throughout stay.

we would definitely stay here again"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice home that was dog friendly. Host was very helpful and friendly. Nice up kept backyard with a fire pit. Quiet and friendly neighborhood as well.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,One of the best air bnbs I have stayed in 10/10
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The lodge is a fun and unique place to stay. It was easy to get to from the freeway. The home was clean and David was easy to communicate with. Check-in was simple. The home was fully stocked and had everything we needed, and we enjoyed using the hot tub in the evenings."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The perfect little way-stop for our journey. Nice, quiet location and the host was super accommodating. Nice having the A/C in this home since we were visiting during a heatwave. Everything was as described, and we all had an enjoyable and memorable stay."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Check in was easy, it's located in what seemed like the middle of a trailer park, close to the freeway."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at David’s place! It was a perfect stop on our road trip. Hot tub was hot and ready when we arrived, kitchen was stocked well and beds were comfortable. We will definitely return if we find ourselves in the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was great!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My family and I stopped in to Green River on our cross country road trip. We had two cats as well and it was great that we could have them with us. The place was very spacious and it was great to break up our trip here. We slept great and were very comfortable!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a very nice stay. David was helpful and generous.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We will start with the positives. The place is very spacious, it has parking right in front of the house. The dining room is nice and seats 6 at the table. The hot tub worked. The living room has a big tv which worked and the couch’s are comfortable. Wi-Fi worked entire stay as well. There is a washer and dryer. Unfortunately there were issues with my check in I was informed 5 mins before I was due to check in at 5 pm (which is already a late check in time) that the place was not cleaned. Understandably frustrating, he did offer to refund me a partial amount which I am waiting to be cleared by Airbnb. I did not check in until over an hour after that. You can tell cleaning was rushed there was sticky stuff on the counter, the stove had a lot of dust on it. There are spots in the house with a lot of dust and build up that seem to have been missed the last several cleanings. The house needs some updating but compared to anything else in this area it is a lot nicer. The stairs are extremely steep, my one year one ended up tumbling down them. (We live in a two story house and she normally slides down on her stomach) but because they were so steep she ended up catching her foot and flipping. These stairs may be an issue for elderly or babies. I do think it should be mentioned in the description that all bedrooms are upstairs and that the stairs are not normal stairs, there very well could be people who wouldn’t be able to make it up them and should be aware if that. The rooms upstairs do have a bit of a smell to them I’m guessing it’s the carpet, it’s tolerable but it’s there. & the lights above the hot tub are broken and hanging to low. I never want to hurt anyones business but it’s not in my nature to leave things out, I believe if these issues are fixed it would be a wonderful place to stay, but after my stay I wouldn’t personally stay here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Supreme service, communication and hospitality. Definitely recommend and suited all of our family's needs. Hot tub was great!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed there for a night while hiking nearby. The cabin was nice and clean, but the laundry machines were a bit dirty. The jacuzzi was a very nice bonus. There is still some renovation going on."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay at David’s cabin! It was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Would highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is lovely. It has a nice grass area in the front and back yards. The hot tub was fun and relaxing. My husband plan in staying again in the future. Great place!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wish we had stayed longer. Plenty of place to stretch out. Great for families. Would love to bring my mom friends here for a weekend together: identified a great spot to lay out a puzzle, lay out some liquor, and get in the hot tub!!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice place! The yard was perfect for our dogs; private and enclosed. The hot tub is nice. Plenty of beds. Nice empty office for remote working!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Fun cabin in Green River that gave us a cozy home for the night. Great kitchen and cute little bedrooms with okay mattresses. Hot tub was a nice feature. Lightly curtained windows do let in a lot of light at night and early morning, so bring an eye mask if light wakes you up."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"David was a great host and was able to help us make a last minute booking. His home is clean and provided all the necessities. The home is a bit dated and rustic, and could use some improvements since there are several open face closets/attics and exposed wood. Also be aware that all the bedrooms are upstairs which was difficult for us as we had a senior family member have some trouble getting up the steep stairs. Other than that it was a great stay and a comfortable place to spend a night on our drive west."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at the lodge! the neighborhood was a little iffy but we overall the stay was very nice and is a nice rest stop between Rocky Mountain NP and Yellowstone

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this cottage. It was close to hiwsy191 for Boar’s Tusk, wild horses and road to Jackson. Check out album of Melinda’s renovation of the place to really appreciate what she’s created. My only less-than-5 star rating was the neighborhood. Shortly after arrival we heard shouting from neighbour house which worried me but we decided it was typical altercation either teen and parent. Not Melinda’s fault or under her control. Definitely would recommend this cottage."

Keep up the great job Melinda!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed at the lovely Blue Owl Cottage on our way to Colorado. it was absolutely charming! It is immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, very comfortable, and has everything you need at your fingertips.
We didn’t have an opportunity to explore the neighborhood or town because we were only there for a brief period of time. However, it was the perfect spot to relax and unwind and sleep comfortably after a long day of travel.
We did take time on our way out after our stay to explore the Flaming Gorge Recreation Area which is not far from the home and a must see if you get the opportunity.
The owner is amazing! She is very responsive, cares about your comfort and needs, and is respectful of your privacy. We would definitely stay there again if our travels lead us to that area again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were thrilled with this quaint little cottage! It felt like a home away from home.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely place, clean, comfortable, a much better experience than staying at a motel. By and large, Melinda was a responsive host.
If I were to underline minor issues, I would say:
1) More pots and pans - would make cooking much easier (and being able to cook is a big advantage over a motel).
2) Get rid of the spiders in the bedroom!"

Really liked that it had off street parking."

The home is in a neighborhood that is not a far driving distance from things you may need, like a grocery store, pharmacy, gas, and restaurants. If you are looking for a place to stay in Rock Springs, Melinda's home will not disappoint!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house was ADORABLE!! everything you could possibly need was provided… from coffee to dental floss. I honestly would move in. It was beyond comfortable and extremely homey. The only downfall was the location- the surrounding houses and neighborhood was a little run down- but nothing bad! Just not familiar with it!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My fiancé and I were passing through on our way to Colorado. Melinda’s home was the perfect overnight spot.

We will definitely stay again if we are ever back in town!

Melinda had included such nice welcoming touches as fresh flowers, a completely equipped kitchen, and easy to read WIFI information. I loved having a real bath after a long, hard drive from Denver. I only wish we had been able to stay longer. We used the fold-out sofa bed as well, which was a bit tricky to pull out, but the extra sheets and blankets were in the ottoman as the instructions told us. While I doubt we will ever be in Rock Springs again, I would definitely choose to stay here again if we were there!"

I looked at a couple other AirBNB's in Rock Springs yesterday. I wouldn't stay anywhere other than here in the future. The other 4 I looked at were terrible - seriously rough. For me, it's either Blue Owl Cottage or hotel."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The home was very well prepared for visitors and would be great for a short term or long term stay. The off street parking is convenient. The owners are very responsive to needs and communicate well. It was just what we needed for our stay. Thanks!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay at Karla’s while passing through the area. The place was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Got a great night sleep after being on the road all day. There is also a big area to hang out and relax if you are staying longer.
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,Very disappointed in the response from my host after I asked theme to hold notice down. She responded back saying that wasn’t 10pm. But later on at 2:20am it sounded like they was rearranging home furniture and I was unable to go back to sleep and need to be up at 5am. I know it was there home but i wonder what would have if it was me making noice waking theme up. So think twice before booking and read the whole ad because it’s a none refund booking but she refunded me back after I had to contact Airbnb and explain why I was canceling my booking.

As this is a basement, all the noises from above can be heard, including a small dog chasing a ball😳.
Also the process of keying in the code for the garage door, going up some wooden steps, entering a door and then going down a very steep stairway carrying luggage was a bit of a hassle.

It was thoughtful of her to have ground Starbucks coffee and 1/2 & 1/2 creamer in the kitchen ready for our use. The place was in a good neighborhood with quick access to the freeway and town. We enjoyed a nice walk in the neighborhood and felt very safe. We would definitely stay here again.

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Anna Marie's place was very clean, ready for us in time, very orderly, homey, and mostly very comfortable. We didn't really have the chance to walk the town but found a cool coffee house in an old train station. I might only comment that there were an excessive list of rules posted most everywhere in the unit. I really understand that in an older home, as well appointed as this one, a host wants people to be respectful. I just felt a bit worried that I might make a mistake and break a rule... which made for a more tense stay. I would recommend this place, understanding the above."

My only complaint was the water heater must have been turned way down and I had a luke-warm bath, so luke-warm I had a hard time melting the oil-based cleanser off my face. But that's an easy fix. I wasn't there long enough to do anything about it. Otherwise, it couldn't have been more perfect."

The owner has a list of “house rules” so make sure you read those throughly. The house is vintage 1930’s (I think) and she has decorated it with charm and comfort in mind. Comfortable beds, good TV and WiFi and quiet neighborhood. Nancy and Rick"

2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,great clean place. some silly rules---no shoes in the house (it's an Old but remodeled house with ZERO carpet) and they wanted us to wash our own dishes.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great spot to stop if you are in the Green River/Rock Springs area. We were enroute to Jackson from Colorado and this was just the right place to land for a night. The cottage is very intentional, clearly designed to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. It was easy to get to and easy to walk anywhere in the area. She is very thorough and mindful about COVID irrespective of the fact that the area itself seems a bit less cautious. We are stopping by again on our trip home. She is super communicative. Sweet sweet place. Well decorated, clean and restful. Thank you."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, cute house, loved our stay!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"what a great stay ... highly recommend, just all around excellent ... really, very well done and will stay again"
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is so cute and charming. Anna is obviously a super talented designer and she responded very quickly to us and even accommodated a date change. The beds are comfy and my kids loved the adorable purple bath tub. Great option for couples or singles or people with older kids.
We gave it 4 stars overall because ultimately it wasn't a great fit for our family. We have 2 small children and the overly restrictive rules made it very hard to relax. Yes, we read them when we booked (I get why they did it but I was not a fan of the semi-condescending ""find the silly phrase"" game to be able book) but they are slightly different in wording when you get there and maybe we are overthinking it but those difference were meaningful in practice. ""The pillows and throws are not for personal use"" is not the same thing as ""you need to put them all in a closet away when you get there."" This begs the question as to why they are out to begin with? You are not allowed to eat or drink anything anywhere except in the kitchen which is one of the most bizarre rules I have ever encountered in an AirBNB. Again the listing made it seem like a suggestion and that only the bedrooms are off limits (which is reasonable) but when you get there they are stated such that the kitchen is the only place you can eat or drink. I wanted to have a tea and watch TV in the living room but realized I couldn't. We also had a very weird exchange around COVID that rubbed me the wrong way but rest assured the home was very very clean and we didn't encounter any people during the stay. Overall not a fit for us and we will not stay here again but I think it will be great for most people."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great space. Cute, quaint, and very well done."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband stayed here while away on business. He said that the place was really nice. He recommends staying here when traveling to town.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a lovely and clean stay! The cottage is just adorable and super organized with anything you could need. Stylish touches everywhere. There was lots of space for a family of 3 and the bed was comfortable. Anna was quick to respond to messages. Would definitely recommend!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding Host. Great communication. Warm and friendly home. Quiet neighborhood easy access to everything.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anna Marie was very flexible with us for booking and my mom loved her stay. Would would definitely stay again - such cute decor. A charming older home that was restored with a little love and TLC.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place! Super nice and clean, and convenient for anyone traveling through."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Green Cottage is an incredibly charming place to stay. Every detail and appointment was well thought out, and you are sure to sleep well. Morning tea at the kitchen nook is a treat, reminiscent of a visit to your grandmother’s house with a bit of hip! You’ll love it!"
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is exactly as described in the ad. It was very clean and very-centrally located to Rock springs's commercial centers. Anne Marie was easy to deal with, and the made sure everything was in order for a smooth check-in process. I stayed at the property for three nights, and it was spacious and left you with peace-of-mind in terms of avoiding other people in this era of Covid-19. The bed was comfortable, and Anna Maria even provided towels, paper towels and some other touches that no all air bnb's provide. The only minor issue I had is it was tricky to control the thermostat setting, to make sure the air at night was neither too cold nor too warm. But that would probably be the case at any property in Wyoming in December, so I highly recommend this location."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely stopover we had. The house was much bigger than I expected. Lots of natural light throughout. Anna was very responsive to any questions we had. The hosts were thoughtful and cleaned the snow during our stay. We were able to relax and recover for our long drive. Wi-fi worked great so I was able to work during our stay. I didn't have a chance to explore the town, but there is a nice welcome station set up with all the information you would need to go explore."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a great stay! Anna was very friendly and responsive, would 10/10 recommend!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Green Cottage was the perfect stop for a warm night’s sleep on a long road trip. We loved the cozy beds, heated bathroom floor, and stylish decor. Anna Marie was very responsive and happy to answer any questions. Check-in was easy, and the cottage was very clean. We’ll definitely come back if we pass through Rock Springs again!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anna Marie’s place was super cute and very festive. The Thoughtful touches were super great and we certainly enjoyed our stay!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house is gorgeous and so comfortable and Anna is an amazing host!

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Green Cottage is a lovely place to stay! So many thoughtful touches -- especially the ""Welcome Note"" made me feel at home. EXTREMELY comfortable bed made for a good night's sleep on a long road trip. Everything is so neat and tidy and the decor is absolutely charming. Highly recommended!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My favorite place to stay in Sweetwater County, by far. And just a couple blocks from historic downtown Rock Springs. Anna Marie is a great host."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute space, comfy furnishings. Loved the purple bathtub!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped for one night at the Green Cottage while on a coast-to-coast drive to escape the smoke and fires of Northern California and see family and friends back East whom we hadn’t seen since the beginning of the pandemic — and it was exactly the cozy, calm, and comfortable respite we needed it to be. Anna Marie’s attention to detail is impeccable, from the abundant seasonal decorations to the unusually high quality of the linens, towels, and other materials around the house. Oh, and plentiful, beautiful wooden toys for our four-year-old to play with. Everything about our stay was wonderful, and honestly I think we’d consider stopping in Rock Springs again just to stay here. Very highly recommended."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was extremely clean (very important to us during Covid), stylish and cozy."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Green Cottage is a very comfortable and special place to stay in while visiting Rock Springs. The beds were very comfortable and everything was sparkling clean. We cooked dinner every night in the large kitchen and watched movies in the cozy living room. Perfect.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"In this house you will find style and distinction. All tidy and clean, the beds super comfy, the spaciousness in its areas are specially designed for comfort.
And in the details of the house you will find history, if you are an observer you will discover each of those details.
Very central that you can walk downtown and visit its historic church.
Highly recommended stay.
Thank you Anna"

2020-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Beds are comfortable. Host is very picky about who stays here so beware of rules, which is fine, just know what you’re signing up for."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I visited The Green Cottage on my way to Colorado. I was hoping to find a place to stay for the night which was clean and comfortable, and would make traveling safer in the time of COVID. What I found was so much more!
Anne was a friendly and responsive host, giving me all the info I needed for my stay. The house was beautiful and a wonderful respite from my travels. The place was super clean and full of beautiful, personal touches. I would hope to stay here again, and have more time to explore the Rock Springs area. Highly recommended for anyone passing through or stopping to enjoy WY!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anna’s place is very well appointed. Sparkling clean. Very good communications.
She is very selective of renters and very understandably so.
Walking distance to historical downtown."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Traveling for 12 hours plus, my stay at the cottage was a great one. The home is beautiful and super clean. I would love to take the interior back to Chicago with me. Everything was labeled out perfectly and I never had to question where things were. The stain glass is an extra plus that I enjoy. Great stay!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Best place we have stayed. So many fine touches. So clean and a great host. Would highly recommend staying there...
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Green House was charming and cozy — perhaps the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in! Ann Marie was communicative and left thoughtful touches like toys and sidewalk chalk for our kiddos. Her home was sparkling clean and was the perfect stopover on our way from the Colorado Rockies to the Wyoming Tetons.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute cottage. Very well decorated. Didn’t use the twin beds but they seemed extremely comfortable. King bed was very comfy.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great location right next to the world’s cutest downtown. This place is flawless, adorable, cozy and safe! You will love it ❤️"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The little green cottage is such a relaxing, beautiful space. It feels classic but with updated amenities. So much space and sunlight. Anna Marie is super communicative and cares about the integrity of the home but also your enjoyment. I would definitely book a stay here again :)"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay on our trip east. Very comfortable house and exactly what we needed after a day on the road. Plenty of hot water in the shower, the beds were comfortable. The police had everything we needed and ample space to spread out. I recommend it to future travelers. I would stay there again"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely recommend staying here in Rock Springs. Clean, spacious place with a nice outdoor area. Located a quick walk from downtown."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anna Marie is a great and thoughtful host. I felt at home when I walked in the door. Great location. Great place.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was arguably the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. We were only here for one night, on our way home to Denver from a long road trip visiting family in Oregon. This felt like a high end boutique hotel in place like Portland, OR or somewhere. For one, it was the cleanest place I've ever been in, hands down. In the era of COVID-19, this was very reassuring. It felt like we were walking into someplace that had never been stayed in before. Even the toilet bowl felt brand new. For a one hundred year old cottage to feel this sparkling clean is truly a feat. I will also note how thoughtfully designed the whole place is. Every room, every corner has such a stylish and thoughtful touch to it. You could spend an hour or two just wandering through the home and admiring each unique aspect to Anna's decorating style. We loved the toys and books for the kids. The beds and bedding were extremely comfortable. The whole house was very easy to navigate thanks to all of Anna's notes. It's also just a great house and great space. I would've loved to live in this house in another life. While we didn't explore much of Rock Springs, this house is in a great spot to wander two blocks into the main downtown district. I wish we could've spent a longer time here and enjoyed a cup of wine on the front porch and watched the sun go down over the mountains. Not sure we'll ever make it back to Rock Springs, but if we do, we will definitely try to stay here."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Anna’s place was great. Very cute decor. The beds were very comfortable!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Anna and Jerod were great hosts. Their place was sparkling clean and the bed was especially comfy. We appreciate all the care they have taken with this property. They made staying here very easy with everything labeled--which takes the guessing game out of finding what you need. We would certainly stay there again.
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Really cute house, but beware of the beds—we found them uncomfortable."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sweet spot with lots of nice touches! Comfy after a long day traveling.
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Anna’s place was very stylish with great touches! It’s probably the best in town. We did find all the rules a bit extreme. It was uncomfortable having all the “do nots” written all over the house. Hoping over time this will change. It’s obvious they are new to hosting. Giving 4 stars only bc of how uncomfortable it made us. Other than that it was a great place to stay as we were passing through town.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were honored to be among the first guests! We needed a place to crash with grandma and the kids on our way from CA to CO. Anna decorates so beautifully, it felt like a boutique hotel. I wanted to stay somewhere clean because of Covid, and having chatted with Anna, I trust her to keep things wiped down between guests. We slept well on the comfy beds and beautiful environment. Very restful and refreshing. You can tell she poured her heart into it."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we have stayed at Gisela's place while in town for work, so this will be my second 5 star review for it. Definitely one we look for when we know we are going to Rock Springs! Clean and comfy beds. Great place."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars! Great place to stay , had no issues at all. Internet was fast. We enjoyed our stay would stay here again next time I’m in rock springs."
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall it was a nice place to stay, but... The dishwasher did not work. We tried to run dishes and the dishwasher leaked. When I told the host, she said the dishwasher had a sign on it saying”Do not use.” It did not. Even if it had, we should have been notified the dishwasher didn’t work. There were no hand towels in the bathrooms. There was broken glass on the back steps and the ground around them. The back yard does not have grass. The beds and bedrooms were comfortable and clean. The living room was a nice space to chat or watch tv. The host was amazing and responsive. She put a fan in the bedroom, at my request, so I could sleep peacefully. It could be a great place to stay, it just needs some attention."

Debra's communication was especially helpful; she replied quickly to questions. If we're ever in the area again, we'd happily stay here.
We were part of a group of friends that was running the marathon in Green River. If you're staying here, check out the Wild Horse Loop that leaves from Green River. It's a nice drive, and you'll probably see wild horses!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent option to stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It would be great if the back windows could be changed to double pane as it would help reduce the noise from the highway traffic. However, even though it was quite noisy, Beth had thoughtfully provided earplugs in every room, which made the stay enjoyable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"the place was very nice. it looked like the photos and had everything we needed. the beds and pillows were far better than most places I have stayed.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were looking for a place to stay on our way to Rocky Mountains and this home was perfect for our family of 4. All the bedrooms are big with comfy bedding and cute decor. The couch is huge and the kitchen is a good size. It’s in a convenient location with grocery and restaurants near by. Old Chicago was great for dinner. The highway noise was noticeable but the host provides ear plugs and we slept with white noise, so it didn’t bother us. We wish we had more time to enjoy the house, but it was a quick stop between states. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beth was excellent to deal with and the house was spotless. We were very pleased with the cleanliness and livability of the house for our stay. Plenty of movies on the tv and the wall scrabble was a hit as well! We were a little concerned about the road noise when we got there but it didn’t bother us at all, in fact it was quite soothing!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Don’t get a hotel…. Stay here you’ll thank me! Beth was an amazing host. She contacted prior to arriving with all the instructions. When we arrive at the house it was spotless. I could tell it had just been cleaned. The house had tons of space and looked exactly how the photos were. Beth had taken the time to make an awesome house book with instructions on everything from the thermostat to the TV remote along with local spots to check out and restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This was 10 times better than a hotel and cheaper. If you’re looking to staying in Rock, Springs, don’t look any further."

It is also a beautiful little very updated townhouse with cute decorations and it looks exactly like the pictures. It literally felt like home, very warm, comfortable, and cozy with all the amenities we would need. Beth was an excellent host. She was very friendly and helpful in her messages and reached out with information at all the right times. We will definitely be coming back in the future and staying again. Even with the noise you can hear from the highway, this place is still a 12/10!! It is a hidden gem. ❤️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Beth was quick to respond. She had the townhome so well kept that it made my time Rock Springs very pleasant and enjoyable. She was always very quick to respond and helpful when it was needed. Thanks again Beth!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location overlooks I-80, so there was constant road noise all night. It was a very warm day, and the house was hot upstairs. There were no fans to move the air. The interior of house was spacious with plenty of room to work in the kitchen."

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,We had a great stay. Place was practically all brand new. We will stay here again if there is an opening.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beth’s place had everything we needed in Rock Springs, while you can see I80 out the window, the highway noise wasn’t a problem at all. There were fresh amenities in the bathrooms, a few kcup pods (caffeinated and decaf!) snacks, dishwashing detergent, plenty of movies available through the large smart tv. The couch in the living room was amazingly comfortable, and the wall scrabble with a welcome message was a great personal touch.
The garage access was perfect for keeping our cars free from snow, and it was extremely convenient to enter/exit with the garage door remote.
Beth was incredibly responsive and supportive, I’d mailed a box of contacts ahead to the address, and when the mail didn’t go where I was expecting she contacted the post office to locate the contacts, and when they weren’t delivered on time she mailed them to my home address. Truly above and beyond host support.
I would encourage anyone remotely near Rock Springs to book this Airbnb, you will have a great stay."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a pristine place to stay. I’m in my seventies and the only problem was not having a railing to get to the doors. But I was able to manage, so I just think I should’ve been thinking about the steps before agreeing. However, it is a lovely place to stay and having 3 bedrooms was wonderful. And Beth was very helpful."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Londa had one of the most clean and comforting places I have stayed in since I started using airbnb. I was an extended stay and if there was any issues no matter how small Londa always went above and beyond to make them right.

My sister and I stayed for two weeks and have no complaints. We were surprised to find there are many things to do in Rock Springs, Wyoming. The scenery is beautiful and the people are so friendly and kind. If you don’t mind driving a little bit, this is the perfect place to visit Yellowstone, Utah, Montana, Idaho (all within driving distance). What a beautiful country we have!!!

I also appreciated the dog blanket spread, even though I brought my own, it was nice for extra coverage! Parking right by entry steps was very convenient, too."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Such a cute home and a great place to rest on our long drive with our dogs. The home is tucked off the street behind another home so was slightly challenging to find in the dark but Vanessa provided excellent instructions and was very responsive. We especially appreciated the blanket for our little dogs to use.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely one of the better AirBnBs in Rock Springs. Clean, great beds, comfortable living room. Easily the biggest kitchen in anywhere I’ve stayed in town. Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place was clean and roomy. Big kitchen which is what I like. The beds were a little hard for my liking. Other than that it is a nice place and comfortable.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a great place. Pretty quiet which is why I picked it. Not too close to the I80. Would stay again.
,,,Came out to work and stayed at this Airbnb. Everything was nice except for no shampoo or soap in the shower. Also I’m pretty sure the host was using cameras to spy on us. We didn’t smoke inside the home but somehow said it smelled like smoke. Sounds like an excuse for spying on the back porch camera. Won’t be staying here again due to privacy/safety concerns. I’ve stayed at a lot of airbnbs uuuover 8 years time and have never received any complaints as we are very respectful of people’s homes.
,,,"We left an hour after checking in because there was a headache-inducing deodorizer smell throughout the house, presumably to cover up other odors. The place also triggered my partner's allergies due to pet dander. Also, as others mentioned the stairs are problematic, especially for folks with disabilities. And it wasn't clear to us in the listing that all the bedrooms were upstairs."
,,,House has numerous tripping hazards from the driveway to the entrance to the home. Hazards tripping to the exit of the home unlevel steps. Back yard was terrible from broken furniture to not clean a very messy back yard. Definitely wouldnt want to bring my guest there to visit. Dish washer was broken no remotes to the tvs. Home Definitely need improvements writing on the walls to wore furniture. Lots of expired food left in pantry. Charcoal left un clean in bbq pit very bad visit at this home would not recommend staying here unless tripping hazards and home is upgraded. Only thing thats a rare find as described is its not up to airbnb standards.
