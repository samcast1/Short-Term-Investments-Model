2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Indy's First Container home is AMAZING!!! The house is clean, cheerful, and has great decor! We will definitely be back!
James was flexible on check in which was very kind as we had multiple arrival times into Indianapolis.
Thank you so much for being the perfect host with such a fun house!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Incredible home! Great location. The hosts were awesome.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was pristine! The beds were extremely comfortable with TVS in all the bedrooms as well as private patios! The listing had all the amenities to accommodate my large family, from excess toiletries, to the kitchen supplies, washer and dryer, and even home security, those features really made my family feel safe and comfortable! The host was very accommodating and flexible with quick responses and helpful local recommendations. The stay was beyond our expectations! My family will absolutely be staying again! We really had such a wonderful time in a beautiful place, it really made our experience worth it! The only thing I could really say was the limited patio furniture. There were so many patios with an awesome view, just no where to relax on. It seemed like the host was in the process of adding those additions. Seriously, regardless of patio furniture, I'd absolutely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family has a great time! James is a phenomenal host and the place is really unique.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best Airbnbs in Indy! The pictures are great but it’s so much nicer in person. The house is very unique , welcoming , clean and has lots of space ! There wasn’t a thing out of place, the furniture was clean and well kept even the WiFi info was ready and available! Our host went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met and was very accommodating and easy to work with. Communication was on point and he even gave us recommendations for restaurants and things to do near by. I give this stay a 5/5 star review and I’m already looking to book again !"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great experience in a unique home. The host communicated well and provided extremely useful information for our stay. The entire house was clean and in excellent condition with lots of personal products to help make our stay more comfortable. We found having a garage very helpful for our stay. The location was great for activities in the city. While we had no issues, we thought guests who are not fully mobile might have difficulty accessing the third floor bedroom."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,James was an absolute delight of a host. He was not only incredibly kind and communicative he truly went above and beyond to ensure a positive experience for our time at his home. Everything was so neat and organized and you can tell the space was so intentionally put together. I am beyond grateful for such an incredible host and can’t wait to stay at another of James’ properties!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning spot, I’ve been obsessed with shipping container houses online and getting to stay in one this gorgeous was a dream. We will definitely be back."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Would definitely rent it again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The ""box house"" (as our 2 yr old grandson called it!) was even cooler than we could imagine! It felt very spacious - especially considering it was made of shipping containers! Our family of 8 had plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable. The upper deck was the perfect spot for viewing the solar eclipse!
James went above and beyond with acquiring items for the grandkids - our grandson was so excited to see the box with train tracks and cars! We so appreciated the baby gates for the stairs!
We also appreciated the 3 car garage, well stocked coffee supplies and basket of snacks to welcome us.
We had a great time exploring Indy but it was nice to come back and relax at the box house!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"first time in Indy and staying here was part of a great experience. comfortable, clean, easy communication."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing property!!! Thanks so much for an incredible stay. Great host.
Great communicator! Pleasure staying."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! We were travelling as a family of 4 with two kids under 5 years. From booking to check out the communication with the host was great with loads of tips what to do and where to eat and with plenty of kids activities.
The house is very spacious, very clean and very comfortable. Thanks James for all your help, we had a wonderful stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"The shipping house was all we hoped it would be. We really enjoyed your home and appreciate all the amenities you had in the home to make our stay more comfortable. The house is adorable and cozy. Everything from the coffee readily available, to the bathroom essentials, and cozy blankets, games, and records! We really enjoyed our stay. Excellent communication with the owners, very responsive and always a step ahead! We will definitely save this location for our yearly trips to Indy! Thanks again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Very beautiful home with private balconies with almost every room. Not the kind of neighborhood you’d want to take a walk in however. The provided garage did make us feel more comfortable there though. Thanks James!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique home with everything we needed and more. Host provided all needed information and made the stay very simple.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a unique and exquisite place! Lots of room to gather together and also plenty of places to curl up with a book. Only a few minutes walk to Mass Ave and the NE Quadrant. I highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"James was a great host. There were very clear directions on getting into the house and some of the amenities of the house. Also there was a tremendous amount of recommendations on food and activities. The house was gorgeous. The three floors worth of decks were great. Four floors worth of TVs in all the major rooms. Tons of space, multiple living areas. The master bedroom “birds nest” at the top of the winding staircase makes you feel like a rockstar. Definitely will come back. Thank you, James, for making our short stay in Indy a memorable one."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The photos do a great job of selling the property, but once you get in, there are so many other really neat amenities as well. This is one of the coolest and nicest airbnbs we’ve stayed in, and we travel a lot for work. They were responsive, communicated quickly, and have such a gem of a house. I can’t wait to stay again. You won’t be disappointed. In fact, you’ll probably be even more excited once you get inside."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The container home was a great vibe! It’s pretty cool and interesting what people can do with different materials to build homes. This was our 1st time in a container home and it’s a must! Anyone going to Indy should definitely check out this container home.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cool spot in an up and coming neighborhood. Close to a lot of thoughtful food and booze spots. It was a central location near highways, but far enough away to feel tucked away in a secluded neighborhood. The house was fantastic."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Impeccable! This home was beautiful, functional, and interesting. My first stay in a shipping container home and it’s one I’ve already told dozens of people about. We will be back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Unique house. Great place to stay and we would return again. Appreciated how well the place was stocked. Great host with fast response to questions.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed staying in James beautiful home! It was very nice to be able to use the garage to stay out of the cold. The house was immaculate and we would love to stay there again. Host was very responsive and very helpful!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone in our group thought the house was spectacular. Modern, unique, spacious, clean and just as described. We did some cooking and the kitchen was reasonably well equipped. The multi-car garage with door remotes was a nice bonus. The neighborhood is in transition, but well on its way and was not a negative for us - and the central location is nice. James was a fine host - proactive and responsive. Would certainly stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a fun and fantastic house to stay at! Our group of 8 adults all enjoyed staying here. Highly recommend this rental to anyone considering it.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our favorite Airbnb in Indy!!! such a fun and unique home!! We will be back!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My family came to stay at this awesome container home in Indy for New Years and a football game. What a good time we had. Lovely home, and so comfortable, blankets everywhere, very comfy beds, and not to mention a great attentive host. I hope we get to come back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a real stunner of a place. Very stylish and comfortable. There is lots of room and great for a larger group. My family was there a few days for a visit and loved it.
Many comment on the neighborhood - while it is a bit transitional, never felt unsafe and there are lots of great amenities (hello Provider Coffee 3 blocks away and on the Monon Trail) and downtown is super close.
The kitchen was very cool and we appreciated the treats left for snacking and the half and half for coffee. TVs are plentiful and cozy couches and chairs in the common areas.
Downsides - sound travels a lot. If you are in the basement we can probably hear you upstairs. In the master bedroom at the top of the spiral stairs, it has no door or anything, so you can hear everything downstairs and vice versa.
There were some small issues for maintenance (like the garage lock being loose, etc.) but I mentioned them to James and they will resolve.
Definitely worth the stay!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,James was a great host. He was very proactive in check in instructions and very helpful with things to do in the area. He also made sure we knew check out procedures prior to our departure. The house was great! Our 4 boys all found their spaces at all felt quite at home for the few days we were in Indy. This was a great first time Airbnb experience for us!
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Had a great time at the house! Clean and fun space
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,house is unbelievable. i would love to had enjoyed this in the summer. the neighborhood around the house is being developed which distracted me a little but overall the house is gorgeous.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay, it was close to everything. Highly recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Spent 3 nights at Indy's first Container house with my son and 4 of his senior classmates for the National Catholic Youth Conference at Lucas Oil Stadium. The boys thought they were pretty high rollers staying in this super cool AirBnB. Loads of space to spread out, comfortable beds, TVs galore, and the ability to make a quick breakfast before we headed out for the day...made for a great stay. The only thing I would add to the kitchen is a toaster. Other than that, everything was well stocked! Great suggestions for restaurants and a easy drive downtown. Would totally stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Unique home
A must see & stay"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was great. It was just like it was described. The area it’s in is a little sus. But the house was great and we felt safe. Would definitely book this place again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Literally the best Airbnb experience I had yet! Looks exactly as describe but much more space than we expected very creative my family and I will definitely recommend and book again great host!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an AMAZING time. The house is very cool and exceeded expectations. It has everything you need. Plenty of room for our group of seven. The decor is beautiful, and we loved the kitchen and porches. There are a few little places in walking distance but we also took an easy Lyft to other neighborhoods and Lucas Oil. We felt safe in the neighborhood and appreciated the use of the garage. Also appreciated not having a long list of chores at checkout :) Very friendly, communicative, and accommodating host! We would love to stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The container house is great! We had a group of 4 in for work and were all extremely comfortable. We each had our own room and had 3 full baths which was incredible for an AirBnB. The 3 car garage accommodated all of our vehicles and was perfect as we only drove one around in the evening. There’s a great pizza place not even a block from the house we really enjoyed! Bring some wine and snacks to enjoy the deck outside!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was super cute and as pictured as well as extremely clean. The host was very responsive and accommodating. He provided very clear directions about checkin, nuances about the house and recommendations for things nearby. We didn’t have an opportunity to explore the neighborhood but it looked like there were many cute places within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I booked this for my husband’s surprise 40th birthday party and this place didn’t disappoint. James was a fantastic host and very helpful. The place is awesome and close to everything. Walking distance to West Fork Whiskey company and a brewery and pizza place. Overall we absolutely loved our stay and would definitely recommend and rebook here.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a fantastic stay — we were blown away by the house and also the amenities! James was super responsive and flexible which was awesome.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"My wedding party and I stayed here for the days leading up to and the night of our wedding and we were blown away every day. Everyone that came by or worked with us was so impressed and it was such a cool experience. The beds and pillows were raved about by everyone and I’ve never stayed anywhere so full of helpful things, besides the fact that James provided our favorite snacks and he didn’t even know, and what I think was a wedding surprise!
James was so helpful with my questions and worked with us to make sure we would have all the time we needed. So flexible in such a stressful time!
We will certainly be referring everyone here and can’t wait to stay again.
Thanks James!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly cool space! Modern, in a great neighborhood, spacious and super unique. The host was very accommodating and helpful throughout the process. Everything went wonderfully well and we hope to visit again soon."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice. Beautiful home. I would stay here again. My children loved it. The board games in the house added to the fun. Perfect place to stay for any length of time.

James was an efficiently responsive and very helpful host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,James was a great host I have to start with him because we had a great experience with him before we even saw the place. I had my brother in town celebrating his birthday and a few outside family as well. I needed a place to host them since I live in a small studio and let me just say James’ place Wow! Definitely a great experience staying in Indy’s first container home. Everything from the set up to the amenities and location was 10/10. Definitely would stay here again in the future!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We absolutely loved our stay! The house itself was incredible. We loved the decorations and attention to detail! Location was close to town and walkable to a local brewery and whiskey distillery! We would definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at this container home! It was thoughtfully designed and had higher ceilings than we thought. The amount of space was perfect for our group, and our family in particular really enjoyed the basement area. It felt like it's own space entirely. James was extremely quick to respond to anything we had a question about and very generous with flexible check-in and check-out times. We would not hesitate to book again! Thank you for a great stay!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cool place. The design is so interesting yet cozy and comfortable. Tons of space, beautiful light, easy parking and check-in. Great communication from the host. We'll be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house has an enormous ""wow factor!"" The pictures can only go so far in how cool the place is when you actually get there. And I have to specifically mention how responsive the host was - well above average! We really enjoyed our stay. The highest recommendation that I can ever give is that I would stay there again (because I am picky). 😊"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was absolutely beautiful, it looks just like the pictures. James was an excellent host. Anything we needed he always responded in a timely manner. I strongly recommend this rental."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This shipping container home did not disappoint. It was a super, cool experience for our family!! With 4 levels of aesthetically pleasing decor and plenty of spaces to curl up and read a book, or for the family to gather and play a game, none of us wanted to leave. Very spacious. Comfortable. Peaceful. Host was AMAZING! 5 stars all day!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at Indy's first container home which is so beautifully furnished and decorated! It's unique, spacious, and clean. The furniture is very comfortable, especially the mattresses. The house is well stocked with everything a guest could need, and having a garage to park in is a huge plus! The neighborhood is safe, quiet, and close to downtown Indianapolis. James is very friendly and helpful. We appreciate how he provided detailed information about getting into the the home, parking, amenities, safety, and food options in the area before check-in. The container home was the perfect place for us to stay, and we would love to stay there again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you ever get a chance to stay here please DO NOT hesitate. James over communicates and goes out of his way to make you feel at home. I will only stay here when I’m in town.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice apartment for family and friends get together, peaceful environment will definitely return when am in Indys"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space was great for our team to gather and build our vision. There were multiple work spaces and many other perks! Thank you for a lovely home!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The container home was the most perfect spot for my team’s inaugural planning meeting. The entire space is so open, traffic flows in a perfect way, and starting our days off with morning yoga on the rooftop patio was incredible. We were close to some amazing local food options, but also far away enough from everything so that we could focus on what we came together for. The kitchen and dining area served as our main meeting space, and the Bluetooth speaker was perfect for our dance breaks."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exceptionally cool place to stay! No doubt

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great we had a little internet outage in the area and they walked me through fixing it. Don’t really like the landscape around the house bunch of “different” people next door staring but other than that the house is BEAUTIFUL ! Would def get again if need be. Thanks guys
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place to stay no doubt-

The decor was STUNNING! Everything was perfect and clean! Every detail was thought of and was provided to make us feel right at home. It was SO clean and comfortable. It was spacious, well equipped in every way. We really loved walking around and looking at how cute everything was decorated! I’ve never seen a container home before let alone stayed in one. This was hands down MY FAVORITE Airbnb that I’ve ever rented. James was so incredibly kind and helpful and we felt really comfortable there. Thank you sooo much for this cool place. We will DEFINITELY be coming back and will recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a place!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As always...great stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Outstanding
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, clean and quiet place 👍"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was really affordable place in Indianapolis!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked last minute and it took just a moment to receive the code for check in, but I called Angel and she picked up after the first ring. Instructions were sent shortly after. The home, while older, is clean and overall in good condition. There was only one other guest during my stay and no issues there. The bare bones room furniture (nothing but a night stand), older style home, and hostel style approach might not be for everyone. However, with the exorbitant cost of hotels, Angels place represents a good value for those that literally just need a clean place to sleep for a night. Therefore, it gets five stars from me. Thankful for places like this that can provide the basics and still be affordable."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place.
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would recommend to someone who isn't working nights or a night owl that sleeps during the day. neighbors tended to not really keep quiet and even when it came to cleaning, it was kind of disturbing. but again this is from someone who works nights"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It was a good location, but more guest in space then excepted. Someone also stole a energy drink of mine out of the fridge. Parking was less then ideal."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Angel is such a angel ❤️.I stayed in angel houses for a week and it worth it
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was 5 stars...

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Angel was very responsive and respectful during our stay. I really appreciated the instant feedback and support when we had trouble. Thank you so much for the room
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the pleasure of staying at this Airbnb, and I was immediately impressed by its location in a stunning area. The surrounding zone was simply breathtaking, and being close to the highways made it incredibly convenient for exploring nearby attractions. The house itself was a delightful surprise, as it was impeccably clean and provided ample space for me to feel comfortable and at ease. One thing that truly stood out was the thoughtful gesture of having some food available for new guests upon arrival. It was a wonderful touch that made settling in even more enjoyable and convenient. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this Airbnb. The combination of the beautiful location, the clean and spacious house, and the welcoming gesture of the food spread made for a fantastic experience. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a memorable and comfortable stay."
2023-05-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place was not comfortable. no lamp on the night stand. the bed sheets and quilt were not washed, very musty. 3 rooms, 1 bathroom. that's up to 6 people...1 bathroom. the place had a weird old smell. no bathroom mat. towels for guests to use had a musty smell. just a very musty place in general. the guy who takes care of the grounds was really weird and around way more often than I felt comfortable with. he scared me twice. he was also loud with whatever he was doing. speaking of noise, the place is VERY cracky and creaking. it's old, but like, you could hear EVERYTHING. not very quiet at all. they need some kind of floor mats to dampen the wood cracking when you walk. couldn't make any moves without being ridiculously loud. the screen door needs fixing because it slams. just get it fixed! no complimentary coffee. I've stayed in some really nice airbnbs for way cheaper. this was the bare minimum."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"These reviews are always difficult... So I'll start by saying I slept comfortably. I always choose the least expensive option, but some issues are so simple and really inexpensive to correct. I read the reviews, they are glowing, so either I'm wayyyyy too fussy, and I left 5 stars, but I'll leave my reflections here. The street address is practically invisible because there's a bright lamp on the porch, behind the large address placard planted in the grass. I had to count the houses on gooogle maps to be sure I was at the correct house. Listing says not to let screen (glass) door slam. practically impossible as the hydraulic cylinder yanks it shut, and trying to squeeze into the doorway, I clunked my head on the outdoor wall lamp. So my head butts, screen door slams, and a little scrubbing (cleaning) on the inside wood door... I had to raise the thermostat to stop cold air from blowing. No luggage platform, no bedtable lamp. Simple improvements, and I would look forward to return"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good stay, very comfortable room and with self check in makes things a lot easier. Room was very basic no tv or anything which is fine. I would definitely stay again."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was amazing. Thank you so much
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Angel was a great host. Communication was good, directions were easy to follow and she seems very nice. The pictures were accurate. The house was clean and comfortable, more than adequate for my one night stay while traveling. Andrew (who is staying downstairs) was pleasant to talk to. The only thing i noticed was that the walls between bedrooms were poor sound barriers. (I heard every sound from the person in the room next to me), but I guess that's a risk you take when staying in a shared house. Thanks for a great stay Angel! I hope to stay with you again the next i come through!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location and stay.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Positive points: easy keyless check-in, nice location, private parking, good communication with the host.
Negative points: bathroom and kitchen lack proper cleaning, house is shared w/ other guests (there were people speaking very loud at 2am and 7am), room consists in a bedside table and a bed only.
Overall, we had a good stay for one night."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place, great price, super nice people"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy place
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was nice but other people was living there with us & food came up missing now they want us to pay $26.00 witch I feel ain’t right because we ain’t eat nothing there or take nothing there
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great value, comfortable bed. Thank you for hosting us!"
2020-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Bathroom and kitchen are dirty and look like they haven’t had more than a quick tidy in a month. The tub is really stained (as a previous review said). I don’t mind stains, I do mind soap scum and grunge that has been collecting for well over two weeks. I picked up one (of 7 bottles of shampoo) and it had that that thick orange slime. I ended up not taking a shower. It was kind of gross. The bottom of the toilet (visible from shower area when looked over) had so much body hair stuck with urine on it. All around the floor baseboard was body hair, dirt and grunge. It looked like the bath got a squirt of windex on the mirror, a quick wipe of the sink and toilet lid then a sweep down the middle of any. Urine on the toilet under the sitting part. This was not a few days worth of use. It had t been cleaned in a while. Kitchen was same. Dirty floors, grease build up all over the stove. Living room and bedroom were sparsely furnished and looked swept. Nice hosts who contacted me when I had a question. I hope they look at my review (and the other complaint about dirty bathroom) and rethink how they operate. Hire a cleaner to do deep cleaning twice a month if needed. But if your running an Airbnb, then at the least it should be clean in the bathroom and kitchen."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a great stay!
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good place for an overnight stay. Bed was comfortable. It was a good value for the cost of the night.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angel’s place is clean, quiet and as-advertised. I really enjoyed my stay and knew that at the end of my long days, Angel’s Air BnB would be a relaxing place to unwind. Would recommend!"

2020-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Check in was very quick, and easy. The location is great. The room was very quiet even with other tenants there.
The bad: the room was hot. No ceiling fan or a table fan to cool me off. I was laying in bed sweating. I asked if there are any fans available but did not get a reply for 24 hours. There were 2 windows and 1 window did not have a curtain so the room was bright, though that is not a big issue.
After 24 hours, I got a message stating they turned on the AC, but since i cant sleep in a hot environment i had decided to leave only after arriving a couple of hours earlier"
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good spot to stay if you're in Indianapolis for a few nights
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So helpful and kind!

2020-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,For the price is ok I recommend to charge more money to provide some paper towels in bathroom and other stuff
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ve stayed here for several years and plan on returning. Great place
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a weekend trip with my daughter for a volleyball tournament. We opted out of a hotel stay and chose to find an Airbnb, which I am so glad we did! We had easy access to the highway and were close to many stores/restaurants. Traveling alone with an 11 year old can be scary but I never felt more safe and comfortable. The bed was so comfortable we almost overslept! lol If I ever have to make a trip back to Indianapolis, I hope to stay at Steven’s place."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location...easy to get to from I-465 but no freeway noise at night. Pictures accurately depicted location and listed amenities. Parking would have been super tight if I wasn't driving a sedan and/or all the spaces were filled. Would stay here again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I'm happy to award 5 stars all the way around. Everything was beautiful and exactly as described. Steven does not over-promise and then under-deliver. If he feels the same way about us - we'll be back!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved my stay at Steven's Suite 1. It was cozy and spacious as seen in the photos. Steven was so understanding with my plane being delayed which made my arrival time a bit after midnight. The bed was very comfortable and the location was very quiet and peaceful. I hope to have the opportunity to stay in one of Stevens's suites on my next visit to Indy.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you for being a great host. It was clean and quiet. Close to job ✅👍🏼
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cozy, excellent suite. We appreciated the hot—not warm, but hot!—water, the nice towels, the comfy couch, and the very effective mini-split. We would definitely stay here again.
Things to note for future guests: the parking lot is a little tight if all four suites that share the parking lot are occupied. It’s not bad, there’s just not endless room to turn around & such. No problem in our Camry, but if I showed up in a big truck I would have trouble navigating into space 1–the space for this suite.
Also just a note on accessibility: there are several steps up a deck to get to the suite and a hefty step to get IN the suite…I’d call that step about twice the height of a normal step. Just want to mention that for future guests with mobility issues.
All in all a fantastic place that met our needs perfectly. As others have mentioned, the walls are very thin. All other suite guests were great about observing quiet hours so it didn’t bother us."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I have stayed here multiple times and will continue to book with Steven. It’s very close for my needs an clean never any problems. An quiet.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while attending the Indianapolis 500. This was quiet and great location, easy to get places. Apartment was clean, cute. All we needed. Our only complaint was the coffee. There was no scoop to measure. Had to guess. The creamer also curdled. These were the only negatives. We didn't notify owners because we felt this was a small thing and there was a Starbucks up the street! Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend suite 1 to a solo traveler, maybe a couple! the walls are quite thin (so you will hear guests staying in the other two units) and the door to the bathroom really only shields you from view (not from hearing), but the room itself is incredibly spacious! There’s so much storage space, the microwave and fridge are VERY strong, and you’re not far from activities in the Greenwood area or the downtown indy area. The couch and bed are comfortable, all the appliances (tv, ac, lights, etc) are fairly simple to navigate. Definitely worth the cost and I would stay here again :)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great guy, very responsive. You can tell that with each visit he tries to tweak the place and make it even better. He shoveled snow before the sun came up and put down salt to prevent ice formation. Numbered parking spots, easy key exchange, quiet road, and an AC unit with a remote control. It was everything I needed for my month in Indianapolis."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was super nice, so much nicer and cozier than a hotel room. I would reccomend this place 10/10 times to someone staying in the area.

Steven and Andrea really have thought of everything when it comes to the little details, and providing everything you need, and did I mention clean? The bed is also very comfortable. The only negative is that noise does carry between the two suites very clearly, so the quiet times are a must, almost not worth mentioning considering everything else was so great. We will definitely stay again when in Indy!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Awesome chic suite! Loved staying in the suite. All to yourself. Private suite. Parking is reserved for each suite Everything yu need is there except no stove.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay, very clean, quiet, cozy, and great communication from host. Highly recommend."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suite 1 is perfect for a solo traveler - and might work well for 2 people. I was happy to find it was very clean and well-appointed. The bed was comfortable, bathroom roomy, and television smart and large - all important aspects in a b and b. The host provided a selection of packaged snacks and other supplies - which was a great touch that I have not seen in other travels. There is dedicated off-street parking (yay) , and the entrance to Suite 1 is on the side of the house away from the driveway. Getting to it involves some stairs, but it is all well-lit at night. The area is quiet and has a homey feel - while still convenient to the highway and many businesses. Steven was very responsive and attentive to reasonable requests. This will definitely be my first choice when I visit Indianapolis again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay. The place was in a good location and exactly as advertised. Steven was good with communication about check in/check out process
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great little spot, nice neighborhood had everything I needed ❤"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is very nice!! Small and minimalistic but nice for our stay while visiting for a local wedding. The checkin was slightly confusing on where exactly the suite was we were staying in, but we easily figured it out. The place wasn’t the most clean we’ve ever stayed at as someone had forgot to taken out the trash and the floor was somewhat dirty too, but overall would stay again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Steven was very communitive and accommodating. The area was clean and cozy, more homey than a hotel. Thanks!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a Suite place! A small studio, perfect for a stay in the area. Very small kitchenette has everything you need for a stay (toaster included!). Off street parking in a dedicated space is most appreciated. Easy check in."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve visited Unit 1 and Unit 4. 4 is my favorite upstairs with a private deck! Everything you need and more! Quiet..yard for kids.
Bring your food and cook or door dash it!
Steve is very accommodating and a phone call away!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful stay. Cozy little apartment. Perfect for relaxing evenings.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great stay with Steven! The place was clean and exactly as advertised.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cute suite with everything you need to have a wonderful stay. Steven was excellent at communicating with me everything I need to know. Will return again!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was fantastic. I highly recommend! If safety is a concern for you i felt completely safe which is always important to me.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. The bed was so comfortable. The place was updated and clean. Perfect for my needs. I will stay here anytime I am in Indy. Thanks Steven!
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Suite 1 is a cute little place. I didn’t hear a peep from any of the other 3 suites. It was a wonderful stay. The place is clean, located in a safe and convenient neighborhood, and it is nice and cozy for 1-2 people. The smartTV is nice for streaming my background noise tv show(parks and rec all the time, lol) at a very low volume while I sleep. I would definitely stay here again when I’m visiting friends and family out here in Indy.
For you fellow warm sleepers out there, the climate control is magical. I’d set it warmer during the day when I wasn’t there so I wasn’t being wasteful, and then turn it into a icebox at night."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Steven’s place was everything I could have hoped for and more. Easily one of the best AirBnB’s I have stayed in. Excellent location, as clean as could be, plenty of privacy. It really doesn’t get better than this. The pictures are extremely accurate but don’t even do this place justice. Anytime I am back in Indianapolis I will be staying at Steven’s place!!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Steven was great. He got us a new coffee maker when the one that was there went on the fritz (the new one makes a great cup of coffee, you’ll love it).
You can also tell he cares about his guests and the property and wants the best for everyone. He definitely made our trip a great one."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place in a great location. We would definitely book again!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Was a great place to stay, super clean and cozy. Does not have a stovetop, if you’re looking for a long term stay. Otherwise it was a great place to stay"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was tidy and clean. Easy check-in/check-out and good communication by property manager. Sounds easily travel through the walls so if you need the guarantee of a quiet nights rest this might not be the place. Our neighbors were playing music which we could easily hear. Additionally, the bathroom barn door offers little privacy, but not an issue if staying by yourself. The tub creaks anytime you move and could be replaced or better supported. Overall good place with good value."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mariah's accommodation is wonderful, even better than advertised.
The place is space, all renovated, with distinctive decor. Aconchegante, clean impeccable and very comfortable.
The recreational areas, board games and fire pit are differentials for even better lodging.
I recommend it as an option to stay around Indy."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very simple and easygoing stay. The environment was peaceful and the bnb itself was beautiful and very comfortable. My host Rachel was very friendly, responsive to messages and helpful with any questions I had. If I’m ever in town for work again I will definitely be booking this place again!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The carriage house was the perfect weekend stay for my husband and I. Everything was exactly as pictured in the listing and was even more lovely in person. The check in process was extremely easy, and the hosts are very friendly and responsive. Many attractions were very close including Mass Ave (the cultural district), the Indiana war memorial, the soldiers and sailors monument, and many more. This was probably one of our favorite airbnb stays, we would definitely book here again if visiting the Indianapolis area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying here, absolutely love it. Everything is pristine, comfortable and amazing. Would live here if I could."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a lovely carriage house apartment - I wish we could have stayed longer. Excellently appointed kitchen, comfy living room, relaxing bedroom, and pristine bathroom. Neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Easy walk to the Mass Ave shopping/restaurant district and short drives to basically everything else in Indy. And so nice to have secure parking in a garage! Hosts very easy to communicate with."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at Holly’s carriage house was exactly as she described it. We had everything that we needed for our one night stay. She was very responsive to our questions. I would definitely recommend staying at Hollys carriage house.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great location with clear instructions. Place was very clean. Probably the best AirBNB we've been to so far.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time here! The place was beautiful and very clean!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re traveling to the Indianapolis area look no further! The decor and aesthetic were absolutely impeccable. Garage parking made coming and going super easy. Take a walk around the neighborhood at Sunset and enjoy the wonderful Eclectic homes and beautiful gardens. Located just minutes from the freeway, getting to and from daytime activities and restaurants in the inner city is a breeze. Make yourself at home in the cozy living room too! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ All around!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Holly's carriage house is absolutely beautiful. The home is extremely clean and matches the photos provided. There's a ton of sunlight and Holly's attention to detail made me feel right at home. Easy check-in/out. 10/10 highly recommend!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The carriage house was amazing! Perfectly clean, new and well maintained, modern, and with so many helpful and thoughtful touches, the place is stocked with just about anything that you might need during your stay.

We would 100% stay again and definitely recommend the space to others!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed four nights for an event at IUPUI. The unit is 8–10 minutes from IUPUI and close to Massachusetts Avenue and Bottle Works. Check-in was smooth with prompt, friendly communication. We appreciated the use of the garage for extra security. The turn to get into the garage was tight, but our Prius fit perfectly. The unit was immaculate. We appreciated the large windows, beautiful fixtures, and comfortable bed. My favorite was the rain shower and new appliances! We cooked all of our meals in the kitchen, and it is fully stocked with everything you will need to prepare large or small meals. My husband and daughter were sick most of our trip, and I was never so grateful to have selected such a comfortable and clean Airbnb with a grocery store nearby for supplies. It is best enjoyed by 1-3 guests, as the unit is cozy. There are steps to get up to the door and a coded entry and security system. Minimal city noise, but it did not bother us at all. Very helpful host!  We will be back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in a great location! Walking distance to trail, bottleworks, and the garage dining. Convenient location for downtown events. Garage parking was nice and the space was exactly as advertised, clean, comfortable, spacious, and quiet. Would stay again if in the area!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Holly’s place was one of the best Air BnB’s I’ve ever stayed at. They provided a seamless check-in and check-out process, beautiful accommodations, and everything we needed was super accessible. ￼What I liked the most was that the carriage house was very modern and nicely designed."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice, up to date, and clean. Very convenient parking, one spot, in a shared garage with access code. Easy to get in, just punch your unique code in the garage and the living space. The entire living space was immaculate and clean. Very comfortable space and felt right at home. Nice location very close to Mass Avenue and to many attractions. Very responsive host and it was a very easy stay. Would stay again and will recommend to friends and family. Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great and looks just like the photos! Very clean and feels secluded even though it’s in their backyard. It was stocked with spices, ketchup, extra bathroom soaps and laundry detergent! Even though We didn’t use any of those but it’s nice knowing they are there just incase you do need them. I hate when an airbnb is just completely empty and it’s like starting from scratch which in my opinion is very nice knowing you don’t have to go out and get anything lot of things. It was very nice to park in the garage and another + is the hot water is HOT! We really enjoyed our stay and was definitely worth the money. Would stay again! (Be aware of potholes throughout the city as they were really bad at the end of January)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Holly's place is gorgeous. It's squeaky clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. The covered garage parking is a huge bonus. Check-in instructions were clear and detailed. Definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was in pristine condition, with every amenity you’d need—a well stocked kitchen, pour over coffee, creamer, shampoo, conditioner, comfortable bed, extra pillows & linens, chargers, board games, garage parking. They went above and beyond to clear the snow & ice as well. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend or re-book!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We've stayed here a couple times for Pacer's games. It is great location, walking distance to bars and restaurants and a quick uber ride to the stadium. Also, being able to park a garage instead of street parking is a major perk!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Awesome location. Extremely helpful with great recommendations. They went above and beyond. Can't say enough good things about this place. Will definitely stay here again.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay in this beautiful carriage house. It was evident that the hosts put their heart and soul into this house.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! Holly and Kristan have hosting absolutely nailed - gorgeous apartment that is laid out perfectly with oodles of space and supplied with high quality everything (furnishings, kitchen, linens, coffee, etc.). We were so very comfortable here - including the couch and bed (and I am not the easiest to please when it comes to mattresses.) I'm also very picky about cleanliness and this apartment is TRULY spotless! We were in town for a family event, but I loved the location for walking to Mass Ave, around the Cottage Home area and even into downtown. Finally both hosts were friendly and proactive in their communications, but gave us complete privacy. We'll be back next time we are in Indy. :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and even better than expected!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved staying here. Holly was incredibly responsive and easy to work with. Had a wonderful time and would highly recommend.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I went to see an Indianapolis Indians baseball game with my dad and found just the place to stay for the night. We had a great stay the space is very nice.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If AirBNB only had a 15-star rating. This place is perfect and spotless clean. Great downtown location. We selected this location for east access to Downtown and the Monon Trail for biking.
This by far exceeds any expectations and I highly recommend for your next trip."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Holly’s place might be the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at so far. Everything is brand new, and they thought of just about anything you could need away from home. The furniture was very comfortable, and the entire place was spotless. Bravo!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Holly's place was great for a quick trip to Indy. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful but also was close to downtown with lots of restaurants and things to do!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristen and Holly’s place was exactly as advertised - perhaps even better! Every detail was thought of and provided. Hearing that we’d had some snags with our travel, they left us some local beers in the fridge, which was super kind and much appreciated after our difficult day. Communication was clear, prompt and detailed. I was even able to bake cookies in the kitchen, with all the tools I needed easily at hand. Thank you for a great stay, we look forward to staying with you again."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Holly’s place several times now and it has been perfect every time. If there is a manual on how to create a perfect AirBnb space, Holly should write it. All of the amenities and thoughtful details, the pristine conditions, and the responsiveness to any needs make this a place I will always stay at when in the Indy area. The location is perfect if you’re looking to experience the cool vibe of the area. Five stars for sure!!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot say enough how much we loved staying there! It was so cute and we were literally welcomed with music playing on the speaker - what a vibe. Not only was the space perfect for a short stay, it was functional beyond that with full amenities."

Many thanks to our amazing hosts!!!"

Definitely will book again when I am back in Indianapolis!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in Indianapolis for a concert at The Cabaret, a fantastic venue for intimate events.
The loft featured everything we needed with many extras. Getting in and out was easy and Uber/Lyft to/from the concert was responsive.
Apart from a sometimes barking dog when we got up in the morning, it was peaceful and quiet. We were already awake when I heard the dog which may have been a neighbors, so no issues!
Thank you for the fabulous stay!"

The kitchen is just as pictured. Nice and large! The use of the garage space was a great bonus. Check-in could not have been easier. Internet speeds were fantastic."

It was clean, beautiful, and had everything we needed! Kristan, Holly’s co-host was very responsive and happy to answer questions we had during our stay. We would definitely stay again if we come back to the area!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow just WOW!! I have stayed in my share of AirBNB’s & this one is most definitely at the top of my list! First, my grandson & I arrived to our own space in a 3-stall garage. How often does that happen?!? Upon entering the carriage house, we were greeted with a wonderful playlist selection. How thoughtful & welcoming! We were immediately impressed with the fine attention to detail. There has been nothing forgotten, nor were any corners cut for the sake of being cheap. The refrigerator, as well as the washer & dryer were clearly high-end & new. In fact, the entire place seemed new & extremely well-decorated. I have to say that my 11-year grandson absolutely LOVED the cutlery set that magnetically hung on one of the kitchen walls! He’s a bit of an organization freak & opened each drawer with delight, finding bowls, plates, drinking glasses & coffee mugs neatly placed. He makes me laugh!! The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the room darkening shades were very appreciated!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're considering where to stay in Indy, stop looking! This is the place!
My husband and I were in town to see Hamilton, and for a weekend trip this Airbnb was perfect. The carriage house was pristine when we arrived, well stocked with anything you could need, and you can't beat garage parking. The hosts were quick to respond when needed, but otherwise gave us space. It was also a great location- it felt private while still being so close to downtown. We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves back in Indy."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay at Holly's Place. I will and would recommend this property to others and I look forward to staying again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this Airbnb so much. Extremely clean and so well decorated. If we were to be in Indy for an extended period of time, this would be the place for us as it had everything needed and the amenities were not only plentiful, but top notch quality. Garage parking was a nice bonus! Great location to get to downtown quickly. A+, 5 Star!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, New, Beautiful Design! This carriage house was a cool experience. Everything we needed was here. The location was great and convenient and very peaceful. I will definitely look to book this place again! And the private secured parking was a wonderful bonus!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We thought this place was extremely beautiful and private. The hosts made check in easy and provided relaxing space to enjoy Indianapolis!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying and the place does not disappointment. It is clean and beautifully furnished.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This has been my best Airbnb experience yet. The place was amazing just as photos listed. The host was very responsive as well as flexible with checking in. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to hesitate on booking this place.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Carriage house was beautiful and comfortably decorated. Had all necessary amenities. Hosts were responsive and friendly. Place had a garage space for parking which was fantastic. Guests must be able to climb flight of steps to access accommodations. Ours was only a brief visit to Indianapolis but could have enjoyed a longer stay here. Peaceful and relaxing.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was amazingly beautiful. Looks just like the pictures. The house was clean and sanitized very well. We loved the stay. Be aware that the house is like an additional unit on the owners property. The house is located on top of the garage. Check in was super smooth and easy. We found the property with no problem. Outside/street parking was hard to find. The garage use is optional but it is a shared garage so you’ll be sharing the garage with the owner. You’ll be minutes away from downtown which is perfect. Overall the house was amazing. We stayed one night for a concert and it was definitely worth it.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Always an excellent- quiet, clean and well appointed property."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay. This was a quick trip for my husband and I to get away and see TMBG at the Egyptian Room.

Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend"

Thank you, Holly, for a great stay!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Holly’s carriage house in Indianapolis was superb. My partner and I were driving all the way from Nashville to Indianapolis as our last destination as part of a five day road trip in the region. We arrived late and tired yet felt right at home. Check in and parking was very easy and the place was fantastic. Not a mote of dust to be seen anywhere. The kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom were all impecable. You can tell the owners have taken good care of this place. All the furniture, linens, decorations, and electronics match the overall aesthetic of the place, are comfortable, and easy to use. And the neighborhood was nice and peaceful but a 5min drive away from all sorts of shops and cafes. We were so sad to have only stayed for one night. Amazing place! Ten out of ten!
(Partner here) Loved the quality finishes, materials, and plumbing fixtures throughout. High end Samsung appliances. Thoughtful choices like Nest thermostat and enterprise grade wifi were the icing on top!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Holly’s place was very nice and Kristan was excellent in providing information and answering any questions we had. Very nice layout and extremely clean.

Their carriage house is beautiful, impeccably clean, and so well designed. Kristan was so helpful in giving us multiple, specific recommendations and helped me craft the perfect evening in a Indianapolis. I am a picky traveler and their home exceeded expectations in every way. Don’t even question whether or not to stay here- it’s just perfect!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This unit was so beautiful and peaceful. She had music playing when we walked in and we had it on almost the entire night it s such great music that we both loved. Perfect deco and the water softener was such an added bonus. Bed was very comfy and the bright sunshine in the morning from all the windows was a great way to wake up. I highly recommend this gem. So close to the bottleworks area and mass ave. She is such a highly responsive host and I’m pretty sure we will be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful little Airbnb. We stayed for a long weekend in January and couldn't happier with our stay. Holly had thought of everything we might have needed and had it ready for us. She was proactive in her communication, making sure that we had what we needed and ready to help on any questions we might have had.
The space was clean and spacious, yet warm and cozy. The bed and linens were comfortable and honestly, everything we needed was there. Traveling with a toddler can be a lot for anyone, but we felt right at home at Holly's. If we're ever back in Indy we'll plan to stay here again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was beautiful and I could love somewhere like that. They very responsive and accommodating. Amenities like pour over coffee and extra shower supplies/toiletries really really made that stay! They even made sure the sidewalk and steps were shoveled in the morning after the snow. I look forward to staying again when back in the area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our hosts were WONDERFUL! Very communicative and responsive. The apartment was clean and full of thoughtful amenities. We loved the plants in every room!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Holly’s place is impeccably clean, well designed and perfect for solos/couples/small families. The thoughtful additions of games, coffee and snacks were a nice touch! We also appreciated having a garage to park. Finally, Holly and Kristan are incredibly responsive should you need anything. My only regret was only being able to stay for 1 night but we plan to come back next time we are in the area :)"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely beautiful! Immaculate. And Holly thinks of everything you could possibly need. Would definitely book again.

The Carriage House was perfect! Not only was it minutes away from the venue + Downtown Indy, but it was also clean, modern, and comfortable. We will definitely be booking again if we’re ever back here. Holly and Kristen were very responsive and gave clear instructions, and were flexible with the check out time which gave us a few extra hours to check out the city. 10/10 would recommend!!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Holly's Place is just as described! It is sparkling clean, well organized, and has many amenities. The location is great with restaurants and shops within walking distance. Holly was very responsive to inquiries during my stay. I would love to stay again when visiting Indianapolis"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, well thought out above garage unit - private, quiet, modern. Access stairs to entry door are steep and getting luggage up and down is a bit of a challenge. Downtown area is undergoing a lot of construction, so plan ahead for a few detours, etc. Parking is inside the garage which is a plus in crummy weather & garage door opener is included. Unit was clean, inviting, had a well-stocked kitchen with a few condiments & beverages left in fridge which was great. Good lighting, comfortable bed and washer & dryer was in the unit as well. Great space for 1 or 2 people. I will definitely stay here again when in Indy."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful space, clean, comfortable and within bike or walking distance to Mass Ave/ The Garage Food Hall. We enjoyed our short stay here. Full sized bed was very comfortable, washer/dryer available, as well as a couch bed pull out if you need it. Fully functional kitchen and bathroom. A perfect place for a short stay or if you need a small apartment for longer term. Garage parking was a great extra, but if you have a larger vehicle than a small car or crossover SUV it may not fit. Plenty of street parking around the area if needed. The location was very quiet and pleasant. Would 5/5 stay here again and recommend to anyone looking to enjoy Indy for a weekend stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Place was fantastic, in a great location, walked down to a pizza place from there less than a mile away, the house was clean and Holly was very friendly and helpful"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place! SO clean and so lovely. We arrived to find garage parking and music playing upon entry - such a nice welcome. Holly’s place is *pristine* and has everything you’ll need. It’s bright, modern, and comfortable."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place. The hosts are friendly and inviting. Close enough to walk to shops, restaurants and bars, but far enough away from the noise of downtown.
Really enjoyed our stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Holly’s home is the best! If you’re looking for 5 star hotel finishes but with more privacy, a full kitchen, high speed internet, living room, washer/dryer, and free garage parking, then look no further.
The place was super clean and the air conditioning was a welcome breath of fresh air given the heat wave during our visit.
It’s also very close to great food at the Garage Food Hall and Amelia’s Bakery. I wish I had spent more time in town exploring the delicious food scene in Indianapolis.
I would definitely stay here again and enjoyed it much more than staying at any hotel downtown."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb’s I have experienced. New, modern, clean stay in an excellent location since it is super close to downtown but still has its small neighborhood feel and tons of bike lanes/trails. Really feels like you are living at your own apartment with the private garage parking. I only had one quick question before my stay and it was answered almost immediately. Would love to stay again!"

He provided ample recommendations on local sites and food/drink. I would recommend this place to others as a great vacation space!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow, I expected a lot given the stellar reviews and I wasn't disappointed. The home was absolutely spotless and thought was clearly given to so much. We had everything we needed and more. We arrived at night and were thrilled that the sofa bed was already made so that my kids were able to quickly get to bed. Communication was also wonderful and all of my questions were quickly answered.
If I absolutely had to look for something to share that I'd think future guests may want to know, I'd suggest bringing your own pillow if you're especially particular. Also, we were able to hear train noise with the windows closed, though we didn't need the white noise machine. Highway noise was a non-issue.
Don't miss the bagel shop one block away! It's really great. Leviathan Bakehouse, a two-minute drive away, was also special. And there's the big Garage food hall and other shops/restaurants nearby - note that you can walk, as parking is expensive (free on Sundays)."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin was super informative and forthcoming with details for getting into the home the day of. The moment we opened the door there was a light clean linen aroma and soft music playing through the TV. The photos matched the listing to a T. There was plenty of lighting & several seating areas. The location is perfect! Within walking distance of restaurants, but you don’t feel or hear any of typical downtown noise. The neighborhood is so cute and you can tell people take pride in their properties. We felt right at home and wish we could have stayed longer! We would 10/10 recommend if you’re coming to Indianapolis, this place does not disappoint. ☮️💙"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kevin was a wonderful host who went above and beyond. He provides tons of great local information and recommendations and has clearly put a lot of thought into making each stay easy and enjoyable.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked Kevin’s place same-day, when I didn’t feel comfortable staying at my pre-planned hotel. Kevin was so kind about the last minute booking and 8pm check-in. The place itself was the perfect airbnb, and I’d gladly recommend it to anyone."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kevin's space was one of the most modern, clean, and cute spaces I've stayed in. My friend and I were visiting the city for one night, and this space offered everything that we needed. Kevin's instructions were timely and clear for arrival, during stay, and departure, and the space was identical to the pictures posted on the listing. Kevin included small, personalized gestures for us, too. A welcome card, candy, complimentary drinks, popcorn, and a personalized letter board message. Comfy bed and living furniture, clean appliances with utensils, and a nice bathroom. The space was close to Mass. Ave and very short drive from other main attractions downtown. I highly recommend and would book again if ever in the city. Thanks, Kevin!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kevin's oasis was exactly as described and so much more. I have added this to my top 3 Airbnb stays. The short is this place is clean,modern,cozy,fun and has a few surprises waiting for you. The home is located in a beautiful Safe cottage neighborhood close to walking and biking trails along with tons of restaurants. This is random
but the shower gel is amazing. Stop reading and hit reserve."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I needed something walkable to Mass Ave, and this was absolutely perfect. The location was exactly what I needed.
The place itself is frankly adorable - perfect for 1 or 2 people looking to spend a few days in downtown Indy. Well-appointed, clean, stylish, it really was an awesome little spot. Parking was essentially right in front of the entrance with no concern about finding a spot. My only regret is that I wasn't in town for more than one night, I would have loved to stay for longer had I the opportunity.
As a Host, Kevin was great - thoroughly responsive and communicative from the point of booking all the way through the end of the rental. Couldn't have asked for more.
If I'm ever back in Indy anytime soon, I'll definitely be checking this one's availability first!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I stayed a night for our anniversary. Kevin was very proactive and responsive with his communication. The check in was simple and he had very detailed instructions. Although the carriage house is right next to another house it’s still very private. Everything was very clean and inviting upon arrival . We didn’t cook any meals but the kitchen seemed equipped. There are several restaurants and breweries that you can easily walk to . We had street parking and no issues at all finding a spot . We really appreciated the hospitality and would definitely stay again .
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I visit Indianapolis a couple days 2 or 3 weeks a month + have found the gem.

Kevin was really responsive and provided clear instructions for check-in and check-out. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean. Owner lives next door, but you wouldn’t know it. It is pretty easy to get downtown from this spot. You can walk to a lot of places if you need to. Otherwise a short drive and parking downtown Indy is easy. Kevin was super welcoming and very quick to respond. He even offered an early check in. We were checking out the film fest at the Kankan and we were able to walk every night. Perfect for 2 people."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay with all of the accommodations in a great part of town!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I only wish I could have stayed for more than one night! Kevin's carriage house is clean, bright, cozy and so SO comfortable. Every time I though of something I might need, I would open a cupboard and there it was!
The decor is gorgeous - I truly felt I was in a suite at a resort. From the super comfy bed to the fanciest ceiling fans I've ever operated, this place had it all: including note cards for correspondence (which I RARELY need but did that evening) and even a sweet treat to make me feel extra welcome.
If 18 star ratings were possible, I would give this place 19!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This studio unit is perfect for a party of 2 to 4 people. Very close to downtown and the highway. Clean and very comfortable. Kevin thought of everything a guest would need or require. Would definitely stay here again if I am in the area! Note to very light sleepers you may want to bring some earplugs as you might hear some train noise :-).
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The carriage house hosted by Kevin was a great find. We do one or two night stays in Indy for concerts and other activities a couple times a year. This may be our favorite spot yet. Nice, quiet neighborhood. There was a little brewery very nearby and Mass Ave. was an easy walk. That's where you'll find a ton of restaurants and bars. That was also a direct shot to the Old National Theatre. So, that's the location and surroundings covered. The place itself was comfortable, had great features like the skylights, comfy couch and bed, and a TV in each room to wind down after our night out. I'll definitely check to see if it is available on our next trip! A+++++"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loree's place is fantastic...a true gem. I am pretty detailed when it comes to my version of what 'clean' is... and this space did not disappoint. I felt instantly at home and did not hesitate to make myself comfortable, which is exactly what I needed after driving 10 hours to get to Indianapolis. The bed is comfortable, (slept like a baby) the sheets and towels were great, and I could control the heat myself which was great. I really appreciated the thought and care that was put into creating a comfortable and peaceful vibe. And I loved that it was a separate building that was secure and felt safe for a woman traveling alone."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loree was a great host. The home was clean and cozy and looked exactly as the pictures. I would highly recommend the hidden cottage.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Situated in a lovely, wooded neighborhood, the house is very easy to locate and really charming. My cats and I enjoyed relaxing in the living room, watching TV, and the bed was very comfortable. I mean very comfortable. Mostly because of the bedding itself, which was specifically suited to my personal preferences.
Overall, a great place to rest and rejuvenate!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn't have asked for a better cottage and hosts!!! Definitely coming back if ever in the area again!! Quick responses from hosts.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place as described
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely little green cottage, with amenities that make it feel like home. it has a great layout, and is in a very nice neighborhood. The cottage is facing and shares backyard space with the homeowners /hosts. but does have a private back sitting area.. The only issues were a musty smell upon arrival, the host shared due to the rainy day and damp bed sheets, which made the bed not usable. The host recognized both issues and should be easily resolved in future stays with a few adjustments. It is 7 minutes from Butler University and in close proximity to a Starbucks."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. Everything went smoothly.
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The cottage was fairly easy to find and we appreciated that it was a bit secluded from the main road. The place was respectably clean, but there was a minor musty odor that permeated the property. Based on the images, we felt the place was going to be a lot brighter inside, but all the lights are very dim. Perfect for romantic ambience but not if you want visibility. The bathroom door didn’t close fully and the shower head water pressure was extremely low. In both the kitchen and bathroom, be patient with the hot water to warm up. All amenities were provided as listed and the complimentary streaming services were a great way to wind down in the evening. Overall, this place is reasonably priced for what is provided. Loree was friendly in all messages to us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay on our way back home. Easy to get to and well maintained. So cozy!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first experience with airbnb, and Loree made it extremely easy. She is very responsive and helpful with any questions I had.

I would not hesitate to book again the next time I come to town."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Hidden gem. This is a “back house” behind the main home on an extremely large property. Very private, quiet, and close to anything you need."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loree's place reminded me of a lake cottage without the lake. We were most comfortable. The setting is peaceful. The neighborhood is quiet; we went for walks. And it's not far from more developed areas. I would definitely seek to stay again at Loree's next time we're in Indianapolis.

The bed was SUPER comfortable and was heavenly after a long day in the heat. Loree pretty much had everything you may have forgotten to pack as well, which could be very helpful! The location was very quiet and tucked away from the city. We will definitely be looking into staying here again if we're back in the area!!"

Loree was super communicative and proactive from before check-in until right after check-out. The property was quiet and peaceful and the private cottage was immaculate, beautifully furnished, and very cozy. We loved how pet friendly the hosts and the area were, with the nearby park. Any time we had questions, Loree was easily available via Airbnb messaging. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her place and would/will definitely stay here again. Thank you!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This little cottage was exactly what I was looking for. It is in a safe, quiet neighborhood and was easy to get around to the places I wanted to go to.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I agree with another review-this was my best Airbnb experience. I was only out for a couple of days for work, and this was an excellent place to be. It's so quiet and comfortable. When I finish work I usually just come back to nap and do paperwork. I felt like I was at home. Everything was so comfortable and nice. I love having a kitchen and being able to cook my meals instead of having to eat out, and even though I didn't use the washer and dryer this time I'm really hoping to stay again in the fall and have it available then to use. I will need it!😆 Loree and Mark answered so quickly the one little question I had. Excellent hosts! Excellent accommodations, excellent experience!"

I was hoping for a tranquil, peaceful place and this cottage more than fit the bill.
The sunrises were heaven on earth from the bedroom view. The kitchen was charming and cozy for morning coffee and emailing.
The living room gave me all the naps and lazy tv viewing I could ask for.
And the bed was perfect. I slept like a baby.
I couldn’t have asked for a more lovely stay.
Loree was the perfect host with lightning quick and efficient responses to any and all questions.
I can’t say enough about it. If you’re looking for a delightful Indianapolis experience, you’ve found it. Stop looking and book this cottage!!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful. Quiet. Cozy. Perfect. For being near the heart of so much of Indianapolis, this feels remote and private.

I really like to be able to cook or bring leftovers back to reheat later. The kitchen was set up with everything I needed and more."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I drove to Indianapolis from DC for a weeklong business conference and decided to stay at Loree's cottage instead of a hotel downtown. The cottage was very peaceful and comfortable and allowed me to get some much needed rest before catching up with my team downtown. The cottage is just over 10 minutes to/from downtown and also close to parks, trails, and shopping centers for stocking up on snacks and necessities. Loree and Mark were also very attentive hosts and provided timely communication from the beginning to end of my stay. I would definitely recommend the cottage for solo travelers and small families alike."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely small home, perfect for staying in Indianapolis. The location is near the highway. It’s secluded and feels private and comfortable. I am staying again in October."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wowsers!!! I loved staying here! Talk about homely & comfortable. One of the best beds I’ve slept in. Safe area, easy to find & no hassle check in.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loree was an amazing host and extremely accomadating. I couldn't have asked for more from our stay.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our cottage stay was a perfect half way stop between Columbus and Chicago. the neighborhood is very quiet, yet still very convenient to I-65. We did not get to meet the host, arriving late evening and leaving in the morning. But Laree sent check in instructions and dining recommendations by text, and made the stay very comfortable and easy. The cottage is very clean, comfortable, with all the necessities on hand. I took a wonderful ""coffee walk"" through the quiet Wynnedale neighborhood and the nearby Fitness Farm. Talked to some locals about the history of the place, and the owners of the property."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location next to the college and it's velodrome.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was incredibly clean, conveniently located, and had easy parking. Loree could not have been more helpful and made the stay wonderful!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely stay at Loree's place; the cottage offers privacy and all the amenities you need to feel right at home. I appreciated the comfortable bed, desk to work from and the well-stocked kitchen for meal prep. As a solo traveler, I had zero concerns about safety. Mark was very responsive and accommodating when we hit a bit of a snag with the washing machine - which is all you can hope for when things happen, as they undoubtedly do! Highly recommend Loree's place!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loree and Mark are great hosts. The house was in a great location and is close enough to things to do and great restaurants but also offers seclusion if you are looking for a quiet night in with a book or movie. They have everything you need to be comfortable during your stay and communication is great.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Adorable little cottage tucked away in a very nice area. Close to everything we wanted to do. Check in was a breeze and the hosts were awesome! Definitely recommend!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! Beautifully designed, cozy and super comfortable. The charm is the property is soothing. A great place for a private retreat, with great access to the city and its vibrancy!"

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very cute cottage and really nicely decorated. It is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. There were snacks and waters which was a nice touch. We had no trouble checking in and the bed was very comfortable. We do have allergies and the cottage being a bit older did seem to trigger them, so if allergies are a concern for you, this may not be an ideal place for you to stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an awesome stay! The commutation is very nice as well!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is probably the best airbnb I have been to in the Midwest. The place is easy to find, clean, fully stocked kitchen, spacious for two people and two dogs, and everything I needed. It's close to enjoyable parks and restaurants. The hosts are very friendly and accommodating. When I return to Indianapolis I will definitely check if they're available."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved staying here! It's the perfect size for 1-2 people and is located in a great area. Even though it's in Indy, it's tucked away which gives you the feeling that you're far away from the city. Would definitely recommend staying here"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a lovely intimate cottage. The place is very comfortable and inviting. The host were nice and very responsive. I stayed with my dog and we had a lovely time.

Less than 10 minutes from Meijer Supermarket"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loree's cottage was a perfect weekend getaway. It was very well appointed and had all of the amenities that we could ask for. The bed was comfortable and when we had friends join us for one of our nights stay, she was gracious and set up the sofa and a trundle bed that doubles as a coffee table (very unique!).
There were plenty of towels and linens and the kitchen has everything that you may need. The wifi was great as well. The cottage is located close to the museum and the Broad Ripple area for food and bars.
We would definitely stay here again when in the area. Thank you!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great. Everything was clean and as listed. Scott was a great host who had amazing recommendations for local places around the town. He was very responsive to any questions I had and would totally stay again if I’m ever back in Indianapolis.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Scott was so friendly and helpful and the home was beautiful! So many thoughtful touches that made our stay so comfy! Would definitely come back again :)
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,One of the best I’ve stayed at. Fully stocked. You won’t need anything as this place has it all. Great for kids. Highly recommended.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic. It is super clean and so quiet, but what really makes it stand out was the thoughtful touches from the hosts - from information to kitchen items to options for entertainment, they thought of so many things to make our stay not just comfortable, but easy and fun!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott was great to work with. His communication was great. We had a few very small issues that he resolved same day for us.
The park across from the house is very nice with pickle ball and tennis and plenty of walking trails."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a volleyball tourney. It was fantastic. I was a little apprehensive about being in the upstairs. But it was fantastic, private front entrance and absolutely zero noise. I’d 100% book this place again with zero hesitation."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott is so accommodating and helpful. Tree Lodge was an oasis for us during a hectic visit to Indy. There was welcoming food and snacks, eggs, and Evian water in the fridge. The beds were so comfortable and the bedrooms quiet. The deck was perfect for relaxing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy place to stay. The place had a real outdoor/log cabin vibe. Would definitely stay again. Scott is a great host.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place and above and beyond service
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for spending the weekend visiting our daughter who is a student at Butler. The neighborhood and park are lovely, the bed was very comfortable, the kitchen had everything we could need and the deck would have been lovely to sit on if the weather had been warmer! The snacks were delicious and very much appreciated and when we ran out of coffee filters, Scott had them hanging on our door within minutes. Wish we would have found this place sooner!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott provided the space above and beyond in everything. We felt very welcome and impressed with his welcome note and the locally made chips. The eggs in the fridge really eased our kids' hunger in the morning. Scott was very friendly. He printed out a very clear instruction about everything in the house. The beddings looked superb and clean. We had a very comfortable stay. The location was also great with such a short driving distance to Broad Ripple restaurants. It's a shame we haven't had time to go on the Monon trail yet. If we return, we will definitely stay with Scott again. Thank you."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay at Scott's ""lodge"" was great. It was exactly what my two (grown) kids and I needed. There's only two bedrooms (with extremely comfortable beds), but they also provided a nice air mattress for guests to use. The snacks and waters were a nice touch, and they also provided coffee and creamer. If we had complaints, which would be unfair because we knew the situation before we reserved, just having one bathroom can be difficult, and had my wife joined us, she would have had trouble making it up the stairs. Otherwise, it was quiet, comfortable and convenient to Broad Ripple village. Although Scott said we might hear their dog, we did not. We didn't see or hear from anyone or anything while we there. I would highly recommend staying in the Treetops!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family & I rented this space to view the solar eclipse. Not only did my sons say the eclipse was the most amazing thing they’ve ever seen, but we felt right at home in Scott’s Airbnb and loved the decorations and art from their travels around the space. We enjoyed utilizing the park across the street, going on hiking trails and playing pickleball and tennis. Broad ripple was an adorable village where we had dinner and walked around looking at shops and getting ice cream. Scott and his wife were very kind and quick to respond with any questions we had to give us the best experience. Just a short two hour dive from our home in northern Kentucky and we created a life long memory….
Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Clean, close to a lot of restaurants, etc. Easy to find. Easy entry. We really enjoyed our stay!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful visit and Scott was a fabulous host!
The space was beautiful, comfortable, and stocked with everything you may need while traveling. Scott even left some additional treats for us to enjoy!
We hope to travel to Indianapolis again so we can book another stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great host and great stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful visit at Scott and Danielle’s, with every detail in place from the extremely comfortable beds to the cleanliness of the whole place to the very well stocked kitchen. They did everything to make us feel comfortable, which meant a lot since it can be stressful to stay with young children in a place above someone’s home. We would definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place will exceed your expectations.
Yes, it is as described and pictured but even better because of the personal touches.
Scott and Danielle are available to answer any questions within minutes.
The house is SPOTLESS.
It is an upstairs unit, so keep in mind if you have mobility issues.
We hope to stay there again when the weather is warmer to take advantage of the lovely deck.
Cozy, comfortable, CLEAN, and conveniently located."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing stay! These hosts were so helpful and the property was as described and they went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at Scott's with our young girls (2 & 4yrs old). It was wonderful having all the amenities we could possibly have needed for our kids, so we didn't have to travel with them. The neighborhood was quiet but close enough to Broad Ripple village and restaurants and the grocery store. We felt right at home and very comfortable for the duration of our stay. We especially appreciated being able to have some quiet time after putting the kids to bed. Scott was extremely communicative and helped out with any questions I had. Would highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! There was a kind welcoming and packet of very helpful instructions. I don’t think there was a single thing missing that you may need!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend getaway! The house was cozy and fulfilled all of our needs.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Treetop Lodge is an excellent place to stay. Scott and his wife have gone out of their way to make it comfortable. It is nicely decorated with lots of interesting pieces, and all the little details necessary for a home away from home have been taken into consideration. They are also very friendly and very communicative. We enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend it to others."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean , cozy, comfortable place to stay. Everything was as described. Maybe even better than described. Great communication and instructions. We would stay here again for sure. Highly recommend"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Broad Ripple Treetop Lodge deserves every ounce of praise on this page--and then some. The hosts have thought of everything from the guest's comfort point of view, down to a beer mug chilling in the freezer. The Lodge has lots of personality and feels like a home, which makes it ideal for longer stays. The instructions and information is presented clearly and the hosts were very responsive. It's without a doubt one of the best Airbnb's to stay at in the Indianapolis area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Danielle's home was an absolute delight and exceeded our expectations in every way. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable, from the charming holiday decor to the fully stocked kitchen and ample amenities. We were particularly impressed with the thoughtful touches, like providing eggs and coffee for breakfast, and a Brita pitcher so we could filter tap water. The extra extra touches, like board games and humorous instructions, really made our stay feel like a home away from home. They were very responsive and attentive and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. We will definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay was simply perfect. It was easy to find with the instructions we got. We found a place that was more spacious than we expected and it was clean… dang! I wish Danielle and Scott would clean my house like that. 😅 It is rustic but in the good way. All furniture, appliances and bathroom appliances are either brand new or in top condition. You can just go a few steps, take a walk or a jog in the park, enjoy the lively neighborhood on the other side of the park, enjoy the playground or simply stay “at home”, watch a movie, play a board game…
Scott was available at every time of the day, friendly, hospitable, helpful. This is the perfect example why AirBnB is fun."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay. The place was very clean and the amenities were unmatched! It was clear that the hosts put a lot of thought into the details. The beds were comfortable and the extra towels and bidet are a nice touch. The bottled water in the fridge was appreciated, and the local chips were delicious. The neighborhood was safe to walk (as 2 females traveling alone this is always on the radar). Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely book again for future Indy visits."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had a fantastic stay at Scott's place! The home was clean and had a warm, homey feel. It was private and quiet, and the kitchen was well stocked with everything I needed. What really impressed me was the thoughtful touch of having snacks and baby items available – a great perk for families. The neighborhood was lovely too, making it an all-around great experience. We would love to stay at Scott’s again on a trip to Indianapolis-Highly recommended!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great comminication and location with excellent check in and check out instructions. The Treetop Lodge is nestled in Broad Ripole near The Monon Trail with a variety of food, drink and entertainment just minutes away. We especially enjoyed the ease of being able to walk outside on nearby trails and play pickleball across the street. Kudos to Scott and Daniele for hosting such a wonderful experience. Clean, organized , good linens and towels. Cannot say enough about location, location, location 👍. We will share with our family and friends so others can experience😍. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay at Treetop lodge! They thought of everything to make the stay awesome!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott and Danielle were lovely hosts—it’s clear they put personal touches and lots of time and attention to the care of the space. We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Indy. Great location with quaint restaurants nearby.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend and we will come back here! Beautiful, clean, cozy and immersed in nature! Scott was an excellent host going above and beyond our expectations. Amazingly comfortable beds, stocked kitchen and wonderfully peaceful. It rained all weekend so we're anxious to return again for some biking, kayaking and pickleball!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Beautiful area and across the street from a park. We brought our two young kids and they enjoyed themselves. It was spotless and had any amenity you can think of. We would love to come back in the future.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Treetop Lodge is a jewel of a place to stay. All of the little touches that make a place special have been done and it's just lovely. It's truly special.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Scott’s place for a weekend in Indy and it was just perfect. Lots of cool details in the home that helped me to get inspired to write. Everywhere you look there is something quirky and delightful. The hosts are very friendly and proactively messaged to ask if I needed anything. I felt very comfortable having my brothers over to cook a meal in the kitchen and we ate on the peaceful balcony. The bed linens were fresh, natural materials, and super cozy. There is an office nook in one of the bedrooms with a labeled rock collection that I will be recreating in my own home. Definitely the cherry on top. 😁"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly Outstanding! When you want to go home and redecorate like your AirBnB..well that says something. Best AirBnB we’ve ever stayed in and we’ve stayed in many. Gorgeous and serene, beautiful walking path/park directly across the street. Most comfortable beds and quiet, peaceful sleep. Completely stocked kitchen with local snacks, eggs, great coffee on our arrival. I cannot say enough about this beautiful place. Working on dates for a return visit soon! This is what AirBnB is all about."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place will definitely stay here again
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is easily within my top 3 of stateside AirBnBs! Scott and Danielle are amazing hosts with an amazing place to stay. They provided great local recommendations and amazing in house amenities. This will be our top choice for any other Indy visits!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t say enough good things about this place! I had gotten up early and went out to sit on the second story balcony by myself. It was a beautiful view that looked out over many backyard gardens including two murals on garages. As I sat many hummingbirds came up to the feeder and it was so peaceful! Everything was just as Scott described, and we felt right at home. The home was spotless, and comfy beds. There is a comfy nook where my child was able to get all their homework done without distraction. The kitchen and dining area were bigger than expected, and well equipped, although we didn’t have enough time to use them. We hope we have the opportunity to stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great example of a perfect Airbnb stay. The little touches like local snacks and coffee available to use during our stay, and the hosts checking in if there is anything else we need, made our visit very nice. The house was in a quiet neighbourhood, but perfect location for visiting local attractions such as the Children’s Museum."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A gem in local stays, I would hesitate to return. Great hosts, comfortable place, and a beautiful area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time, the place had everything we could ask for in a quiet location and was very clean. Thanks again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was probably one of the best Airbnb's we have stayed at. Very accommodating and comfortable! It was perfect for us to just have a night away from home. Would definitely recommend to others looking for a place to stay in Indianapolis.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We would definitely stay here again. The place was immaculately clean, well appointed and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed relaxing on the deck watching the hummingbirds stop at the feeder. Scott is a very conscientious and attentive host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The stay was memorable.
The place was not only well decorated showcasing artifacts and collectible from the hosts' travels but was also stocked up with all the typical things that travelers would look for and more. Often one will have to pay for some of the extras such as Water bottle, fruits and snacks, Gevalia coffee and eggs (which is above and beyond). The little office room in one of the bedrooms, I particularly liked since I had to catch up on work.
Scott was also very proactive in reaching out periodically. Given that we were juggling a few things on our end, I wasn't very communicative but certainly appreciated it. We also had an opportunity to say hello to Scott before we took off which was cool.
Finally, I'd like to thank Scott for taking the time to return the Hair Curler that we had accidentally left behind - which is happening right now.
Overall, Scott and Danielle are excellent hosts which shows in their actions."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy and peaceful place was perfect for my little retreat/getaway. I can't say enough good things about it! The space was spotless, the linens were luxurious and the ambiance was like a warm hug. The hosts put a lot of effort into every detail and it shows. Even the shower head was amazing. The neighborhood is quiet and walkable. There is a path to Broad Ripple Park right across the street. It takes 10 minutes to walk to some local shops and Broad Ripple center. All in all this is one of my favorite AirBnbs. If you get a chance to stay here, do it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a great place to stay. It felt very homey for our family and had everything we needed. Scott was a great host and very welcoming and helpful. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott and Danielle’s place is a lovely hideaway in the city. It is close enough for varied dining options, endless sightseeing and entertainment and just enough away from any hustle and bustle. The ample apartment was perfect for our getaway for 3 people. We had plenty of space to gather or spread out and relax. We all agreed that the beds were cozy and comfortable for a great night’s sleep.
We truly appreciated:
-A scent free space
-Plentiful blankets and quality linens
-Window shades/blackout for bedroom windows
-Helpful suggestions for dining
-Board game options
One of our group insisted on bringing her guitar to practice and I was a bit worried the sound would carry. We could barely hear her from the other rooms in the apartment, a plus to not be disturbing anyone else!
We are so thankful that our last minute trip landed us at this apartment."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Scott's place and it was just as wonderful as the first! The surrounding park and river are so beautiful to walk through and we enjoyed playing pickle ball at the local courts all within walking distance. The home is beautifully decorated and we truly enjoyed our time there. Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We rented Scott's house for an interview shoot. Scott was extremely responsive and quick to answer any questions. The space worked great for our crew. Scott was a great host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott and Danielle were wonderful hosts and have put a lot of effort into the details of their place that make your stay relaxing. It truly was peaceful despite being minutes away from Broad Ripple. Scott and Danielle had great communication, checked in on us respectfully, and had clear instructions/expectations helping us respect their space. We visit Indy almost annually and will most definitely be back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely stay! Everything was very well thought out. Would gladly return on another trip to Indy!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Scott’s place. It was exactly as described, plus very private, clean, and comfortable. More than most other stays we’ve had recently (even perfectly good ones), Scott seems to really be on top of the details—everything was in place to make our stay hassle free and memorable. Highly recommended!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed staying at the spacious second floor location with balcony for unwinding after a long day.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us! We loved sitting out on the deck with our morning coffee and again in the evening. The 'welcome' sheet gave us a ton of information about nearby restaurants and Broad Ripple Village -- be sure to get ice cream at BRICS! We really appreciated that the hosts didn't skimp on the amenities. From the big, fluffy bath towels and name-brand body wash and shampoo to the Gevalia coffee, everything was first-rate. They even provided tennis and pickleball equipment to use at the courts a couple of blocks away. Next time we'll know to bring our tennis shoes! Would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay. Near Broad Ripple, Fashion Mall, restaurants, etc. But still quiet and relaxing. While our trip was short (one night), it was perfect for us. Scott was very responsive, unit was beyond well appointed, and very comfortable. We can'tthank you enough!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've been a Super host on Airbnb for nearly 20 years. From that perspective, I can tell you Scott and Danielle's place is the top of the top. Don't hesitate to book!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This is a great place! Very comfortable, clean, and convenient. Host was very responsive. We hope to be back next year for the Indy 500!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed here several times…Scott is a great host, it’s walking distance from everything I need, but more than that this place has such soul to it. Sitting on the deck, especially in the mornings and evenings, listening to the birds..it’s the perfect anecdote to feeling stressed and rushed. I come here to get recentered. Can’t recommend enough! Beyond that, it’s super cleaned and very nicely decorated. Beds comfortable too!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to spend the weekend! We were right next to Broad Ripple Park with walking trails and restaurants nearby. We also enjoyed spending time on the balcony, the neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. Great location and great hosts, will keep in mind the next time we need a place to stay!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott’s place was great! I’m so glad I found this gem. I would definitely try to book it again when I’m in town.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our club had 2 coaches that stayed at this property. They had nothing but good things to say about their stay. They both indicated that the property was clean, the owners were very nice and helpful, it was a great place to stay, and they enjoyed their stay."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was the last Airbnb on our roadtrip through the Midwest and THE BEST! Such a unique place, everything you need, so many cute details and a great location. Would give 6 stars if possible."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Scott's airbnb was wonderful. Check-in was very easy and the entire home was spotless. The water pressure was incredible and the amenities listed were all provided, he even left us with some snacks! I love that they use white linens because it makes the stay feel even cleaner. Comfortable beds, soft linens, and comfortable main area and kitchen. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! The house was very comfortable and clean, great water pressure and heat, and the kitchen was stocked with snacks and a few groceries, which was so kind and helpful.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very nice - it has a great balcony. It was very clean and had all the amenities and the location was great across from a park and many restaurants within walking distance.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As terrific as the house was it paled in comparison to how terrific Scott was as a host. He was very proactive in every step of the process, reaching out to me ahead of time with clear instructions and guidance. On our first night a very strong storm rolled through in the middle of the night. My wife and young daughter were incredibly frightened and I must admit I was quite alarmed. While I was grasping for answers on what to do, Scott reached out to check on us, gave us updates on the storm and offered their basement to us. He also told me where the safe places were in the house and the locations of the flashlights, should the power go out. He turned a scary, turbulent moment into one of warmth. Scott was warm, welcoming and respectful of our visit. I originally was very wary of using Airbnb because of all the horror stories I've heard. That feeling remains but with a different reason. I don't believe anyone host could come close to the service provided by Scott."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed at Scott’s with my son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Scott was a wonderful host and he hasn’t missed a thing with his BnB. It’s cozy yet spacious, furnished with anything you’d need, including snacks, and filled with personality. We loved exploring the area and it was easy to get to all the museums and sights! We enjoyed coming back each evening to this BnB. Stayed an extra night and hope to return!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Treetop Lodge was perfect for a mother-daughter weekend! The location adjacent to the park made it walkable and serene. We were close to fun restaurants and shopping. My daughter kept referring to the space as ""home"" and we truly did feel comfortable and at ease in the quiet, well-equipped space. The bedding and linens were top quality and the extra treats (cookies, kettle chips, etc.) were very hospitable. Scott included wonderful recommendations and instructions to make the most of our short trip in Indy."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our visit and hope to return!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came here from California to attend the match day celebration for our daughter who just completed medical school. We loved everything about our stay. The home was perfect. It was immaculate with lots of personality and charm. The owners clearly take pride in this home as well as hosting for others. They nailed it with the beds being perfect and the added touch of the art made this one of my favorites. Also I cant believe we had free eggs, butter, coffees and even snacks. They really go above and beyond and deserve more than 5 stars. If you are in the area this is a must stay.
The photos did not do this place Justice. It was just perfect. Parked my car in front of the door. Thank you."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place and amazing location! Would rebook in a heartbeat!

Stayed for a weekend and will definitely be returning for future trips! By far the best air bnb I have ever stayed in!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a conference and the wife stayed in. She said it was so peaceful. She read and worked on a quilt while there. Scott volunteered to help expand the table if she needed more room to quilt and sew. They had set out some packages of cookies, apples, waters, local chips and eggs. And had provided coffee to brew. I appreciated the really cool decor. It was really unique and since we have antique booths really enjoyed all the antiques and unique decorations. Usually I sleep poorly at new places. But the bed was so comfortable I slept great the whole time. Since the space is upstairs we were tired carrying everything up the stairs. But it was definitely worth the stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful stay at Scott’s home. It looked just as advertised in the listing and was perfectly located in the Broad Ripple area. I make frequent trips to Indy and hope to stay in Scott’s home again. I highly recommend.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay very much! The place was peaceful and felt like being at home. Scott messaged us to let us know about things to do at the park and to make sure things were ok. I would highly recommend staying here. Close to things and great neighborhood restaurants to eat at.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Host Scott is super friendly, responsive, and clearly cares about your comfort and experience.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our weekend stay was perfect. Couldn't ask for anything more. Scott's communication is great and his place couldn't be better. Felt very safe in the neighborhood and restaurants are everywhere. Will definitely stay again if we travel back to Indy.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Place - Hid in Indianapolis:
I’ve stayed in many places in Indianapolis. And have lived up there 3 periods in my life. This beautiful Home with the Lodge is the best place to stay in Indy when you want to see friends concerts and go shopping for quality items. Located in a prime location in a wooded area that is off the main drag of streets .The noise level is much more quiet than any other place. in metropolitan Indy. This is a real bargain for what you’ll enjoy compared to other places. The kitchen is new and well set up and has the right stuff including important items like paper towels. Very good tasting tap water because of the Brita filter. Very good TV with local channels and Roku. An easy entrance. The decor is eclectic of fine items with a travel theme to inspire your next trip. There is attention to details for all you need. Scott the host is very helpful and friendly. I really had a wonderful time there and plan to come back many times in the future when I’m living it up in the great town of Indianapolis."

It's also great to walk right out the door and be in a beautiful park and along the river."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled to Indy for a part work/part play vacation and we’re extremely happy with Scott’s space. The lodge was spacious and had plenty of room to spread out while working but also so close to the Monon Trail for biking. Comfortable beds, well appointed kitchen, endless hot water…If you’re trying to decide just stop looking and book this place! You won’t be disappointed."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host, location, and apartment was perfect. It was in a very safe, peaceful, and quiet location that was very accessible via car to all Broad Ripple spots."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Treetop Lodge was incredible! Hands down the best experience we've had at an Airbnb. Scott was easy to reach and happy to help with any questions we had. The space is so comfortable and inviting. The guide they leave for guests was so helpful - we ate at two of the restaurants they recommended and loved the walk through the park to Luciana's was delightful! We would absolutely stay here again!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, lovely, charming, clean place! It's upstairs from the host, but it's like you are the homeowner."

Scott was extremely helpful with our car issue and we felt well taken care of. The open kitchen, dining area and living room made cooking while chatting and having wine very enjoyable. Thank you Scott for a wonderful stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott was an excellent host. His place was clean and well-decorated. The house is in a great location — a quiet neighborhood with a park right across the road.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice house in a good area and close to a lot of things to do.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything from start to finish was warm and welcoming. The space itself was large enough for four people and had all the amenities anyone would need. I especially appreciated the detail to coffee. We are all about our coffee and Scott did not disappoint. Providing a good brand in both regular and decaf was perfect in everyway. The deck off the back was a wonderful place to enjoy my coffee in the morning while the sun was rising. We had never stayed in the part of town and found it convenient to the places we frequent in Carmel and Downtown. We used the park across the street quite a bit. If we had stayed longer we certainly would have used the public pool. We loved how quiet and calm the neighborhood was. This was a well-appointed apartment, in a great location, and with excellent hosts. If you visit, do yourself a favor and try Capri Restaurant, which is just five minutes away."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was absolutely gorgeous. From the balcony, perfect location, the most comfortable beds and beddings! The neighborhood is so beautiful and perfectly quiet. Scott is a perfect host and made sure that you have everything you need during your stay, he even offered to do our laundry.

It was clean and it was obvious that they also stay at Airbnb's because they put special attention into things that we all want --- extra towels, nice mattresses, welcome items, wi-fi... and more. They offered to help with anything and everything. Definitely a place I would go back to and recommend to others."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was very comfortable and convenient. We enjoyed all of the thoughtful touches and extras from the hosts and the space felt very cozy. I’m usually working when we travel, so the workspace in one of the bedrooms was really helpful. The beds and bedding were excellent and my family thoroughly enjoyed the large collection of board games. We would definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I agree with previous reviewers who stated this place is a cut above other AirBNBs we have stayed in before. We really enjoyed sitting out on the shaded deck. The best part of our stay though was how welcoming and responsive Scott and Danielle were. They go the extra mile and that was evident in every detail of our stay. We really relied on their manual to choose our food options. Bazbeaux Pizza was so good we needed to go twice!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was awesome stay and easy check in and great location and super host , if I come again to Indianapolis I will choose this place again . Thanks Scott"

The apartment was stocked with everything we needed and Scott was helpful and responsive. Broad Ripple park - right across the street was a wonderful treat - there are trails in the woods to explore, as well as the river, a playground, and a public pool! My 7 year-old was delighted! It was spotlessly clean with comfortable beds and plenty of towels. I would definitely recommend it and would stay again if we were in Indy again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a spectacular home! The Treetop Lodge was all that it promised and more. Every detail was artistic and thoughtful. We look forward to staying there again.

Lots of special touches from a welcome note, birthday greetings, snacks, eggs in the fridge, plenty of towels, extra pillows etc. I highly recommend this location. Close to downtown Broad Ripple and all of the great shops and restaurants, yet secluded and quiet at the same time. I would most definitely stay here again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in airbnbs in nine states over the past two years and this one is head and shoulders better than any in which we have previous!y stayed. First there is the location on a quiet street across from a large park near a neighborhood with many eating options. Second is the place itself with a decor that appears to be done professionally. Third is the amenities. Few places offer Famous Amos cookies; locally made chips or Gevalia coffee. Fourth, my wife says that was the best bed she has stayed in since we began traveling 47 years ago. Overall it appears Scott & Danielle have tried very hard to make thier place a step above. They have succeeded!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow this place is a hidden GEM! You truly feel like you are in a tree house surrounded by huge trees!

I will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Indy!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott’s place was very comfortable and close to great shopping and restaurants. It was also right across the street from a beautiful park which made it very convenient for walking. The house is on a quiet street which made for a great setting away from all of the traffic in other parts of Indy where I have stayed in the past.

Scott and Danielle were excellent hosts and left a pamphlet with easy instructions and details about eateries in the area. The kitchen was well appointed as was the rest of the living space! Honestly, it was by far the best night sleep we’ve ever gotten outside of our own home. It was easy to get in touch with them and they were very obliging to help us get some soccer uniforms cleaned for the match the next day. We will be staying here whenever we are in Indy again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a place near the State Fairgrounds, which are only ten minutes away. This place is awesome. It is in a quiet neighborhood, with a park across the street.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott & Danielle we’re the perfect hosts! The location was neat and clean! They left nice little treats including some local snacks.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The next time I am coming to Indianapolis, I am first checking to see if Scott's place is available.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!definitely a 5 star place. I’ll definitely be back again
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A quiet retreat setting that was so restful and comfortable. We enjoyed getting take out from nearby restaurants. The sudden cold and snow kept us from enjoying leisurely walks in the park. Next time!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place. I can't recommend enough. I grew up in Indy and came home for a week's visit and stayed here. I felt so at home. Loved sitting on the back porch among the oak trees, watching birds and squirrels. Very peaceful, I went to the park and White River every morning just outside the door. The house is beautifully arranged, beds extra-comfortable, super-clean and well decorated, nice and quiet but 5 minute drive to all the restaurants and great little shops of Broad Ripple Village. Scott the host was very helpful and welcoming. I really hope to stay here every time I come home."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I felt at home with the hospitality and decor that Scott provided. Beds were great for a restful night sleep. Location was convenient for shopping and eating. I would definitely stay at the Tree Top Lodge again!!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a lovely stay in Indianapolis. The retreat is warm and cozy and the bed was amazing. The welcome basket and extra amenities (eggs, coffee, etc) were really thoughtful. I was able to enjoy coffee on the deck and caught the dog playing playing fetch.
If you are a light sleeper it’s worth bringing earplugs for the nuts falling from the trees (they are huge), but there are also fans and a noise machine, which helped.
This was a great stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to reserve it again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was fantastic. The flat was very comfortable, and beautifully furnished. You can feel how much care and love have gone into the set up. Every detail of your stay, your every need has been accounted for from the welcome treats, to the myriad of supplies tucked away - from art supplies for kids, to extra pillows, movies, or restaurant recommendations. We really felt comfortable here and Broad Ripple is lovely!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Scott’s is like you brought your home with you. Extra comfortable bed, loads of towels (I think he has more than me), plenty of room space, quiet and safe location, great communication, anything you could possibly need. We’ll definitely stay again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, where do I begin.
First let’s go with Scott, thoughtful and really really considerate of our space and super quick with responses and anything we needed.
There was a welcome packet (packed with banter which was appreciated lol)
The house is beautiful, spacious, and this is the thing that separates it. ATTENTION TO DETAIL. Every aspect of the stay was though through as if they themselves were staying there. Down to mattress descriptions for each of the beds. There’s an incredible light above the dining room that I loved. Eat at their recommendations. I could go on. But 10/10 in every aspect. Except lugging my girlfriends 95 pound suitcase up a flight of stairs."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,loved staying here! felt like home. super comfy. hosts very hospitable! great location. will definitely return! so relaxing and serene!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The treetop lodge lived up to the other reviews. Scott was an amazing host, very nice and responsive. The amenities were perfect. Space was clean and very functional. The mattresses were WAY better quality than staying at a hotel. I would stay here again when we come back to the area."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Treetop Lodge was exactly as pictured and described on the app. It was immaculate with a capital ""I""! It was super quiet and peaceful next to the park. Which also made for a beautiful morning walk along the river. My friend and I stayed in two of our 3 nights there and just enjoyed the deck. So much nature, including warblers and a resident raccoon who shimmied down the tree and looked us in the eye. Scott was very attentive and available for any questions or notes. I would absolutely stay here again, in any season."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place that was perfect for our stay in Indianapolis. We enjoyed the back deck for drinking coffee and all the other amenities.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is beautiful. My kind of place. Very quiet and peaceful.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott was a wonderful host! We really enjoyed our stay at the Treetop Lodge and will definitely come back next time we're in Indianapolis!
Scott was so easy to communicate with and I really enjoyed talking with him. He has many interests and it's clear from how lovely the space was that he and his wife put a lot into making it beautiful and super functional!
The entrance is separate with a lock code which made it very easy to come and go.
All the amenities were great- beds extremely comfortable, different pillows to choose from that were great, soft towels and plenty of them, really nice shampoo and soap, beautiful shower with great water pressure, and lovely things in the kitchen including Starbucks coffee, eggs, chips from a local company, fruit and cookies, and cold water bottles in the fridge!
The deck from the second floor was lovely and had a great table and chairs, but it was just very hot in August so we weren't able to spend too much time outside, but it was very pleasant.
Scott was super easy to reach and very friendly. It was great as they live on the first floor with the Airbnb on the second floor so I felt very comfortable that if we needed anything he'd be right there.
They also left a great handout with all the instructions carefully laid out, eg. WIFI, etc, and also several pages of places to eat and things to do, which was all really helpful.
The whole place was spotless and extremely comfortable, with really interesting decorations and books-(some of which Scott wrote!) and interesting things around. Clearly they enjoy what they're doing and it shows in how it is set up. The AC and fans were wonderful and made it super comfortable.
Can't say enough about how great they were as hosts and how lovely the entire Airbnb was- thanks so much!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Scott’s place was wonderful! My daughter kept commenting on how she’d love to live in a place like that. Scott was a gracious host as we got in late and I was worried about disturbing them but he assured us we did not. The beds were SO comfortable. We felt right at home.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent time at Scott’s place. Highly recommended!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Scott was an awesome Host. We Enjoyed our stay here. We were here for a Fire Conference FDIC. Wish we had more time to enjoy this place. We had everything we needed and more. We will be back.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott's place is amazing! Super comfortable with everything you need to feel at home. The decor is unique and interesting with LOTS of reading material.
(We may have to spend a couple months here just to enjoy the books!) Scott and his wife, Danielle, went out of their way to ensure we were well cared for. They provided a welcome basket with goodies, eggs in the fridge and a very detailed guidebook with information about local restaurants as well as information about how to use everything in their place. Also the location is wonderful! Close to so many great places to eat and a park that has wonderful trails for walking and jogging. All and all, perfect! We didn't want to leave!"
2021-07-01,5.0,,Perfect in every way! Plenty of space. Everything I needed to cook meals in but close to many eat out options. The beds and pillows were amazing! Definitely a great night's sleep. Very quiet and peaceful surroundings. Check in and out was super easy. Scott is a fantastic host. I would most definitely stay here again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"As former (and long-time) Indy residents, we had a great experience staying in the Treetop Lodge and feeling at home in our former hometown. The space was perfect for the four of us visiting extended family in the area. We particularly loved being able to walk out the door to Broad Ripple Park and I also enjoyed listening the birdsong from the deck with my morning coffee. We would love to stay again next time we're in the area. Thanks to our hosts for providing a great home away from home!"
2021-07-01,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Treetop Lodge! It is on the edge of a quiet residential area across from a park and was so peaceful. I enjoyed sitting on the deck and just listening to the birds. Inside, everything you could need is provided and there was a welcome tray and detailed instructions about everything you will need to know. The bed was comfortable and there are plenty of blankets, pillows and towels. There are plenty of entertainment options and the kitchen has everything you could possibly need. I enjoyed it so much I wasn't ready to leave."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"#Overwhelmed ,#Inspired,#Super-Comfy, #Feltlikehome.
Scott was very responsive , Very easy instructions for self check-in , parking etc.
We were completely overwhelmed after entering the house , the welcome snacks and water provided with much needed hydration! The instructions manual is super easy and has everything that needs to be done.
The artifacts in the house , the way it is arranged , the music cds , movie dvds had more to offer than Netflix , Prime etc;
Taking cues from this house , My wife started to make a checklist of items to be bought to decorate our own.
Would love to get hands on the book once you publish it Scott.
Was able to get high speed internet that helped me to work as well.
Beds were super comfy and got a good nights sleep

Hands down one of the best Airbnb’s I stayed.
Thanks a lot for hosting us and would definitely recommend this place."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was wonderful! The entire place felt cozy and elegant at the same time. Extremely comfortable beds — just what we needed after a long day. The house is on a quiet street and so close to the park. We loved sipping coffee on the balcony and watching the birds in the morning, and we walked into Broad Ripple several times to explore and eat at the restaurants. If we’d had more time, we definitely would have rented the kayaks!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I were in Indianapolis to help our daughter move and we could not have picked a better place to stay. Scott takes care of every detail and even left eggs (!!) that made an otherwise stressful morning better. We also enjoyed a morning walk to the river in the park that's across the street. We're considering a trip to the Smokies so we can stay at Scott's on the way down. Highly recommended.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent spot! Our family of four stayed for two nights and the kids didn't want to leave! The host were incredibly thoughtful and how they've arranged the space.

We look forward to staying in the guest house again the next time we're in Indianapolis."

Great layout, well appointed, nicely decorated, very clean. High quality appliances and furnishings, with brand name disposables like bathroom tissue and hand soap, not the bargain stuff. Heated bathroom floors and an enormous walk in shower - bidet was a fun surprise. King size bed was very comfortable, as were the pillows.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"LOVED my stay here. This place isn’t 5 stars —- it’s easily 10. Location, finishes, amenities were top notch. The stylish design adds to the vibe, and i was sad to have only booked one night. Don’t event think about it — book this place now."

We didn't realize it was going to be behind another home! Missed reading that somehow. Loved the beautiful furnishings, the heated bathroom floor, the quiet heating and air unit and dog loved the fenced in back yard.
We enjoyed the little snacks, treats and offered bottled water and canned sparkling waters in the fridge. Plenty of extra blankets and pillows for sectional in living room to relax there. Liked the hot water pot to make tea. Lots of incidentals in the kitchen...nice touches everywhere.
Great job! Would definitely stay again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We especially appreciated the attention to details of our comfort, like plenty of coffee supplies, lovely thick towels & plenty of them, enough toilet paper for two people. The only thing lacking was a box of Kleenex for the bathroom."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a gem, absolutely spotless and so many nice little touches. The yard was big enough for my two corgis to run around but not big enough for them to get into trouble. I walked them on the street without any issues. The furniture is actually comfortable (not just a cast off from the main house like you'll see sometimes) and it was a very comfortable setup."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This guest house is beautiful, comfortable and extremely well-located. In fact, the pictures don't quite do it justice because of all the extra touch items like snacks, linens, toiletries and other supplies at your fingertips. The backyard is fenced in so our pup could run around and have fun. The layout and decor were very homey and pleasing. Best value I've had on Air BB!
Can't wait to come back."

I highly recommend and will book again when we go to Indy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at Collyn’s guest house, which we have found to be perfect for a one-night stop when driving through Indy. It is located was conveniently close to an I-465 interchange in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. We appreciated the fenced-in back yard — a great place for my dog to burn off some energy after spending essentially all day in the car. The snack basket was a nice touch for a weary traveler! The house is immaculate and equipped with everything we could possibly want or need. Collyn was friendly and responsive to all communication. We will definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a slight issue with the access code but Collyn was quick to respond and resolve the issue. This is a great Airbnb and I will definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Very impressed with the cleanliness, attention to detail, safe, quiet neighborhood and responsive and accommodating host. Heated tile in the bathroom was awesome. Would recommend to anyone traveling in the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at Guest House Central for GEN CON 2023 and had the best experience imaginable. The fenced in yard was perfect for our Corgi and we loved the small details like waters in the fridge, coffee pods for use and extra snacks.
The house is located on a quiet street and was very easy to locate. We had zero issues with the wifi or using the smart lock to get in. The house is beautiful with a cozy, king bed and modern bathroom that had a bidet and heated floors. We could tell immediately that a lot of thought was put into planning and maintaining this guest house. It was extremely clean and well cared for.
The only thing that could be improved is providing a map of the surrounding areas and maybe some recommendations on restaurants or things to do.
We would definitely stay here again. We had an even more enjoyable trip because of this guest house!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were travelling with two small dogs. The fenced back yard was fabulous to have. The guesthouse had everything we needed. It would be great if they were all like this. It was the perfect oasis for our time in Indianapolis.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay for our little family! It was nice to have a refrigerator and washer and dryer. The neighborhood felt very safe and was centrally located for the things we had planned around Indianapolis including the Zoo and Noblesville. I was so grateful Collyn issued a refund when I had to cancel a night last minute due to an unexpected funeral. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,If I could replicate a space for each night of my travels it would absolutely 100% be this place! Perfect go stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This guest house was perfect for a one-night stop on our drive through Indy. Both the house and the fenced-in back yard were free of junk/stuff that might have attracted the attention of my dog. The heated floor in the bathroom was a great “extra”! I’ll definitely stay there on future trips through Indy.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,One of our favorite air bnbs we’ve ever had. I wish we could have had a full 24 hours here. They thought of everything.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful guesthouse, dream bed, fenced yard for the pups and immaculately clean. Loved the layout! Will recommend to anyone."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pet friendly was what closed the deal for us. The two dogs are a little elderly and our lovely old gentleman sheds non-stop. We wish we'd been about to clean more before we left, but brooms and vacuums were locked away.
Thanks for a delightful and peaceful stay Collyn. It was such a pleasure."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stopped here for the night on our trip from Maine to Arizona and found the space so comfortable and cozy we extended our stay an extra day just to relax! One of the best Airbnb stays ever!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great stay! Clean, peaceful, and perfect for our pups!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This review will be short and to the point. After driving over 10 hours from Ontario to Indy, through heavy urban traffic and extreme summer heat, my wife and I were exhausted when we arrived at Collyn’s place. I chose it in part due to easy access to 465 North, but as soon as we walked in, we were awestruck. The detailed planning of the space was immediately evident. Fading sunlight poured in through multiple windows; the kitchen was expertly equipped; the hide-a-way washer and dryer was an added bonus; the bedroom and bath…out of this world with style and functionality! And the fenced-in back yard was much appreciated by our four-legged family member. We loved this cozy place so much that we decided to adjust our annual travel plans to Canada (from Missouri). Next year, rather than drive further north to Ft. Wayne or even Lansing, we are stopping in Indianapolis to stay with Collyn. And then repeat our stay on the way home. See you in 2024!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Have been staying at airbandb’s for 10 years and this one is in my top 5. I love stepping into a place and you know immediately you can walk around without your shoes on! And I love a place that is well constructed, my dad was a perfectionist and I notice the construction of places. Not only the cleanliness, comfort and location convenience, but the thoughtful things the host did were noticeable, from the cold water, seltzer water and snacks! So classy. Speaking of classy..you can do yoga in the shower..and the bidet and heated floor are a luxury ❤️🥰"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely loved our stay! We were in town for the evening to go to a concert and wanted to stay somewhere a little more personal than a hotel. I found this little gem and I’m so glad I did. It was easy to find, clean, and cutely decorated - with two kids at home, it was a nice change to stay somewhere free of clutter. There were some snacks and drinks and coffee for the next morning, which was great because we had such an odd schedule going on, so it was nice we didn’t have to stop somewhere just to grab some. Loved our stay and will definitely try to book here again for any future concerts!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay here. The location was private and quiet. The space was comfortable, clean, and had lots of extras like snacks and coffee, which I appreciated. The fenced in yard was perfect for our two dogs. Perfect airbnb, would recommend to anyone."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Collyn's Place was super clean, easy to find, and had everything we needed. The snack basket was a great touch since we didn'thave time for breakfast. We enjoyed our stay and would return again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Easily one of the nicest and well-appointed air bnbs we’ve stayed at. So many thoughtful touches, immaculately clean, spacious, and really private and peaceful. We had an anomalous stay due to a power outage in the neighborhood after a storm, but the hosts were great communicators and did what they could to ameliorate such a freak event. Hard pressed to find a better space or hosts in Indianapolis area. Do not hesitate to book!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This space is beautiful, modern, and has a stunning sun-drenched kitchen in the afternoons. Everything looked from out of a magazine. The bed was the softest, most comfortable experience for the perfect night's sleep and the heated floor in the bathroom was the cherry on top.
Bonus - My cat LOVED walking around in the private, enclosed back yard. This was a wonderful place to stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful little get away! Very private and peaceful. Loved the fenced in back yard and the interior of the home was beautiful! Highly recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Collyns place. We lived in Indy for many years and have now found the place we want to stay every time we visit friends- great location close to restaurants, the fashion mall, shopping, and coffee shops, the guest house was so clean and comfortable (the bed was AMAZING), and the backyard is wonderful for furry family members. This is one of the best Airbnbs we’ve visited and we recommend it to anyone staying in the Indy/ carmel/ fishers area."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing find. So peaceful, comfortable, and clean. A perfect retreat!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AirBNB Hosts should take note of how Collyn manages this property!
This guest house has been beautifully updated, is sparkling clean, has a comfortable bed and linens, lovely sets of kitchenware (along with snacks, water, and coffee!), and a huge plus for us and our two dogs, there is a secure, fully-fenced backyard.
Private, quiet, very comfortable. Collyn was communicative, and extremely responsive.
Easy location to find, and very convenient, just off of Hwy 465 and Meridian, to get around to visit our family members. Good food nearby. We will definitely be returning in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful! Tidy, well appointed, comfortable bed and pillows and spacious bathroom. We would happily stay again."

Communication and check in was quick and easy, the house was beautifully decorated and clean, and the location was great.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"2nd time staying, just as nice as the first."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place. Definitely would come back again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an awesome stay! Having our own private backyard was such a great feature. For two, this was the perfect size. Collyn went above and beyond by providing snacks and water that were much needed after a long drive. We’ll definitely be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"a very cozy and modern styled location! the heated bathroom floors were probably one of the best surprises, i definitely wish id have had more time!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place and everything was perfectly smooth.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was so much better than the average Airbnb that we have stayed in. The bed was comfy, the space was really clean and pretty much exactly what we needed after a long drive. You can tell it was renovated with good quality materials. It honestly just felt really nice to be there. The backyard was perfect too. Definitely would recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at this cute little place. Lovely decorated, with a very convenient fenced in backyard. Would highly recommend!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the perfect place! Comfy, cozy, beautifully done. Great bed and a bathroom with heated floors! Collyn thought of everything to make us feel welcome and enjoy our stay! Very private and quiet, but easy to get to. Near several restaurant (loved McAllister’s Deli). Our dogs loved the fenced backyard and so did we. If you are in Indianapolis, Collyn’s place is your home away from home. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The little house was very clean and had everything one might need. Beautiful, minimalist decorations, cozy atmosphere, and beautiful backyard patio. The area is safe and the surrounding neighbors were quiet."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"After a less than stellar hotel experience forced us to find other accommodations, stepping into this little guest house was such a relief. It was so clean and cozy and the enclosed backyard was great for our dogs, they also made themselves right at home. We were in town for a concert close by and after a long fun night it was nice to come back, take a shower, and crawl into bed. Every little detail was taken into account from the couch to the linens to the heated bathroom floor. If you like a couch you can sink into, a soft but firm mattress, velvety soft bedding, and a quiet space tucked away out of the city, I cannot recommend Nora’s Nook more."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. The guest house was larger than we imagined and had privacy. Everything looked new and clean. Very beautiful house.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay! We would stay again. Loved the heated bathroom floors. The bed was super comfortable. Private, quiet location, with a nice yard! They thought of everything."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was just amazing. Looked great, was flexible, and Collyn was a helpful and responsive host."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great place to stay! We loved our time there.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay! The place was beautiful and the hosts added so many little touches to make their guests have an amazing experience. There wasn’t anything they didn’t think of. Thank you for sharing your space with us- we hope to come back someday!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a very clean place! We loved the heated bathroom floors and the setup. Front door gave us a little trouble opening. That was the only issue. Collyn sent a bunch of info and was transparent. We would definitely book here again
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This little guest house was big in all the right ways. We loved the king bed, heated bathroom floors, and full kitchen! It was the perfect pit stop on our road trip, but I wouldn't have minded staying longer :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, clean and new. The bed and couch were comfy and the fenced-in yard in the back was a nice touch. Lots of great basics provided (body wash, shampoo, snacks, coffee). Close to the highway and lots of food/shopping while also a nice and safe-feeling neighborhood.
The only thing I'd mention is the backyard is very nice, with a small deck and a privacy fenced, but it's not fully fenced in...we were traveling with pets and it would have been nice to let them run a bit more freely, but we didn't want to take the risk of them potentially taking off since one side is open to the main house/yard and street, so just an FYI."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,La Cochera is a wonderful spot just a few minutes outside of downtown Indianapolis. The apartment has everything you need (including good water pressure and a good hair dryer!). It’s in a gorgeous spot with a lot of green space. And Kerissa is so sweet and helpful. We would definitely stay there again if/when we head back to Indy!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved Kerissa’s place! I was in town for a conference and was able to stay here for cheaper, plus it was so much nicer then any hotel I would’ve gotten! The location was extremely safe and the quiet. It was only minutes from the conference, so that was a plus! I felt totally comfortable staying here alone. I was greeted upon arrival, offered a drink, and welcomed to the area. The actual place itself was beautiful! It was nicely laid out, well-decorated, and offered many amenities! I especially loved the “fun” extra things— I bought a pair of IU silhouette earrings (handmade) from the house! That was a nice added touch!
I will definitely stay here again! 10/10 recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place to stay! Great location close venues. We really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely stay there again when we head back to Indy.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Private, quiet, modern/homey place you can veg out or go to nearby cities - such as Lawrence or downtown Indy. Depending on how GPS brings you, you may not see all the great restaurants nearby. If you leave the house and go right then when the street ends go left, all the restaurants are there. The place is open concept with an intuitive wall for the bedroom privacy. They had alcohol in the fridge for cost, coffee, fresh and clean everything. Will hopefully be able to go back."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great space! plenty of room and tastefully decorated. Host was responsive and clear with check in.

The location is about 20 mins to downtown. There was a nice little selection of restaurants close by."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay and it was even better than the first time. It is exactly as pictured and very clean. Kerissa and Carlos had the yard wonderfully decorated for Halloween. I recommend their place to all my friends.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend! Everything was perfect and really enjoyed my stay! Hands down best Airbnb I have stayed in. This place is a vibe!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful space and great, communicative hosts. Would definitely recommend to others and book again in the future!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"La cochera was an excellent place to stay. My son and I were very comfortable there and had a great stay. The place is spotless, and it is clear that Kerissa pays attention to the details. She has it decorated in such a welcoming way and has all of the essentials covered, plus covered so many extra details like portable fans, a record player, and TV remotes for both sides of the bed. She is clearly an experienced host and has thought of so many things so make a stay go smoothly. If I need a place in Indy again, this is a place I would come back to for sure!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A peaceful and beautiful place to stay, has all the things you need for a short stay, clear and easy instructions to check in and check out. 10/10 to stay at Indianapolis, would visit again when coming to watch Indy500😁"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my second stay at Kerissa's place and I must state again that this is a perfect ABNB experience. Kerissa is a first class host and her property is beyond comfortable. The ABNB is located just a few minutes from all of Indy, yet it is located in an area that feels like a nice quiet country setting. Also, it is a wonderful bargain! For less than the cost of many local hotels you can stay at this property that has LOTS of room to stretch out and relax. If you need accommodations in the Indianapolis area you should not hesitate to book here. It's great!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,truly amazing spot - you can feel the love and care this place has received. definitely recommend !

Their place was quiet and cozy and was a great stop wish we would’ve had more time to stay and enjoy their beautiful Airbnb! They did an awesome job and it’s 15 min from downtown, you can’t beat it! It was perfect!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. I can’t complain about the location, but know that this is not downtown Indy if you’re coming from out of town. But it’s on a relatively quiet street. Nice loft apartment.
The only complaint I could have at all about this place is the same complaint I have about MOST AirBnB stays these days; there isn’t “real” cable tv. There are multiple smart TVs, but you are only able to watch app type programming (Netflix, etc). That’s not really much to complain about."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here in between travel before heading to the Indianapolis airport and Kerissa’s place was perfect! It was comfortable, had great amenities and had two desks for my husband and I to work remotely from."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful comfy place to rest for a night along our drive. We were able to book last minute and Karissa made sure we were aware there were additional pillows and blankets. Thank you for a great stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kerissa’s place would rate as one of the best Airbnbs we have ever stayed at.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a lovely stay at Kerissa's. She was so accommodating and super quick to respond with any questions. The place was right on our route and a perfect stopover.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a lovely airbnb! Huge private space with all the amenities we needed. The rainstorms sounded lovely from the cozy king bed. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Indie.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great place. Extremely well designed. Very, very clean, even in corners. Cool vibe. I could not have been more pleased. Karissa and Carlos had thought of everything and it was already taken care of.
I stayed 133 nights in hotels in 2022, some of the best. This, though not a hotel, has become my favorite place to stay.
Thank you Karissa. Hospitality is your calling!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay in the loft apartment. The decor was wonderful and functional. Kerissa communicated well with us. Just know that there is a long set of steps that have to be climbed with luggage if you stay here. But, this is definitely a place worth checking out if you are traveling through Indianapolis."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and comfortable place to stay definitely would book again sometime .
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,La Cochera was the perfect space for our trip to Indy for Junior Gold! We felt safe and right at home. The accommodations were great and matched the description/pictures. Kerissa is a wonderful host and we will definitely stay again when traveling in the area!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place: we were rushed out the next day to head to Greece and she was more than accommodating.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A really cool place to stay. It was very clean. Private and secure. Everything was really nice and just how it was described. I would definitely go back. Even had two deer walk under the private balcony that night.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Beautiful apartment. private parking on premises. great for a couple or single person. it doesn't seem kid friendly to me though but I am a single. I had a wonderful peaceful time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are not enough words to describe how awesome Kerissa and her studio are. The La Cochera was immaculately clean and decorated. Pictures did not do it justice. The bed was comfortable. We enjoyed relaxing on the balcony. We have stayed in several rentals, and this is definitely one of the best. The no cleaning charge was an added bonus. Kerissa responded quickly to any questions. The weekend we stayed, there were storms and a lot of power outages. We didn't lose electricity, but it knocked out the Hvac system. She was proactive in making sure we were comfortable. They bought a portable air conditioner until the hvac system could be repaired. She communicated with us during the process. There is reason she is a superhost. This weekend, she was our superhero."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay! Kerissa was very friendly and helpful. We will be back. Everything was as described.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I want to thank Kerissa so much for being accommodating to my stay. I had an unfortunate event take place and was in a rush to find somewhere to lay my head for the night.
The place was clean, very relaxing. The wifi was great as I was also working remotely during the day. Thank you so much for the hospitality!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cool, clean space! Would recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Kerissa's La Cochera and it was as good as the first. The place is so well decorated and absolutely immaculate. Our brother and sister-in-law stopped by and they couldn't get over the place either You can tell Kerissa takes a lot of pride in La Cochera and being a great Airbnb host. Thank you Kerissa and Carlos!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful decor, private, and tremendously well kept. The only issue, which Kerissa explains in the details, is the location in Maps takes you to a different location. Using the Gymnastics gym across the street resolved that issue. Highly recommend La Cochera and we hope to stay there again when we return for another visit!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely LOVED this place it was so cute and in a great location outside the hustle and bustle, literally just loved the space!!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"La Cochera is such a lovely space! Every element shows thoughtfulness and an impeccable eye for design and function. My partner and I delighted in each new discovery.
Within the modern and elegant layout, there are several visual references to Indianapolis and Indiana so that you feel a real sense of place.
Kerissa was great about providing detailed instructions for checking in and out, even including a YouTube video to show how to use the smart lock. The message accepting our reservation was both friendly and funny! We felt so welcomed.
The simple cleaning tasks for checkout are well worth the money saved from not paying cleaning fees.
We would definitely stay here again and for longer next time!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night at Kerissa’s place while driving through Indianapolis on a road trip and it was a quiet, clean, well-decorated place to stay! It’s evident that a lot of thought has gone into the interior design and how to make the stay a positive experience for guests. Would definitely recommend!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The host was wonderful and the place was spacious, immaculate, and private. La Cochera is just far enough from Indy to be relaxed, but close enough to quickly go have fun. If you need a quiet, comfortable space as a base of Indy exploration operations - this is it!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kerissa and Carlos take great pride in their Airbnb and it shows. Their attention to detail and interior decorating was awesome. Kerissa answering all of our questions quickly and was always there to help. If you like a clean and incredibly organized Airbnb with friendly hosts and beautiful grounds this is your place. We’re already planning a return trip. I wish all Airbnb hosts put the love and care into their properties like Kerissa and Carlos. It was a pleasure from start to finish.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love staying here every chance we can! And once again Kerissa’s place was perfect! Looking forward to the next time!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely a great stay! I will be back for sure!! I loved the atmosphere and how friendly and helpful Kerissa was the entire visit!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kerissa’s place is a home away from home. She is very easy to work with. We will come back here every time we are in the area if they are not booked out! We are very happy with our stay every time. We are extremely picky where we stay and where we stay.
The location was safe and in a great neighborhood. The place was clean exactly how you would expect it!"

A great value if you ever visit Indy. We would stay here again without hesitation!"

The house was easy to find, it was impeccably clean, and it was extremely comfortable. This is a great place to relax or to do remote work. I have had many Airbnb experiences and this one ranks right at the top. The host Kerissa is the perfect Airbnb host. She ensures that you have everything that you need for your stay. Other Airbnb hosts could definitely take some pointers from her because she knows what she’s doing and knows how to make your stay comfortable, enjoyable and stress free. I can’t wait to return."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I don’t even know where to start..
First of all the place is absolutely beautiful. Kerissa has created a welcoming space that hits ya right in the feels.
Every detail was so perfectly executed it’s unreal.
Usually when you stay at a Airbnb you wish that they had remembered the.. nope. That’s not gonna happen here.
Everything you could possibly want or need is available and if it isn’t I’m 100% confident that Kerissa would be more than happy to help you obtain it.
Some things we especially loved about La Cochera..
The Crosley self contained record player with Jack White ( among others) vinyl.
The bed/ bedding.. Luxury to the max
The well thought out space.. Tv in the Living room area and bedroom both!
The chandelier above the kitchen table is GORGEOUS!!
The beautiful Chicago brick tiled shower/ bathroom. So good.
The place is like a huge studio apt but it feels like 4 separate spaces because of the way it was designed and executed. It’s really breathtaking.
It’s was VERY clean and well..
I just can’t say enough about this place.. it is literally THE most incredible Airbnb that we have stayed at or could even imagine staying at!
It’s so nice and quiet and even has a fire pit for those cool Autumn evenings! The property itself is a easy 15 min drive from Indy and has all kind of local places to eat/ shop. Communication with Kerissa was a breeze! She made check in/ check out so incredibly easy.
We loved our stay at La Cochera so much and can’t recommend it enough!
Thank you so much again Kerissa!
La Cochera… It’s not a place.. It’s a feeling!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing above and beyond hospitality! Very helpful about the area and offering suggestions on where to go! The place is quiet and it feels very private once you are inside. Very clean and spacious! The ambiance is super cool and fun! Kerissa is very easy to get a hold of and she makes sure you are well taken care of! Its nice to be outside the city yet close enough for dinner and activities too! We plan to come back but hopefully for a longer next time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My bf and I came to stay here for a concert and we loved it! One of the best places I’ve stayed at! So clean and cozy!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A wonderfully clean and convenient place to stay. I stopped in during a cross country road trip.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"La Cochera is the best place we've stayed at in any city by far! We were only in Indy for two days, wish we could have stayed longer. It's so clean and peaceful!

Can’t wait to come back!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place with top notch communication and thoughtfulness. We loved the decor and wish we had more time to actually spend inside the Airbnb. Worked well for my partner and I to stay at while attending a pickleball tournament. His sister had zero complaints about the pullout coach. Loved the laundry and kitchen. Truly had everything we need. Communication was second to none. Kerissa made herself available for everything we needed and is very dedicated to providing a good experience. She even put fresh mint on the balcony for us! We will definitely stay again if we return to the area.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome stay in Indianapolis! Would stay again 10/10!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for something close to Indy, but also quiet and scenic, this is the spot!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything about our stay was perfect - super comfy bed, lots of room for the kids to play (Kerissa even set up a little tepee for the kids to play in!), clean space, plus a relaxed hip vibe from the decor. Communication was consistent and reliable from the hosts. The record player was a fun touch to the space too! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with the kids. If we ever need to stop for the night in Indy again, would book this place in a heartbeat!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I have stayed here before! I love this place! it's amazing! One of my most favorite Airbnb's. I would stay more often if it was available. The host is fantastic!!!! Highly recommended!!!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is my top Indy pick!! Hands down!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kerissa is the consummate host. The experience was perfect and I cannot wait to go back. No where could you find a hotel for the price, with the amenities, and SPACE! For fall, it's heavenly, for spring it's heaven scent, for winter it's celestial, and for summer, euphoric."
,,,"Save your money and stay in a motel 6, at least there won’t be random guests coming in and out at all hours of the night. And it might be cleaner too. The bathroom and kitchen were gross!"
,,,She had an aggressive dog
,,,"I work in public safety and while looking for permanent housing in Indianapolis I booked this for long term stay (roughly 2 months?). I arrived night one and ended up leaving the next morning. There is one bathroom for three rooms that may have multiple people staying in them at a time, this isn’t a problem. The problem is that the fridge “for anyone to use” has absolutely no room due to their other long term guest having it piled high with their things. Along with this, there was a hair straightener sitting in the bathroom with hair hanging from it and hair all over the sink from other guests. The shower had discoloration (I have photos), there was a couple nats flying around (I have photos), the floor was dirty, the toilet seat had urine on it (the night of arrival and the following morning), the other guests remained awake laughing and talking loudly/listening to music until 1am (roughly) and I called the host and she had to ask them to quiet down. They were back up at 5am making just as much noise. (Continuing to the next morning) There was socks laying in the common area, urine on the toilet seat again and a strong foul odor. We left the residence and immediately called Airbnb. All photos were sent to them and multiple agents agreed that it was disgusting (on a recorded line). Due to covid their response times were delayed by two weeks causing us to not get a full refund. If you care about your health and want to stay somewhere that you don’t feel disgusting, this would in my entire personal opinion not be the place for you. She advised if we cancel that we can get a refund atleast of the remaining days, we did not receive that and now we are fighting for it even though we have it in writing directly from her. The moral of the story: the host failed to maintain the property and order and cleanliness of the property."
