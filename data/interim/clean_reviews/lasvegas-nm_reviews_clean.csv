2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would absolutely keep this space in mind to use again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Adorable place! Very comfortable. Beautiful kitchen and bath. Definitely recommend
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Las Vegas NM is full of hidden gems, and this home was one of them. Well located and lovely hosts."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a magical place. It is a perfect retreat for a few days on your own.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This small house is very nicely decorated in a New Mexico style. The kitchen is big with lots of cooking utensils, and our host provided some fresh eggs from his chickens! The host lives just across the small yard from the house, so handy if you need anything. It was a little strange that one of the bedrooms did not have a door - just an archway into the living room. Otherwise, it was a nice place to rest after our days exploring."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent, cozy home for my family and me."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jim is a great host and made sure we have everything we need for our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great little house with a lot of character. It is a cozy and comfortable home and I especially loved the details of the curated decor, rugs, and furnishings throughout. The well appointed kitchen allowed us the flexibility to cook (ü•∞ the gas range and retro fridge). Beds were comfortable and access to TV, WiFi, and an assortment of books was nice for winding down once we were in for the evening. Although they had recently gotten snow, I could imagine having coffee and reading a book on the stunning sun porch had we more time in our visit. Located in a quiet neighborhood and easily walkable to the nearby Plaza. I had the chance to meet both the hosts during our stay (one at their lovely Weave+Gather shop in town and the other stopped by as I was unpacking the car) as they live/work locally. Check in and check out was easy, price was fair given the quality of the home and amenities, and the host was timely and helpful in their communication. Would absolutely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Step into a home that feels like a hug from around the world. We had the best time simply embracing the casita~so much character and lovely decor. The hosts put a lot of love into the house, and you‚Äôll feel it! Excellent location just off the Plaza! Rachel, Jim and their beautiful home are welcome additions to the heart of Las Vegas‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect spot, an easy walk to lots of shops and restaurants yet felt private and quiet. The house was very clean and cute and the beds were super comfy. The kitchen has everything you need to cook a full meal, lots of utensils and supplies and a good selection of spices. We loved the gas fireplace which kept the house cozy and the hosts were available and very nice. A really great place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim's home was a wonderful place!! very warm and inviting, super comfortable!! Jim is such a nice guy, very helpful with all of my questions!! with as much as i travel to Las Vegas, I will definitely be checking to see if this home is available from now on!!! Thanks for being so awesome!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim‚Äôs home was awesome and nice. Worked perfect for us with tons of great decor. All areas of the home was clean and stocked well. Felt like home. Thanks again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vegas is a charming town and Jim's house was such a pleasure to stay in! A couple of blocks from the town green, close to everything yet completely quiet at night for the best sleep. Soft sheets and towels, bright kitchen and front sun room, just perfect. Loved it!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful refurbished space with beautiful finishes and furnishings, in walking distance from the Las Vegas plaza. Great communication and flexibility were also a plus. Thank you Jim and Rachel!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely place to stay, great location, very walkable to plaza and restaurants nearby. Beautifully decorated, lovely feel in the home. Great kitchen, bathroom/shower, sleeping and seating areas. Would love to go back and stay again! It was a perfect place to stay whilst in Las Vegas, close to so many things, appreciated the walkability!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Highly recommended.
Jim was as friendly and accommodating a host as they come, and the home was both beautiful and immaculate. Location is perfect - walking distance to the historic plaza but tucked away off a side street down in a shady grove, plenty of peace and quiet.
We'll be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was exactly what we needed .
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jim & Rachel did a great job preparing this spot for my arrival! We had a torrential hail storm the day I arrived and the casita held up really well! Would love to visit again. Be sure to check out their shop!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jim & Rachel's Downtown Bungalow was a better than expected in LV delight. Historic bungalow is freshly renovated, the kitchen & bath are bright & beautifully appointed with all one could want. Lovely antiques, intriguing books & ethnic textiles throughout - learn more about by visiting their shop, Weave & Gather, on the Plaza, a treat of local & rare imported treasures. Appreciated energy conservative appliances & heat pumps that maintained VERY comfortable temp in near 100 weather. Rachel even gave me a compost bucket. Will recommend & return. Thank you for a great time!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the stay! Close to everything but still private and quiet.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. Perfect location and great feel to the home. Will stay there again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful historic casita just minutes from downtown. We enjoyed our stay and all the cozy amenities. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating of our needs. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again soon!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay! Comfortable space and very clean. The hosts were extremely friendly and responsive. The location is great! There are several shops and restaurants within walking distance. I would highly recommend staying here!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This bungalow is much nicer than the pictures show! The surroundings are lovely and the overall setting is peaceful and isolated, but a short walkable distance to the plaza. Jim was friendly and available when needed. My husband and I highly recommend this gem in Las Vegas."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super sweet bungalow just steps off the central plaza in Las Vegas, yet feels like you're in the countryside. Jim and Rachel have thought of everything. Cozy couch in front of the fireplace, fully stocked kitchen, comfy beds, interesting books, and lovely artwork and plants. Highly recommended."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the bungalow, Jim and Rachel were kind, thoughtful and very helpful hosts. The house was beautiful and easy to stay at, only one minute from the plaza for restaurants and plenty of things to do. We especially loved the kitchen which had every amenity we needed. The bathroom was beautiful and had our favorite local spa's shampoo and conditioner. The living areas had plenty of books, games and gorgeous art. It was so restful to stay there. We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you Jim and Rachel for making our trip so much easier, beautiful and peaceful."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are so pleased with our stay -
Jim and Rachel treated us so well. We were greeted with fresh eggs from their coop, and fresh produce. This is a beautiful clean and cozy historic home that they have renovated and decorated with amazing fiber textiles and photos. It‚Äôs got a wonderful kitchen. While it‚Äôs so conveniently one block from downtown and a quick walk to the university, their home has a wonderful sense of privacy. It‚Äôs one of two homes on this acre-sized farm with fruit trees and chickens. The boxer Jack Johnson stayed and trained at the next door neighbor‚Äôs house :) Jim and Rachel also own a really beautiful fiber textiles store downtown and will be offering weaving courses, and yoga retreats. We loved our stay in the city of LasVegas and can‚Äôt wait to return."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Colin‚Äôs home was very clean and peaceful. House was great for a work trip.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Colin was great! We had a great time at the Ranch. The location was perfect and not too far from town. Thank you for the brunch and helping with other accommodations. We appreciate you. We highly recommend it, and will be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great stay! The Leaping Deer Ranch was beautiful in its entirety, with comfortable, spatious, clean and well maintained accommodations and a great overall energy. We particularly enjoyed exploring the nearby ridge and cave (watch out for cacti!) with our children, under the guidance of the adorable dog Fluffy. The horses and deer on property were friendly and enjoyable. The impressive Labyrinth, yoga deck and general vibes of the area contributed to a great spiritual energy to our stay. Colin was an attentive and gracious host. We highly recommend and will definitely come back!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was spacious and sprawling. Lots of bedrooms to fit a lot of people comfortably. My family was able to stay in one place and relax together. Beautiful scenery and peaceful.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Great place for a work retreat - it was a beautiful opportunity for us to reconnect as a team.
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"This is everything the description. A pristine ranch/retreat center off the beaten path with all of the amenities that you will need. Full kitchen (really nice dishes and utilities), a fully functioning hot tub, and acres upon acres to explore. Go explore the local towns and enjoy the day time excursions, but at night make sure to light the fire and enjoy the clear night sky. I took a group of 10 people here to get away from the craziness of every day life, and Leaping Deer did just that. You are going to love the place so much that you will want your own Leaping Deer swag. Colin is around when needed and happy to answer any questions. He even stayed up late for us to drive into town during a rather tough blizzard with whiteout conditions. Can‚Äôt say enough about how incredible this stay was. I fully recommend Leaping Deer Ranch"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place for a big company. Very private and beautiful. Colin is a very responsive and helpful host. Great stay overall!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the most wonderful vacation at the ranch! Colin and all the either are so kind and helpful. The home itself was spacious, well decorated and stocked with anything you could need and the property was breathtakingly beautiful. We can‚Äôt wait to back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Leaping Deer Ranch is spacious both inside and outside. It was perfect for our large family gathering. Recent heavy snows made getting our van down the road a little tricky but luckily Colin was there to lend a hand. We really enjoyed our stay, from the friendly dog Fluffy to visits to the horses to hiking the ridge to the cozy fireplace."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely love this place! This was our second year here for a family get together.This place is so peaceful and beautiful. We loved exploring the property and the star gazing was amazing, especially from the hot tub. This house is so well stocked. The kitchen had plenty of spices and gadgets. There are lots of towels and extra blankets. There are several areas for sitting, visiting and plenty of space to spread out. This is such a good place to relax. We hope to make it an annual destination."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the most grand house we have stayed in. The design, views, lighting, decor, unique artworks, and the expansive nature of the rooms are all outstanding. The photos do not do it justice. Not to mention the beauty and tranquility of the ranch itself! I cannot leave out the stunning night sky which was among the best we‚Äôve seen. This home is a unique blend of luxury and comfort in a beautiful natural setting. New Mexico at its best. Would highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great location!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay with Colin and the rest of the staff. The property is truly stunning. Peaceful. Spacious. Very relaxing. Inside was beautiful and comfortable for our larger party. All amenities as described. We made day trips into Taos and Santa Fe. Would love to come back for spa services.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Leaping Deer Ranch perfectly accommodated our group of 9 guys who were visiting New Mexico on an annual retreat. The ranch is very unique and has many things to do. Colin & team were very accommodating during our time - with pig roast, fresh chicken eggs, shooting range, on site massages. We hope to be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic getaway for our group. Highly recommend the Wild Sol Sanctuary onsite as well.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We knew exactly what we wanted when we booked our place. We wanted a ranch with space and Colin‚Äôs place was exactly that. It was conveniently located between Taos and Santa Fe. It was beautiful and quiet and we couldn‚Äôt be happier! Thank you very much!
Matt"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town with a film crew and the space was great for our group. Lots of space, comfortable bedrooms, and big community areas for us to work and hang out. Colin was easy to communicate with and was quick to address any issues or questions that came up."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my 4th time staying at Leaping Deer Ranch and can‚Äôt say enough good things about the place and the staff. Colin is A+ and I got to meet Shami (sp). The ranch itself is beautiful and each time I visit there seems to be more amenities added. Outdoor movie theatre is now operational. My favorite thing to do is grab a drink and sit on the porch on the wheel bench to watch the setting Sun well into dusk and listen to the crickets. If you ever want to explore northern New Mexico, give Leaping Dear Ranch a try."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Great stay at the ranch. Colin was great. We‚Äôd love to come back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a wonderful location for a large group of people. Everyone had plenty of space and the accommodations were excellent. I would book this location again in the future. My family had a very good time!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Leaping Deer Ranch is a GREAT place to get-away. Although it appears to be used for larger wedding parties and gatherings, my wife and I were lucky enough to be able to book it for a 4 night anniversary getaway. All was as described in the listing. Colin is responsive and lives on-site. We didn't even scratch the surface of the available outdoor opportunities. A beautiful 20 mile drive to Mora, and a simple 10 mile drive to Las Vegas, you have access to anything you might need. Booking a massage on-site is HIGHLY recommended. Looking forward to a return trip in the warmer months."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a family reunion for the second time at Leaping Deer Ranch, great location convenient to Red River, Santa Fe, and lots of great time spent on the ranch just enjoying family. A buetigul spot to get away!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,An amazing and beautiful placed villa with immense privacy. I was able to have a ladies/my bachelorette weekend here and it was everything I dreamed of and more!! Everything you need is accessible and the owners are nearby for any help :) 11/10 would recommend!!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Leaping Deer Ranch was the perfect location for our small outdoor wedding! Due to COVID-19, we needed to keep our wedding small, and the ranch was the perfect size to accommodate ourselves and our 9 guests. The ranch is spacious and well decorated, which made the perfect backdrop for our reception; the large dining room table was even able to comfortably seat the 11 of us! The location of the ranch is about 1.5-2 hours from an airport, depending on if you fly into Santa Fe or Albuquerque, so our guests rented cars and there was ample parking at the ranch. The ranch is also located ~15 minutes from Las Vegas, NM, which was incredibly convenient for getting groceries. We ordered our reception dinner from The Skillet in Las Vegas, which is a restaurant/bar that also hosts karaoke Thursday nights at 9; the food was delicious and karaoke was a blast! Leaping Deer is also just a great place for hanging out and relaxing. We spent a lot of time in the hot tub, gazing at the stars - we even saw shooting stars! The land itself is stunning and has spectacular views, especially when you hike up the hillside with Fluffy the adorable resident malamute. Our first night there we were also treated to a giant double rainbow right out in front of the ranch! There were a few hiccups here and there, such as the refrigerator in the kitchen being broken, so we relied on a smaller one that was kindly setup for us on the porch. Also, one of our guests found a scorpion in their room, so be careful to always shut doors behind you and don't open windows without screens. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and we're very grateful to Colin and the crew for such a pleasant time!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing. The house is very roomy and big enough for a large gathering. The kitchen is well stocked. Everything was very clean and the descriptions as accurate. The view in the morning is gorgeous.
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,"This place is exactly what we needed! I came with 6 other friends to find a refuge from our city lives for the month of February. The house is spacious so we all had plenty of space; the property is huge and a lot of fun to explore, with curious horses and a playful husky wandering around as well. Would highly recommend."
2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Leaping Deer Ranch was the perfect family getaway. We skipped the beach and decided to do a socially distant trip out west, and the ranch did not disappoint! The house was so large that everyone had their own room, with many empty to spare, giving us some much-needed space after months of quarantining together. We enjoyed the extremely well-appointed kitchen, the seemingly endless covered porch, the majestic sunrises across the landscape, and the cozy fireplaces. The kids enjoyed our daily hikes around the property, climbing to find the cave, collecting eggs, and feeding the horses with Colin. We were sad to leave and only wish we could have stayed longer!"
2020-10-01,4,Group trip,This ranch was clean and rooms comfy.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a beautiful and private getaway! Everything you need is there. The kitchen is fully stocked with cookware and appliances, even a Kitchen Aid mixer, and Vita Mix blender. I loved the large professional gas stove. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. Sleeping there was fantastic. Colin is a great host. He provides a private,
professional atmosphere and offers complete privacy. We felt very safe."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such an amazing time for my husband 50th! The home was spacious and clean. The staff was amazing and helpful. We collected eggs with the kids and went in search of horses. We hiked to the cave and the guys shot guns at the private range. These guys really went out of their way to make our trip amazing and I can‚Äôt thank them enough. The kids had no need for iPads as they had so much outdoor adventures. As adults we had plenty of space to unwind and enjoy the stunning view. You won‚Äôt be disappointed if you book here.
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"My friends and I had a lovely stay at the ranch. It was just five of us and we used our time to relax, explore the property, and cook. The kitchen is exceptionally well stocked, and we were able to cook and bake delicious things without any problems. I highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Leaping Deer Ranch is absolutely stunning & the perfect place for a family or friend reunion. Our party included three generations with two grandparents, two sets of parents, & four kids ranging from 5 to 1 year old. The house is so spacious that everyone commented on how we could easily double the size of our party without any issue. Plus it‚Äôs very kid & dog friendly. The kitchen is incredibly well-stocked with appliances, serving ware, & other kitchen essentials (spices, cooking oils, coffee filters, paper towels, etc). The eight-person hot tub is a huge plus & only adds to the luxurious feel of the place. I hope to be back soon & highly recommend Leaping Deer Ranch for its beautiful views of NM vistas, its relaxing vibes, & its come as you are attitude."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Leapong Deer Ranch offered an amazing setting for my wedding. It had everything to offer! You will not regret booking here!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"The ranch house is beautiful, with views for miles. There are lots of places to relax and recharge while enjoying the mountain vistas of northern NM. We had a wonderful stay!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,From the moment we arrived to the time we checked out we completely enjoyed our stay. Everything was super clean. Everyone had their own space to spread out and do their own thing.
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely magical! We stayed at the ranch for a few nights to celebrate two birthdays and we have an amazing time! The picture do not do it justice, everything is very well thought out and Collin and everyone else who works there are super helpful and willing to do whatever they can to make it a memorable experience. We already booked our next trip!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great experience staying at Colins place. We wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything! Very comfortable and very clean. Will definitely come again!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property and house. The hummingbirds were so much fun to watch. My kids loved having their own bedrooms and bathrooms.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to LDR to host our wedding - due to COVID, we postponed. When we decided to keep our reservation for a romantic getaway, we discovered LDR was a magical, tranquil, and fascinating place - cathedral ceilings, intricate tile work, a fully stocked kitchen, the most majestic night sky, and fresh eggs right from the coop. Colin and crew were hospitable yet gave us full privacy...plus Fluffy is a delight. We will return!"
2020-07-01,4,Group trip,Tranquil and quiet. Nice spot to unwind and enjoy the big sky.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful place - we really enjoyed our time at Leaping Deer Ranch. Our kids loved exploring the property, including the chickens, horses, and Fluffy the ranch dog. Collin and team were very helpful and our stay was the get-away we needed. Hope we get the chance to come back some day."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Amazing panoramic views from worlds best front porch! Feels like your own private luxury resort. Spacious and spotless.
Owner is super thoughtful and kind."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Leaping Deer Ranch. I couldn't have asked for a more accommodating location to hold our wedding ceremony and reception. We are both into the outdoors but knew we needed to provide comfort and amenities to our guests. Thus, making Leaping Deer Ranch a perfect location for our wedding. Colin (the owner) is extremely professional and the staff were all very helpful. The Master Bedroom has the biggest bathtub I've ever seen. A nice bubble bath was perfect addition to ease away my stress the day before the wedding . Also, the kitchen is a Professional Chef's dream come true! We didn't have our event catered but with the help of this spacious kitchen we were able to prepare enough food (and more) for all 57 of our guests."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My wife and I had a great time here along with our puppy. Was super clean, the property the house is located on was great, and lots of hiking within an hour of the VRBO."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a phenomenal experience! This place is 186 acres of magic! We took multiple walks to the gate daily for exercise/view (.65 miles each way). We fed the four friendly horses that roam the property (often times exploring). We ate fresh eggs daily and got to get them from the chickens themselves. We hiked the mountain behind the big house and found a cool cave and a giant hole we called, ""The Pit of Doom"" (it sounds scarier than it is haha). We enjoyed each other's company (was kind of like a family reunion - 13 of us at one point including 6 adults and 7 children; youngest was 4 and it was totally appropriate/not dangerous). We relaxed in the jacuzzi. We ran, we played, we cooked. We shot our pellet gun and crossbow at the range. It was such a special time. Colin was fantastic. At first, the thought of ""sharing"" the ranch didn't seem as appealing. However, we were happy Colin was there and really hardly saw him! There are folks that work there as well, but we hardly saw them too (and they were super friendly when we did). It was a relief Colin was there when we realized we needed things (eggs, horse treats, etc.). It was also nice to get a tour of the place at check-in. We felt like we had the best of both worlds - hospitality and privacy.
Leaping Deer Ranch is magical. We hope to return and I highly recommend you stay there."
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay here! There are so many places to explore and great views. Fresh eggs in the morning from the chicken coup and a hot tub to relax.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing. It was so peaceful and quiet. The kids had a wonderful time exploring. There was tons of room. They got to feed the chickens and get eggs. Go on hikes every day. Couldn‚Äôt be better.
2020-03-01,4,Group trip,"This ranch is gorgeous, with beautiful views from the ridge and comfortable spaces all over the house, indoors and out. Our large family group of 12 adults and 6 little kids was able to spread out and be comfortable with almost no need to ever leave except to buy more groceries (just 10 miles away!). So much room to play, hike, rest. And the hot tub was large and comfortable for a small crowd.
The kitchen was fantastic for a big group who loves to cook. We really enjoyed the huge range and the convection oven, and the wine fridge!
The place is quality, and a really good price. Colin and his team were accommodating and helpful. HIGHLY recommend this place for a large group gathering or family reunion."
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,"Colin's ranch is amazing. We were there for a weekend getaway with friends and it couldn't have been more perfect, from the lovely views, the clear night sky, and the very sweet ranch dog, Fluffy, that greeted us. The rooms were palatial, clean, and plentiful. Thanks again!"
2020-02-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home. Not very clean. The host made me feel really unwanted, he was very worried about the next guests coming. I had higher expectations."
2020-02-01,5,Group trip,We used this space for a retreat for our chorus. Everything was amazing and we had everything we needed. Colin built us a bonfire and we sang around the fire and made s‚Äômores. It was a great weekend!
2020-01-01,5,Group trip,"This home was perfect for our group of ten women. We had enough different spaces in the house to play games, cook together in the wonderful kitchen, all sit together at meals, complete a puzzle, read, crochet, and generally relax. The sleeping accommodations are very comfortable and the staff was very helpful. We enjoyed a nice fire in the fireplace and appreciated being resupplied with wood. We will return!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leaping Deer is such a gorgeous, wonderful place! My husband and I got married here and I went to the ranch for my bachelorette party. Both were amazing experiences. Colin and Matt are great, helpful hosts, and Fluffy is an excellent hiking companion."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my family‚Äôs second time spending Christmas at the Leaping Deer Ranch and it was once again, a great experience. We all wished we could spend another week there. It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs comfortable, the kitchen is a dream for cooking for large groups, and Colin and the other folks on the property are very friendly. I took the time to walk through the labyrinth and it was so cool! It must have taken a lot of effort to build it and I‚Äôve never seen anything like it."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed spending our family Christmas at this beautiful, spacious ranch. There were 16 of us and we never felt crowded. We enjoyed soaking in the hot tub, hiking in the hills behind the house, walking the labyrinth, visiting the horses and exploring the surrounding area."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the getaway. Beautiful home. Comfortable. Once we arrived, we unloaded and never left. It was a lovely space to relax, spend time with my family, and have access to so much space and adventure. Loved it. Will go back."
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful and luxurious home with the best sunrise and sunset! My friends and I (n = 9) did a writing and yoga retreat for 5 nights.This was the best place to do it. One of it‚Äôs best kept secrets is Colin‚Äôs cooking. I highly recommend that people who stay here hire the host to prepare their meals. Breakfast, lunch and dinner! They were able to accommodate our different culinary needs - vegan, vegetarian and carnivores. And some of us had the chocolate cake Colin baked for our first night and some said it was the best they have ever had!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely setting with ample amenities! Our large family includes children, teens, and fur babies; we ALL enjoyed our stay!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had our wedding at Colin‚Äôs ranch this past weekend and wow I cannot say enough positive things about Colin himself, his ranch hand Matt, and the ranch as a whole.
Not only us, who were partial to the ranch from the start, but every other person who attended our wedding this weekend spoke highly of the ranch and its natural beauty. We all absolutely loved the house, too. The kitchen allowed us to cook breakfast together and enjoy the community of our friends in the days leading up to the wedding and after. The fireplace in the front entrance was perfect for sharing old stories and laughing together. The formal dining room was picturesque and perfect for signing our marriage license in as well as for sharing meals and memories with friends and family. The master bedroom was INCREDIBLE. The tub large enough to comfortably fit two adults was icing on the cake! The bed and pillows were a dream to sleep on, and the candles that were made available throughout the space added a beautiful sense of romance to the place.
My new husband and I enjoyed the rooster crows through the entire weekend and Fluffy, the ranch dog, made each part of the weekend that much more fun. We love dogs and fluffy was perfect have around. She spent time with us on the porch, visited us during our reception, and played with us and our bridal party in one of the grass fields during our photo session just after the ceremony.
Colin and Matt even attended a post-reception bonfire and shared some great stories. Colin also talked to us about the meaningfulness of having our marriage at the center of the rock labyrinth. We were not able to walk the labyrinth in entirety during our stay this time, but we would absolutely love to return with more family and friends in the future to walk the labyrinth make more memories at this beautiful and very special ranch.
Thank you both for a perfect stay."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Was a great few days with extended family, and Colin was a great host. The atmosphere is very relaxed and captures the New Mexico vibe well. Was really great having Fluffy accompany us on hikes around the property."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnb experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Colin is an amazing host and his property is such a beautiful place.
2019-10-01,4,Group trip,"We were looking for a rustic venue, in a majestic setting, for my daughter's wedding where we could house and host a large group of people. Leaping Deer Ranch was perfect. The location of the ranch is nestled in the hills with sweeping vistas. There was a lot of space to gather and relax and on the porches surrounding the ranch house. The kitchen and great room easily accommodate 50+ people . The Kitchen itself had everything we needed including multiple ovens and dishwashers and utensils. Colin was very attentive and quick to respond if we needed anything. All in all , we had a great experience. If you are looking for a secluded, rural location with access to hotels and stores, as well as, hiking and hot springs then Leaping Deer Ranch is your place."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leaping Deer Ranch is a true gem! We recently had our wedding here and it was everything we dreamed of and more!
Colin is a great host and his property is immaculate. You can feel the hard work and love that he puts into the space. He was extremely helpful in answering our questions and accommodating our needs. He is easy going and truly wants his guests to enjoy their stay.
The ranch housed our entire families comfortably. We had a beautiful ceremony in the outdoor labyrinth and a fun reception in the event hall. We were able to customize the space to our liking and it was great to have tables, chairs, linens, and place settings already available.
The ranch has many other special touches. We enjoyed the beautiful fiber art in the house, the hot tub, fresh eggs from the chickens, visits from the hummingbirds, hikes led by the house dog, Fluffy, the horses, and star gazing at night.
You will enjoy every minute of your stay here. It is so peaceful and serene. We will definitely be back again!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Leaping Deer Ranch is an experience rather than a place to stay. The grounds are lovely and beckon to be walked and the house has charm, comfort, and art to take in in every room. The hot tub was a fabulous way to unwind after an eventful day. We had our wedding and rehearsal dinner at the ranch and all our guests commented on the beautiful landscape and property. Every one thoroughly enjoyed their stay and Colin was always prompt with answers and available if we had a need. Overall, we had an amazing stay at Leaping Deer!"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,"Our experience at Leaping Deer Ranch was absolutely amazing. After searching through over 30 other venues, we finally found this oasis of tranquility. Colin was a fantastic, and attentive host. From the start, Colin helped us with information about the property & specifics that were invaluable to the planning. From working with the caterer to helping us accommodate our 12 guests, to building a frame for our group activity, he was always gracious, patient and friendly. The property, regardless of the beautiful photos on the advertisement, is understated. Every guest at attendance was blown away by the beauty, peacefulness, and amenities of this wonderful property. We highly recommend Leaping Deer Ranch to any couple or business looking for an event venue. It will probably be considerably less expensive compared to other comparable locations, without sacrificing any of the luxury. A+"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had our wedding at Colin‚Äôs ranch and wow, I simply cannot express enough what an incredibly picturesque space it has turned out to be. The ranch is peaceful, enormous, and gorgeously appointed. We would watch the hummingbirds every morning before coffee and got some simply incredible pictures on the grounds. The event space is completely stocked with chairs, plates, etc. Perfect for hosting an event. :) Finally, there was not a single thing we wanted for the entire weekend. Colin is brilliant and kind, and his story with the ranch is an inspiring one. Would absolutely recommend. :)"
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,Leaping Deer Ranch is a fantastic stay for a family getaway! Breathtaking views and a friendly host made our stay perfect. We loved how everyone in our family had their own space to relax and other spaces to get together and hang out
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay in an exceptional home. Colin is a perfect host and provides a relaxing and stress free environment.We are looking forward to our next visit!
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,"Third consecutive year staying at the ranch. Great place for a large group extended stay, or just a couple nights along the way, like my group. Relaxing."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Leaping Deer Ranch was the perfect place for our wedding, and spending a long weekend with friends & family. Colin was great and very accommodating, helping to make our day perfect.
The ranch is spacious with spectacular views from every direction. The fully stocked kitchen and grill allowed us to cook for our big group and enjoy spending time with everyone with plenty of space.
We had sides catered for the reception through the Skillet (in Las Vegas), in combination with a roasted pig that Colin and team took care of for us on property. Everything was delicious!
So many of our friends and family told us it's the best wedding they've been to, and we have Colin & Leaping Deer to thank for a big part of that. It was our best day ever. Thank you!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Lots of space. Great kitchen. Many nearby places for excursions.
2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The ranch house was spacious and clean. The main kitchen has a lot of cupboard and counter space and has 3 sinks! The wide covered porch the surrounds the entire ranch house was enjoyed by the children and adults alike. Four of the largest bedrooms have their own private full bathrooms! Great views!
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were very comfortable at the Leaping Deer Ranch! Very cozy!
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful time with our kids and grandkids. We would definitely do it again without hesitation. Collin made it a wonderful experience and was quick to respond to requests or questions.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Our entire family loved The Leaping Deer Ranch. It was spacious and the wrap-around porch was delightful. The wildflowers were lovely as was the labyrinth. The event hall was a great space for my mother‚Äôs 90th birthday party.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Colin was an excellent host!
We fed the horses treats multiple times, collected fresh eggs from the chickens, went on hikes with Fluffly the ranch dog, did yoga as a group, had on-site massages and used the range for target shooting and archery!
If you are looking for a great get-way this place is a gem!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The leaping deer Ranch is spectacular as was our host Colin and his helper Matt. We had our wedding there and basically a large family reunion. We had between 15 and 20 people sleeping there each night and a family dinner of almost 50 one night followed by a party of over a hundred people the next day. This place and host accommodated us very well. The beautiful indoor and outdoor spaces and even the town of Las Vegas had something for everyone. Our host provided us with a pig roast or matanza which ended up keeping him working until 2 in the morning to get it cooked! We can't thank Colin and Matt enough! We were able to have the most precious ceremony in the middle of the labyrinth with even a little bit of thunder in the distance but under gorgeous New Mexico Blue Skies. This place was magical. Come see it.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,"I‚Äôve been to a lot of AirBnBs, but this is by far the most grand. Majestic and yet serene. Supremely appointed with room for many, yet, perfectly romantic for two. Close to the beautiful and historic town of Las Vegas, NM, it‚Äôs still remote enough to feel the kind of true seclusion one seeks for a vacation getaway. Didn‚Äôt want to leave‚Äîmy wife now talks of retiring to the area. It‚Äôs stunning, day and night. Thanks, Colin!"
2019-05-01,4,Group trip,"Leaping Deer Ranch exceeded my expectations! Had a fun bachelorette weekend there and had an amazing time. Beautiful area, gorgeous house, and a great host! Plus, the sweet dog Fluffy lead us on a hike...where else would you get that service?!"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We can't begin to express how awesome our stay was at Leaping Deer Ranch. All aspects of our stay were exceptional! The beauty, serenity, ambiance, service, cleanliness, etc. were beyond our expectations. Leaping Deer Ranch is such an ideal place for any occasion which we highly recommend. Colin does an amazing job to ensure his guests are well taken care of. He definitely goes above and beyond. We stayed there for several days. An enjoyable time was had by all. People participated in climbing the mountain, visiting the horses, doing the shooting range and just relaxing. We also had our wedding there. The surroundings were very beautiful and we had a great reception in the event hall. Also, we highly recommend doing the pig roast. If you are looking for a great get-away, at a great location, with a wonderful host, this is the place to go! We look forward to our next stay there."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We knew from the moment we drove up the road across the pasture to this incredible house that we were going to experience a special time. The Leaping Deer Ranch could not have been more perfect for our family reunion. The front double doors open into a grand room with high ceilings and impressive fireplace. The entire home is furnished with comfortable leather couches and chairs. The fully stocked professional kitchen is leaves nothing to be desired.
The house is surrounded by original fiber art and metal sculptures. The bedrooms are resort class with fantastic colorful tile work and plush towels. This is a magical place where our family was able to heal from the loss of a special loved one and welcome a new brother and his wife to our family.
The host could not be more caring than Colin the owner. The ranch has laying chickens that so we were able to enjoy fresh eggs for breakfast each morning. Colin allowed my 4-year-old autistic granddaughter to go with him in the morning to gather eggs from the chickens in the barn. This was so special to her and something she will always remember. Thank you, Colin, you really did something good.

2019-04-01,5,Group trip,This ranch is absolutely amazing. Colon is an excellent host and is on premises so communication is a breeze. Our daughter had her wedding there this past weekend and it could not have been more perfect. The event space is great along with all the activities available. I would recommend this site to any one looking for a great destination event.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is truly outstanding. It's a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the spacious view. The house wonderfully accommodates large groups, and is very comfortable. Colin goes out of his way to share the special elements of this unusual and truly lovely place. Be sure to touch base with him arrangements for accommodating larger (16+) than normal groups."
2019-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Pros: The house and land is breathtaking! The house is extremely clean. Colin was a great host. He is on the property, so he is readily available as needed. He was quick to respond to texts and calls. The space is great for events. We did our wedding here, and used the event space. It was so much fun! The fire pit was really great and huge!
Cons: one of the employees did try taking a bottle of vodka and a bottle of wine from our reception. That‚Äôs not ok! But Colin was notified and spoke with him. We did book yoga and she was 40 minutes late, So if you book yoga make sure you email her the day before to remind her.
Again, Colin was great, the place was amazing! I hope to come back and visit again in the future! Make sure you read the full listings expenses. Overall a great experience!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Colin was helpful and friendly he took his time to show us him home and property...
Would stay again"
2019-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home!!! Cannot wait to come back.
2019-02-01,5,Group trip,"Worth the price in any way for sure, great for a group of friends. Super hospitable and receptive to anything we needed."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely one of the most amazing Airbnb experiences we've had. This villa is enormous, well designed, and located in a quiet, beautiful location just over an hour from Santa Fe. We had a group of 8 adults + 10 kids and there was plenty of room for everyone to spread out. We enjoyed the hot-tub, the fireplace, the huge and fully-equipped kitchen, and the comfortable beds and living areas. Colin was the perfect host, communication and check-in were flawless, and he gave our kids a tour of the ranch -- they got to feed the chickens, collect eggs, and take hay out to the field for the horses. The surroundings are extremely quiet and peaceful, with wonderful star-gazing at night just outside the doorstep, and the lovely labyrinth for a meditative walk. Everyone had a wonderful time and we're already talking about coming back. Highly recommended in every way!"
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,"Colin is a thoughtful and available host. He set up a great bonfire for us. The house is very clean, large, and beautiful. The kitchen is equipped with everything we needed plus more. Would recommend for large groups."
2019-01-01,5,Group trip,"This location has plenty of places to gather for large groups and to split off into smaller groups. We enjoyed having our meals together in the spacious dining room, putting a puzzle together in the large living room near the fire, playing games at the table in the kitchen, cooking together in the large well-equipped kitchen, doing yoga in the large master bedroom, and taking a brisk winter walk on the property. The beds were very comfortable, also! Plenty of pillows, blankets, linens, and throws to get comfortable and stay cozy. We have already made our reservation for next year!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Colin's property is really great. We had a group of 15 in the house and everyone enjoyed the property. Colin's hospitality was awesome and made our trip easy. We had his team prepare a dinner to celebrate my parents 40th anniversary and the food and space were wonderful - we all agreed that it was much better than trying to go to a restaurant. There was literally nothing to complain about which is saying something with a group that big.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I stay in vacation rental homes a dozen or more times per year, and Leaping Deer Ranch is the best of the best. The house is stunning, the setting is beautiful, the amenities are ample, and Colin and his crew run the place professionally. While the house and setting make it worthwhile, the little touches like a supply of fresh eggs from the ranch and Colin's easy-going nature make this not just a good rental but a vacation destination. Note that Colin and the staff stays on the property in a small home nearby, and they strike the perfect balance of being available but not obtrusive. We also loved hiking and exploring the area, and particularly enjoyed hiking Hermit's Peak and visiting the cool outdoor hot springs in Montezuma. We also had a great meal at Charlie's Spic n Span in Las Vegas. We'll be back!"
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Colin's place was great. The home was even larger than we expected, and was very well kept. The property is very nice and conveniently located between Santa Fe, Taos, and Angelfire."
2018-12-01,5,Group trip,"The leaping deer ranch is amazing!! It was perfect for our group of 10. We had plenty of space, there were so many amenities, and it was spotless! The staff was very accommodating and wonderful to interact with. We can't wait to return!!"
2018-12-01,5,Group trip,wonderful home in a beautiful setting - highly recommend!
2018-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time at the Leaping Deer Ranch! The ranch had everything we could need, even free eggs!
Fluffy is the best dog too!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We organized a yoga and meditation retreat at the ranch and our guests had great things to say. Colin was very responsive to our needs. The location was relaxing and peaceful. The artwork and outdoor space is amazing! The catering was phenomenal! The extras offered like massages and bon fire were also amazing!! The landscape was beautiful and the staff friendly and efficient.
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,"We all enjoyed our stay at Leaping Deer Ranch! The house is beautiful and spacious, and Colin was an excellent host."
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,"This place exceeded all of our expectations. Our Cousins group was much larger than normal, with a few special circumstances to negotiate. Colin and Sophie were terrific, and made sure we had everything we needed. The accommodations were spacious and private for such a large group including several different 'group rooms' for eating, sharing, and even a slide show presentation (our projector/screen)! Those that got along well could share bedrooms, and a few that needed their own room were very pleased. My immediate siblings and a couple of spouses shared the master bedroom. in our 60's, it felt like a fantastic Mini reunion amongst our immediate family, a unexpected and fun slumber party! I loved the spaciousness of the kitchen, which included three sinks, ample countertops and double dishwashers . I really cannot say enough about this place. The couch beds were a little firm, but I believe that is easily rectified with a topper since they were a more solid modern style and not the formidable spring beds of the 50's. All in all...we can't wait to return on our next (now annual) Cousins Reunion."
2018-10-01,5,Group trip,"Words can express how delightful our stay was at Leaping Deer Ranch! Colin and his team provided outstanding hospitality. First, it was so easy to communicate with Colin, Sophie, and Matt; it made the entire process hassle-free. Second, Colin and his team made us feel more like family than like guests. Third, Leaping Deer Ranch and all the amenities are top notch. From the comfy linens to the well-stocked kitchen to the lovely views, everything combined beautifully to make our stay so very enjoyable. Thank you, Colin, Sophie and Matt!"
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful ranch! VERY CLEAN! Can‚Äôt wait till we return, just hope some of the beds will be switched out before we do."
2018-09-01,5,Group trip,"The landscape is heavenly, the ranch is beautiful, Collin is an absolute amazing host. The whole place is spotless and so well taken care of inside and out. Was the perfect place we hope to return to!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My now wife, Anna, and i were looking for a truly special place to have our wedding. a place that not only has all the necessary amenities and logistical advantages, but that also has a unique, serene feeling, wide-open vistas, a sense of place and authenticity. we feel beyond lucky that we found Leaping Deer Ranch.
in our attempt to keep our wedding compact, simple, and go-with-the-flow, we wanted to accept the imperfections and mix-ups that are par for the course when you keep it a little loose. the funny thing is, by being open to the imperfect, everything worked out perfectly.
the property is a stunner, the layout, the landscape, the fire pit, the labyrinth (largest in New Mexico, apparently); the house itself is at once spacious and cozy, beautifully appointed, a place that accommodates the max guest capacity with total ease. the event hall was the perfect size for our group meals and our highly successful dance-off of a reception. i mean, everybody got up and danced, even the grandmas. so dang fun! and our ceremony--replete with big puffy clouds and darkening rosy-blue sky at dusk-- took place in the middle of that big, beautiful labyrinth. again, perfect.
Anna and i absolutely, completely loved the experience and the feeling of being at Leaping Deer. both our families couldn't (and still can't) stop crowing about how beautiful and peaceful and magnificent the ranch is, and how perfect it was for our wedding. i'm so happy that they're going to walk away with such vivid and deeply fond memories of the event and the place. and Anna and i will cherish our memories of this weekend forever.
and, by the way...Collin is awesome. always on-point and helpful and fun to talk to.
if you're thinking about staying here, do yourself a favor and just book it now. thank Collin for the memories later..."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Colin was a wonderful host and responded to all our needs quickly and graciously. This location has everything. An expansive view, a great little place to hike, nice hot tub, spacious wrap around deck, all surrounding a spacious and wonderful home. The kitchen was a great place for family to gather an make great meals to feed our large family. I would highly recommend this home for any large family gathering."
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"Amazing home, Amazing views, Amazing hosts. The wedding arbor was amazing for our ceremony, we added a little of our touch to make it even more perfect. The wrap around deck was amazing, it worked perfectly for the ceremony to keep our guests out of the sun. It worked perfectly for the overflow from the venue.
I could not of found a more perfect place for our wedding. our wedding party loved the rooms and the grand kitchen. The hot tub worked for us perfectly.
Thank you again Colin and Sophie."
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,This place is awesome for large groups. Second year in a row for our family group of 10 to spend a night on our way to Ouray. Great hosts. Beautiful property.
2018-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Leaping Deer Ranch is absolutely gorgeous. My family loved relaxing on the porch and strolling through the grounds. Las Vegas has everything you need and is reasonably close to the best of northern New Mexico.
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,"Travelers can expect a wonderful experience. The location was spectacular, the ranch was superb and the help and responsiveness of the hosts were excellent. I highly recommend Colin's place and have no doubt that future visitors will have a lovely time."

2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"Very special property, easy for our group of nine to have plenty of places to spend time all together and in smaller groups. The kitchen is great! The porches are amazing! And the peace and quiet was enjoyed by all."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful, secluded property yet close enough to town to get what is needed. The wrap around porch and outdoor seating was wonderful to relax at night. Staff was always friendly and available to attend to whatever was needed. We loved the space and would highly recommend it."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, peaceful place to hold your event. Loads of beds and baths. Hummingbirds to wake up to in the morning and stars to go to bed with at night. We loved our stay at Leaping Deer Ranch and recommend for others!"
2018-06-01,5,Group trip,"All I can say is WOW! We enjoyed a family reunion at Colin's. And we couldn't be happier with the venue. It was super clean, gorgeous, being in a magical and very special place. We will most definitely return to this beautiful ranch.

DO SOMETHING GOOD!!!

2018-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're going to Las Vegas, NM and have a few people with you this is the place to stay. The porch is an amazing place to sit and look at the stars, and you can catch them from the hot tub. The kitchen is perfect for large groups, and there's plenty of silverware, plates, etc. We can't wait to go back."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW! We had our daughter's wedding at Leaping Deer Ranch this past weekend and it was AMAZING! The guests were so impressed and many said it was the most beautiful wedding they had ever been to.
We were looking for a place that we could have a small (75 people) wedding where we could stay and also have some family time. This was the JACKPOT! The home is truly amazing and the hall was perfect. Colin and his staff made sure we had everything we needed for the entire time.
The bride's family stayed in the beautiful main house and the groomsmen stayed in the apartment behind the hall. It could not have worked out better. The kitchen is a dream! So much space and it had everything we needed. The hall also has a kitchen so the caterer was able to work in there while the family was able to do all our work in the house.
Colin provided all the tables and chairs for the hall, which were beautiful wood and would have been beautiful on their own, but he also provided the linen. In addition, he also provided the place settings with nice plates, bowls, coffee cups, stemware and flatware. Perfect!
I cannot say enough good things about Leaping Deer Ranch or their staff. It was an amazing weekend from beginning to end. My family can't wait to go back and enjoy the amazing views, peaceful days, and wonderful accommodations."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property is one of the most beautiful and hidden gems I‚Äôve ever come across. Photos do not do it justice. Immaculate, grand and gorgeous, it‚Äôs a truly unique experience.
Colin and his team were kind, thoughtful and responsive. He recommended some local places to see which made our stay even better.
This is a truly magical place with such healing energy. We can‚Äôt wait to return :)
Thanks again Colin, Fred, Phil, Mrs. Fung, Tamara, Fluffy, and all the others who helped make our stay so wonderful and memorable! Can not recommend enough!!!"
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our group stayed at Colin's place for a weekend scuba diving trip at Blue Hole in Santa Rosa. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer! The house and property are both beautiful and so well cared for, and plenty of space for a large group. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking and serving a large group, and we loved the art throughout the house. We had a great time, and would love to stay again and explore the property and local activities!"
2018-04-01,5,Group trip,"Do Something Good is the motto at Leaping Deer Ranch, and I will have to say they nailed it. They truly did something AMAZING there!! Serene, Zen, Peace, Harmony...words cannot describe the amazement of Leaping Deer Ranch! Colin, Phil and the rest of the staff went above and beyond the definition of Hospitality! We had 3 more late arrival guests show up, and Colin immediately had his staff make-up 3 more beds. Leaping Deer Ranch is a must see, and definitely a must stay!! Thank you Colin and staff for being so awesome! Extra thanks to Phil for the bonus fun! We will definitely be returning! We LOVED everything this place and the land had to offer!!"

We arrived at night and I‚Äôve never in my life seen such an incredible blanket of stars as I did at Colin‚Äôs Ranch. Wow! The home is amazing, has a lot of little details that make it extra luxurious and special, and it would be perfect for a retreat or special getaway.

2018-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Stunning house and surrounds. Host was quick to respond and met us at the house to show us around. We made great use of the massive kitchen and hot tub and climbed the hill behind the house to see great views of the valley. The host has some exciting plans for the area in the future too and we wish him all the best!
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great people work there. Beautiful view. Plenty of spaces. Lovely kitchen
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, what a glorious place this ranch is! My whole family of 12 (including 4 kids) stayed here for the holidays and we were blown away not only by the natural beauty but by the house. The art pieces inside were especially notable. We had everything we needed and didn‚Äôt leave the property much, cooking most meals in the enormous kitchen space. The kids were led by one of the ranch hands to feed the horses carrots and other treats on one of the mornings. The horses, four female rescues are truly in heaven on this property. It warmed my heart that they are getting such freedom and loving treatment. Something to note is that a small staff live in the surrounding buildings but we did not find their presence intrusive. Trips to town included meals at Smiling Faces and Charlie‚Äôs Bakery both of which had the most friendly wait staff! We also took a trip to the hot springs near UWC campus which all ages of our family enjoyed. You won‚Äôt regret the trek out to this beautiful pocket of New Mexico!"
2017-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,We loved the spaciousness of Colin‚Äôs home and the kitchen really is top notch. New mattresses on the beds were nice to have but were still on the firm side as they were new. It was great to gather around the fireplace each evening. We loved the time we got to spend on the gun range.
2017-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Super weekend with family! Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer! Hope to be back soon!
2017-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"As other reviews have said, the pictures do not do justice to Leaping Deer. Outstanding. Colin went over and beyond being helpful. Thank you Colin."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible! It surpassed our expectations in every way and was absolutely wonderful. There is plenty of room for small and large gatherings and the place itself is beautifully built. The views were amazing and the location was perfect.
Colin is a great host and made our stay feel like home. We certainly didn‚Äôt want to leave and will definitely be back, hopefully sooner than later."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Ranch is absolutely gorgeous, stylish, comfortable and more. The host and team are super friendly and kind, I will definitely return."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, comfortable house, the house is in a farm and the environment is very nice.The owner of the house has four horses and four dogs and will take the kids to feed the horses in the morning and the kids are very excited.The administrator is very kind, the house is fully equipped with all kinds of supplies, basically each bedroom is equipped with a separate bathroom, privacy is very private.Suitable for children or groups."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Leaping Dear Ranch is one of the coolest places I've visited in quite some time. The Airbnb description and photos just can't do it justice. The hacienda is enormous, and very well appointed, with every conceivable amenity. The property is absolutely beautiful, with numerous spots to relax, explore, drink and eat, and recreate. We knew it would fit our needs for a 50th birthday party, but once we arrived we couldn't believe how great of value we were getting for our money.
Colin is an incredible host. He went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Even though he lives in an apartment on the property, he wasn't at all intrusive, but always available when we needed something. He was very flexible and accommodating, and did everything he could to ensure our experience was an outstanding one. We felt like we made a new friend in Colin, and were lucky to have had such great hospitality.
I highly recommend The Leaping Deer Ranch to anyone looking for a unique, warm, welcoming, and entertaining experience. The Ranch is perfect for a variety of uses. We definitely plan to return!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved staying at Leaping Deer Ranch! Accommodations were grate! Such a beautiful location. Colin and Fred were amazing hosts and were great help and provided everything we needed!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"If you are looking for an elegant stately upscale and larger than life home in the setting of expansive nature, this is the place to be. The sky is big, the land is beautiful and the home is well appointed. It has everything needed to accommodate a large group.
We were 19 in number, and had plenty of spaces inside and outside the home to visit and move about. The kitchen is enormous and well stocked for a professional chef to provide gourmet meals. Extra tables and chairs were provided, which allowed us to create both indoor and outdoor dining spaces.
The living room is huge with ample seating clusters. The grand fireplace was well stocked with wood and restocked by the manager. Overall, the home and the grounds provided the perfect setting for long and rich conversations, walks and hikes.
We used the 40 x 40 foot meeting room, complete with extra kitchen, for our program and it was spectacular. The bank of windows provided the connection to nature with easy access to a cover porch where participants could easily walk all around the house and stay out of the weather.
This is one of the most spectacular retreat homes we have been in, but what makes is so special is the love and care that owner Colin and manager Fred take to ensure that we had all that was needed for creating a special environment for one and all. They were always on the ready to ensure that we had what was needed, and if it was not readily available, they quickly provided it.
We hope to return!"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Words can't express how amazing this home is. Secluded, quiet, peaceful, everything i wanted. Colin is amazing and was an amazing host. He goes out of his way to make you feel at home. I hated to leave. My family and i can't wait to go back. Thank you Colin, you made my weekend one i will NEVER forget"
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about Leaping Deer Ranch was perfect for our family! We gathered there for our son's wedding in Las Vegas and hosted a barbecue for guests two nights before the wedding. Our granddaughter loved feeding the horses. I wish we would have had more time to enjoy the meditation and yoga class Fred offered, but our schedule didn't allow it. Fred was a terrific host and was available for anything we needed. I hope we have the opportunity to stay there again."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house with lots of land and views. Host was very helpful
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My company and I recently stayed at the Leaping Deer Ranch for a company retreat and it was wonderful. The house is spacious, lovely and extremely well-stocked (especially the kitchen!) The amenities allowed us to have a relaxing time after all of the work that we got done - the inclusion of a hot tub, bonfire pit, and gas grill really added to our experience. The home is situated in a gorgeous locale so if peace, quiet and beauty are what you are looking for this is definitely the place to stay. Colin and Fred were available to help us out with anything we needed without being in the way. They are excellent hosts and this house is amazing! I definitely recommend it for your company retreat or family getaway!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a group of ten (10) guys who were there for a bachelor party. We were all in our thirties and for the most part all married, so a traditional venue and game plan was not going to work for us. After much searching and hand wringing I came upon Leaping Deer. We were fortunate to have found this space. It was exactly what we needed and gave the groom a huge space to take a deep breath before the deep dive into marriage. Fred and Colin could not have been more helpful and accommodating. At first, I was skeptical having them on site, but in hindsight was quite relieved to have them there. I am working to organize a reunion for both bachelorettes and bachelors at Leaping Deer. In addition, I will be working with some other groups to host events and retreats. This property and it's hosts are well suited for large groups and the internal reflection that comes with open vistas and a the solitude of being in nature. Except there is plenty of amenities and modern comforts without being obtrusive. Thanks again Colin and Fred!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our group of 10 spent a night here on our way to Colorado. This place was perfect after a long day of driving. Scenic, spacious, great hosts, and fed the horses too!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful place!!! So quiet and we had a wonderful stay. Thank you to Colin and Fred for your hospitality.
2017-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This by far was the best experience I have had with airbnb. Fred and Collin were both more than welcoming and made us feel right at home. The home was beautiful very clean and comfy. More than enough space for my large family to vacation and spend time together. A massive kitchen and a bath room in each room which was a plus. The scene was amazing and the horses were very friendly. This place is a MUST book. You will not regret it!
Thanks again for your hospitality
We will be back!"
2017-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful, secluded retreat. If you're looking for a place to relax and get away from city life, this the place. House is beautiful. Great for families. Lots of wildflowers and birds in the pastures and hills on the property. If you like outdoors and nature, this is perfect. Close to great hiking in the mountains and not too far from Taos. Hot springs and storrie lake are nearby. Best airbnb we have ever been to. Colin and Fred were great hosts."
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This location is in a beautiful country setting. Great kitchen and meeting amenities. Quiet and peaceful. Close enough to Las Vegas if needed to run into town for supplies. Fred took great care of us
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home is really beautiful - there is stunning artwork in all of the rooms.
It fit our party of nine very comfortably.
I would advise anyone going to this home to use the directions and map provided on the website - your GPS will misdirect you. Also it is very very dark at night and hard to find the entrance so best to arrive during daylight hours."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great home for families to stay for multiple days
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tons of space. Great for the family. The horses are lovely. Our boys had a great time in the shooting range!

2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing place with unforgettable scenery. Quiet and serene, four horses on the property, a chance to be close to nature. The house can accommodate many guests and is very well-supplied. Fred and Colin answered all of our questions and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. Only wish we had more time to enjoy this special place!"
2017-05-01,2,Stayed a few nights,"This house is in a great location and easy to locate. The ranch is huge and Colin is great to talk to. However, if you care for a clean accommodation, amenities and an environment where all family comes together and cooks something and expects clean kitchen, bathrooms etc, then this ranch is not for you."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a remote working Ranch with all of the amenities to make you feel welcomed, then this is the place for you. Nestled in the foothills of the northern New Mexico mountains, Leaping Deer Ranch has everything that will make you and your guests feel welcomed. Beautiful prairie and mountain views and lots of space to gather with friends and family. We sat outside on the wrap around porch start gazing one night. Great place and we will definitely be back again. Most people might not venture towards Sapello, NM; however, this would be a great base camp for all of your northern New Mexico adventures.
We didn't use all of the amenities that were available to us, but there is a great fire place (with firewood provided) in the Den, a hot tub, a fire pit and a Yoga Studio. The 4 bedrooms in the main house all had their private bathrooms. a big plus for our family.
Colin and Fred (our Hosts) were great with communicating and making us feel at home. Highly recommend Leaping Deer Ranch."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The leaping deer ranch is a great place to stay. It has a relaxing atmosphere. My family and enjoyed staying here.

2017-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Directions are a bit tricky but not because of Colin; but Google Maps and Waze had us going the wrong direction on 518. This Ranch is far superior to any place we have ever the privilege of staying! Colin is a wonderful host and we highly recommend his Ranch.

The house was very nice and roomy and big enough for people to have their own space when needed and nice common areas when we wanted to be all together. We appreciated being able to bring our pets!

Since I visit northern New Mexico regularly, I'll be back."

The kitchen was fully equipped. The smart TV was handy as I could just take a photo of the sign-in code with my phone and it signed me into the media services I use.
The bed was so comfortable. There was a pleasant light scent in the home.
The host Jan offered advice about places to see and where to eat. I had lunch at Charlie‚Äôs Spic & Span. It was so good and I recommend having their huge cream puff!
Jan is an accommodating and pleasant host. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and bring friends!
Note: There are several fires in New Mexico currently. Jan kept me updated prior to my visit and during."

I highly recommend this place!"

We enjoyed the just-right kitchen, cozy places to sit by a sunny window or a warm fire, and a very comfortable bed. Maps, guides, and books highlighting the town's history and features were thoughtfully provided, and the location was perfect for walking to eateries, shops, and the historic plaza. It was a great place for my husband and me to stay while we explored the area and a lovely space in which to unwind and dream. Jan and Frank were wonderful hosts and we will definitely stay with them again soon!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Jan has created a cozy unique experience! The beautiful rock house is surrounded by a lovely artistic garden and felt private and safe despite being right on the edge of downtown. The inside had everything we needed to make and host a small Thanksgiving feast. A great place to curl up and enjoy a fire or to use as a home base from which to explore.
Definitely check out The Skillet located a block away for great food. Also a short walk away from the plaza, a walking trail along the Gallinas River, other restaurants, and Highlands University.
Really couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay. We also appreciated Jan checking in on us and always making sure we had what we needed."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The place was spotlessly clean and there was much thought given to the furnishings and decor. Additionally, there were nice touches such as coffee, tea, half-and-half, English muffins, butter, spices, bathrobes, candles, firewood, and flowers. The location is excellent for exploring Las Vegas on foot. The cabin is located in a private compound filled with interesting art and plantings. The hosts were extremely friendly and welcoming.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,10/10
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,we loved this house. 1 really good thing is that they have antique looking night lights and flash lights around the house. it is usually difficult when you are in a new place and you need to go to the bathroom at night. lol and the lights made everything Easier
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We went for a graduation party and had a nice time.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnb‚Äôs and this one had some of the most character among them all.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Bbb
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Such a cool space! This stay was full of small touches that made it even better! All beds (including pull outs) were super comfortable. Linens and towels were soft. Even the door code was specialized to make it easy for us! The owners were very easy to communicate with. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a family trip to Las Vegas and really enjoyed our stay at Vanessa's place. It's comfortable and spacious and offers all the amenities that you would expect when traveling. In total, there were 5 of us on the trip. There was plenty of room to relax and enjoy ourselves. The neighbors are super friendly."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One reason I like Airbnbs better than hotels is because most Airbnbs have way more character - and Vanessa and Jaime's place oozes character. Former saloon turned speakeasy. Much of the original structure is preserved and rally nicely restored, but it has all the modern conveniences too. I especially like that the bedrooms are in the basement, so they're quiet and get really dark. The kitchen is well equipped, laundry was easy. Convenient location just a five minute walk from the Plaza (which had a live band on Friday evenings). Nice to have plenty of off street parking too. Jaime and Vanessa are very friendly hosts as well. Great place."

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Vanessa was very helpful both before and after our stay. She went out of her way to insure we could have an early check in with the premises already being clean. After we left she saw to it that our private Netflix account was removed from the television because I couldn't figure out how to do it myself. I would not hesitate to recommend Vanessa and the property to anyone I know interested in staying in Las Vegas, New Mexico."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Would love to come back.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Vanessa's house is a beautiful old jem! The upstairs is large and airy. We were traveling with two young kids so the gate on the stairs was particularly helpful and my kids learned how to play foosball on the coffee table that was just their height. The neighbors, Jamie and his wife, were so nice and generous with our kids. They helped our kids find and pet their cats and even wrapped up some seeds to their beautiful sunflowers for us to take home. I would definitely stay here again, there is so much to do in Las Vegas that I didn't know about. We would love to visit again!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Vanessa‚Äôs place, the Brick House Saloon! As stated in some of the reviews, the pictures (though wonderful in and of themselves) could not compete with the real thing.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Vanessa and Wes offer you a historic gem in the mines of New Mexico.
Our family had a wonderful stay!
Our daughter loved the beds being so high off of the ground, the foosball/coffee table and having a television in her own room- though it saw little use.
The almost 300 year old claw foot was a dream relived for me and mi amor.
After miles of driving, exchanging rental cars, dealing with Mercedes‚Äô warranty department- my partner and I step outside momentarily only to realize we left our phones inside and no memory of the code to get in. Our daughter asleep.
We were locked out.
Luckily Wes was able to help us via interstellar communication, I.E an ADT ring system.
We are both grateful for that. Thanks!

Connie was very responsive and accommodated our late check in as our flight was delayed! Can‚Äôt say anything negative about this place! We had a pleasant stay. Thank you Connie for sharing your home with us!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Connie‚Äôs spacious home situated on the edge of countryside with a view of horses in a pasture facing the house and mountains in the background. The Montezuma hot Springs set by the Gallinas river with a view of the castle are nearby as is the beautiful plaza of Las Vegas with it‚Äôs old times Main Street (National St). The shops and restaurants have gotten better that ever without sacrificing any charm, becoming quirkier to reflect the local artists and University population. Las Vegas is often used in TV and movie sets (Roswell and No Country for Old Men). Ski resorts and Santa Fe are roughly an hour away. Kids really enjoyed the home and outdoors and I enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere in the house. I would recommend to anyone wanting an authentic New Mexico experience."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There was plenty of space. Kathryn is very friendy, and her dog, shorty, is awesome. He‚Äôs very quiet. The bed was very comfortable. I believe the bed is a foam mattress. The shower had ample pressure. The room has a lot of natural light."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were not in Las Vegas but for a few hours to sleep. Kathryn was an excellent host with lots of great information.

I would definitely stay again! Thanks for the hospitality!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful space and generous host. Everything was perfect and better than expected.
The icing on the cake was when I picked up a starving stray dog and she said to bring it home and she would take it to the shelter and instead decided to keep it. She is a kind and generous hearted individual. We will be returning soon. üß°"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A friend and I booked a one night stay at the Studio of Kathryn M. The Studio is a very peaceful and welcoming environment. As we entered the studio, we were greeted by beautiful music and a big colorful room with tremendous natural lighting. There is a recliner to use after a long drive.
Kathryn was very kind and welcoming from the very start. She is very responsive in messaging and gave plenty of good instruction about the house, and information about Las Vegas.
She does have a cat, Sparky, and a dog, Flapjack. Both are friendly and quiet, I didn‚Äôt interact with them much, as they like to keep to themselves :)
The Studio is very clean, the bathroom was also very clean and the hot water runs excellent in the shower.
The bed had a memory mattress, it was very comfortable, I had a full nights rest on it and I didn‚Äôt even wake up once.
It‚Äôs a perfect stay for a single person or a couple. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. Our overall experience at this studio was excellent!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quick drive to the hot springs, beautiful views and minutes away from Las Vegas. We loved it!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The nest was a lovely private home on top of a hill surrounded by lots of trees! Stayed the weekend to relax in the nearby hot springs and unplug. Would recommend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay.
Clean, quiet, and beautiful dark night sky.
There were no surprises.
A few things to make sure you notice.
The house is 5 miles from town so grab groceries while you are in town.
There is a gate you need to go through that is hard to see at night. Someone will need to get out of the car each time and open/close the gate.
The road to the house is rocky/dirt and a little loose on the way up to the house.
There is no wifi at the house so be prepared to use cell data. Cell service signal was fine.
The tv doesn‚Äôt have a remote so it is a bit difficult to use. No streaming services.
Finally, if you arrive at night the lights might be not be on when you arrive so have a light ready because it is really dark out at the house."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Delightful rustic cabin in the mountains above Las Vegas, NM. The surrounding property is beautiful even though the forest has been touched by the hermit/calf fire. The cabin itself is cozy and surprisingly clean! The kitchen is vintage but equipped enough for most basic meals. The bathroom is a little tight, squish around the toilet, sink and shower should be operated with care. The ceiling is low but for folks around 5‚Äô9‚Äù it‚Äôs just right. The porch hangs over the road and views beaver creek, we saw little fish and our kiddos loved playing in the creek. Spent a good amount of time enjoying the breeze in the mornings and evening. Loved our time and will be fondly remembering our time! Almost would like to keep this place a secret!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Beautiful location I enjoyed staying here :) If you enjoy being outdoors this is the place for you very private and quiet
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A gorgeous place in the New Mexico mountains with tons of character. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Everything has wonderful character, is clean, and works. An incredibly beautiful and atmospheric place. Magic!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is out second time at these cabins and the location is unbeatable!
The view of Hermit's Peak is phenomenal from the meadow. Some of the cabins are very rustic, if that's what you are looking for. The Martin cabin had low ceilings which were a little uncomfortable for my husband in the kitchen and the shower, tight spaces but for a short weekend it's enjoyable and the place has everything you need. Very friendly and helpful hosts, would recommend them to anyone. they are fixing up some of the cabins to be more updated and those will be wonderful. Lots of hiking on their land, a beautiful babbling brook and for the most part quiet."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved.the cabins! Beautiful location and plqce to stay. Had everything we needed and more. Thank you so much üíì

Beautiful scenery"
2021-09-01,4,Stayed about a week,The cabin was spotless and well equipped!!! We loved the front porch and spent a lot of time there. The cabin is rustic but we enjoyed our time there immensely!!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to unplug and relax. Easy access to trails, river etc. If you‚Äôre quiet in the morning, you can watch the deer while you drink your coffee. Don‚Äôt forget to turn off the lights and look at the star filled skies. We loved our time at Martin cabin."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great time at the Martin cabin. It is a basic, unique and very clean set-up with everything you need to enjoy the beautiful environment. Kat and Lacey are very kind and welcoming hosts. I enjoyed hiking around the property and thoroughly enjoyed hanging out by the creek. I recommend a visit here."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a secluded get away, the Martin Cabin is perfect! It has everything you need, plus views and plenty of nature to enjoy. We loved every minute!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect cabin get away tucked back in an amazing area. Exactly what we were looking for. Quiet, relaxing, plenty to explore, the landscape was breath taking with the leaves changing colors and so much more. Gallinas Canyon is one of the prettiest places I've ever seen."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you seek some peace and quiet, this is your spot. We were literally the only people on the property for days. Cool in the mornings in August. We brought box fans for the evening and were quite comfortable. Creek across the street was dry in August, but allowed for some exploring. El Porvenir is a beautiful location for a few days of peaceful getaway."
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very sweet simple cabin. Lacey is a superb host.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great comfortable stay in a great are. Cabin was great and comfortable. Views were great. Communication was perfect. Thanks for everything. We will be back.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful cabin on hundred acres of land to explore, hike with children, or dip your toes in the creek across the road. Had a great time for three nights with our small children and would come back. Beautiful land and wonderful hosts who love the place and it shows."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in this cabin. The cabin itself was comfy and clean and perfect. The surrounding area, is just so quiet and stunningly beautiful. Loved it!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic cabin! See my other review of the other house for more details. If you've found this place because you're looking for a place to stay in the Las Vegas area, your search is over. Stay here!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thanks Lacey and Kat. This was my second time staying at one of your cabins and again we had a great time. Brought the granddaughter and she had ""the best time ever"". The views, hikes, fishing, and accommodations were wonderful. This location made it easy to go site seeing to nearby towns and national forests. As always Las Vegas was fun for shopping and eating some great New Mexican cuisine. We will be back!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful, peaceful place to stay. Right outside the city limits, yet quiet and relaxing. Great spot for hiking and bike riding. We‚Äôll definitely come back again!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Martin cabin! Kat and Lacey were so responsive, friendly and just delightful to interact with in every way, and gave us perfect privacy. It was clear they really wanted us to have a good time and enjoy ourselves in this stunning setting, which for us, was so perfect with the immediate access to and immersion in the Hermit's Peak environment which is so special to our family. And the weather gave us such surprises and laughs with its extremes - snow in May!!!! Then glorious sunny blue skies again! Wow! But we loved every minute of it and how those heaters kept us warm no matter what. We saw the cabins 11 years ago so can personally attest to the wonderful improvements that have been made not only to their comfort level but just their character in general. They are very quirky and rustic but this added to their charm for us. Our bed was super comfortable and perfect for us and I am a very picky sleeper! We also noticed and really appreciated the high quality cotton sheets. The quiet and darkness at night really helped us relax and melt into peacefulness that is really only possible, for me anyway, in such unique, special natural environments as this where your connection to nature is unparalleled. Oh! My husband wanted me to mention the water in the cabin - he loved the taste of it! Very clean and fresh - matching the environment! And the porch was the perfect hang out place overlooking the creek and forest. Thank you, thank you , thank you, Kat and Lacey and helpful Ron! We hope to return soon!!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful quiet location with a rustic, very clean, comfortable cabin. As others have mentioned, ceilings in some areas are low, but I managed fine at 5‚Äô10‚Äù. The beds were comfortable and the deck outside was nice for relaxing. The kitchen has adequate supplies for basic cooking."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is perfect for those who want get away from it all. It was clean and comfortable. It's a no frills place. There is no cell service or a TV. However, there is a landline there if you have an emergency or if someone needs to reach you. There is a kind gentleman there that is easy to contact if you need anything. Overall a great place to relax. Would definitely recommend."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I decided to use apple maps to get to the cabin and it took us to the backroads which were underdeveloped and difficult to drive on. However, if you follow the host‚Äôs directions exactly, you‚Äôll go through a much smoother road than the alternative. The cabin is very cozy and we instantly felt at home. It had everything we needed for the weekend. It‚Äôs fairly secluded and the owners were kind enough to let us explore their huge land since we were guests there. All in all, we had an amazing stay at the Martin cabin."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean, quiet, away from daily routine. Beautiful view of Hermit's Peak."
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were so comfortable in the Martin cabin! It is clean and has everything needed for a pleasant stay. If you are are tall, just be aware that the bathroom and kitchen ceilings are only about six feet. Even with that, we want to stay there again. Our four days flew past. The property is peaceful and scenic. From the meadow you can see Hermit Peak. The hike up Hermit Peak is fantastic, and the cabins at El Rito are the perfect location if you are planning to go up. If you want to get away and relax, the Martin cabin is a great place to do it. Kat and Lacey are gracious hosts. We appreciated the history of their family and the cabins."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lacey and Kat are incredible hosts - their property is rustic and well-kept with breathtaking views of Hermit's Peak. Great communication and charming, rustic cabins make for a perfect New Mexico Mountain getaway - highly recommended!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly rustic. Genuinely old but very clean, comfortable, and functional. Close to National Forest, far from noise and stress. Spend time exploring the large property or just hang out on the front porch listening to the stream. Wi Fi available if you really think you need it. Hosts Lacey & Kat very gracious and accommodating."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. We come to Las Vegas often to visit family.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is clean and comfortable, you get the feel of both a modern and older model home at the same time. I will add that the old style radiator heating kept us warm and cozy.
I would definitely stay here again, give it a try you will not be disappointed.
Do note:
We were just two during this stay. The owner did share that there were issues with the bathroom plumbing up stairs. Which we did not need. The bathroom downstairs was plenty for us.
We had a great stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stay
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Joseph is SO responsive.
This is my parents third time staying there and it is definitely their favorite Airbnb in the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and clean!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great! Thank you!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful little home. The jacuzzi tub upstairs is so luxurious. Close to all the amenities of Las Vegas. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,2,Stayed with kids,"Just spend the extra few bucks for a hotel. That‚Äôs what we had to do after taking a look around this property. I was traveling with my wife and month old baby to Las Vegas for a funeral. I saw this rental was about the same as a hotel and decided to try it out. We got there late at night, around 11. I notified JoJo and he said that was okay. When we got to the property we realized it was surrounded by abandoned and boarded up houses. I was willing to look past this until I noticed the windows on the first floor do not lock or close all the way. I notified JoJo of my concerns but unfortunately it was already 1AM at this point so I don‚Äôt fault him for not responding. We cancelled and moved to a hotel because I wasn‚Äôt going to have my family sleep in a muggy, dusty, unsecured house in an unfamiliar, seemingly abandoned neighborhood. The next day I asked JoJo if I could get at least another day refunded as we never even laid a finger on any of the furniture, but he did not reply."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Heater works extremely well. House was stocked up with everything we needed.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Upstairs bathroom floors were dirty, hair, toenail clippings, gummy bear stuck to the floor. Twin bed could use a mattress topper so it‚Äôs more comfortable. Since house sleeps 5-6 people, could really use a large 12 cup coffee pot. Needs more cooking and eating utensils.
Otherwise description was accurate and our stay was good. Would stay again, cute old house."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Myself and others enjoyed staying here. The Wi-Fi was good and the host was responsive when we had a question or curiosity. It was fairly clean and we appreciated the location of the home in general. We weren‚Äôt able to use the upstairs bathroom amenities, but it was doable. I also think certain rooms could have used curtains. The home had plenty of space. Overall good experience!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely stay, and we felt right at home. Jojo's place is wonderful and is only a 15-20 min walk from the plaza. We had such a great time! We‚Äôll definitely be back."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,it well accommodated or needs for the weekend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host was super freindly and proactive at answering any questions we had. The place was clean and as pictured
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We stayed in Las Vegas for a Squash 57 tournament. JoJo‚Äôs place was perfect for us location wise and with the needed house amenities. We‚Äôll stay here again next year!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had to make several changes to our itinerary and extended our stay by several days. JoJo was very accommodating. We had a toddler with us and the host provided two child gates. They have added a recliner since we stayed last year. This is a great benefit for me as I can only sleep in a recliner. We look forward to staying with them in the future.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice historic home. The host was friendly and responsive.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is our family home, my grand parents purchased this home in early 1900's and have so many wonderful memories here. It was so wonderful to be back and still feels like home ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This spot worked out perfect for what I needed it for it was better priced and better than most hotels in the the area. I will defiantly use again. Host was amazing.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and great location!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"construction crew for 4 nights
a lot better experience than a hotel
kitchen its a plus"
2023-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This was the second time we stayed here. The location is great, there‚Äôs not a lot of choices in this town. The house is older, we knew that since we stayed before. The downstairs is clean, the upstairs carpet seems old and dusty, and has narrow stairs . We were not aware that the upstairs shower and tub was not working until we got there and no choice but to stay. The downstairs tub/shower is in the master bedroom so that made it very inconvenient for a party of 4. It‚Äôs a good house, it‚Äôs in a good location, but the house needs to be deep cleaned , especially the carpet on the stairs and upstairs and fixed up a little. With a little TLC this house could be really awesome. Great location to downtown, colleges, hot springs, etc"
2023-02-01,3,Stayed about a week,"Would have liked to have known about the construction (it was my uncle that told me and took pictures) could have found the house easier and faster. Barricades seem to be haphazardly put up and taken down all through the day so access was an issue-almost no traffic was a plus. Had no idea where the garbage can was and come to find out by accident, owners dad was in the backyard moving it from behind the house to the street and had gotten hung up on the clothesline with his truck. They were really nice and they explained some things to me we couldn‚Äôt find. We never used the upstairs. The heaters didn‚Äôt seem to work up there, no shower or bathtub to be used bc of some leak, the staircase is really narrow and steep so careful with the radiator pipes. It‚Äôs a house that needs some maintenance and tlc. Easy to get in the house. Expect people to walk through the yard at weird hours and around it. Parking is left side of house but the house can be driven around completely. Felt every bit home."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our technicians loved this home, they spent the last month in Las Vegas at a couple of different spots said this ones was probably the nicest, just a little disappointed the upstairs shower didnt work."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Located near the hot springs, private and cozy. Just what I expected from the trip."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There should be an option to use the upstairs tub since the only other restroom is accessed through the master bedroom. I understand there are water restrictions, but everyone has to bathe regardless and it made our travel companions grumpy. Other than that and some unexpected road construction blocking the driveway, it's a good clean place to stay walking distance from the Plaza. The host is fair and responsive."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So warm and cozy, a beautiful place to relax when getting back from the days excursions."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice place like stayi g here

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy place to find and great location
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is a gem. Hardwood floors, updated bathroom and kitchen. The kitchen was well equipped. We made most of our meals on site but don‚Äôt miss having at least one meal at ‚ÄúSpic and Span‚Äù. There is a full laundry and also outdoor lines to dry clothes you don‚Äôt want to put in the dryer which was important for folks like us who were on a hunting trip.
Everything was clean as could be and very comfortable. Lots of room and dishTV and Wi-Fi to boot. Great value and convenient location. The property is just a few blocks from the very cool town square.
Highly recommend."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location near I-25, and good value. Check-in and communication were outstanding."

House was clean and as described, really appreciated having a washer and dryer. Will definitely keep this on our list for places to stay when we visit family in LV!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice place to stay. Chose it over staying at the local hotels because we really wanted a place to just spread out and relax and this place filled that request perfectly.
Everything worked as promised and the radiator heaters kept us plenty warm on some cold nights. If you are looking for a nice quiet experience, this is perfect."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Although this is not a luxury property, the house was very clean and functional. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking basics. We enjoyed our stay and would return in the future."

Dining room was very comfortable and had seating for 8 of us. We loved the two sun porches and all the light. We didn't spend time in the huge yard but would have if the weather had been warmer. Host was very responsive and let us know what to expect. We had a fabulous time!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Michelle‚Äôs place was great! It was very spacious and the hosts were very responsive.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great stay
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed an extend stay. Loved Las Vegas and the house. Had a great time.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Spacious house, well stocked kitchen, but it was quite dusty and overall not as clean as we would have expected."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing quick family gathering this beautiful home was able to accommodate a quick family get together! Will definitely be booking again!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Michelle is a great host. Also, David her co-host is very helpful as well. Very neat home with plenty of room, seating and dining."

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Michelle is a wonderful host. The house was cozy and felt like going to my own mother's house. It is a very comfortable and roomy place for our family to gather and have separate spaces! I will be reaching our again should we be back in the area as a group.
Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Even though half our friends decided not to go because we booked for the motorcycle rally and the city Council the rally still five of us did go. We had a great time. We explored the area with all the history.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious. Plenty of room for everyone to be together or for guests to have their own space.
We went during a heat wave, and as there is no a/c, the house was a bit warm and stuffy. The fans helped in the bedrooms but the windows were really hard to open in some of the rooms.
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,This place is located on a gorgeous piece of property with a beautiful acequia running through it. My kids loved playing outside and I enjoyed sitting in the porch. We were worried about the lack of air conditioning but it wasn‚Äôt a problem as the summer night cooled down significantly. This place could easily become a five star Airbnb with a bit more attention to the cleaning and the details.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great communicative host!
Very nice grounds and walking paths."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Our family always gets together every Memorial Day weekend to visit family cemetery. This was the first time we have been able to see everyone in three years. The house has lots of eating areas, great outdoor areas for seating and place for kids to play and lots of seating for visiting. Everyone was very impressed with the whole place. We would like to reserve it again next year at Memorial Day weekend."
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,Our party of five had a great visit to this home. It was a great place to land at the end of a day of sight seeing and playing tourist. The home was clean and welcoming with plenty of room to spread out and relax. Michelle was great to work with from the moment we booked the reservation until our check-out date. We had a minor furnace issue which was resolved promptly! Thanks Michelle!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house for family gatherings. You don't feel like you are on top of each other. The property has a homey feeling. We would come back again. Thanks Michelle for making it special for us.
2023-05-01,3,Group trip,Our overall stay was okay. Host allowed us to check in early so that was great for our big group who arrived early. We enjoyed the privacy this home had to offer but giving it 3 stars as there is no AC in the home and no ceiling fans in bedrooms. It is an older home so it has a distinct smell. Not all windows open so there was no proper airflow.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"michelle was very helpful and accomidating, we were there for my daughters wedding and even though, issues kept popping up, michelle helped us in overcoming them. she was extremely fast in responding to us, and very pleasent to deal with. las vegas has always been a negative experience for me, but i can honestly say, having michelle host us, will always be my highlight in vegas. thanks michelle!"

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at this property. This had a rustic charm that my kids really enjoyed. Location is close to Santa Fe and a few popular ski valleys in the area. Michelle has been a great host - very responsive and the instructions were very clear.
Only suggestion I have is to upgrade kitchen utensils. Thanks!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great size property for a big family . Accommodated us very well & we would love to have been able to see it in the summer instead of the cold winter. All of our family members loved being together.
2022-11-01,4,Group trip,"This home is BIG and can definitely afford everyone to have their own space. You can just feel the history of the place. Our group of 6 enjoyed our stay and could absolutely see how a summertime group would benefit from the expansive grounds. (Too cold for us)
We had an issue and the hosts were extremely quick to remedy the situation and make things right. A++ for these hosts! We‚Äôll probably never go back to Las Vegas, but if we did, we‚Äôd be sure to stay here."
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,place was great.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a lovely stay. Felt like visiting grandma‚Äôs house!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"The house was amazing and a very unique house in the very unsuspecting little town of Las Vegas NM. We all love the old style, and sitting outside in the evening was amazing. I hope we get more work in the area so that we can be back to visit again. Hopefully real soon. Thank you for everything it was a great experience."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a special house and estate. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It is very comfortable and would be perfect for a family‚Äîthere is so much room! It is quiet and provides a lot of privacy. We enjoyed all of the views of the beautiful trees and walking the expansive grounds. Thank you for sharing this grand house and estate.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Best BNB. It is clear that the host takes great care and thoughtfulness when preparing this beautiful home for guests. It has nice touches that make it very comfortable like mattress warmers and spices in the kitchen. The property is secluded and quiet. It is very rejuvenating. Would definitely stay here again
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful location outside of Las Vegas. Very peaceful and quiet!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Another great stay!!!! Can't say how much we enjoyed the home and property. Both Leonard and JoAnn are wonderful!!!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lenard is quite possibly the best Airbnb host I've ever met. Both him and his wife are extremely kind, caring, and thoughtful. They communicated with precision at every touch point. The house was immaculately clean and the property is breath taking. If you're looking for a quite mountain or outdoors getaway...look no further!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great peaceful location with amazing view of both sunrises and sunset.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place, wonderful hosts!!! We would stay here again!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"In love with La Casita!
We traveled from California to New Mexico to visit our son in college. Leonard was incredibly helpful, hospitable and so accommodating. Our family and doggies enjoyed the beautiful nature and amazing hikes. What stood out the most about La Casita was the rich history and ‚Äúlived in‚Äù feeling with such wonderful art pieces throughout.
We loved our peaceful and warmth stay at La Casita and highly recommend anyone looking for a family friendly place.
Thank you so much, Leonard for the incredible hospitality :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The area is absolutely gorgeous and Lenard‚Äôs casita felt like home. Our family enjoyed our stay and opted to stay in and cancel plans to go out.
Lenard was great and met us for checking in and out, per our request. Answering all our questions and making sure we had what we needed including a welcome basket of goodies.
If you need a peaceful environment, I would recommend staying here. It is off the main roads but a nice drive.
We would love to go back and stay in the spring."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a great experience! Exactly the remote getaway we wanted!!! We‚Äôll be back!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a blessing to stay at this place. We definitely will come back :-)
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Leonard was truly the most communicative host we‚Äôve encountered with Air BNB.
He was very thoughtful and made every effort to be sure we were comfortable and even left welcome goodies geared towards the age of our group. The house was an awesome oasis in the wilderness and so peaceful. Super comfy beds and he had provided everything we needed and wanted. We hope to go back!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The casita was beautiful! If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful getaway this is the spot. You‚Äôre at the base of a beautiful mountain surrounded by fresh air and quiet! The house was so cozy inside with a wood burning fireplace. Walk out the front door and enjoy coffee on the porch. Leonard was so responsive, kind, and helpful!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would give this house and its owners a 10 out of 10. The house is in an idyllic setting, nestled in a meadow beside a small stream. It is very quiet and peaceful, which we value coming from a big noisy city.
The house is very well laid out and all furnishings are in good shape and comfortable. The owners have thought of just about everything in terms of what you will need. While we didn‚Äôt do any cooking, the kitchen is well laid out and seems to have all the necessities. The beds and linens are comfortable.
Leonard helped us out with directions for visiting a friend in the area. He made sure that we had his cellphone number. He always responded quickly to our texts.
Things to remember about staying in this part of the country: Do your shopping before leaving the main highway. There is a Walmart in Las Vegas as well as other shops and restaurants. There are no services once you leave the main highway. Make sure to use the directions provided by the owners. These are the best."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place! Host was very nice and very responsive. Beautiful surroundings and great house. Would book again. Thanks Len!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful secluded casita-very cozy
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Len was an excellent host!He was accessible the entire stay, and was willing to quickly answer any questions or requests that we had. Check in/check out was easy, and the home was beautiful!Highly recommend for a quick or extended get away off the beaten path."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Casita just a little way from Las Vegas New Mexico is a gem out in the country where there is space, peace, and quiet surrounded by natural beauty. The hosts are very helpful and because they communicated promptly and extensively we were able to confidently bring one family member who uses a wheelchair. The furnishing and decorating are very artistic and practical. We felt well cared for and comfortable. It's on our list of favorite places. Great place for a relaxing family stay."
2019-03-01,5,Group trip,"Comfy cozy and we'd come back again. Ready great location, and a great place to reconnect with your inner soul."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent host, super helpful, amazing space. It was hard to leave; we hope to go back soon."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It's difficult to imagine finding a place more beautiful than this lovely casita and the surrounding environs. We wanted to find a place to spend some time with family and enjoy nature, and this was ideal for our objectives. There was plenty of pretty country for hiking, and the stars at night were gorgeous. The lodging was quite comfortable too, but the property was what made this place extra special."
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,"By far the best Airbnb experience all seven of us have ever had. Beautiful setting and the house had everything you could possibly want. As another guest said, ‚Äúbetter than home. Go Now!!!"
2018-07-01,5,Group trip,"Nicer than our own home ‚Äî beautiful house, comfy beds, plenty of pillows and towels ‚Äî more like being a guest of friends!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second visit to Len‚Äôs lovely home.
Len calls this lovely home a casita. It is, in reality, a true home with three full bedrooms and two baths. There are special touches through out that make visiting feel more like home.
Len is very quick to respond to queries about availability and stays in touch throughout.
Some details that you might look forward to:
A kitchen with the cooking tools needed to make real meals. There are some limited supplies like olive oil, salt & pepper, some spices available. However, if there is something that you must cook with, it‚Äôs best to bring your own. Eating meals on the front patio is such a treat at any time.
Hiking. There is so much space to explore and it‚Äôs never dull.
Peace and quiet. The property sits at the end of a road and there are no homes close by. It is so quiet. The stars are brilliant at night.
Len‚Äôs home is fantastic and worth repeated visits."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We reached out to Len a few days before booking in the hopes that he would allow us to book on short notice before the holiday weekend for a much needed girls' getaway during a very touristy weekend in our hometown of Santa Fe.
Len was instantly in communication and remained so during the entire visit. He was willing to accommodate us and shared fully all expectations for staying over at his home. His directions to the property were perfect and we arrived in the amount of time that he said we would. He provided us with a welcome bottle of wine from one of our local NM vineyards - delicious!
The property was just as described and could not have been more perfect for what we were seeking. There were no sounds of traffic as we were located at the end of the road. The only sounds we heard were those of the wind blowing through the many pine trees and birds.
The hiking was fantastic and we never got bored going out for walks with our dogs.
Checking out, we were sad to leave, was very easy. We hope to go back again for some more rest and relaxation soon! Thank you, Len!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great stay!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Neat little spot. Very clean, close to the downtown, well-appointed kitchen. Perfectly suitable for one or two guests looking for an alternative to the local hotels."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Anne‚Äôs place is just as described. I enjoyed my 3 month stay. The property has all the amenities you need and is close to the plaza. Teresa, was very helpful with any questions and to help with any issue. She is quick to respond and resolve things quickly. The Bunk is quiet and a peaceful retreat. This is a gem of a place to stay when in Las Vegas!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is perfect for visiting LV. I found the Airbnb space lacked any ‚Äòwarm‚Äô touches plus the lack of a coffee table or side tables made sitting on the couch uncomfortable. Needs a few adjustments, otherwise a great spot."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Kathy stayed here for six weeks while attending to our son's family after our second granddaughter's birth. The location is very convenient, right off the plaza. Our 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loved spending time at Gigi's place, her favorite spot was snack time at the desk. Billy's bunk is warm and comfortable despite outside temperatures in the teens. Didn't get a chance to use the air conditioning. Theresa was very pleasant and accommodating, and handled a couple of minor glitches in a timely manner. The kitchen is nice and stocked with dishes, etc. whatever you might need."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location of this place is excellent, as was communication with Theresa and husband, who seem to manage the day to day guest relations piece. A cool building and historic setting."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint place near the center of town. Kitchen well appointed and spacious. Theresa, co-host, was right there when needed. Would return! Week worth the price!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I was looking for a place to get away and also be able to work remotely during the week. Billy‚Äôs Bunk was quiet, had fast internet, was in a great location and had all amenities needed for a month long stay. I was able to walk everywhere, which was perfect when the work day was done and wanted to get out for a bit. I hope to come back next summer."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,We stayed at Anne's Place in November 2019 so we were familiar with the accommodations and location. It had everything we needed including clear reception on the TV. We will definitely stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Billy's Bunk was a great place to stay in Las Vegas, NM. It is very centrally located right next to the plaza with a couple coffee places, the Traveler's cafe and Shelly's nearby, as well as the Plaza hotel for restaurant and bar (there are a bunch of other restaurants too that are an easy walk). The bunk is clean and spacious with everything you need for a great stay. Linda was incredibly responsive and very helpful with any question I had.
I would highly recommend the hot springs, a small drive away & the Dwan Light Sanctuary is fun too and near the hot springs."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,I always enjoy my stay. It is my 1st choice for a place to stay in Las Vegas NM.

2021-08-01,3,Stayed over a week,"The place itself is well cared for and clean. Full kitchen with dishwasher a big plus. Internet worked well for remote work. There are no windows in the bedroom; just the front door at in the front of the kitchen. The location is right in town, which has its benefits and drawbacks. You are right around the corner from the plaza where there are shops and some restaurants. However, there is also some safety precautions to be aware of. Keep the gate locked. I had someone wander in thinking they were at a shelter. Linda and Anne were very responsive and accommodating."
2020-12-01,4,Stayed over a week,Anne is a great host and Linda is the best!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I really enjoyed my stay! The place was clean, safe, & responses were always quick should something come up from the managers! You really get what you pay for and being walking distance to so many things was such a perk."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay! Linda & Bill met us and gave us our keys, all while ensuring safety during covid19. Spacious apartment, comfy bed, all the kitchen necessities and a convenient location! We also really appreciated the curtains made it easier to sleep late! We'd be happy to stay again :)"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This place oozes charm. The exposed brick and the beautiful decor make this a true gem located in a town that is a bit of a gem itself!

2019-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"Thanks, we will consider Billy's bunk again the next time we are in Las Vegas."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay in this quaint little apartment off the heart of the historic plaza of Las Vegas. We booked last-minute on our way through the area, but Sandra and Vince both went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed (as well as great tips on where to have dinner and breakfast the next morning). We will definitely stay again if our travels ever bring us back to Las Vegas!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location. Redeveloped Historic area. Comfy and Colorful, Open space. Will stay again! Despite a city wide internet/cell tower outage...Host and staff went out of their way to get us to Billy's Bunk."

Some of the many reasons I love my home state. üíõüíö

The Denmin cabin provides a wonderful stay for our group of 4. Curtain dividers create adequate privacy in this charming, single room cabin.

Cabin was located in a very scenic and serene location, overlooking a meadow with views of Hermit Peak on one side and nice creek on the other side. Lot of positive energy and vibes at this place.

Wonderful mornings to wake up to with the sounds of birds in the fresh smelling pines. Take your coffee or tea outside and watch the sun and the clouds play hide-and-seek with Hermit Peak, the background for the sweet smelling grass pasture that extends from the back door of this cabin. With 150 acres of pines, oaks, cottonwoods and grasslands to walk in you have plenty of space to enjoy the wildlife. For the hiker numerous trails are nearby in the National Forests, and for the fishing buffs, the streams are some well kept local jewels. Las Vegas is a neat town to visit, the art community is up and coming and the restaurants serve some famous green hatch chili dishes. Visit the plaza in the historical district with it's famous 1880's hotels and buildings for a walk in yesteryear. Easy day trips to Santa Fe, Pecos , Mora and Taos are scenic drives not to be missed. Whether you enjoy the outdoors or the Old West appeal of the local towns, this cabin is far in the woods but easy enough to get too. Enjoy, I sure did and will again."

Kat and Lacey warmed our arrival with a gift basket full of goodies and a refrigerator full of bottled water. I seriously dreaded leaving this beautiful valley and plan to return soon.
The cabin was built by hand in the 1950s, so it has rough edges. For city dwellers and suburbanites, this perfectly appointed period piece cabin is a welcome respite from the squares and boxes and veneer that surround our modern lives. Kudos to Lacey and family for preserving these beautiful, unique Americana treasures."
