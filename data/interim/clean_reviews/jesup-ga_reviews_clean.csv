2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Flexible check in really helped us out.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed with our two dogs and it was perfect. The internet is very slow so we couldn’t get much work done, but other than that perfect place for us and our pups!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very cozy cottage a perfect get away for a weekend.
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"The good: Large place, very friendly host, fenced yard for dogs, kitchen, ample parking, grass and trees.
Hot water odor of sulfur (eggs) presumably from well - I couldn't take a shower for more than 3 minutes before getting out gagging. My wife wouldn't use the bath. House smelled of eggs after that. Dogs are very friendly but barked quite a bit knowing we had dogs, and they have access to the same yard via a dog door into their main house. Be careful if your dogs aren't friendly. Almost left but it was too late.
Well-worn 1980's style, decor, bed pillows, TV, and CD player. Beds not good. Needs $40K update and it'd be a gold mine. The mermaid painting - we had to find it from the previous reviews. It's a very good pencil line-art drawing of a well-endowed 25-year old woman arching her back - who happens to have a mermaid tail. I looked at it much longer than my wife did, so I get what the other lady was saying."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the dog yard. Spacious and well equipped kitchen.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tim’s guest house was such a cozy little gem! The whole property was just beautiful, and our dogs had a blast running around safely thanks to the fenced yard. Whenever we ran into anyone there, they were nice but also minded their business. The guest home was very clean overall, it was just a really relaxing, comfortable stay in a gorgeous setting."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stay at Tim's was great. Tim greeted us on arrival and welcomed us & our dog.
Cottage was clean and comfortable. There was a TV, but even better a CD player for us to listen to music while I cooked and while we ate. Bed was comfortable and coffee was there for the morning."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The sheets were soft and smelled like fresh laundry. The shower was nice and clean. We had a nice weekend stay here.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our third stay - need we say more?
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was quiet even though on a road. The dogs were friendly and cute. The house did have a slight odor and we found roach droppings but no roaches were actually seen. Overall an ok stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tim was a great host; he gave clear instructions, was welcoming, and turned on all the lights in the guest house for my arrival. This helped immensely because I arrived very late in the evening after a road trip. Would recommend, especially for a weary traveler."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I’m a repeat customer, and will be back again. Thanks Tim!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tim’s place was a great stop on my way further south. The house was as described and the instructions were perfect! Added bonus was a fenced in back yard and his 2 beautiful dogs. Wonderful water pressure in the shower, everything I needed.
Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Booked the pool house for my brother to coincide with our staying at Tim's guest house. He LOVED the poolhouse. Setup much like a studio apartment it had everything he needed for a relaxing stay. He's already talking about booking again next spring.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Location was convenient to activities we were in town to attend. It was nice to have a yard for our elderly dog to roam a little. Tim made check in process very easy and we had everything we needed so there was no need to contact him for anything. H
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My mom and I stayed at Tim’s guest house to attend a family funeral. He was quick to respond to book; provided clear check in instructions and the location was easily accessible for my mother who is an amputee. We enjoyed our stay!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay. We expect to stay a couple of times a year as we travel between NC and Florida. Great setting for our dog to be able to run in the fenced area. Pet friendly is always a priority for us.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay at the Guest House. I'm not sure what more could be added to my review of our stay in Oct, '22. Tim is a wonderful host, very affable and always available to help. We are so comfortable at the Guest House, it's becoming our second home."

Communication was excellent, directions were on point, clean kid & pet-friendly house, and the pool was perfect for back to back days in the 90s. Tim was a very interesting dude with a lot of cool stories, I highly recommend chatting him up if you have the chance.

Overall, it was a fantastic stay, and I'm looking forward to returning."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a short stay or long term THIS is the place. It isn’t a small hotel like room but a small home with all you need. I would recommend this place for a long term visit if I was staying anywhere near-by. We only stayed one night because of our schedule, but with the price, location and room, this is our go to place in Georgia."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Since we were traveling w/ our dog, Nickel, Tim's guest house was an awesome find! Not sure who enjoyed our stay more, her or Mike & I. What an understated luxury to have the fenced in yard, she could explore and roam on her own and we didn't have to worry.
Tim's place has everything needed for a comfortable stay. The central location made for easy day trips to Savannah, Brunswick & St Simons.
Of course, no review of Tim's place would be complete w/o mentioning ""The Girls"" as we referred to them. Sherlock & Rosie are two of the sweetest dogs ever. They both not only welcomed Nickel, but also tolerated her 3 year old lab energy.
Thanks again, Tim for everything. We'll be back for sure!!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Once again, our stay at Tim's property was wonderful. The location is quiet, but close to necessities. We look forward to staying again in the coming months!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Tim offers a safe and spacious refuge for travelers. We were moving to the area and needed a place to stay for a couple of weeks. We had 3 dogs( one passed prior to our visit at Tims) but Tim was fine with allowing us to bring our dogs.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bonafide nice
2021-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Tim was very responsive and his place was just what we needed on our trip. There was some great if odd to find in an AirBnB kitschy art that we enjoyed. There were however a number of kitschy signs encouraging skinny dipping and topless bathing. Though I believe women should get to go topless whenever it came off as kinda creepy in an AirBnB hosted by a dude.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We definitely recommend this place to others

2019-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Animal hair on bed/couches and rugs. No internet access.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tim's place was just great. We arrived after dark and were a bit disoriented trying to find it, but Tim waited for us at the end of his driveway with a flashlight to guide us in from the road. His cottage was large and had a full kitchen, sitting room, two bedrooms, and large bathroom--and it was sparkling clean. We had a great night's sleep and then were on the road early the next day, but Tim's hospitality will not be forgotten!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tim’s home was perfect for our work trip. Great location. The atmosphere is laidback and inviting. I especially loved the pool area with bar. Oh and the Labs super nice they made it feel like home. Tim and Angle are super nice and we came home with a southern accent! Five STARS!!!!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’m riding my bicycle across the country, and after a long day on the saddle, staying at Tim’s was a welcome relief! They even offered to drive me into town to get dinner, although I ended up ordering delivery."

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’m cycling the atlantic coast trail, and the countryside area around Jesup is a weak spot on the map because of a lack of services.
I’m happy that Tim was available on such a short notice. He wasn’t at home but he made sure that someone else welcomed me.
The dogs are an added bonus, they’re fun and wanna play all the time!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tim was great! We left some very important things at the house and called to find them. Tim helped us find them AND waited for us to get back to give them to us personally. He even offered to ship them to us!
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome host. Quiet and peaceful area with a few personal touches of nature (wild turkeys and deer). Perfect place for a get away.
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Tim's guest house. It was a spacious, two bedroom unit with a large bathroom and kitchen. We had everything we needed. The beds were extremely comfortable. Tim was gracious, welcoming and helpful. I'd definitely stay there again."

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tim is a great host. Can’t do enough for you. The apartment has everything you will need. Deer at dusk in the back garden too! Jesup is just down the road and has some great restaurants. If you’re anywhere near here, this Airbnb is a perfect stopover. Highly recommended."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tim's place is located in rural southeast Georgia. Traffic isn't bad and he is right off a major highway, and the highways are scenic. I stayed in the guest house and it felt like I was staying with family. Tim was very welcoming and made me feel at home. I had all of the comforts of home (satellite & Wi-Fi) and he even let his dogs into the courtyard between the 3 houses so I could play with them. It is a rural area, so expect wildlife, bugs & insects to be around the property. I would stay there again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,great Host nice country feel . would stay again .

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay was a brief one night stay with most of it spent sleeping. We departed early the next morning and didn't get to enjoy the property. We will plan any future stays in the Jesup area in the Barn and more time set a side for hanging at the property.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was great! My husband was sent to Jesup for work and spending March there in this rental was great! our boys loved riding their bikes up the long driveway most days and visiting the cows. The Moxley's are wonderful friendly people! The house had everything we needed and most of what we wanted! There were a couple small issues that Debbie worked hard to resolve! Would recommend to anyone and would stay again if the opportunity comes.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Debbie's place was a great fit for my family of 5 adults during our road trip. Would definitely stay again!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was just what I needed! A clean, inviting, warm, cozy, peaceful, QUIET oasis to step into and call home! Debbie + her husband truly went out of her way to make it feel like a home away from home! I WISH I had booked a longer stay, but this was my first booking with AirBNB and I was so afraid of being disappointed... Alas, that couldn't be further from the truth! I look forward to staying here -- again and again -- every time I pass through town. The decor is just as I would decorate if I had a dream-barn of my own! Love, love, love!!! Highly recommend clicking ""reserve"" if you're considering. If you need a break from the hustle, stay as long as you can!"

Great value."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debbie and her husband were very congeniel hosts.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stephen was a fantastic host- communicative,

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, safe location! This place is a guest house near the back of the property near the pool. Parking is located near the first drive near the mailbox and driving straight back. Parking was the only thing that slightly confused us, everything else was very clear and exceeded our expectations. One of the nicest air bnb’s I’ve rented and one of the cleanest as well. Also, well-decorated and I absolutely loved the lit mirror. Was my favorite feature and made getting ready so easy! 😊"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the place. Hopefully it will be available on our next trip to Jesup.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely pleased. Quiet secluded and in great condition. Most definitely recommend to others
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute place with all the amenities we needed for an overnight stay. I could see a long weekend there being very pleasant as well. Kylie was very responsive to my request to remove air fresheners due to my allergies. The bedroom is small for a king-size bed, so it is against the wall and one person has to climb in from the end, but that was not a big deal for us and I am sure it would not be for others. You can tell that is the case from the pictures so it was not a surprise. The living area is spacious and welcoming and the couch is so comfortable. I just wish my schedule had allowed time to enjoy the pool!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful home and she’s very nice.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great stay ! Thank you for having us.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There is not a better host, or stay in all of Jesup, GA. She hosted me for 3 days a week for 7 weeks and was phenomenal to deal with. The guest suite is beautiful, relaxing and offers every amenity you could possibly need."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were nervous about staying on someone else’s property but the space was absolutely perfect, warm, & welcoming! Highly recommend Kylies Airbnb to anyone coming to Jesup!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a great place to stay! In an awesome neighborhood..isolated enough for privacy, but convenient enough to get to restaurants and some shopping. It was perfect for what I needed for business with an easy drive to Ft. Stewart.
The host...Kylie is fantastic and very accommodating. Just the right touches to make a home away from home. The place is spotless and steps away from the pool.
I will absolutely stay here again and I highly recommended it. Well done!"

There’s plenty of room and everything in the house worked.
The next time I’m in town I will be checking on this place again"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Derrick was an excellent host. We were very comfortable with our stay here. Wish the mosquitoes were not invited, and the dirt road made it a bit challenging after the rain. Derrick was helpful with the tv and permitting our dog being in the house. The car port was a great help. We appreciated all this place offered."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a perfect place for us on our trip south. We wanted to do some exploring in the area for personal reason. The place has all the most important basics for us. Nice and peaceful.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,His place is exactly as described.. Worked well for what I needed.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"At first, we were worried when the road pavement ended. But once we got to the house, seeing all the neighbors and their friendliness, and knowing Derrick lives just down the road, all our concerns ended. The location gave us great access to the coastal islands and historical sites from Charleston SC to Jekyll Island. The accommodations met all our needs and Derrick responded quickly to all our communications. It will remain on our list of possibilities for next Jan-Feb."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Immaculately clean, looks just like the photos. Was the 3rd GA rental I've been in, and by far the best."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I got to stay this entire summer here. Loved everything, it was quiet backwoods area that offered a pond to fish in and spacious overhang porch. As someone who is very laid back kind of country it truly was a slice of heaven. 15 mins to small town of Jesup and 40 mins to Brunswick 50 mins to the islands. Far enough away for extra peace and close enough for plenty to do. I'll be back absolutely for sure. Also the nicest hosts ever."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Derrick was accessible if needed easy check in, clean, everything needed was available. Would stay again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Derrick's spot is out in the country and the accommodations are as advertised.
Nothing fancy but adequate and satisfactory.
We enjoyed walking down to the boat ramp -- it looks a bit like ""Where the Crawdads Sing"", a little magical. But the mosquitoes liked me a lot more than I liked them!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,a good host very friendly a very clean place very cozy would definitely stay there again when I come back to Jesup

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Francisco was amazing. Good little spot. Relaxing
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place was amazing. It is a peaceful cabin set on 40 acres. Although it provides privacy and seclusion, it is only 10 minutes from downtown Jesup. Francisco was an incredible accommodating host and always quick to communicate with any questions we had. Myself and my crew stayed here for almost 2 months while working on a project in Jesup. Franciso had no problem with us parking our trailers in the grass which was very helpful. He even allowed us to bring a camper which they had full hookups for at a small additional cost. If ever in Jesup again, this is where I would stay. I highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was the perfect lil family get away for my family the screened in front porch was our favorite part for anytime at all morning ,noon or night we could be out and enjoy without getting eaten by bugs !!!! The cabin was cute and big enough for just us four and far as surrounding areas for stuff to do we was an hour away from any direction we wanted to go so we was kinda in the middle ! The cabin is quiet and peaceful and it is the perfect spot to turn off the phones and enjoy just family !!! Can’t wait to come back !!!"

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked this to have extra space with a lot of family staying in Jesup for Thanksgiving. The location was great for us as it was just down the road from where the rest of the family was staying. The porches are fantastic! Will stay again if needed.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is great. Just far enough away from town and set back enough to feel like you are out in the middle of nowhere. Very clean everything you need to relax. We will be back
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The grounds were beautiful & allowed us to take walks down to the pond. The screened in porch was the best & just added to our stay. Very nice retreat from our busy lives.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I’m absolutely in love with this property! It is located minutes from town yet when you are on the property it feels as if you are on a private oasis. My husband children and myself loved walking around looking at the beautiful trees and the cute goats. It was so nice sitting on the screened in porch watching beautiful sunsets and hearing only the sounds of our kids laughing and nature. Definitely one of those moments you want to live in forever. If you need to get back in that honeymoon phase of your relationship I highly recommend coming here away from the world turning your phone off and just enjoy the company with your person. The home is a beautiful and cozy. The host is very responsive and yet very respectful to give privacy. We will be back
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can’t say anything wrong about this place. The house was very nice & cozy. The screened porch definitely made some some cool nights not getting eating alive by bugs. I truly enjoyed myself & will definitely will look you up again for my next trip out.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful small cabin, the loft was a pretty cool place to sleep and the property was expansive. We really enjoyed our stay. We would advise bringing drinking water as the well water does have the sulfur smell common in this part of the country. It isn't super strong and we cooked, cleaned, and brushed our teeth with the tap water but for drinking, we preferred bottled water. Easy enough!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Very friendly host, quick response time. The cabin is very cozy and the property is beautiful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean just as described. Creston was very friendly. He greeted me as I arrived to make sure everything was good. Checked up periodically to see if I needed anything. The AC went out and he took care of the problem right away to ensure my stay was completely comfortable. I would give more than a 5 star review if I could.
The only thing I regret was that I couldn’t enjoy the pool due to my work schedule.
I would highly recommend staying here."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could not have asked for a better first experience with an Airbnb.
Everything was exactly as described and even more. It felt as if I had just walked into my own home.
R. Creston was a very gracious host and I would recommend his accommodations for anyone.
I would definitely return if the beed ever arised.
Thank you Creston"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Creston is a great host. Really enjoyed our stay. The home had everything we needed. Really enjoyed sitting on the porch with a great view of the pool and nature. Highly recommended.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly, the pictures don't capture the true beauty of this place. Nestled in a serene and tranquil location, it's absolutely stunning. The hosts were exceptional, always responding promptly within minutes. Their kindness and helpfulness were remarkable. The cottage itself is not only well-equipped but also exquisitely beautiful. The hosts went the extra mile to ensure it felt like a home away from home. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone and would definitely choose to stay here again if I'm ever in the area."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely and very clean cottage with an easy check in process.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I have to say I was extremely pleased with Pauline’s Cottage. The place was very welcoming and smelled great. Everything was well organized. Nice and comfortable home away from home.

This is my second time staying and would definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great easy location. Just as described. Perfect for our stay.
2024-02-01,3.0,Group trip,"I am not one to criticize anyone or place, so this is all I will say since Airbnb keeps requesting a review, while it was clean, it was not the same as it was the first time we stayed there."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place very quiet
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s cottage was just what I needed for my unfortunate trip I had to make. Amy worked with me with getting me checked in on the date I really needed.
However, it could use better lighting outside as it was pitch black trying to get a kid into the house. Also, way too many air fresheners in the house. I had to unplug all of them as they gave me and my kid a headache. It was not the cleanest place. The kitchen cabinets were very dirty (inside and outside) and the dishes were dirty and smelled horrible from being stacked in the cabinets soaking wet. The entire place really needed a deep cleaning. The couch covers were hanging off in the floor and not on the couch properly. The shower curtain in the master bath was extremely dirty also.
I really loved the house because it is older and I love old houses and it was in the perfect location for me."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Just a great place to stay. Home away from home. Very comfortable and a lot better than staying in a local hotel. Thanks for everything!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was in a great area near town and Amy was great at responding.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pauline’s Cottage was conveniently located to Jesup. Cute place but the multitude of air fresheners were a little overwhelming and did give me a killer headache when coming inside. Solved by unplugging though…so all good. The mattresses and pillows weren’t too comfortable but the place was pretty clean, which I really appreciate. Only thing to watch out for is the coffee maker. The water reservoir was loaded with grounds like it had overflowed a few times before, so had to clean it out before using…it also malfunctions some as it turns on instantly upon plugging it in, so just a caution on that. Peaceful setting and close to everything…overall a nice place and worth the stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was clean.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little cottage home perfect for a peaceful getaway away but close enough to Southern attractions for day trips. it was quiet and clean. plenty of space to relax indoors and out. The kitchen was well stocked, reducing the need to eat out."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Felt like home being from Jesup, clean, comfortable and safe.
I loved the kitchen window looking out at the backyard watching Cardinals and Mocking Birds, thankful for all the amenities that were available. Amy is very responsive to questions but we really didn’t have to bother her because we had everything we needed. Thank you so much for the stay at Pauline’s Cottage, we would definitely stay again 😊"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Clean and comfortable, what more could you ask for? The only issue we had was with the Dish satellite and Amy personally came out with a friend to try and fix it.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Originally, we were supposed to stay at Pauline’s cottage, but unfortunately because of the ridiculously freezing temperatures the pipes had froze. Amy was amazing and let me know there was an issue and she moved us to the octagon cottage. We loved staying in the octagon, it was unique and welcoming. The kids absolutely loved hearing and seeing the trains."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing Airbnb
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a very clean place. It's an older house, but it's nicer than any of the hotels in Jesup. Only two things that I wish would improve...there are no lamps in either of the secondary bedrooms, only the overhead light. The master bathroom does not have a towel rack at all, so there is no where to hang wet towels."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was perfect. clean and comfortable.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just as Amy posted, a great place to stay, very clean and well furnished. Will definitely rebook next visit."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at Kayla's. We felt right at home. The back yard was great for back yard play with the children and their cousins. And when the rain trapped us inside, the ping pong table came through in the clutch. The bed slept comfortably and there was more than enough space. The place was clean. I would definitely book again when I visit home."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The little house is conveniently located in Jesup across from the hospital, but it wasn't loud. It has plenty of space, three bedrooms and two bathrooms and a bonus room that I think used to be a garage that could be another bedroom if you had an air mattress. There isn't much furniture (coffee tables, any tables in the living area, accent chairs), but the essentials are there. There was also no toaster or spatulas/cooking utensils. Kayla was very flexible and helpful when I needed to flex my arrival/departure last minute for a family emergency and I appreciated that! would stay again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Look forward to working with Kayla again!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great stay and host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay. The house was big enough for our family as well as our family members to visit. It needs more chairs and furniture to sit down on. The house has a large enclosed area it would be great to make it an entertainment area with a pool table or gaming equipment.. It also needs to have TV’s in each bedroom as well as in the family room where everyone gathers. But overall it was great we would most definitely stay here again. Love the house and the location.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, clean, well lit with natural lighting and in night..well equipped with essentials..clean soft, white towels ..trees and birds..quiet neighborhood.."

She was very sweet and attentive. There had been alot of rain just before we arrived so she let me know before we arrived about the wet yard but honestly, that didn't to detour from the stay at all. We would most definitely stay here again."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay at Christine’s place in Odum. We loved how private and relaxing the location was. We loved the pretty pond and ducks. Christine even left duck food for us and we were able to feed the ducks which was fun! The place was clean and had everything we needed. Our dog also enjoyed the large yard and pond. Christine was very nice and helpful! We will definitely be back next time we visit the area. Thank you for a great stay!

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just one regret here. We didn’t stay longer because the time flew by quickly. With that, we plan to stay again. No WIFI and limited television coverage added to the appeal. That propane fire pit was a pleasant surprise. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Thank you Mrs. Christine for your hospitality!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mrs. Christine’s cabin on lake Martha was the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. It was so peaceful and we felt at home. I would highly recommend her listing to avid sportsmen or for someone just looking to relax.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a wonderful place with so much charm! We would definitely stay there again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The outdoor shower is definitely worth it. Loved being out and hearing all the nature sounds.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very peaceful! Perfect spot for a getaway from the hustle and bustle.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I only passed through for a single night on a road trip with my 6 month old. The parrot place was very quaint and eclectic. We loved the big bed and bath tub. They were very accommodating to us and thought about our needs before we expressed them. Highly recommend. Its a very beautiful property.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Old Parrot Place was absolutely charming. My mom and I felt like we were in a Nancy Drew novel. Antiques were artfully dotted all around the property; winding paths led you to a cookhouse, greenhouse, and animals; and the Spanish moss and palms gave the entire property a slightly mystical vibe. The cabin was well represented in the listing’s photos. Its furnishings were antique but sturdy and well-functioning. The bed was comfortable, the towels and linens clean, and everything felt very homey.
Mary herself was a delight to communicate with. She was extremely friendly and responsive to messages. She had clearly put a great deal of thought into what people might need during their stay and provided many creature comforts such as books, DVDs, a coffee maker etc. The fully outfitted cookhouse provided an easy place to make meals if you didn’t want to go into town. And the outdoor shower (there’s an indoor tub too) was a fun extra feature. It truly felt like staying at a relative’s home."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spent a wonderful few days at Mary and Marvins place. We were in the cabin and everything was as shown. We used the cookhouse for meals. The outdoor fridge was useful and Mary left condiments and beverages for our use. Mary and Marvin were very kind and there were animals to visit. It is close to Okefenokee and to the coast Brunswick and St SImons.. Very peaceful. Also there is a lake nearby for boating.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay the night! Peaceful surroundings. Mary was kind and offered fresh eggs.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Mary and Marvin was ideal!! We were looking for a place to relax and unwind and this was the perfect spot. Both Mary and Marvin were very friendly and great hosts, they made us feel welcome and at home. We can't wait to visit again soon!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful, beautiful, peaceful place to stay. Mary and Marvin were a lovely couple and so welcoming as well as there fine furry friends. We loved being greeted by their 2 dogs Corey and Susie and Phillip the cat. It is a lovely setting and Mary gave us some history on their property. Easy parking right in front of the cabin. Nice clean and cozy room with comfy bed, large bathroom and also has an outdoor shower. Lots of dvds to choose from if you want to watch a movie. Even has another building if you want to cook something. Mary had fresh eggs waiting for us upon our arrival. We were also introduced to her other animal friends that live on the property. What a great place to stay. We can’t wait to come back. Thank you both for a wonderful stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"At Mary’s place, we were able to escape the norm and partake in paradise. Mary and Marvin are exceptionally nice hosts who took us on a tour of the property, explaining its history and some potential plans for the future. The place had everything and more. We definitely hope to go back and stay a couple of days. Unfortunately, our schedule did not permit it."

The setting was the most peaceful place I have ever stayed. I loved the animals and the charm of the property. If you are looking to unplug and get some peace and quiet, this is the perfect place. I only wish I had more time to spend there."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great place to spend a weekend.
Loved meeting/petting all the animals, star gazing at the fire, sunset walk to the lake, and cooking farm fresh eggs in the morning. Cabin was a great place to stay and felt rustic the best way."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Mary’s place! The cottage was peaceful and pristine. We enjoyed the personal touches she added. Mary was accommodating, responsive, and very welcoming. We enjoyed chatting with her about her diving adventures. Our favorite part of the stay was definitely meeting and feeding the baby goats she is babysitting. :)
If you are looking for a peaceful place in nature (and love animals) this is the place for you. Incredible value and a special find. Thank you Mary for your hospitality, we’ll definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The sweetest and most peaceful place to stay! We will definitely be coming back :)

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked Mary's place for my sister's 50th birthday present. She said it was the most adorable place with so much character. They got to kayake in the lake, grill out, feed the animals and relax on the porch!! The cook house had everything you needed to prepare a meal. The hosts provide farm fresh eggs, as well! My sister said they will definitely be back again. Thank you Mary and Marvin for making her birthday a special one!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay . The hosts were worth it alone. They were wonderful people who make magic happen in peoples lives because of their presence and the offer of sharing their land and cabins for little cost for those seeking to remember the best things in life are peace joy and love, which we received in abundance. A wonderful and relaxing get away in a whimsicle space that we began to miss the minute we closed the door to our rustic and yet very comfortable cabin which left us wanting more. WE will be back Thank you for such a great memory and your amazing generosity of spirit. To us you are now friends Victoria and Chris"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a sweet,cozy place to relax and unwind. We spent several days here celebrating our 39th anniversary and enjoyed it so much! Perfect location away from city noises -loved hearing the rooster crow in the mornings and the train whistle at night. We took day trips to the Golden Isles from the abnb. A day on St Simons, a day to Cumberland National seashore and a day golfing on Jekyll Island. Lots of good places to eat in those areas and then back to the cottage for rest. Also there are nearby convenience stores for whatever you may need or want for snacks since there is a microwave and fridge at the cottage. Mary and Marvin are wonderful host, available if needed but not around if you don’t. They gave us a tour of the little farm place and all the critters and we enjoyed that and their friendliness. I have to comment on the cost as well as we have stayed in rentals for years now, thank you Mary and Marvin for keeping the cost down and affordable for everyone. Just a truly great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a magical and restorative two days at this beautiful property. Mary and Marvin are kind and generous humans. They left me fresh eggs in the morning and treated me like their own family. It was exactly what my soul needed. The property is quiet and a perfect respite from our too-busy world. There's so many places to explore: the animals, the lake, the various antiques on the property. I loved it. Thank you again!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a lovely yet too short of a stay at Mary Ann Marvin’s. We so wished we had booked for a longer stay, but we plan to return in the near future. So peaceful, and inviting. We felt so comfortable and wished we could’ve stayed longer. Mary gave us a wonderful tour of their property, and we were astounded at all of the work they put into it to make it such a lovely place to be. Upon arriving we were greeted by two adorable affectionate dogs. The cabin we stayed in was perfect. Mary, thought of everything, to make it comfortable including small floor heater as there had been a cold front the day before. She was so gracious and showed us all of her amazing animals on the farm, as well as the larger unit for a family gathering situation. Just gorgeous workmanship and decor. A very special place, that I would highly recommend for someone who appreciates a peaceful place, with a sweet history."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When I pull up to Mary’s cabin, it feels like I just got home:)). It’s so lovely on their land and Mary is such a helpful host and delightful to chat with— makes me feel like I wish I was staying longer!!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible deal for the price! Such a relaxing spot with incredible hosts! All the animals on property are a great bonus to the stay. We so wish we could have stayed longer. If you are looking for a secluded and relaxing spot - this is for sure the place!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend Mary and Marvin’s place when you need fresh air and quiet— great little cabin, with a front porch meant for coffee and reflection!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LOVED it here. So peaceful. It’s off the beaten path but well worth the drive to Okefenokee. Mary was great. The animals are amazing. The horse and donkey really like carrots, the potbelly pig preferred apples.
It rained while we were there. Nothing like rain on a tin roof to lull you right to sleep. I highly recommend this little cabin!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful and peaceful place! Cozy, unique and super clean. We really appreciated the extra touches like popcorn & movies. We look forward to coming back:)"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Most responsive host ever. Had troubles on the way there and she was willing to help in any way. Really looking forto staying here in the future.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always love staying at the parrot place.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed my stay. Peaceful. Lots of animals. Quiet. Off the beaten path. I’ll be back for the outdoor shower next trip to FL. I chickened out in the chilly morning air. The clawfoot tub was amazing. Plenty of hot water
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, quiet cabin with a beautiful shared cookhouse, lots of quirky antiques to see. Great if you want a rustic, throwback vibe - but still want AC and running water!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Mary's cabin, so that's a sign right away that we like it!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really unique and cozy place in rural Georgia, fun stay for an evening! Definitely would recommend to most folks; quirky touches and really lovely surroundings.
*A few tips though: if you're staying on a Friday/Saturday night, there's a wedding venue nearby that can have music playing until 11pm-midnight. Also, the road into the place is sandy dirt, so in wet weather it can be half a mile of bumps and sandy tires.*"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is off the beaten path and it’s quaint cute and smells like fresh linen. We were so comfortable and would definitely stay again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin were so kind, friendly and hospitable. We had booked the cabin for a quick, quiet get away but there was a complication with the plumbing… they didn’t miss a beat. They put us in another house on their property and we still were able to enjoy our peace and quiet!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I always look forward to staying at Mary and Marvin's place in the country. I got a free upgrade to the bigger house because some repairs were needed at the cabin, which was extra nice."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our review is actually for the other home on the property, Story House. We were due to stay in the cabin and received a call from the host on our way down to inform us that the previous occupants of the cabin had been I'll and the host felt it would be wrong to have us stay in the cabin until they had thoroughly sanitized. They instead offered us the large home on the property to stay in at the same rate as the cabin. This was the beginning of the hosts endearing themselves to us. I don't know the policies of the company but I know that most hotels and other stays might not have given us the same option. It is so cozy and we loved being able to unplug, watch DVDs and rest before visiting Cumberland Island the next day. When we returned from the island there was a fire in the fire pit, the cookhouse lights were on as I had said I wanted to explore over there and Marvin and Mary were both outside dealing with farm emergency (I hope the horse recovered!). We can't wait to return!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We booked this as a stop on our way to a vacation spot. Little did we know Mary's place WAS a destination! We loved it so much. Mary and Marvin were very welcoming. Their homestead is full of wonderful surprises around each corner. Mary pays attention to little details to make you comfortable. I cannot wait to go back and make more great memories!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing out of the ordinary place I. a beautiful nature surrounding and the cabin Wow

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Mary's cabin was great! She was responsive, helpful, and flexible when we were delayed by traffic. The cabin is wonderfully decorated: we felt right at home. The host provided everything we could have needed for our stay! We watched one of the many DVDs and bundled up in bed. There were pamphlets to local parks and many field guides, which we enjoyed. Mary provided interesting details about the property and buildings in the provided binder. Any questions we could have had were clearly answered by the binder or helpful notes left around the cabin. We had a great time looking at the beautiful plants and saying hello to the animals in the back.
Clean, comfy, and very welcoming! We hope to be back someday."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very beautiful, cozy place to stay and the owners were so lovely"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Old Parrot’s Place in my cabin in the woods was a dream come true, to every last detail of interior design Mary so thoroughly put together. I enjoyed Marvin’s hospitality; I saw their horses and the miniature donkey, and the pig was a riot! I enjoyed making myself a hot tub, and watching a DVD the old school way. I felt right at home! It was everything I hoped for, and more! I highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this little cabin. It was perfect for us. Mary and Marvin were both very hospitable and friendly. They made us feel right at home. The cabin was charming, cozy, comfortable and very clean. So many little extras were well thought out and provided. From games, pens, colored pencils, books, dvds and so much more. We did not make use of the cook house. But we toured it and found it to be quite a gem. If we had more time, we would have made use of it I am sure. We hope to stay here again when ever we are back in the area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We’ve stayed here numerous times- we love it! Quiet getaway ❤️
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay if you're looking for a quiet place surrounded by woods. The cabin is super cute and the property is full of awesome collectables. Mary and her husband are the more sincere people. They took their time to show us around the property, introduce us to all of their animals, and answer any questions we had. They are so genuine. I'd highly recommend their place!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary & Marvin are the epitome of what a gracious host should be.
This was our 4th visit and plan to visit more in the future. We have stayed in both the cabin and the ""story House"" and absolutely love both."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This completely charming airbnb is close to the Okefenokee Swamp, and it was my second time staying. Always a pleasure to enjoy some farm fresh eggs and say hello to all of the animals. My go-to stop if I am ever looking for a place in the area. Hosts are wonderful and very accommodating. Outdoor shower is always a must."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was absolutely thrilled with the cabin. Very cozy and the surroundings were welcoming and just what I needed to get away from the city. Wish I could have stayed longer.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place ! Awesome cabin with the most fantastic outside shower ( great water pressure/tons of hot water) . It’s set in a wonderful Sandy bottom forest with tons of shade. The cabin has so much character and charm as does the “ cook house “. Felt like I was transported to an earlier era when life was simpler. Marvin and Mary are wonderful hosts ( generous , hospitable , friendly )."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cabin was Rustic as described but everything I needed was provided. Property was interesting and quiet, plenty of good walks around."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second time staying at Mary's place. We absolutely love everything about it. Both Mary and her husband are delightful people marching to the beat of their own drums! We enjoyed perusing the fascinating collection of antiques and other oddities. Most of all I applaud Mary's consideration of my fragrance allergies as she made sure to wash the linens and towels in unscented detergent to keep me safe. Many thanks, Mary!! We shall return!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our third time back and we love it here! Mary & Marvin are always so welcoming and flexible. They always make sure we have everything we need for a comfortable stay. We look forward to any time they can spare to sit down and chat with us, at the same time they give us lots of space/privacy. I’ve told so many people about this wonderful place- and we hope they always continue hosting guests."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and her husband are south Georgia jewels! What a peaceful place they have; I had a wonderful stay! They could not have been more accommodating. I would stay here again if I am ever back in the area.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin were friendly, relaxed hosts. The location was my delight because it was in the country and so peaceful and calm. I could walk barefoot and sit on the earth. It’s rustic in a good way, but clean. I ate their chicken’s eggs. Mary, Marvin and I shared conversations and connection. They introduced me to their animals and since I’m a plant person, too, Mary showed me her plants. We geeked outside on herbs and potions, too. Mary sent me away with a cutting and other treats. Not saying that will be the case for everyone, we just shared interests.
Marvin is kind and caring and made sure I felt safe when working guests arrived in their truck at night at the other house.
I loved! hanging out with their two dogs and the horses and donkey. I gave Piggy my persimmon peals per suggestion. All friendly animals; if you don’t want to have animal time, you don’t have to.
Their cook house is cool. I love a gas stove. There’s a zip line! I forgot to try it before I left."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin have created a rustic and timeless get away free from the noise of everyday life. Step back from all the business and enjoy the uncomplicated pleasures of a simpler approach to life.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin are just the loveliest people you can find. The place is rustic but awesome if you look for an unplugged hideaway!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary's cabin was absolutely charming! We arrived at dark but were still able to get in and settled with no problem. We only got to stay one night. We were blown away by the place the cookhouse and absolute charm of the whole surroundings. We would definitely stay there again. Wish we could have been there longer this time around. If you love a charming cabin in the woods this is your place. The attention to detail is spot on. We love the antiques and the welcoming atmosphere. We slept well and enjoyed everything about the cabin. We would definitely stay there again and spend more time. Thank you Mary!!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little cabin in the woods was spectacular. We built a nice little fire outside when we arrived. Made breakfast in the cook house and explored the area the next day. Don't miss out on this one! It's a WONDERFUL place and at a great price!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you're looking for fancy, this ain't it. If you're looking for a comfortable night's sleep in a quiet, rural spot with friendly hosts, you've found it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As usual, my stay was lovely. Mary is a wonderful hostees and is very engaging and knowledgeable about the area and what it has to offer. I will definitely be back for my, now, 6th visit there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay! The property is peaceful and quiet. A nice quiet get-away. Our cat was really enjoying exploring around the property and meeting the barnyard animals. We would love to book a longer stay in the future. Highly recommended.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect, quaint spot for a cozy stay in South Georgia! Mary is the consummate host and even will provide fresh eggs and breakfast items for you in the cookhouse just next door (with a gorgeous wraparound porch). You must experience the outdoor shower — so fun! The bed was comfy, too. Will stay here again if we are in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was absolutely amazing. Mary and Marvin thought of everything to make sure that we had everything we needed to feel at home, including fresh eggs from their chickens. The property is eclectically decorated with plenty to look at and explore. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to unplug and unwind in a peaceful natural setting."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a peaceful respite or just an opportunity to decompress, you have found the right place. Mary's cabin is lovely and quaint. You can almost imagine yourself in another time with all the interesting antiques and old-time setting. Mary's husband, Marvin, gave me a tour around the property and there is quite the interesting history. The location is remote with no decent restaurants or other city amenities within miles. But that's what you are there for, right? There is nice wooded hiking and a pretty lake (with fishing I understand) just across the road plus Jekyll Island is not too far away. Clean and comfortable and although Mary describes it as teeny tiny, it's small but not that small (and the bathroom is quite large btw). These are good people - I wish there were more Airbnb hosts like Mary and Marvin that really cared about providing a good experience for their guests."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We love visiting the cabin! It was our second stay here and we hope to continue to make visits. Mary always makes us feel welcomed and makes sure we have everything we need. Always grateful for the hospitality and friendliness. Thank you 💜

We took advantage of the cookhouse, farm fresh eggs, and outdoor shower. We have already booked our next stay and can’t wait to return. Thank you both for the conversation and opening up your home to us. It felt like a home away from home from the moment we parked and we are looking forward to coming back again, kayaking or sitting around a fire and having more conversation. Exactly the relaxing, laid-back weekend trip that I needed to reset. 11/10: wonderful experience, kind hearted people, +animals and delicious eggs! 💕 thank you, thank you!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the best air bnb I've stayed at yet. My daughter and I were traveling from VA to Florida for a wedding and needed a place to crash for the night. The cabin was clean, the bed was comfortable, and everything made me feel like I was at home. We got in late but woke up and walked the property to be happily greeted by all the farm family. Horses, chickens, dogs, cats, and my daughters personal favorite, a mini donkey by the name of Skippy Jack. The welcome guide covered everything you could possibly need to know about the place, whether you were staying for a night or a month.
10/10 I'll make up a reason to travel there in the future to stay again"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary, Marvin, and The Old Parrot Place are a definite TREASURE. This was my husband and my second stay at Mary's cabin, and we have decided to make it our annual getaway. The peace and tranquility we find there is beyond compare, and we look forward to unplugging everytime!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an unforgettable experience at the cabin. my partner and I were escaping the hurricane, and Mary responded to changes and answered questions quickly, even very late at night.
When we met her, she was filled with so much joy and made us feel very comfortable and right at home. I have never met someone with so much hospitality.
I loved feeding the donkey Skippy he is so sweet. we also loved walking around the property barefoot the sand is amazing! the outdoor shower and the bathtub were also great! there is nothing more I could have asked for. I would not have wanted to spend my time anywhere else during the unexpected hurricane. I was so grateful to be there with such a kind and caring host. it was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back!!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a peaceful environment and enjoy authentic antiques and a rustic atmosphere this is your paradise! Mary and Marvin have really out done themselves and have thought of every little detail to make your stay comfortable and carefree! They greeted us on arrival, gave a us a gate pass and key to the private boat ramp. Left us fresh eggs daily. You could spend hours looking at all the antiques and taking a step back in time. We absolutely loved the outdoor shower! Especially after a hot day on the river fishing. We didn't get to talk plants but Mrs. Mary has lots of those to look at too! We will definitely be going back and we look forward to visiting the Woodbine Opry that Mr. Marvin told us about. It was the perfect way for us to unwind! Bella (our dog) enjoyed her self as well! Thanks for having us and for sharing your beautiful farm with us!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at Old Parrot Place and definitely not our last! We love the homey, peaceful feel of the cabin and the property. Mary and Marvin set the bar for all other hosts - they have thought of everything you may need or want for a quiet escape with beautiful surroundings. Thoughtful touches and details abound all the way down to the fresh flowers placed in the bathroom! This time we were blessed enough to get to meet Susie and Cooper, the sweet puppies on property. Sitting on the little porch with a cold drink and a good book is an unbeatable experience and we can’t wait to come do it again soon!!!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Not only is this Airbnb just a unique delight, the hosts make this experience extra special. I had my two small children with me, that they welcomed with open arms. We felt like family right from the start. Between the Zipline, ninja warrior course that they set up along the trees, the horses, the donkey, all the chickens. We felt as if we could’ve stayed there and then content for a week. It was an extreme pleasure getting to meet Mary and Marvin. I can’t wait to sit down and have breakfast again with them one morning. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for an unforgettable experience."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin is a little piece of history. A fun little time warp with everything you need!
Everything was neat and tidy. Lots to look at but not cluttered.
We popped in for a long travel day pit stop. We didn’t get to meet Mary but made us feel more than welcome with communication through texts.
I took many photos of the pine trees next to palms. Amazing energy in this landscape. Can’t wait to draw and paint from this stay! katykstudio"

Adding this spot to my vacation rotation."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an awesome experience at this Airbnb. Mary and Marvin were absolutely awesome! We loved the room and the surroundings. It was so peaceful and absolutely beautiful where we were. Mary was even kind enough to give us fresh chicken eggs for breakfast. They have a beautiful kitchen that you can use to cook whatever you would like while you’re on property. It’s about 20 minutes off the interstate and it is well worth the drive. It was about 30 minutes from the beach. Mary had an awesome book to let us know different restaurants that were available in the area. My husband and I cannot wait to book another visit to the area with Mary and Marvin. Next time we will stay definitely more than one night, we hated to leave. Thank you so much for being such a gracious host!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stay! Marvin and Mary made me feel very welcome and shared wonderful tips for my trip to Okefenokee. They were gracious enough to offer fresh eggs and let me explore their beautiful property. I loved meeting their sweet dogs that made me feel right at home

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is a true gem, and a great deal for the price. I stayed here with my two dogs for just one night, but I would love to come back and enjoy a longer stay sometime in the future.
It's a cozy, rustic spot that's great for just one or two people, but it has a large and comfy bed, and a surprisingly spacious bathroom as well. It sits on a 25-ish acre rural property with plenty of walking trails and woodsy sights to explore.
Guests at this cabin have access to a separate building called ""the cookhouse,"" which has a full kitchen and dining room and is filled with interesting antiques.
Mary and her husband Marvin were incredibly warm and gracious hosts — they were nearby to greet me when I arrived, and checked on me a couple more times during my stay (but not in a way that felt intrusive).
There were so many details that made this Airbnb feel special, from thoughtful touches inside the cabin to the friendliness of the hosts. It felt like a home away from home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was perfect!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this cozy, peaceful cabin. it is in a fairly remote location so we took some food with us. Mary and Marvin are perfect hosts who provided us with everything we needed, even farm fresh eggs for breakfast!! The bed is extremely comfortable and, though small, the cabin had everything we needed for a great evening. We sipped our wine while rocking on the porch and listening to the birds. This is perfect a perfect place to relax!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are many reasons why I have returned to The Old Parrott Place 5 times in the past 15 months, and one of them is Mary! I truly consider the area my second home now, and it wouldn't feel quite the same without the care and attention that Mary, and Marvin, provide."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great place. Such charm. So friendly and helpful. ♥️
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"On a star scale of 1-5, staying with Mary and Marvin is a solid 10. Old Parrott Place is a charming, funky, delightful “estate”. The hosts provided fresh eggs from the resident chickens - and you might be visited by those chickens as you feast in the dining room looking out through the squeaky screen door of the Cookhouse. Numerous and varied antiques and collectibles provide a peek into the past of Southern Georgia life. Book with Mary and Marvin to give your eyes a feast and your brain a rest."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin have an amazing place. The cabin they have is absolutely beautiful and immaculate. It is decorated perfectly.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin were excellent hosts!! They were very friendly, knowledgeable about the area and offered excellent suggestions for places to see and things to do. The Old Parrot Cabin was a diamond in the rough! The cabin and kitchen had everything you could possibly want or need, and then some!! Fresh eggs from their own chickens no less!! Suzy and Copper, their super friendly dogs came to meet us when we arrived and greeted us every morning and evening. It is quite evident that our hosts spend a lot of time creating and furnishing our cabin as well
As the two story cabin, for 3+ guests. Melvin built most of both cabins himself! A very skilled craftsman and Mary was a wealth of knowledge regarding the Flora and Fauna on their property. If you are looking for a rustic and quiet retreat, this is it!! As a bonus, only a short drive to The Golden Isles, St. Simonds, Jekyll and Sea Island!!!
Highly recommended!!"

We chatted by the fire under the stars, listened to Louis Armstrong while we read some of the books, and visited the chickens and horses on site. If you're looking for a truly unique Airbnb experience off the beaten path, this is it!
Marvin was so friendly and even got out the karaoke machine for us! We will definitely be back!"

We will always return to this gem."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love that place, and I love Mary and Marvin. Nothing else to tell 😁"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rustic and quaint small cabin offers a wonderful bit of tranquility--a lovely respite from an often crazy world. I could just sit in a rocking chair on the porch for hours, with a small ""break"" to feed the horses apples. As a long-time travel writer, I have plenty of stays in ultra-luxurious accommodations. This was a nice change, and yet I lacked for nothing. There were small items of convenience thoughtfully tucked in every corner. A very enjoyable stay."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time staying here and I absolutely love the place. If you are looking for somewhere to stay when going to Jekyll Island this is the place. Bring a book and relax in the rocking chairs. It's a good spot to unplug and relax. Highly recommend staying here.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great country, shabby chic setting among a lttile enclave of homes nestled in the woods.
Kitchen facilities available steps away in the ""cookhouse."""
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute historical cabin. Definitely a great deal too. The stars look beautiful at night and the bed is so comfy. Mary is super helpful and responsive. I hope to come back one day.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Magical . You are staying in the enchanted forest . Yes , rustic , but still comfortable. I didn’t use the “ cookhouse “ but Mary gave me a tour and I thought it would be such a fun experience to cook there . In the morning before I left I visited with the horses and chickens. ❤️ . Lots of thoughtful little touches. Tea and honey, oatmeal, DVDs! Just simply fun ."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the perfect stop on a solo drive to Florida with my dog. Friendly hosts introduced me to the animals and showed me the great spots on the lake. Giant antique bath tub with candles for a relaxing soak. My dog was truly welcome and got along great with the resident pups. This is my new go to when I need a break from a stressful world or a long drive.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's always a fairy tale at Mary and Marvin's place. This is a place I love revisiting with my family. We book both of her Airbnbs when we go and we always enjoy ourselves, and are never really ready to leave. This place is like going in a time machine back to simpler times when you could sit on a porch without any technology and just enjoy nature or make your own music. Being here is like a type of therapy for me, and I love it"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Old Parrot Cabin was absolutely amazing!! It was so charming, had all of the amenities, plus more! Mary and Marvin are the sweetest couple - they gave us a tour of the other house, they gave us fresh eggs, and Mary and I bonded over plants in her greenhouse :) The pups and horses were so sweet as well. We will for sure be back!!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love this tiny and quirky cabin in the woods. Mary and Marvin are wonderful hosts and always make me feel welcome. This trip, they gave me eggs fresh from the chickens! A great place to stay on my frequent north-south trips; off the beaten path and unique."

The cabin had a very comfortable king size bed, microwave, coffee pot and coffee, creamers, popcorn… wine glasses, mugs you honestly felt right at home! We traveled during the cool weather and she already had the heaters going for us in the room and the bathroom! The tub has a shower attachment and the water was hot! :-) the kitchen is a detached house but it included a table with chairs, pots and pans, spray oil and fresh eggs from her pets! We loved feeding the horses, donkey, chicken and playing with their sweet doggies. I would definitely recommend this home and plan on going back again! It gave us the outdoor cabin feeling with the rocking chairs and fire pits !! Ms Mary and Mr Marvin were incredible hosts!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary and Marvin’s cabin was perfect for us. We visited Okeefenokee Swamp one day and relaxed the next on rocking chairs on the porch. The cabin is a short drive to Jekyll Island and other sights….great location. Parking was easy. Bed was very comfortable….we slept well. Kitchen had everything and more than we needed. Any Mary and Marvin were extremely welcoming….so great to meet them. FYI…Larger groups would love to stay in the old Sears mail order house. We would stay again.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Friendly and welcoming!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the cabin and all the decorations inside and out. Both Marvin and Mary are so nice and approachable-- nice visits with them. The cabin has all you need and it's so cleverly constructed. We liked all the extras of books and instruments and just a general funk factor. The separate cookhouse is a great idea and we loved the outside fire ring-- sitting outside in a peaceful setting. Definitely coming back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Mary made us feel welcome and right at home. The grounds are lovely and the rescue animals are a nice touch :) We will definitely be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary and Marvin are very friendly and gracious hosts! They went above and beyond to make sure you had everything you needed to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. They provided much more than expected of hosts from proving firewood and even starting our evening outdoor fires to providing their golf cart for us to use to go exploring and a well equipped kitchen with every utensil know to man and even proving fresh eggs for our breakfast! They even provided the charcoal for the big grill they provided. They have 2 of the sweetest dogs although we are not pet owners we loved having their dogs visit especially the big dog “Cooper” he is awesome and you can’t keep from loving him? If you don’t like rustic forget this place but if you like nostalgic book now you won’t be disappointed? So many antique treasures to see and they let you roam around the farm and feed and pet the horses and feed the chickens etc. you will love it at least we did?

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommended A +++
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is one of the best places we've stayed.
Delightfully rustic but still with modern conveniences.
Mary and Marvin and the dogs were all exceptionally friendly and welcoming.
If it had been just a bit warmer, I would have tried the outdoor shower.
The property is fun to explore, including the short hike to the lake.
And the hens shared amazing fresh eggs with us.
Thank you for a delightful experience."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We are seasoned AirBnb travelers and the Cabin at Parrott Place is by far our absolute favorite stay. Mary and Marvin have created a rustic peaceful paradise loaded with charm and thoughtful touches. The hosts are incredibly kind and communicative and the cabin is super comfortable and immaculately clean. We will definitely return!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the most awesome places we have stayed and some of the nicest peeps we have met. Will take a trip just to stay there again. !! :)
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little cottage that was perfect for our needs! Super close to everything in town and the floor plan was great for three separate groups. We would stay here again without hesitation.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time at the octagon cottage! The park right down the street was awesome for the kids. We will definitely be returning
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family was very comfortable at the Octagon house. It definitely fulfilled our expectations. Our best advice is to embrace the train. My great granddaughter loved watching it go by from the bedroom window. We would stay again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming home with lots of open room! Easy to navigate (at night) if you wake…
Will request again when going to Jesup GA."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Octagon Cottage was clean, comfy, and well-stocked, just as described. Conveniently near downtown and close to Amtrak/railroad. Thank you for helping us have such a good experience in Jesup!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,excellent location. Very clean and very spacious. We will stay again..Amy was very easy to work with and a great host...
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was exactly as pictured. Amy is a super host would stay again
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was nice. Close to a RR crossing heard trains during my sleep hours.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to stay close to my work and very comfortable
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything and super clean. Downsides are the sulfur water and the train noise which makes it hard to sleep.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The family enjoyed the stay
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay . My family enjoyed it . We will definitely book again.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,This place is an overall great stay. Roomy interesting home. The octagon shape is neat and Amy is really friendly. It was close to Walmart and a couple of restaurants. Absolutely only complaint is the train.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Giving this all 5 stars except for one giving a 4 stars for pricing. I wouldn’t mind the price as much if the water system had a filter on it. Showering etc was extremely difficult to do due to the smell of the water. Thankfully I had water bottles to use for the Keurig otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to drink my coffee, brushing our teeth wasn’t great either due to smell and taste of water. The whole place would have a bad smell to it after showering or running the running for more than a minute. I would also add TV’s to the bedrooms as we would have liked to watch TV before going to bed. We did only sleep in the room with the two double beds due to the fact that those were the most comfortable beds. Other than that great house, clean, great location, safe and would stay again, but with love to see the water system better more than anything. Thank you for sharing your place."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! This was the second time I stayed at the Octagon and wasn't disappointed!
Too bad the trains runs frequently and is loud but that has nothing to do with Amy and doesn't deter me!
~Sherri B."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our happy place for several days. Clean, comfortable, and full of Peace. Thank you for making such a lovely space!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First time in Georgia and first Airbnb. Place was great, very clean and the decor was so nice! Amy was great and responsive. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was short but the house felt just like home. Convenient check in and close vicinity to shops and food. I would stay here again!
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time at the Octagon House! Our family was in town for a wedding, and the cottage was a nice upgrade from the local motels. It was clean and in a safe part of town, and we felt comfortable and had all we needed. Although clearly mentioned in the listing by Amy and other guests, the effect of being so close to the train tracks was surprising. I have always lived around train tracks and am used to noisy trains, but the volume of the train whistles and the frequency of the trains (the first night there were about 6 between 1:30am and 2:00am) made good sleep difficult. We came home a day early to avoid another night with the trains, but based on the reviews not everyone is as inconvenienced as we were.
Overall, this home is clean and affordable, and seems to be one the better options available in Jesup."
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice clean comfortable place to stay.
2022-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Amy’s place was very clean, conveniently located and fairly well-stocked. The noise from the nearby railroad tracks is disruptive to sleep."
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"BEWARE!! Train tracks are directly across the street in the front of the Octagon house and trains go by about every 2 hours all day and NIGHT blasting their horns the entire time! I know that the ad says close to amtrack but it's literally across the street and that doesn't do the amount of noise throughout the night justice or give fair warning to potential travelers. One bed is so noisy, you can't lift a finger without it squeaking. Another is so hard/firm it's like sleeping on the floor. Not to mention that one of the bathroom showers showerhead is so low that I, at 5'1"", struggled to get my head under water to wash shampoo out. Last thing was the typed/hand written rules left in the kitchen we had to follow that were not in the description.
All that aside and it was an incredibly unique house with neat nooks and crannies to explore and within walking distance to downtown."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and well kelp. The beds were comfortable and it felt like home. The host was very respectful and gave us space with gentle reminders that was texts on rear occasions, such as check out procedures. I enjoyed my stay at ""The Octagon House""."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was GREAT! I plan on booking every time I visit Jesup. Much better than those horrid hotels! Very clean!!!
The cottage provides plenty of space for your family. Only one television so tell the kids to bring their tablets😃"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay in Jesup Ga. nice clean and convent to downtown. Amy is a super host with the most.I will be interested in staying again

We enjoyed the Trains and how close we were to the Super Cute Downtown!!!
Thanks for a really nice stay to celebrate dear friends for their wedding shower!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at the octagon; from check-in to check-out everything was fabulous. It was clean, well furnished and smelled terrific!
Every little detail was thought of and taken care of, the lot and house was large enough to hold a family event, yet small enough to feel at home.
Will definitely stay again, the next time i'm in the area. You can't go wrong booking the octagon."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cool house. We didn’t mind the train. Just no oven. Everything else was great
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The octagon cottage was a wonderful place for our family to stay. The trains were definitely heard but we enjoyed them. Very unique property.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As described by the other guest. The snacks were there if we needed it. Very clean and safe! This is a great location. The photos just don’t even tell the whole picture. From the outside it looks like it might be small. Then when you go inside it’s big and inviting. The way the rooms are laid out is perfect even the 2 full beds in one room was larger then I expected! The train was no problem at all! Thank you Amy for having this beautiful location available!
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Octagon Cottage is a really neat place. If you like trains, you'll love this place. However, the trains aren't so great for sleeping because they run throughout the night and are blowing their horns as they roll through town."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amy was amazing. Answered me back within minutes most days never more than an hour.
The house was perfect for our family. Really cute remodeled and well stocked. The snacks were a plus after a long road trip. We will be reaching out again next year. Thank Amy!!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cottage is so unique and perfect! So close to the small town. Very clean and spacious. The basket of treats were perfect for our late night cravings. Provided plenty of towels and even supplied paper products to eat with, toiletries. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! And not to mention the host went above and beyond!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second property I stayed at with Amy. I hosted a dinner for my grandmothers 82 birthday and we had a blast. She is very responsive. Everything was clean and rooms are huge with two big bathrooms. Really enjoyed my stay here.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place really big inside, plenty of room! Clean and very nice!

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Octagon Cottage is so cute and a perfect spot to stay!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely loved the place. Beautiful cottage and thoughtful amenities. Definitely set the standard for how I expect AirBNB’s to be in the future.
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Unique open spacious house with lots of extras. Grandchildren loved the toy room. Plenty of room for everyone. The train does run all hours day and night and blows its whistle because of that it made it difficult for the adults to sleep. The children slept right through it. The house is located directly across the street from the train tracks. If the house was located elsewhere I’d rent it again but, because of its location to the train track I wouldn’t. If you’re a heavy sleeper you might be ok. Two of us even sleep with a cpap and had trouble sleeping because of the train whistles & noises."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We’ve stayed with Amy multiple times, and as always, she is a fantastic host! Communication is very prompt, and she’s always helpful if we had a question. The Octagon House is very neat and clean, and we loved the large open living space, as well as the easy one-block walk to downtown and the park for the kids just down the street. The kitchen is well stocked with anything we needed for cooking as well."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Unique place with more than what you’ll need. I had a great stay!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved the Cottage! Amy was super helpful and made sure we had a great stay! We will definitely consider staying there again in the future!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was perfect for our late family Christmas. we have not been together in over 2 years thanks to COVID. My 2yr old Great nephew loved watching and counting the trains. We hope it will be a regular place for family to come to town.
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amy’s house is very clean, comfortable and close to downtown Jesup. Amy is responsive and quickly resolved the issue with the TV remote. We have stayed in 2 of her houses and will be back."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed the stay, verry clean and comfortable. The snacks for us on arrival was a pleasant treat! Will be back. Oh, the trains come by often but we were ok with it. Added to the charm! (;"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious and clean. Great location, and close to food and shopping."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Octogan Cottage while in town for a family Christmas celebration! The house was conveniently located, spacious, comfortable and nicely decorated! My teens were grateful for the snacks (thank you, Amy 😊). It is important to note that the train tracks are very close, and trains travel through town during the night sounding their horns though the crossing areas; however, that wouldn't discourage me from staying there again. 🤗"
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very comfortable, well-furnished, location good. Amy was very responsive and we had everything we needed. We will likely rent again."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s place is a nice house, spacious and very well decorated. The kids got an awesome surprise when they found the toy room with toys for them to play with. It was in close proximity to my family’s home and conveniently located.
The house is right across the street from the railroad tracks so trains run daily if you’re a light sleeper. There is a playground within walking distance if you have little ones."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amy is amazing she responds that very quickly! Great place to stay decorated very well.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This octagon house is absolutely beautiful and amazingly comfortable and relaxing even with the trains coming and going

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place to stay, especially if you have a family!! Very nice and clean!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Group trip,You would be wasting your valuable time and money if you're in the Jesup area and not reside in the Octagon cottage (aka Jewel of Jesup).
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We like to find adventures with our grandkids while we visit them in Georgia and Amy's Octagon house was just that! From the unique finds in the corner rooms offering fun places for hide and seek, to the toy room, to the trains outside the window and the park a block away, we had a fantastic stay!! lots of lil touches to offer stylish, comfy surroundings."
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"super nice home. very clean. has special touches like snacks, toys, etc. however, is close to train tracks with trains passing all day & night."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It's a beautiful house, very well decorated. Toy's room with ample of toys and kids' books was really thoughtful.
If you are a very light sleeper, train noise might be a bit bothersome for you."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend! Very clean and unique! My family and I enjoyed the home. Will definitely be booking for our next visit.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the place! It was very clean and spacious and exceeded all of our expectations. The yard was a great size for the kids to run around in while we grilled out. 10/10 we definitely recommend.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a pleasant surprise to have a house like that right in the middle of town! It was so nice and clean too! The amenities and special touches was wonderful! My grandkids loved the closet full of toys as well, very nice thought! A nice grill on the back deck for cooking out with our family was a nice add as well! Super stylish inside, very highly recommended! We will book every time we come down with our family again!! Thank you so much for being there!!❤"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This unique cottage is very welcoming, clean and comfortable. Snacks, waters, toys, books, WiFi and dish TV. Everything needed to immediately feel like we were right at home. You can take a nice little morning walk to get a cinnamon roll at Sugar and Spice but you need to get there early. Then take the children one block over to the playground or grill on the deck and play in the spacious yard. The frequency of the nighttime trains takes getting used to but the host and cottage itself couldn’t be any more inviting!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy's place is absolutely charming and a must see! The decor is amazing, the layout is unique, and the character of the home shines through. I wish our stay could've lasted longer. Plenty of space for families of all sizes. The kids absolutely loved playing hide-n-seek! It is locate beside of an active train track that runs mostly at night... though we loved that part of the experience too! Not everyone can open their front door and see a train go by!"
2020-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious home, attentive host, pictures are accurate, train is loud so bring ear plugs, we had some cold nights there so you may want to have a conversation about heat with the host."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amy’s Place was amazing. It was super clean, close to everything and the snacks were a great bonus (my boys loved them). We will definitely be back! The house is close to the railroad so I would suggest earplugs if you are a light sleeper (which thanks to another review I had packed). You will not be disappointed with this place."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Octagon House worked beautifully for our family group of 8! The whole house was nice and spacious. Our children were delighted to find a closet of toys available for their use and the snacks and water were very considerate touches Amy had placed there for us! It was very clean and tastefully decorated. We felt right at home there and we will definitely stay here again, if possible, if we ever find ourselves in the area again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed staying at the Octagon House. We loved the open living space and the large bedrooms. It’s great for a family. The kitchen was well stocked. Such a nice atmosphere. And it’s close to everything. I definitely recommend the quick walk to the bakery next to the train station. Just get there early or order ahead!! We will book again when we visit Jesup again.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very nice place to stay. Very definitely recommended!

,,,"I paid for one night and ended up having an emergency and had to cancel, I canceled well before my check-in and was told she would not give me my money back.
