Plenty of towels, general toiletries, kitchen appliances for cooking and eating. Easy to get to campus and casino from location. Instructions for home were clear. Neighborhood was quiet, but home location is in older neighborhood adjacent to low income area so many people walking around and cars parked in the front yard of many homes. Home has a garage so you can park car in a secure location which was is good. 3 Large TV‚Äôs in the home, TV package provided in home could not get local channels so we couldn‚Äôt watch local news, couldn‚Äôt watch Sunday night football and could only watch items streamed from any services we already had accounts to like Netflix or Prime. No problem with streaming from our accounts, just wanted the ability to watch standard ABC, NBC, CBS, etc. content when gathered with family as there was no streaming option for those."

2022-02-01,4.0,Group trip,The house was as explained !!! But we were accused of smoking in the house and trying to charge a extra $300 for carpet cleaning and smoking when I KNOW NEITHER WAS DONE!! I book HOMES ON A REGULAR NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN ! And I feel like they are out of extra funding ! Also they stated we smoked in the home. But was told that everything in the home we could use so I‚Äôm guessing firing up the fireplace & having the closed chimney smoking because it doesn‚Äôt open was considered smoking in the house ! I don‚Äôt like to be scammed and I know a scam when I see it ! Selfish enough to lie like we smoked in the house knowing you saw the burnt wood in the fire place ! And the surrounding neighborhood is the GHETTO

We had everything that we needed from kitchen and toilet essentials to fun card/board games for entertainment. We spent some fun times eating and playing card games and scrabble at the cozy kitchen nook. We slept good on fresh linens and comfortable beds. The outside of the house was very well kept. There was an outside seating great for bbq-ing while listening to the relaxing sound of the little pond beside it. The cottage was very well thought out and fits perfect for families visiting the town. The location of the cottage is easy to find and close to everything. There are restaurants (fast food/local resto/starbucks) and grocery stores (whole foods/trader joes/albertsons) within minutes. The host, Ms. Brenda is one of the kindest. She is quick to respond to any questions and willing to go above and beyond. We left some personal items at the cottage and without hesitations, she mailed it to us the next day. She is awesome! My family and I would definitely recommend this cottage. 10 stars out 5."

And the highlight: a separate small cottage with washing machine, dryer, a work area and a play corner for children."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was everything we could expect and then some. It was very clean and welcoming with all the modern amenities. The hostess, Brenda, was very responsive to every question we had and made us feel very welcome. Many small touches like a jar full of biscottis, a drawer filled with Kuerig k-cups and many other little, thoughtful things made us feel at home. We also used the outdoor grill (which was very clean) for a great evening of food and fun. The outhouse where the laundry is located is a nice, cozy addition to the main house. The neighborhood was fantastic- residential, quiet and safe and yet with easy access to main roads to anywhere in the city. I highly recommend this place and would rent again if I went back to Baton Rouge."

Great for all ages with the room off the patio with a doll house for kids that they will absolutely love hanging out in, to the lovely remodeled kitchen, to the comfortable beds and bedrooms. And the big back yard is perfect to play a game in or have the kids run around in.
Brenda went well out of her way to make our stay a very fun and satisfying one. She was nice enough to leave us a cooler as we had our son graduating from LSU and had a cookout the night before. She even hung a LSU flag for the occasion! Very nice touch! Geaux Tigers!
The house is well appointed with games, many cooking pots, pans, utensils, scissors tape, you name it - just about anything you would ever need. Never have we been so comfortable in a house that was not ours, although it sure felt so homey and comfortable. Truly, a home away from home! Coming all the way from Colorado, it was so pleasant and is the perfect location for everything Baton Rouge. We hope we can come back for a game in the future. We certainly will check with Brenda to see if her cottage is available!
To close, Brenda was so understanding when I booked - well over a year ago. Our older son was set to graduate in 2020 until the pandemic hit and canceled his graduation. I had booked a place for his graduation and it was painful to try and get a refund! Brenda was so understanding about my hesitancy and made me feel so secure with the process. After communicating with her, I had absolutely no hesitation booking. And cannot wait to book again.
Take care Brenda! John and Carrie

2020-02-01,5.0,Group trip,This was my family and my second time staying at Brenda's cottage and the second stay was as lovely as the first! The house is the perfect size for the five of us. It is cute and cozy with a beautiful kitchen. There is an exterior room with laundry and a patio outside. Brenda is very helpful and responsive to all communication. One feature I really appreciated was the option to use the alarm system. I was once broken into at a different AirBnb in another town and so the alarm makes me feel nice and secure.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A comfortable cottage on a quiet residential street lined with 73 year old live oaks. The area has a traditional southern feel.
We loved the redone kitchen and wanted to take it home after eight days.
The covered patio and water feature were great for enjoying pleasant weather.
A converted garage offered unexpected additional space.
Many good restaurants are nearby.
When we returned at the end of a day of sightseeing, the cottage felt like a second home."

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,CHARMING PLACE! GREAT LOCATION! CLEAN! WILL BE BACK:)
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Brenda was a dream host. She thought of everything - including going over and turning the lights on so we wouldn‚Äôt arrive to a dark house when we got in late. She was helpful with recommendations and made the check in process a breeze. The place was sparkling clean and just perfect for a weekend trip to an LSU football game.

Outside you pull in to find a beautiful lawn, lovely little patio, relaxing fish pond and perfect flowers in the flower box. Super easy access with the lock box. Walk in and feel wowed by the sparkling clean, full-of-character-and-charm space. Every room is so quaint, decorated ever so perfectly and very comfortable. We wanted for nothing, from coffee to extra pillows and enjoyed it all. This was my favorite AirBnb to date! Brenda clearly works very hard to make her space perfect for her guests down to every last detail. Highly recommend!"

We had coffee at Brew Ha Ha and Sunday Brunch at Superior Grill, which were both great! The house is ""oldish,"" small rooms, creaks, etc., but it was all updated and the kitchen was airy and upscale. The patio and pond are a nice touch, but we hit a very hot spell and the mosquitoes liked us a lot! I would absolutely stay here again."

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda is a wonderful host!! First time booking thru Airbnb and my expectations and experience was just amazing! She thinks of everything to go above and beyond and not make you think for a second you've left your home! We stayed for 4 days & 3 nights and was able to make breakfast lunch and dinner! Everything you need in a kitchen it's there! We even got to wash a load of laundry...she had plenty towels and even small dark towels to remove makeup! Theres plenty of room/space to share with guests...enough room for fellowship and food! We had an incident where we forgot house key inside home and when I reached out to her for help she immediately responded and saved the day! Again, shes an amazing host and may God Bless this special home!!!"

It was the perfect place for my family and friends to stay for my graduation from LSU. The location could not be better for all of the fun restaurants and little shops on Government st. and the house is an easy drive to downtown or LSU. If you‚Äôre coming to Baton Rouge and have the opportunity to stay here then you absolutely should!

Also, lots of things to make you feel you‚Äôre staying in a functional house such as, seasonings in the kitchen, coffee, well stocked supplies. next trip to Baton Rouge we will definitely be staying at Brenda‚Äôs place. We also had similar tastes in literature and music so looking forward to spending more time listening to the music."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brenda‚Äôs house was beautiful and decorated so well. We felt right at home from the moment we walked in. It was close to shopping areas and easy to find as well.

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome
2019-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Brenda‚Äôs house was fantastic. The location was convenient and we had everything we could need. Check in and check out were easy. The house was cozy but the perfect size for me, my husband, my sister and our parents. There is extra space outside and in what we called the ‚Äúshe shed‚Äù that makes the house feel bigger. The kitchen was great to cook in too! We hope to come back again. Thanks!"
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house! Very nice host helped us get some kids stuff we left behind back to us. Plan on staying again when we come back in the summer.

The kitchen was stocked with he necessary pots, pans and utensils for cooking. The recommendations for restaurants was a nice touch. We highly recommend Brenda's place if you are in Baton Rouge it is a lot better than a overpriced hotel."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is located in a quiet neighborhood and had such a cute and comfortable feel. It really felt like a charming home rather than just a rented house. You pull into a driveway for off street parking and walk through a gate to a lovely patio with outdoor table/chairs, a grill, and a swing! The entire house was very clean, well organized, and nicely decorated. This house is stocked with so many books....so maybe instead of packing your own, enjoy the selection while you visit. There is a dining nook with bench and chair seating able to accommodate quite a few people. The kitchen appears to be newly remodeled. One of the most impressive things about this place was the amount of cooking supplies. There were more than enough pots/pans/knives/plate/etc to make cooking a large meal easy. There are three bedrooms (two with queen beds and the third with two twins) all with very comfortable mattresses. One of the bedrooms has an attached bathroom and there is a second bathroom off the hallway. There were more than enough towels for everyone and bars of soap should you need it. Next to the house, off the patio is a charming little Free-standing studio room. There is a washer/dryer for guest use which was very helpful. This room also seems to be furnished for kids that may be traveling with you to have a separate space to play.
Overall, we were extremely impressed with the quality of this home, it‚Äôs amenities, and the comfortable feel. The host is very responsive to communication."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Brenda‚Äôs place numerous times and I cannot say enough good things about her home and her as a host!

We will definitely stay here again when in BR."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Truly a gem! When we travel as a family, I prefer to stay in a home where we can have meals together without rushing. This is the perfect location in a quiet neighborhood to relax and recharge. Such a sweet cottage with a warm and welcoming vibe the moment you pull in the driveway. Thank you, Brenda, for the perfect accommodations!"
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home has exceeded our expectations on every level. Our extended family joined us. As we prepared for Thanksgiving and we loved every ‚Äúextra‚Äù in her house from preparing in the gourmet spotless kitchen to game night at the breakfast nook. Brenda even offered to bring us extra towels to make sure we were comfortable.
I would (and have) recommended this vacation home over and over. We can‚Äôt wait for our next trip to Brenda‚Äôs as we visit family in Baton Rouge!"

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Look no further!!! My husband and another couple came to stay here for a weekend and to go to an LSU game. The house is immaculate, super cozy, and gorgeous. We enjoyed that the kitchen is open to the living room and breakfast table so that we can all visit while cooking, watching tv, or sitting at the table. The house is stocked with cook ware, cable, coffee maker, cards, games, and even a grill outside. It was truly a home away from home. The kitchen and bathrooms are redone and very clean with beautiful finishings. Checkin and check out was a breeze. We will stay again and will suggest it to everyone we know that stays in Baton Rouge. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book!!"
2018-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Brenda is the Ultimate host and I highly recommending her quite little cottage. It felt like more of a home away from home then a Airbnb. It‚Äôs on a quiet street but in a easily accessible location.

2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Brenda was very responsive from the moment she accepted my request. House exceeded my expectations. Interior and exterior were beautiful and very well taken care of. My family of 5 people stayed there very comfortably. Brenda was so kind in leaving nearby food recomendations and offering a great dvd collection of movies! The house really had a lot of charm to it and was decorated beautifully. I highly recommend staying there if in the BR area. Price was very reasonable also!
2018-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Home was comfortable, perfect space for 6 people. Brenda let me check in early at no charge and was very quick to respond to me when I asked questions. The only 2 things I will say is we saw a few bugs, and there is only one tv and it is in the sitting room. Even with those things if I am in Baton Rouge I will stay again."

2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"A beautiful, clean, and comfy home that's great for families and small groups that has everything you would ever need in a vacation home from a wine opener to information on nuances specific to the home. I normally have an ""Airbnb bag"" so I won't make store runs while traveling, but I didn't even use it this time. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay here. It was a great place for memorable weekend as we celebrated our 10 year class reunion!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was easy to locate, extremely clean, and felt safe. I will definitely stay here again if we visit Baton Rouge."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Danielle was amazing from the start. Me and my two college classmates came to BR for a convention and she accommodated us well. When we told danielle that we were college students looking for some affordable she didn‚Äôt hesitate to help. The area is great and we never felt unsafe. Close too many places and was very nice to have a grocery store right downstairs. The place was also very clean and had all the extra things you would forget like paper towels ice and even laundry soap. Danielle even messaged back when i would reach out super nice! I would recommend this place to anyone.

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Danielle‚Äôs place was perfect for me and my 3 year old daughter. I appreciated the minimal decor; very clean and open space. The beds were comfy and amenities were perfect. Check in instructions were very easy. We really felt like we were at home.
The only downside (and this has nothing to do with Danielle) was the downstairs grocery store. I purchased some bread which I learned was expired past its shelf date as well as a frozen kid‚Äôs dinner which also was well expired beyond its date. Luckily the clerks let me switch out the frozen dinner for another bag of chicken nuggets. So my advice is if you‚Äôre going to purchase something from the market, look at the dates on the food. Other than that, the hosts were very responsive and helpful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I felt right at home and we did not want to leave! The space was clean and Gorgeous, it was really secure and safe, and the hist, Danielle, was very helpful and responsive."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow where to start!? Me, my husband and brother in law had never been to Baton Rouge & went to celebrate mardi gras with family and needed somewhere to stay. When we arrived we immediately fell in love with the home. It is so perfectly decorated & peaceful, with everything one would need on vacation. Coffee, huge soaking bathtub with epsom salt for relaxing baths, air purifier, I mean you name it, she had it. She was also wonderful to converse with & never seemed annoyed if we needed anything. If we ever go back to Baton Rouge we will only book this home again. This was possibly the best vacation we‚Äôd ever took! I even left a book that I bought in town at 2nd & Charles & she offered to mail it to me! Don‚Äôt have enough characters to describe how wonderful the entire experience was<3"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Kasey‚Äôs place and will definitely return. Everything was excellent. This was the first time a member of our group had ever stayed at an Airbnb place. He was amazed and was already looking at houses in other parts of the country to visit. Great first experience.
We also appreciated how many thoughtful touches there were‚Äî a stroller, snacks, toys for our 2-year-old son.
Thanks, Kasey!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb was a dream. From the incredibly well considered decor to all of the special personal touches, it exceeded all expectations. This place looks absolutely adorable in the pictures, but in reality it‚Äôs more charming, warm and inviting than pictures can convey. The area is also safe with plenty to walk to in terms of restaurants, coffee shops etc. We loved the restaurant across the street! I cannot recommend Kasey‚Äôs place highly enough! WE ADORED STAYING THERE!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kasey was a gracious host for my weekend away from home. It is an adorable home in an excellent location. I am from Baton Rouge and would highly recommend it.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved Kasey‚Äôs home! Warm, cozy and tasteful, we were just sad we couldn‚Äôt stay longer. The bathtub was the most gorgeous I‚Äôve seen in any Airbnb!!
We were traveling during a severe weather advisory and Kasey was so responsive and accommodating to our check-in needs. We will definitely be back to enjoy more of the neighborhood which seemed quiet and peaceful and just a few minutes drive to the downtown :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Kasey's space was well-appointed, beautifully decorated, and centrally located to all of the little gems BR has to offer. In addition to the comfy and cozy space, Kasey's communication was impeccable. She was kind, considerate and the ultimate host. I will most definitely attempt to lodge here again the next time I visit the area. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Kasey!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place for our young family. Very charming house! Would stay here again
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kasey‚Äôs place was perfect for our pit stop on a long road trip. The space is beautiful and unique. The house is across the street from a breakfast spot and coffee shop which was great for getting moving in the morning. We loved this spot and would gladly stay again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is my favorite place to stay in Baton Rouge. I've booked it whenever I could while my child attended LSU. This cottage is comfy and feels like home. The owners have furnished it with cozy items without cluttering the space, as the pictures show. It's their special touches that really set this AirBnB apart -- like the Christmas decorations this month. They added a wreath on the door, plus a red throw and pillow on the porch chairs, and a mini christmas tree on the porch table. The living room mantle was decked in evergreen. A lighted Christmas tree lent a festive feel. In my arrival email, I happened to mention we were coming for LSU graduation ceremonies. There was an LSU balloon on the dining table and a congratulatory bottle of Prosecco in the refrigerator. Classy folk.
Cross the street to Zeeland St. Market for homemade breakfast, lunch and dinner. My favorite is the pecan smoked brisket or one of their unique salads. Dinner is elevated soul food!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Let me begin with WHAT AN INCREDIBLE HOST!!! Kasey was extremely friendly and responsive. The home is the absolute cutest place I‚Äôve ever stayed at!! So happy I chose this Airbnb!! The neighborhood is also extremely precious and the rental bikes are right there across the road! Such a great experience and will definitely be booking this Airbnb again!!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Kasey is an excellent host and the cottage is an exceptional value. I enjoyed the older neighborhood with its interesting mix of housing. The house is thoughtfully equipped - not fancy but comfortably. If you are a noise-sensitive person this house is close enough to Perkins and also (less close) to Interstate 10 that there is a moderate level of traffic noise. I enjoyed my stay at Kasey's and so did my dogs.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Kasey was friendly! Very responsive! excellent space.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second time to stay here and it will be our go to every time we come back!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is the most prettily decorated AirBnB I have stayed in! Partly because it was all very tasteful but did not feel generic. I don't know Baton Rouge well but we seemed close enough to everything by car.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wow!! We had a fabulous time staying at Kasey‚Äôs home. I can‚Äôt say enough how much we enjoyed it. It was the perfect location for our little family. Our 3 year old and 18 month old kids were so comfortable there - we used the crib that was provided and they got such a big kick out of the cool toys and books available for them. The home itself is beautiful and peaceful with unique style and furnishings. The location was perfect for accessing great restaurants and coffee nearby. Of course when you travel with small kids you have to be ready to change gears and eat takeout at home instead of out at the restaurant - depending on the circumstances. The kitchen was well outfitted with all that we needed for an enjoyable takeout dinner at home from Chow Yum. We all left feeling happy and refreshed. Thanks again for the lovely stay, Kasey!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here!! The house was so cute and cozy. It was close to campus & close to restaurants and shopping.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We traveled to Baton Rouge for the gymnastics camp at LSU - after our hotel was a complete disaster, Kasey gave us a warm welcome and a LOVELY place to stay! The house was very clean, comfortable, and absolutely adorable! My daughter even commented that this is exactly how she wants her house to look when she‚Äôs grown up - teenager approval is worth everything!! Kasey was incredibly helpful and very responsive to messages. There were very charming local places to eat within walking distance, with the loveliest people! Highly recommend breakfast right across the street! Even more local spots were just a short drive down the street. We felt like part of the neighborhood family for the few days we were there. It was also a very easy drive to LSU‚Äôs campus each day for camp. We will definitely be staying here again when my daughter goes to camp again next year."

The house was extremely clean and well decorated with lots of beautiful natural light. It felt airy and homey. Lots of great amenities (including a wonderful large bathtub) and a well-stocked kitchen that made cooking a pleasure. The house is well-situated in the neighborhood. My husband was particularly excited about being a very short walk from his favorite Baton Rouge coffee shop.
We came to visit my mother-in-law for Mother's Day and the hosts were very kind and accommodating to our needs. Nice outdoor areas as well. All in all, can't say enough good things about this place. We had a lovely stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,All I can say is I‚Äôm obsessed with this property. I am very particular about the esthetic of the places I stay and this one knocked it out of the park. It is perfectly appointed and feels like home. I can not recommend this property more. You will not be disappointed. Already sent the link it to my sister who‚Äôs son goes to LSU.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome house, the hosts were very communicative, and even left some treats for our arrival. Would 100% stay here again if I'm ever in the area.

Anne Marie provides a fully stocked kitchen, extra upon extra towels, wash cloths, shampoo, conditioner‚Ä¶everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. The home is in an older neighborhood, but directly across the street is The Zeeland Street Caf√©- a nice little restaurant that serves a healthy sized breakfast and lunch & some very good service. You can sit outside or inside. I don‚Äôt think they are open on Sundays, though.
The home is very clean, beds are comfortable, the air conditioner works very well, and the bathroom is a little dreamy. The shower is spectacular! Ann Marie has added some of the cutest decor to this home- it‚Äôs a little boho and a little contemporary mixed in with some Louisiana flare. We were visiting my daughter who attends LSU & this was the perfect spot for us to get to and from campus easily. Geaux Tigers!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick stay so didn‚Äôt have much time to explore. House was great, nicely furnished and very comfortable. Picked up Zealands for breakfast across the street and it was great. Lovely neighborhood and very convenient for our LSU campus tour."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay. Besides the terrific location and lovely accommodations, my favorite part was morning coffee on the front porch. The neighbors were a delight to meet. We had everything we needed and would book this property again."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend this cute little house! It was perfect for our family with two little ones 5 and 1.5.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anne Marie‚Äôs house was a GREAT place to stay. The home was spotless, and the bed was very comfortable. I felt safe there. Some other features that make the home a standout are these: the front porch with comfortable chairs and fragrant, trellised star jasmine, the soaking tub, the gas stove, and the artfully decorated rooms. The location is great with lots of good restaurants, grocery stores, and a park nearby. The checkout list was simple and straightforward. And lastly, Anne is a communicative, kind, thoughtful, and accommodating host! I greatly appreciate the opportunity to stay there!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Anne Marie's house was perfect! She was extremely responsive and easy to work with for any questions we had. The house is in the perfect location for Baton Rouge and is very safe. Large open backyard that our kids enjoyed running around. I'm sure this was stated somewhere in the description but the bathroom is in between the two bedrooms, but it is very spacious and clean. She also provided extra towels and toilet paper. Everything we needed was available! I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you have little kids. It was wonderful!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is really nice, fully equipped kitchen, nice beds and beautiful place."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Location. Be prepared for great place.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the BEST place to stay in Baton Rouge! We remarked multiple times while staying here how this house is the perfect vacation house. The house is updated and beautiful! The house is in the perfect location in Baton Rouge, close to LSU‚Äôs campus and right on the university bus line.
The restaurant across the street has amazing breakfast and the coffee shop around the corner has great coffee. We loved everything about this place and would most definitely stay here again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ann Marie was an excellent host and her place was perfect: cosy, well equipped with lots of small details that make all the difference, and in a great spot of town.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Anne Marie's home was perfect. It was stylish, clean, unique, and comfortable. I loved that there were kid's toys and a crib. We were only there one night, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. The cafe across the street was a nice spot for breakfast and we met the owner while taking a walk - she lives down the street! The neighborhood had a friendly vibe. I would certainly stay here again if we're back in Baton Rouge and I wholeheartedly recommended it to others."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fresh, eclectic, and well ordered space in the beautiful Garden District of Baton Rogue. Just a short walk from City Park Golf Course and Lake, in a peaceful and secure neighborhood.
Large backyard and cozy front porch added to the comfort of this gem!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My daughter and I had a absolutely amazing time in Baton Rogue. This home was a huge reason why: The location was perfect for all our activities and events and the amenities offered exceed our expectations. The owner was very responsive and resourceful and we'd definitely encourage others to book here.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and well stocked home. Super comfortable and had a large relaxing tub. AC & Heat both worked great. Front porch was perfect for your morning coffee.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house is absolutely adorable. We had such a nice time! And it‚Äôs a great location. wonderful coffee shop across the street and a great brunch/food place as well
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Anne‚Äôs place was wonderful. The location couldn‚Äôt be more perfect. It had a lot of charm and was very beautifully updated for being an older house. It‚Äôs very close to the neighbors and in the morning when the restaurant next door was opened we almost could not get out of the driveway because of people parking in the yard/on the road but that‚Äôs not something she could help. Overall you really can‚Äôt beat the value for what we paid.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Anne Marie‚Äôs home is so cute and in a pretty little neighborhood!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming, unique home, close to campus! Everything was beautiful and comfortable and the home was extremely clean!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 spent a long weekend here visiting family who live nearby, and I cannot say enough good things about this charming and comfortable home. It it beautifully restored and feels more spacious than one might expect from the exterior. Annemarie has thoughtfully furnished the house in such a way that it makes you feel at home immediately. The kitchen was well stocked and the beds were very comfortable. Though we didn‚Äôt need them ourselves I appreciated that there was a crib, umbrella stroller, and some toddler books and toys available. It is in a great location - walkable to a coffee shop, restaurants and parks. We will definitely be returning."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Baton Rouge! Anne Marie was a great host, the place was extremely clean, and the feel of the house is exactly like the pictures look - a bungalow-style house updated with modern furnishings and appliances! There's a good breakfast place about 100 feet from the front door, and a good coffee shop about 100 feet in a different direction.
Definitely recommend!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Definitely will be coming back. Awesome location
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful time and everything was perfectly thought out! Anne Marie was excellent at responding and was kind enough to offer some grace on our initial rental dates due to some unexpected snowy weather in Dallas! We will definitely be staying again!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cutest little place, really great location, and super nice host. This place was definitely our favorite place we stayed on our trip."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anne Marie's place was exceptionally well appointed, tastefully decorated, convenient, quiet and accurately represented the listing/pics. As a host, I couldn't ask for better. Anne Marie was proactive in her communications and always responded promptly. Check in instructions were provided well in advance and very crystal clear. This was a perfect place for a family of 4 to while visiting family in the area. It was a home away from home. I highly recommend both the property and Anne Marie as a host!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anne Marie's cottage was absolutely perfect. The location is accessible to lots of great restaurants and coffee shops, and not far from the freeway. It is very stylishly decorated and comfortable. In my opinion and from what I have seen, it's one of the best Airbnbs in Baton Rouge for a party of 2-4. I haven't seen anything better and that's why I booked it--and I wasn't disappointed. Anne Marie is also a good communicator and check-in was a breeze. I definitely recommend and will use this cottage again next time I am in town!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a wonderful home in a great location in Baton Rouge. Anne Marie is gifted at anticipating every need you may have. You will not be disappointed.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of my favorite stays, to date! Loved the design of the home - so cute, Anne Marie was very attentive, and the location was quiet but also centrally located. Thanks!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful home! Nicely decorated, comfortable, child-friendly. Cute street and close to restaurants, grocery and convenience stores. The bathroom feels like a spa!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place! Conveniently located, thoughtfully decorated, immaculately clean, and all around stylish. We‚Äôll be back!"

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"One of the most intentional and thoughtful places I‚Äôve ever stayed. Super cool layout and so many neat useful things for kids and adults. Host was a wonderful communicator and quick to respond. This is a great location in the historical garden district. Much to do in walking distance.
This is all before you consider the reasonable rate. By far the best value in town."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely home!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I hate to share the awesomeness of this place so that I can keep it all to myself! Location, charm, character, Most amazing host. Loaded kitchen. Deep soaker tub. Sincerely cannot say enough wonderful things."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay and will without question look to stay here again the next time we‚Äôre in town! The home is just as charming as the photos show and it‚Äôs thoughtfully decorated with places for all your things, toys for little ones and everything you could need. The beds are super comfy, the home is so charming and Anne Marie is a great host! Can‚Äôt wait to stay again!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Well stocked. Great location. Great style. Consider bringing a sleep mask as very bright in the morning. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"BLUF: This is the best AirB&B location you will ever rent.
The house itself is so beautiful and has a wonderfully calming aesthetic. You will feel welcome and comfortable as soon as you walk through the door. On top of that, the whole home is very thoughtful in what it provides and where it is placed. I was impressed by the inclusion of a First Aid Kit in the kids' room, for example. The pictures posted are 100% accurate all the way down to the sheets on the bed and where the couch pillows are placed. This is a dream house.
Also, the house is perfectly located for having an authentic LSU-Baton Rouge experience. I earned both my Bachelor's and Law Degrees from LSU and was in town for an Alumni Tailgate event. So, I was already familiar with great places to get food and drink. This house is right across the street from Zeeland Cafe which is a great place to have a home-style breakfast or lunch, and is within walking distance of Garden District Coffee. Also, there are great restaurants and bars just over the Perkins overpass literally no more than three minutes away. It is also a five minute drive to campus, or cheap ride if you don't like to drive and park around campus like me. You are also close to Government Street that also has a lot of great restaurants and bars (like the new beer garden).
The cute little black kitten running around was also a nice bonus but not a part of the house.
Overall, it was an amazing experience. As soon as LSU puts out its 2022 football schedule I will immediately book this location again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little place. Perfect location. Nice neighborhood.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place and I am a repeat customer! A cozy bungalow with tons of great food in walking distance.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is best spot! We were in town for a kid‚Äôs soccer tournament. Great location to get to fields, visit LSU, yummy restaurants & city park. We are a family of 5 and we didn‚Äôt feel cramped here. Kids loved all the cool - modern decor, toys and cozy blankets. I personally loved the large tub & great smelling soaps. Every need in the kitchen was available. Definitely will stay here again if ever in the area!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A cozy well maintained home in a convenient location.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Host provided everything you could possibly need.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anne Marie was a terrific host all-around. Although we did not have the chance to meet her, she was accommodating before, during, and after our trip. The check-in process was seamless, and she helped with catering suggestions, delivered a food cooler to the house when we asked for help providing food to an outdoor event, and was incredibly quick to respond to all our communication. The house is adorable, with beautiful artwork throughout the home. It is full of many thoughtful niceties such as laundry soap, coffee, and extra towels. We utilized the appliances (stove, fridge, washer/dryer), and all were clean and new. We found the location in a nice neighborhood and very close to a restaurant hub that kept us off the busy freeways at night. We didn't use the backyard, but it is enormous and has a nice outdoor seating area. The grandparents decided to join us last minute, and Anne Marie had no problem with that. There was also off-street parking for two cars. If we ever travel to Baton Rouge again, we will try to stay at Anne Marie's house."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Precious little house! It was super clean in a great location. We would love to return one day! Reservation and check in process was easy and seamless. Thanks for a great stay!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful house, located in the garden district. From this location my friends and I were within walking distance of great restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores. We were even able to make the hike to LSU to catch a game (this was a couple miles though). I give this place my strongest recommendation."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing time! The house is gorgeous, very clean, and cozy! Anne Marie is super helpful, and fast responding. There is the cutest breakfast place across the street I suggest everyone to try! Definitely will book with Anne Marie again! It‚Äôs a must book place!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is three houses away from a busy street but it still is quiet inside. Shopping centers and restaurants are very close. Annie Marie has creatively decorated each room along with providing ample supplies: i.e. dishes, silverware, glasses, towels etc. The floors are beautifully restored in this over one hundred year old house. Due to its age the floors slope to the point that older people can trip over the transitions into other rooms (you must step down or up slightly). Overall, we would recommend Annie Marie's home to anyone."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Let me start by saying this place is everything and more. Each and every detail was well thought out. Anne Marie forgot nothing. My only regret was not being able to stay longer. Pictures do not do this little gem justice. It‚Äôs the perfect place to relax and unwind. Location is great as well. We will definitely book here anytime we come to BR as long as it‚Äôs available.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this home and wish I could of stayed there longer! Serene and eco friendly atmosphere. Quiet street and felt very safe.

One of the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve had."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such an amazing Airbnb. I highly recommend if you are thinking about it. Everything about this house was amazing and it was so convenient. Wish we stayed longer than one night. They have done an amazing job decorating the place
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anne was extremely accommodating during very difficult times. We were traveling from Tampa to Texas during the time hurricane Ida hit Louisiana and we stopped for the night in Baton Rouge at Anne‚Äôs place which didn‚Äôt have any power due to the hurricane effects. She explained to me where all the flash lights were and talked me how to get inside because everything was in complete darkness. She went well out of her way to make sure we had a place to stop after driving 700+ miles and 13 hours straight.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location and wonderful host! Although we did not get to complete our stay this time due to Hurricane Ida, Anne Marie was incredibly accommodating and communicative throughout the process. We can't wait to get another visit on the calendar!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house is perfection. It's beautifully decorated, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Location is in a cute neighborhood convenient to LSU, restaurants, and downtown. Hope to stay here again on our next trip to Baton Rouge!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely a stunner of a house! Far exceeded pictures and expectations - just a perfect, cozy cottage with everything you need.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay at this adorable, clean and comfortable house in a neat part of Baton Rouge. After a long day of driving, my 2 kids was thrilled to find a bedroom of their own with simple kids toys and a spacious and pretty backyard to get their energy out. The house is so nicely decorated, beds are very comfortable and the kitchen was spotless, modern and well equipped with coffee, tea and everything we needed to cook a meal upon arrival. The tub/shower in the bathroom was also fantastic, very roomy, great pressure and super clean. Loved the design and all the little touches throughout the home. Anne Marie was also so easy to communicate with and quickly responsive. You can tell this home is well loved and taken care of. Wish we stayed longer!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is an excellent place, which I used for 4 months, and it‚Äôs located in a fantastic area. There is a Whole Foods and a number of restaurants nearby along with a movie theater and other shops in the area. It‚Äôs located on the top (3rd) floor but parking is a breeze on the third level of a parking garage, from which there is a short walkway that allows easy access to the apartment.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The apartment was exactly as described and pictured. The bed was comfortable and I really felt at home. Having a washer and dryer in unit was amazing and convenient. I only had 1 small note and they had nothing to do with the owners or the apartment. The gym was more outdated than the pictures showed, still works just old equipment.
Hosts were super communicative and nice. Always happy to help. There is a Whole Foods right down the road in a cute little plaza with shops and restaurants. Really central location."

Our stay at Erika‚Äôs place was amazing and well-planned to accommodate her guests. As soon as you walk in, the aroma was great, the decor was fabulous in a very modern and minimalist way. The bed was very comfy (better than my Sleep Number) and the place was immaculately clean. üòä
Our hosts were very communicative from the beginning (pre/check in) giving clear instructions on everything, including parking (3rd floor - garage) to the very end (post check out); the follow up phone call) was huge.
The community was extremely nice and safe with gate access, restaurants and shopping nearby. Erika (has definitely set the bar on what to expect from an Airbnb host who is very in-tune with her client‚Äôs needs for a great stay. I‚Äôll üíØ percent book again and highly recommend to others."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer communicated quickly and was proactive in addressing issues she knew could become a problem.
I thoroughly enjoyed the space! It‚Äôs tastefully decorated, functional, beautifully apportioned and equipped with all of the creature comforts I could request. The patio was incredibly peaceful even located in the city. Parking worked for me because I was there for business. And I was sorry not to stay longer."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The renovation of this place was just great - beautiful floors, high ceilings, so much charm, but with every amenity we needed (and some we hadn't even thought of). Outdoor space out back was incredible. Could not have been more pleased start to finish!"

Really an incredible place in great downtown location, with a beautiful backyard and grill. Jennifer is one of the most flexible and understanding hosts we've ever had. Fingers crossed we'll get to enjoy it a third time"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"PERFECTION! Wow! I absolutely LOVED Jennifer‚Äôs place. I‚Äôm a BR native & visit often since moving away 30+ years ago. With limited updated and luxury hotel options in Baton Rouge, I often choose to stay in an AirBnB. This one is the best so far!
The attention to detail is incredible - the decor (so very tasteful yet still very Louisiana), the amenities (the coffee bar w/ Community Coffee & go-cups, an air fryer, the clawfoot tub, ample towels and linens), the bed was so comfortable it‚Äôs addictive! And the ‚Äòpi√®ce de r√©sistance‚Äô - the outdoor space! I love and look for welcoming outdoor spaces when I book an AirBnB ‚Äî ALL of it was simply awesome!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to Baton Rouge for a concert at the River Center and Jennifer‚Äôs place was easy walking distance to the venue.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My college-age daughter and I had a wonderful weekend and enjoyed so much about this home! It‚Äôs in a perfect location to explore the downtown area, be close to LSU‚Äôs campus, and have easy access to the interstate. It was also perfect because it was spotless, beautiful, and had every thing we could possibly need (loved all the details and the outdoor space!). And a huge thank you to Jennifer for making it so easy and comfortable! We didn‚Äôt want to leave, which means we will definitely be back!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Baton Rouge gem is exactly as pictured. It is within walking distance to downtown and a short ride away from LSU and other local attractions. After busy days of exploring, it was always nice to come home and relax in the backyard - so peaceful! Jennifer goes above and beyond as a host, offering local recommendations and equipping the house with everything you might need during your stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"(I hope none of my prior hosts are reading this) Jennifer was hands-down the best communicator, most patient, and most understanding host we‚Äôve ever had. She was extremely flexible about accommodating our daughters nap schedule, even though it was a big inconvenience to her. Her place is beautiful, and was ideal for us (couple with a baby). Loves the bathroom, big bed, well-stocked kitchen, and incredible backyard. The place was five stars, but wish I could give an extra one for the host."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot recommend Jennifer‚Äôs home highly enough! It was immaculate, charming, beautifully decorated. The kitchen is well-appointed. The yard is great.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed at several AirBnb‚Äôs, and Jennifer‚Äôs ranks right at the top! Her place was just as described‚Ä¶. Beautifully decorated, clean, and a mattress that didn‚Äôt hurt when I slept! While this place was amazing, my favorite thing has nothing to do with the actual AirBnb, but instead with Jennifer herself! She was very responsive and went as far to send me pictures of where I could find items similar to what she used in her AirBnb. She definitely raised the host ‚Äúbar‚Äù up several notches because she went above and beyond when I asked her questions. If you have any hesitations about staying at Jennifer‚Äôs AirBnb, let me save you the time and tell you to just book it now! I promise, you won‚Äôt regret it!"

We have been on a week long road trip and our vintage camper sprung a leak in the middle of a rainstorm! The hosts graciously accepted our request to book late in the day and were happy to let us park our camper in their driveway while we explored Baton Rouge for a bit before continuing on our way.

Melissa accommodated an early check in for us which we appreciated as we had an early flight.

Melissa was the easiest host to deal with, from early questions before booking to making sure we checked out with ease.
The home was absolutely beautiful and so spacious which was important for my larger family. The pool area was perfect for the crawfish we ate (suggested by Melissa) and watching our kids swim and enjoy the time in our space.

Plenty of space for all and the upscale kitchen appliances were the icing on top, it offers all the perks I look for (and rarely find) in a vacation rental. Definitely the cleanest rental I have ever stayed in, and very well stocked with all the necessities. The back patio with firepit & pool offer a gorgeous setting to get together and relax with family & friends. We truly didn‚Äôt want to leave!!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing space and host!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a nice place to stay for a short term visit for people with a family but a longer visit for students needing a place to stay. I am 6 months pregnant and the bed was pretty comfortable but definitely could use help. I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend a longer than 2 night stay if you are pregnant just due to the bed but if that gets fixed then I‚Äôd recommend to anyone. Very nice host. They live right behind you but they give you privacy. In a great centralized location that‚Äôs far enough down that game day traffic to interstate won‚Äôt be as terrible. But very close to LSU. FHA ms for hosting us.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Two sides to this review:
First, the place was perfect. Great neighborhood. Great location. Adorable set up. We loved it.
Second, Kirsten was slow to respond if she responded at all. As of six hours after checkout, she still hasn't answered my question from our first night. (We stayed for the weekend.) I also had questions about some confusion concerning checkout that have gone unanswered.
Overall I recommend this place. 5 stars on everything except communication. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that something important came up that she needed to focus on. We still had a lovely stay nevertheless."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 recommend..beautiful comfy place...the bed and linens were heavenly..
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was super cute and clean but we felt like we were right on top of everybody and were in someone‚Äôs back yard. The kitchen was super small and had limited supplies; if you plan on doing a lot of cooking this may not be the place for you.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable, comfy, cozy, and i LOVED the little kitchen with the little oven/stove!

I will definitely recommend this place for any of my out of town guests that come back to visit. Only real issue was with Waze having the location about 2 houses down, but my other guests used Apple and found it just fine! Also, definitely going to buy a set of those sheets and pillows for my home - so comfortable!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This property was such a wonderful place to stay for anyone, but especially for our family traveling with a young child! We all had our own spaces to relax, and our the young crawling child in our group could crawl around without us worrying about much of anything as it's set up to be both adult and child-friendly.

Owen was incredibly thoughtful and responsive when I needed to communicate with him. I definitely recommend this space!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Located in a beautiful area, the first impression of Owen‚Äôs place will blow you way. Let‚Äôs start with the mechanical gate that makes you feel like you paid way more than asking price, then the impeccably clean home with decor that‚Äôs simply an inspiration.
The layout of the house is perfect with the bedrooms perfectly designed with a family in mind. The backyard is fenced with room to roam. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt have time to grill or take advantage of the bikes that were included‚Ä¶ next time. The primary suite was perfect for my wife and I, and speaking of wife, I heard the words that every husband wants to hear after booking an Airbnb.. ‚ÄúWow! Babe you did good!‚Äù
Thanks Owen for a great stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was perfectly adorned. The host was extremely proactive and answered a question within minutes. The bedding was upscale and very comfortable.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"10/10 definitely recommend if staying in Baton Rouge or vicinity. The gated backyard was a plus with extra parking in front of the home in the driveway. Very nice backyard setting for grilling and hanging out although we didn‚Äôt have enough time to use it like we would have wanted to. The bedrooms were all really comfortable and this host goes the extra mile providing you with things you may need during your stay such as toothbrushes, floss and so forth. Wine bottle in the fridge and snacks for the kiddos. Perfect stay. Thanks for having us and we will definitely be back if ever visiting the area again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Mid City Haven! It had everything we needed. This was such a comfortable place for us to work from and to come rest while we were in the midst of closing on our home. We didn‚Äôt want to have to board our dogs all week while we were moving, so we really appreciated this space. Our pups enjoyed the huge yard, and although the home is located on a main street with through traffic, we felt confident our pups were safe & secured in the yard. We were pleasantly surprised at how quiet and peaceful this area was too once the brief work/school rush hour died down. The horseshoe driveway made it a breeze to close the gate & then exit on to the main road. In one direction, you are close to many of Baton Rouge‚Äôs unique & delicious restaurants all around the Mid City area, but turn another direction, and you can easily get to Towne Center shopping & a Whole Foods. The home is absolutely beautiful, comfortable, & welcoming. We look forward to staying at Owen‚Äôs place again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Owen‚Äôs home was beautiful. The decor, the outside, just everything. The neighborhood was safe and peaceful.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm from Baton Rouge, which makes me a trustworthy reviewer, so trust me when I say Carl's Airbnb is the perfect place to stay when visiting the capital city!
The location is PRIME ‚Äî about a block from the LSU lakes (and some of the most insane mansions on the lake), and is a short walk to everything the Overpass has to offer (mainly bars and restaurants).
It's a small space, but I was seriously nerding out over how effectively everything was laid out. I'm thinking of eventually building my own ADU and was taking notes.
My family no longer lives in Baton Rouge, so this is definitely where I'll be staying for future trips."

,,,Joshua was great but the power was knocked out by a storm on our first day there and didn't come back on until the morning of check out we only got 1 night out of our 3 night stay. I think we should have been reimbursed for the cleaning fees because we didn't have anything that needed to be cleaned we wasn't there long enough to mess anything up. He actually reimbursed us for 2 days and like I said he was a good host and I know he has to make money but due to circumstances outside of his or our control I think we should've been reimbursed for cleaning fee also.
