2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location, we were able to walk to everything. And a very nice apartment, with a great little deck on the roof. This was a perfect spot to enjoy downtown Keene for a weekend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Hannah was an excellent host! Thank you so much.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This apartment is a little kooky in its location being that you have to walk across the roof to access it but the moment you step in it’s super clean and beautifully done. Every detail is well thought out. I really enjoyed staying there and it’s right by downtown. It was just the relaxing spot I needed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love Hannah’s place! It is so comfortable and I always feel right at home when I stay here. They just renovated the bathroom and the shower is beautiful! I always appreciate staying in such a squeaky clean place with nice linens.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Hannah's place! Hannah was very proactive with communication ahead of our stay which helped with a very smooth checkin process and made us feel like we could go to her for anything we needed throughout our stay. The apartment is incredibly spacious and accomodated our 3 guests perfectly. We were a little unsure about navigating up to the apartment at first and there was one icey night where it felt sketchy to walk across the rooftop even with the grip pads, but once inside we were able to relax and felt right at home!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah's UpTop rooftop appartement was really exceeding our expectations. It is so spacious and nice decorated. Everything you want to have is there, even a special space for our yoga and tai chi exercises. The living room is a little bit cold so we did not spend time there. No problem: we like to spend time at the kitchen table. Keene is a nice town and the apartment is within walking distance of a really nice supermarket that sells organic locally produced food. In main street there a few nice restaurants.
We stayed two days longer than planned!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our time at Hannah’s place was one of our favorite stays to date! We were wowed by how pristine, cozy and spacious the apartment was. It was quiet, private, and the rooftop location was quite straightforward to access. The kitchen had more dishes/utensils than needed for the maximum amount of guests allowed - usually we run into the opposite with most airbnbs. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen, spending time in the living space and we wish we had time to play the many games available. There were so many thoughtful touches, such as lovely decor, free tea, coffee and snacks, and easy access with the keypad. There were even yoga mats for 4 and plenty of space to use them! Everything was so clean and tidy and we had no issues. Hannah sent clear instructions and great recommendations for dining before we even asked, too! The area was so cute and there was tons to do - we loved the speakeasy and went back twice. We would LOVE to come back! Thanks Hannah!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hannah's place is unique, cute and very clean! It's in a great location for walking to restaurants and little shops. We appreciated the basket of snacks left for us and it had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable overnight. If you're traveling with young children, please heed the considerations Hannah has included. A parent would need to be very conscious about the rooftop area along with keeping the safety gate closed to the nook with the twin mattress as it has a steep stairwell. We had only our teenager so no concerns.
We will definitely consider staying here again in the future. Thank you, Hannah!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a great spot. Stayed here with our 2 year old daughter and the amount of space in the apartment was perfect. The apartment is in a great location and decorated so cozy and is updated. We would stay here again if were ever in Keene!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay in Keene at this lovely apartment was great. It is a beautiful and comfortable space in the perfect location!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had visited a friend this summer while they stayed at The Rooftop. I liked it so much, that I booked it as my first airbnb stay for my birthday weekend. I loved the cozy homey feeling of the unit but yet it has so much unique space to spread out and enjoy yourself!
Hannah was fantastic with communication without being intrusive. She made sure to answer any questions. The unit was extremely clean and inviting and was perfectly stocked with all items you’d need, as well as those you might not think of!
The rooftop is an ideal location to just get away and relax or go enjoy a night or two on the town :) I look forward to seeing what the new renovations will be at this already ideal space!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give Hannah’s place more than 5 stars I would!! I absolutely loved this space. It was so peaceful, private, clean and spacious. Communication was easy and Hannah was very helpful in every way. If I’m ever back in Keene, I’d definitely want to stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Keene! At the top of the building, quiet, cozy and clean. Would come back again for a nearby ski trip!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This wasn’t my first time to stay at Hannah’s place. I love it here! I booked more stays for this year when I will be back in town.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying at Hannah’s rooftop, and it was my second time to love my stay! She just got a brand new washer and dryer that I was able to use, and I really appreciated that! I plan to stay here again in the next few months - I booked today to ensure it was available. I also loved that I could quickly walk to the restaurants and shops downtown."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay in Hannah’s apartment. It was very easy to access with the simple instructions she sent us. The apartment was clean and matched all the pictures. There was plenty of space to hang out in the futon/TV room, kitchen, second living area with yoga mats and bean bags, and the bedroom. Kitchen was well stocked with utensils and dishes, and dishwasher was a great feature. Bathroom was clean and water was hot. My girlfriend loved the interior design and made sure to take lots of pics of everything. Would definitely reccomend based on cleanliness and proximity to an awesome downtown area."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Hannah’s place was absolutely perfect. We needed a getaway while visiting family for the holidays and Hannah’s place served as the perfect sanctuary from the open floor plan to the board games and books, we had a ton of space to relax and enjoy some quiet time. They even put out sand on the walkway on one of the colder nights when some puddles iced over. Great place, great host!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our trip was just a brief overnight stay in Keene.
The apartment was very clean and had everything you might need for a short visit.
Overall, very happy with the accommodations."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing space in Keene - walkable to downtown, amazingly clean, unique, full of character and quiet. I will stay here whenever I need to lodge in keene and so happy to have found this space. Hannah was easy to communicate with and made the check in and check out seamless."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place is wonderful!! Clean, beautiful, cozy, inviting. Will definitely be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this space! Squeaky clean and nice linens. I also loved the yoga space! It was so nice to be able to work out at “home” - she even had 5 lb hand weights. Extremely close to the downtown area and great restaurants. I enjoyed it so much, I booked 8 additional nights for next month when I will be back for work."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As mentioned. Spacious apartment in the center of the town. Hostess was extremely responsive.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our 2 nights stay at Hannah’s listing. Its conveniently located and everything you will need is within walking distance. The space was open and bright which sets a very relaxing environment. I would most definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! This was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had on Airbnb. Hannah was so friendly and helpful. I found the property easily, thanks for her detailed instructions. The apartment was incredibly spacious and clean. I couldn’t believe how quiet it was during the day and night.
It was the perfect home away from home. I will absolutely be back!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place! We loved it. Would come back.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean and airy space with 3 bedrooms, perfect for a family with two kids. The towels are soft, the sheets are crisp, the kitchen is well appointed, the neighborhood is peaceful, and the house is just a few minutes from Main Street. My 80-year-old mother was charmed by the place and my 15-year-old daughter declared it was the kind of place she wanted to live after college."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in Keene for a wedding that happened to coincide with the Pumpkin Festival. Parking in town was not to be had, but it didn't matter.
Hannah's property put us within walking distance of everything. Her descriptions of the local color and restaurants were right on...and the space was wonderfully and tastefully done. Except that it rained every day (which wasn't Hannah's fault!), we loved our stay and look forward to returning."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We LOVED our stay in Keene! Easy to follow instructions, a seamless keypad code to get in, and the place was fantastic. Everything was spotless, the decor was so cute, and the place was even bigger than what I expected. The bed was comfortable and the area was very safe and walkable. Our only regret was not staying here longer. We’d love to come back soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful 2-day stay at Hannah's place. The moment I entered the apartment I felt right at home: it is tastefully decorated, has everything needed for a comfortable stay, extremely clean, and overall welcoming. You can walk to town with shops and restaurants in just a few minutes and there is also a large grocery store very close to the apartment. I loved the yoga/meditation room and made sure to use it. Hannah's communication was prompt and friendly. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a nice and relaxing getaway which is still close to a town."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We met Hannah on checking out. She was super helpful, very friendly and we enjoyed talking with her. The place is great and she is renovating. We will definitely want to come back. The unit had MANY extra touches and she is very generous.
A great night and we wished we had booked it again on our way home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great stay at Hannah’s place! Everything was exactly as pictured and above and beyond our expectations! Sadly, we were only staying one night, but we loved the walkability and convenience to the square. Hannah thought of everything; the roof top space was well appointed with a comfy seating area, great book selections, comfortable and clean linens, and it was SO spacious! On top of that, Hannah was very responsive and super friendly. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Keene!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing. Super clean, cute, and there was even a basket of welcome goodies and a yoga space 🧘‍♀️❤️. The bed was super comfortable and the location was right next to an adorable downtown square. We stayed here on our last night and were wishing that we could have stayed longer. Will be booking this again if I’m ever back in Keene."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hannah’s little rooftop apartment is quirky and adorable!! It was definitely bigger than I anticipated, and didn’t feel cramped or confined whatsoever.
Her place is a work in progress, but it still felt homey and I can wait to see how she renovates.
Please don’t take away that one of a kind charm
(And sit in the poof chairs! They are surprisingly comfy!)"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great one night stay after hiking nearby with some friends.. We were able to walk 3 minutes to a restaurant for dinner and had a nice evening in the apt.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the nicest places I've ever stayed. The location was an absolute dream to be able to walk to Keen Music Fest, but even on a day there aren't dozens of performances, to be able to walk to great restaurants and shops would be nice.
There was an amazing view from the deck, and the apartment had nice big windows for lots of light and air.
The futon was super comfy and all the amenities - sheets, towels, coffee, were great. Everything was in great condition and so pretty.
My only regret was a didn't give myself a chance to try the extra large bathtub."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This apartment is amazing! I stayed for a few weeks while visiting family and I really can’t say enough good things about it. The location is fantastic. It’s like a 30 second walk to Main Street with all of the shops and restaurants, but yet it’s incredibly quiet. The apartment itself is huge. I loved the yoga space (Hannah even provides yoga mats!) The whole space has a very laid back vibe to it, very relaxing. It has pretty much everything you will need during your stay. Check in was a breeze and the place was spotless. Hannah is awesome- very responsive, very nice. I highly recommend this place if you’re coming to Keene and I would 100% stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a quirky and delightful place to stay in Keene. It’s close to everything, easy to find and its quirkiness (across a roof to the front door, railroad flat layout) makes it very fun. We didn’t have time for yoga but appreciated the space and equipment."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Everything as described in the write-up. Close to Main Street and excellent restaurant and bar scene (check out the speak-easy). Place is surrounded by an apartment/condo complex that pulls a little away from the rustic charm but it’s still a nice, comfortable place in a attractive town. My wife enjoyed it and when that happens, life is easy."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an absolutely lovely space! So pretty and thoroughly stocked with everything we needed. Hannah made everything so easy and straightforward. We’d love to stay again and I can’t recommend it enough!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Hannah's place was really incredible, great location, really nice decor, and organization. plenty of space. I loved walking to dinner and the market easily. The Fireworks restaurant was so good! Highly recommend. The only downside was the difficulty in cooling down the sleeping area with this hot summer weather even with AC units and fans provided. I would absolutely return to this amazing Airbnb in cooler weather."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hannah’s place was an excellent choice of location for us during our stay in Keene.

We plan to book again when we visit Keene next time."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, sunny, peaceful space. Looks/is just like the photos. Nice linens. Spotless. Nice welcoming touches like a small basket with an assortment of snacks and tea, honey, coffee and creamer. Very close to Main Street and many decent restaurants but tucked away so it’s quiet. We appreciated the room darkening curtain tucked behind the pretty curtains in the bedroom. Hannah was very responsive. Arrival was easy with a key code. We appreciated the breakfast recommendation for Brewbakers. It was delicious."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is incredibly beautiful! It’s a great mix of old fashioned charm with the beams and hardwood floors, with modern amenities and decor. It’s very bright and airy. Great parking in the back, with plenty of room and a little away from the road. I love that I could walk two blocks to restaurants and cafes. The Colonial theater is about a four minute walk! I definitely recommend. I also love that Hannah left water, drinks, and a few snacks! Very thoughtful. The linens provided were very high quality. There is a huge space for yoga if you’re into that. It’s a beautiful and peaceful spot. It also has a great outdoor space to enjoy during the warm months. I definitely recommend!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"can walk to numerous restaurants and things to do. wish we could have stayed longer. I have a certified service dog so when searching, this place came up under pet friendly - DO NOT BRING DOGGOS. Cleaner is allergic and very much not the vibe. if my dog didn’t stay by my side and trained i would be nervous about the decor (hence why my other dog doesn’t travel with me 😅) entirely understandable and despite the confusion, communication was breezy. There are stairs but they are well lit with cameras and not isolated. I did not feel in danger whatsoever. highly recommended to friends."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very happy with choice of Hannah’s BNB. Walking distance to everything in downtown Keene. Place was well organized, spacious and comfortable.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hannah's place checks all the BnB boxes - Clean, comfortable, quiet, all the amenities and at a fair price. What sets it apart is the wonderfully unique space. Hannah has done a remarkable job transforming this 3rd floor space into something that makes for a memorable stay. Among all the pitched architectural features are a variety of very well composed living spaces. It's walking distance to a revitalized Main Street. Enjoyed Modestman Brewing in particular. Parking was great, access easy and Hannah was an extraordinary host."
2022-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Not a good place for 4 adults. Truly can sleep two adults and two children. The staircase up to the apartment door is fine but I would not walk up there alone as a female. Make sure there are multiple people walking up the stairs especially late at night. It seems like a good place to be mugged. Pricey apartment for only one bed. Place was very clean and Hannah was a good host.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This has got to be hands down the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. If I could rate it higher than 5 I totally would. The hospitality from Kristin and Marty was above and beyond! They made us fresh cookies and brought us bagels which was so thoughtful. These photos also don’t do justice. They really think of every detail and the place was immaculate. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely stay again!!

We traveled on Halloween weekend so the to go cups on the well supplied coffee bar were Halloween themed! There were bagels and cream cheese waiting for us in the refrigerator. There were fresh flowers over the fireplace. The linens were spa quality. Everything looked brand new in an antique house. The decor was very tasteful and fresh. The kitchen was well equipped with everything. The bathroom looked like it had just been remodeled and no one else had even used it yet. The beds were excellent. The mattresses weren't the cheap foam ones but quality all the way. The room had such great windows I didn't even know it had rained until morning. It was totally quiet all night.
Their communication was excellent. They were attentive and ready to serve. My only regret is not having enough time to meet the host. I will definitely be staying with them again."

Their apartment was very clean and fully stocked with everything that we needed (bagels and cream cheese in the fridge !!!). The linen, towels and sheets were washed and smelled so fresh. Kristin and Marty even arranged for milk and water for us on very short notice!! They really care for their guests and also suggested some really cool places to visit around town.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you go to Keene you MUST stay here!!! The space is so nice and comfortable. It has wonderful light during the day (but you can always draw the curtains for a cozy nap). It was by far our favorite Airbnb experience both because of the space and because Kristin and Marty are just the best. There were so many special touches that made this space feel so comfortable and more like a home away from home. Their attention to detail and kindness is unmatched. We walked downtown for dinner (with a 4 year old) and it was an easy walk so it's definitely a great location too. I really can't say enough good things about our experience here. We will be back (in fact we've already booked another week here).

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristin and Marty's place was a fantastic base for a weekend of exploring NH. The house was easy to find and easy to access. The street was quiet and parking out front was very straightforward. The apartment itself was fantastic too. Extremely clean and lots of thoughtful touches throughout. I was particularly impressed with the sheets and towels - everything smelled amazing and felt like high-end hotel quality. There were also a few pastries and bottled waters waiting for us in the fridge which was a delight. Kristin and Marty were also very responsive to our questions. Coming from an NYC apartment, I think this would be a very appealing long-term space as well. We'd absolutely stay here again."

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristin and Marty are wonderful hosts! They are so friendly and responsive and made everything easy - from reservations to check in to check out. The apartment itself is lovely and sparkling clean. The apartment is thoughtfully laid out to allow for all sorts of different functional spaces (bedroom, office, living, dining, etc). I stayed for a week while 'working from home', so this was really great. I moved from space to space from the day to the evening so never felt like I was cooped up. I was gathering decorating ideas for my own apartment, too! There were thoughtful personal touches while I was there, but I won't spoil the surprise. Honestly - I could have moved into this apartment full time. You will love staying here."

It was sparkling clean (which I really appreciated with a crawling baby), stylishly updated, beautifully decorated, in a perfect location and had everything we could possibly need (including fresh croissants and muffins they had waiting for us when we checked in!). I literally cannot say enough good things about their place. All 4 adults agreed that we wish we had a weekend place in Keene that looked just like it. If we're ever in the area again we'll absolutely stay there!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable space with great care taken by Kristin and Marty. Great amenities (pastries upon arrival) and very welcoming. Close to town and we enjoyed our short walk to town.

Keene is a wonderful town, with great bars and restaurants, and really friendly locals. Kristin and Marty were fantastic hosts, with a really cute apartment that's a short walk to the town center.

From coordinator:
They were amazing hosts! They texted us every day to see how we liked it. Also texted me that everything looked great when we left. It was clean, beautiful, and well stocked. Would stay again!
From photographer:
The place was nice, it was clean, and it was conveniently located. Natalia and I didn't meet the owners because of the odd times we were arriving and leaving, but it felt very personal - they had a welcome sign with all of our names on it, and they left some waters and some pastries, which was thoughtful. It was a very positive experience, I would stay at that place again.
Kristin and Marty were great hosts and I would definitely book this place again! Thank you so much!"

The beds were very comfy, and we especially like the Keurig coffee station. It is a 10 minute walk to downtown, and I felt comfortable walking back to the apartment at 9 at night after eating at the local Mexican restaurant. There’s some nice fishing in the area too. We will certainly be back, and stay longer next time!"

The kitchen was stocked with delicious bagels and cheese from a local bakery, coffee, waters, etc..The place was sunny, nice breezes, quiet, and we felt very safe there.

It was a beautiful, comfortable, pristine apartment with a well equipped kitchen and many special touches. We had a wonderful visit and are appreciative of their great hospitality."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment we booked with Kristin and Marty we were in good hands with expeditious responses to our inquiries. We arrived to find their skillfully-renovated apartment spick and span with gleaning wooden floors and a television with access to Netflix, HBO plus and more. The space was well heated with ceiling fans that will be great additions for the summer. The fridge had cream cheese for the bagels they’d left for us on the counter next to the stocked coffee maker. We enjoyed our stay tremendously and left with two bags of freshly baked cookies from Kristin for the ride home. Thanks so much for a great visit."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kristen & Martys’ place was an extremely cozy and comfortable apartment that was well-stocked with amenities. From the comfy beds to the new furniture—some of which the host made by hand—the place was full of charm and comfort. The hosts were friendly and very responsive to our needs.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay in Kristin and Marty’s place. It is delightful: warm and cozy, with plenty of space and beautiful structural details, and it’s a short walk into town for great meals. My friend and I were having some ‘girls’ time’ away from family and work responsibilities. The living room and desk/sitting room offer different spots for hanging out and relaxing. The space could easily accommodate two couples (2 rooms with big beds), or be a nice work retreat if someone was seeking a place to write. Everything seemed brand new, sparkling clean, and much of the space was created by hand by Marty and Kristin—a true labor of love that guests now get to enjoy. Keurig coffee available at all times; pastry treats offered our first morning; quick replies on all correspondence. Truly wonderful hosts and a wonderful getaway. It’s a quick walk into town for dinner: we particularly liked The Stage (good food and great cocktails). Hoping to run away for another weekend sometime! We’ll be sure to stay with Kristin and Marty if they aren’t booked up already."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful stay!! Strongly recommend to anyone thinking about visiting Keene

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we reserved a month in advance, we took a chance on a new place that didn't yet have reviews, and we are so glad we did. Kristen and Marty recently renovated the space and were friendly and welcoming. They even provided fresh bagels and cream cheese, a welcome surprise. There's a Keurig with coffee and cocoa. The kitchen had space to store our groceries and came equipped with everything we needed. We could have cooked all our meals there, but we enjoyed the half-mile walk to town to local restaurants for dinner.
The apartment was so clean and new-looking that we wondered if we were the first guests, but no, others had signed the guestbook and left glowing comments. Kristin and Marty clearly take pride in giving their guests a spotless and nicely decorated place to stay.
One warning: you do need to climb a flight of steep stairs, and since the apartment was once an attic, there are some low ceilings. My family members and I are short so this wasn't a problem, but very tall people might not prefer it.
Overall, we were delighted. If you're looking for a place in Keene, the second floor of Kristin and Marty's home makes a great apartment."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kristin and Marty’s place was something out of a better homes and gardens magazine. It looked like Joanna Gaines decorated herself! So adorable from the welcome sign saying welcome heather and friends to the bagels left for us to enjoy in the morning. If I lived in Keene I would want to live there. Short walk to down town as well! Loved it here, highly recommended!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kristin and Marty's place is fabulous. My family and I were in town for the Clarence Demar marathon and couldn't have found a better place to stay.

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're going to stay anywhere in, or around Keene NH, then you should stay here! My girlfriend and I came over from London to visit some family nearby, and Kristin and Marty's place was truly fantastic.
It's a really comfortable and private apartment, perfectly located within walking distance of Keene's vibrant main street, with plenty of restaurants, bars and shops nearby.
Everything in the apartment was thoughtfully laid out and stylishly finished to a very high standard. The kitchen and living areas are well equipped and spacious. The apartment could comfortably accommodate at least four people, though there were only the two of us staying.
Kristin and Marty are warm, welcoming, attentive hosts - and lovely people! They had added some great personal touches, and were very kind to be flexible for us. It was a wonderful retreat and definitely great value for money.
Cannot recommend this place enough. Thanks Kristin and Marty for a great stay!"

location perfect for Keene town centre and college nearby, has plenty of character
hosts were awesome, thank you"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Christina’s and sister’s place was pretty near perfect. Homey and beautifully decorated We needed a place for family get together that would mimic home and their place delivered …with lots of lovely extras. Squeaky clean, nice loaf of delicious banana bread to greet us. An unexpected snow storm arrived overnight and our hosts were so great about getting a snow machine and snow guru to dig out our cars. Hoping to make this a biannual space for family get togethers in the future.. maybe without the snow. Love the town also"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about this place was perfect for our stay. We used the house as a base for my family (grown kids and their SOs) while in Keene for my mom’s 90th. So in and out a lot. The house was precisely as described, spotlessly clean, homey and well supplied, and the common areas were great for our late evening chats. We loved our stay here."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Christina's house was perfect for our stay in Keene. We were greeted with a freshly baked banana bread which was delicious!! Our family was in town for a funeral which did not leave us much time for fun, but the house was very comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. I would love to stay again when we are in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay in Keene and this home was wonderful. It had everything we needed right down to fresh banana bread when we arrived. We highly recommend this home
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a magical, delightful gem in the heart Keene. Can’t wait to come back."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house with well appointed amenities. Warm surroundings great for a family or a friend’s reunion!
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This beautiful retreat has become our favorite family gathering spot. Christina and Heather are accommodating, kind, and quick to respond. It’s fun exploring the many rooms. So many nooks full of wonderful things to discover. Comfortable seating and beds (heavenly king size mattress). Granddaughters love the studio. It’s their sanctuary when we’re there (one wants to buy the house when she grows up). Well equipped kitchen, and labeled cabinets and drawers make it so easy to find things. Dishes and glassware are pretty and fun. The unexpected extra touches throughout the house are so appreciated and add to the home away from home feeling. Nice neighborhood and close to town. We enjoyed many walks into town, to check out the stores, get fancy coffee, or eat. I could go on and on about this house. We just love it so much."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved every moment staying at Christina's! So close to Downtown walking isn't a problem! Enjoyed being close to parks and trails and being able walk around the neighborhood looking at the beautiful old homes! Christina had the house planned out so well, we never had to wonder where anything was or how to change the temperature. It felt vey much a home and myself and my in-law were very sad when it was time to leave. We hope to visit again many more times in the future! Keene is a wonderful place! May have even inspired my in-laws to move there from Oklahoma. I can't say enough, it was magical!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are some places that one stays in that feel nice or are beautiful, etc,. and there are others that ALSO make you feel cared for and that inspire conversation and promote well being. Christina’s home does that and more. There are quiet corners to work, crafts to create with, intimate spaces for reading and a walkable area that gets you outdoors into wonderful NH days and evenings. This home makes you feel that all is right with the world."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was a perfect location for a small get together with friends. Very well kept, everything was clearly labeled and accessible, just an absolutely charming house all around! Perfect location in walking distance of central Keene. The host went above and beyond to address any and all needs we had. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So perfect for our family trip. Everything was labeled and easy to find. The decor was personal but so interesting and to at. The porch area, dining room, and living room made it easy to have group time, chat with each other, and plenty of area to your own time!! Location perfect our events and for coffee and dining and shopping. We wouldn'tchange a thing!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Family and friends of mine met at Christina’s beautiful house to visit my daughter and enjoy Keene. The house was updated, cozy , peaceful and very clean with many different rooms for people to gather together in and also spread out in for some alone time after a busy day. I love the screened in patio area as well.
There were many amenities and the drawers and cabinets were labeled, which made it easy to locate things. The walk to the town and restaurants was about 0.5 miles which was very convenient for us.
I would love to stay at this home again and highly recommend it to others."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,It’s a great quite place to unwind!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Third time staying here and perfect. Thank you!!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a fun and beautiful place to stay. Very clean, comfortable, with some really fun spaces, the house has a lot of character. There was plenty of room for six of us. Christina and her sisters were very helpful. They responded very quickly and were very accommodating. We highly recommend!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a gathering of old friends, and the house easily accommodating all of us. The kitchen is well equipped and all the cabinets are labelled making it easy to work in an unfamiliar kitchen. The large screened-in porch was ideal for hanging out in the evening."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved our stay here! Everyone had space to themselves and there were so many options for communal spaces. The house is gorgeous, couldn't have loved it more!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is an absolute gem. Gorgeously decorated...probably the most beautiful air b&b I've stayed at. So many special touches to make it more welcoming and comfortable. Things like homemade chocolate chip banana bread in the fridge, tons of books in the library, soft cozy throw blankets everywhere including the patio furniture on the screened in porch, amazing linens, and comfortable beds.
Great location a 10 minute or less walk to downtown. Traveling with kids we especially loved being just around the corner from 2 playgrounds.
The hosts were incredible!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We felt right at home! All communication was superb. The setting was peaceful, yet easy access to a bustling downtown.

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place! Perfect for our family! Christina was very responsive! We so appreciated the home- made banana cinnamon bread!
Thank you"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is a gem! From start to finish, the whole experience was wonderful. We have stayed at other Airbnb rentals and this one is at the top of our list! Banana bread in the kitchen, all of the items that you don’t have to shop for (paper products, condiments etc) the complete charm of the house…just loved it all! It’s hard to say what I liked most about the place, but, if I had to pick it's a toss up between the living room and the porch. So comfortable, so cozy! Enough room for everyone and we weren’t right on top of each other. Close enough to Main St. to walk easily and drive to surrounding stores to shop. We will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When women gather who have traveled far and wide the Airbnb accommodation needs to offer comfort, ease, and joy. Christina's place does all of that and more, just a short walk from the center of Keene but tucked into a peaceful historic neighborhood. Well-appointed and full of love is how I would describe this cozy oasis. I can not imagine any need that was not met."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Second stay was even better than our first. Great accommodations for our group.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house, walking distance to downtown. Lots of different spaces in the house. Quiet neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again. In fact, our family in Keene liked it and wanted to stay there too!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house really feels like home. We will definitely be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful, warm and friendly home. I stayed here with seven other women for a training in Keene. We had plenty of room, plenty of hot water, good internet connection, fantastic kitchen to cook in together and best of all a fresh loaf of banana bread on the counter to welcome us! Christina gave us a few extra hours to depart which was so helpful and generous as they had guests coming in right after us! We would definitely stay again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is an excellent location. Very clean and well maintained. Well equipped. Heisting is an excellent host who responds quickly to requests and does everything to make for a comfortable stay. Highly recommend.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Wonderful convenient stay with everything we needed!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time staying here and the house was fantastic. Very clean, and welcoming! Plan on staying again in a month when I head back to Keene to visit my daughter! Thank you and highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a magical house! How lucky we were to find ourselves in the incredible home here in Keene. We ended up needing an extra home for our summer family reunion. As luck would have it, we stumbled on this incredible place and had the most wonderful week. Beds were comfy, the house was delightful, coffee on the screened porch was perfection and the brilliant hospitality of three sisters was the cherry on top! We can’t wait to come again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is lovely, close to Keene, and Christina is very kind and easy to communicate with."
2022-07-01,4.0,Group trip,This was a great place to stay to call our home away from home. Very quiet as well at night for sleeping...great little town to see and explore....the accomodations were great...
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were in Keene for a family reunion and stayed in this lovely house with both children and grandparents. The house was beautifully decorated and maintained and was really perfect for us. The kitchen had everything we could possibly need, the house was stocked with cool books and games, and our kids fell in love with the awesome loft. The layout worked well for a larger group, as it allowed people to spread out and not keep each other awake. The screened-in porch was a great place to congregate, and the first floor bedroom and bathroom were good for an older person with limited mobility. The location is excellent - an easy, flat walk 10 minute walk into downtown Keene — and the hosts could not have been nicer or more responsive. We are all hoping to stay again for the next family reunion!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Christina's place was perfect. We had a six person group, there was plenty of room, just outside of town, everything you need to cook and grill, places to read, nice screened in porch, great outside space. If you are visiting Keene this place is awesome. Hope
To be back next year."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Extremely cozy and home-like
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is an absolute gem! My family stayed there to celebrate my graduation. It was cozy, clean, beautifully decorated, and perfectly located. The home not only had everything we needed, but it offered the creature comforts that make choosing an AirBnB far better than staying in a hotel. I've already recommended this place to several of my friends and classmates that live in or near the area. It's too big for a couple, but perfect for a family getaway."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was just as described with ample sleeping arrangements. The hosts provided a welcome basket with a personal note for our family. Absolutely made our graduation weekend easy and enjoyable!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful house! Very clean. Extremely spacious. Well decorated. Loved the open concept. How unique and comfortable it was to have the four bedrooms, four living room/den spaces, three bathrooms, two electric fireplaces, tons of counter space, and that one could walk from end to end through the first floor, up the stairs, through the second floor and down the back stair case. We didn’t cook during this visit but we sooo appreciated the fresh, local milk in the fridge waiting to greet a house full of coffee drinkers! There as a very nice welcome basket with snacks and wine. All instructions and house guide book was clear and easy to follow. We are looking forward to a return visit in one year!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful stay! The house was perfect for our large group. Downtown is a 5 minute walk. We will be back again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Much larger than it looks in the photos! What a great space to stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ample, clean, wonderfully charming space to live in for a fall wedding nearby for all 12 of us, including 2 five year olds. The open space on the first floor was immaculate and accommodating to all of us at meal and relaxation times. Then the back room served us well for late night chats while the sleepers slept. BIG bedrooms. Really Nice furnishings throughout. So tastefully decorated throughout. All the amenities we needed and more. So much parking space (for 5-8 cars?) and two garage spots made in and out and security so easy. Beds were comfy. Lots of pillows, blankets, seats, TP, towels, etc. Lots of space / bathroom availability. Big fridge. Snacks! Coffee! Tea! Lots of stuff carefully and proactively provided. Very helpful and detailed binder.
This old farmhouse has a charm that left us all looking forward to our next visit!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great stay - house was clean, had everything we needed and was a short walk from town!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful time at this AirBnb. Everything was as advertised. The place was clean, had everything we needed to cook (and I mean everything), and tons of space for me and my friends to enjoy. The hot tub was nice and clean. There was plenty of space to park. It was an easy 10 minute walk from downtown.
I highly recommend this place for groups or large families!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Pinhas is a gracious host. When we arrived, a lovely basket of fruits, snacks and wine were waiting for us. The house was emasculate and everything was easy to find. The location of the house was walking distance to the town and restaurants."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very enjoyable. My family and I had a great time very clean and quiet. Close to the town. Would definetly return.
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Close to restaurants and shops. Easy to feed a good size group.
Back stairs are too narrow to be really useful. And bathroom situation upstairs is a challenge if group is not all one family."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place! Can’t wait to come back next year!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Place was spacious and perfect walking distance to downtown. Nice small yard to hang out in as well.

Pini was incredibly responsive to questions before and during our stay. There were many thoughtful and generous touches … even a personal note with wine and snacks on the table when we arrived!
Everything was perfect!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were in Keene for my daughters wedding in Walpole. We were 7 staying at the home and it was completely wonderful. We had a few local friends who were able to walk from their hotels, to the home, to visit after the long days. It is the perfect place for a group. Super unassuming from the street but walk in and it is perfection. Comfortable with plenty of room to spread out. We loved the outside covered seating area near the hottub. All the seating in the house was comfortable as were the beds. I am fussy where I stay when I get away from it all. All of us agree that we would run back to this home when we can. Main Street is a short walk to farmers market, coffee shops, restaurants and galleries. We already want to go back when we have more time to explore. The host was super responsive when I had a question! That is a huge plus. You will not be disappointed in this home."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful stay! The home is impeccably clean, inviting, spacious, and charming. The hosts thought of everything - from a welcome basket, to a high chair for our baby, to a guide on some history of their house. We loved our weekend in the home, and it’s obvious the hosts take pride in it.
One of the reasons we decided on this house is because of its prime location to downtown. It’s a very short walk to all of the restaurants, cafes, and shopping. Yet it’s still quiet and serene. The perfect location, in a beautiful home, with very accommodating and gracious hosts.
(This house even converted my parents into liking the idea of Airbnbs - they were previously very skeptical.)"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice stay.

It was a very beautiful and clean home with responsive/friendly hosts. We would certainly stay again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was perfect for our group of 8 friends. The common areas are much bigger than pictured, with an open concept dining, kitchen and living room area and then a second living room with cozy fireplace down a hallway. The bedrooms were all big enough and beds all comfy. The hot tub was a must have for us and we were not disappointed. Quick walk to the heart of Keene for meals. The welcome basket was a lovely touch. Overall exceeded expectations!"

We were so impressed by how large and functional the kitchen space was, as well as how many different communal spaces we had to sprawl out and enjoy. Pini and Hillary have truly thought of everything to make this stay as easy and as comfortable as possible and would absolutely recommend staying here for any large group visiting Keene!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"I've stayed at many Airbnb's in the past few years, and I can honestly say this was one of the best! Everything was as described and/or better. Communication was A+.

The house is appointed with everything you can think of, the house manual is thorough, and the hosts attentive. Easy walking distance to downtown Keene or a quick drive to other attractions in the area. This would be a perfect spot for Parent's Weekend or graduation celebration with lots of family coming in. Everyone loved our time here!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a large group -7 adults and a toddler- and we all had to get ready for a wedding. The house was perfect. Large enough for all of us and everything we needed was there - hairdryer, iron, steamer. It is in a great location- easy walk into town."

I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone, thank you again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"We knew this would be a wonderful place but it far exceeded our expectations. It is incredibly roomy and everybody enjoyed their stay. The garage is a nice touch to keep the car away from the elements. The rainfall shower was amazing after a long drive and a day on the mountains and the place is filled with everything you could need from cooking/dishware to entertainment. The fruits, wine, and milk were very gracious gifts for us and it was greatly appreciated!
I could not recommend this place more! Pinhas was very responsive. I would be back here in a heartbeat if I am ever back in the area."
2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house was amazing - even better than the photos. The hosts were gracious and very communicative. Everyone in our group loved our stay. If we make it back to Keene, this is absolutely the house we'll be staying in again. 10/10."

Pini and Hilary were amazing hosts - we loved the basket with treats they left us, and the few basics in the refrigerator (like milk and juice) that were an extremely welcomed touch when we got in late at night hungry and tired. They were very responsive and everything was clean, working and easy to use. Highly recommended!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,A beautiful home with thoughtful and tasteful updates. Great character and location is within easy walking distance of downtown.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful, relaxing home. Very comfortable and adorable!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Celia's place, Heron Cove at Wilson Pond, was beautiful & very peaceful. It was an easy check-in process. Upon entering, I noticed how much bigger the inside looks from the outside. At the same time, it has a very cozy feel to it. Once we got settled, we looked for places close by that would deliver. Athen's Pizza did not disappoint. Papagallo's is another really great restaurant that's only a couple miles up the road. There were ducks that would come to visit every day, & a 2 person kayak to enjoy. I stayed there while there was a snow storm. Initially the internet went out, but it came back on later that night. Other than that, there were no problems with it. On Easter Sunday, I had a few family members over for dinner. Everyone wholeheartedly enjoyed themselves! The only thing that could have been better was the furniture. The beds are on the soft side, and the living room couch & chairs weren't very comfortable. Having the use of a washer/dryer was a major plus. I would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Celia's place was just as advertised and more! The views, the space, everything was perfect, neat and clean. We had everything we needed and then some! Can't wait to return!"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Great views out back window. Loved having separate desk for computer. Light switches and kitchen cabinets and drawers are labeled, so it was very easy to find things. Convenient parking right outside front door. What to know: Streetlight keeps main bedroom from getting very dark. Second bedroom is open at ceiling to living room so sound travels. Entrance to second bedroom is at head of the bed, so need to walk very narrow path between bed and wall to get in and out. Floors between kitchen, dining room, and living room are at slightly different levels with very small ramps between each room. Had issues with wall HVAC unit in living room always blowing hot air even when set at cool, which will hopefully be resolved for next guest."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and cozy place!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was so lucky to find a perfect house for us to stay in. We have family nearby and our rental was in the best location. The house was clean, everything was easy to find. Parking was easy and we felt relaxed. So much better than staying at a hotel, and not much difference in price. Well worth what we paid for it. Thank you Celia for opening your home to us. We will definitely be reaching out again soon.
The Poisson’s."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My boyfriend & I had an amazing time. We brought our dogs & they loved the backyard. Enough room to run around & it was very clean. The house was very cute, clean & tidy. Everything about this stay was literally perfect."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed here the end of fall, and during one of the first snows. It was magical! You feel much more secluded even though you are into a few minutes from Keene. We will definitely check this out for future visits."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you! It was perfect!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Heron’s Cove was a spacious, beautifully appointed place on Wilson Pond. We enjoyed looking out the picture window at the fall colors reflected in the water. It was a very serene, relaxing getaway and close to all the places we wanted to visit. The kitchen was well equipped. We appreciated that we were able to do our laundry there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay near Keene! Met our expectations in every category.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I cannot say enough for this listing. Patti was very responsive. We were up from NC to visit family. The location was convenient and allowed for them to come visit us as well. The house was easy to find and easy to get into. The pictures do not do it justice. It was very clean and smelled wonderful. Everything was easy to find with the label cabinets. Everything you need is available right there. The beds were the most comfortable that we have slept on while traveling. We slept like babies. We enjoyed it so much that we have already booked for next year. We also love the fact that we are able to bring our 4-legged children.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Celia's place! The location is absolutely beautiful, there was a double kayak there for us to use, and the house was as described. The beds were incredibly comfortable as well! We had a couple of questions when we first got there, but Celia got back to us right away. the only thing I would say is that if you are planning on watching Netflix, don't. It took forever to get logged into the system because the internet would not connect, and then it kept booting us off of the internet. Between the rebooting and the screen freezing and having to keep rewinding and restarting things, it took a couple hours of extra time the two nights we returned to watch movies in the evening. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a lovely experience. we had dinner guests for two evenings who wanted to know how they could stay there themselves! This home demonstrated why the host is referred to as a ""super host""."

Couldn’t ask for more from a host. Excited to return next year!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were very happy with our stay. The house was beautifully and thoughtfully appointed. The space was very clean and I really appreciated that the kitchen cabinets were labeled--there is nothing worse than trying to cook in a strange kitchen and spending half the time looking for a cutting board! The location is just minutes to beautiful Downtown Keene, and walking distance to the Fairgrounds. The neighborhood was very quiet--no partying at night! :) We also enjoyed kayaking around the pond!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a delightful cottage with a lovely view. Actually better than it looks in the photos! Geese came to visit us in the mornings. Lots of really good restaurants in Keene.

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"liked this location and would come back in the summer to use the lake. The heater made a strange burning smell that was not resolved, the heater was also very loud. I got a tect right before checking in informing me that the lock was stuck and to only use the deadbolt and i wish this was in the description of the house because i am big on security. the dishwasher was missing fluid so we had to do them by hand. over nice area and home."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our weekend away in Keene. Highly recommend this beautiful modern cottage! Perfect size for a couple and a doggie 🐾 or to even bring the kids! Will definitely return in warmer weather ☺️

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a gem! This a wonderful historical house. We had an awesome mini vacation between Christmas and New Years. There were 5 adults 3 children and 2 dogs and we were all very comfortable. We would love to return in the future. Highly recommend
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great house! super close to down town and other chain shops/restaurants around the corner.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had 7 adults and 2 kids and all of us had a great early Thanksgiving stay here. Rooms were comfortable, kitchen was easy to navigate and cook in. Two minor issues were dealt with promptly. Would happily stay again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Came into town for a wedding and this was the perfect little place for our group of people to stay. It’s an old home and gives you that feeling with the decor. There are quite a few stairs which could be a bit much with young children or anyone older that may not be able to handle them. But we loved the quietness even being near downtown Keene. After a bit of trouble getting into the front door with our code, the hosts were quick to help remedy and get us inside for our check in with little trouble after that. If we ever have a big family event in Keene again we will definitely want to come back here!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely historic house that has been updated really thoughtfully. We didn’t need to cook but it seemed well equipped. Good heat too. Beds and bedding very comfortable. Think all 10 of us would agree. Thank you.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. Great location. Clean and well stocked.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a charming historical home with plenty of space for our family wedding. It’s proximity to downtown made it easy to enjoy a lovely fall weekend!

The house was clean and spacious."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was much larger than expected, though the stairwells and the hallway under the stairs on the first floor was pretty short. Otherwise, the house exceeded expectations and was a cozy little place to stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was amazing and my whole family enjoyed staying in such a historic house. It was well cared for and Demelza really has great attention to detail, which made us feel at home. We will definitely stay there again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"10 of us came to NH for a funeral & to climb Monadnock. We arrived quite late on a weeknight and were happy with ease of entry instructions. Wifi name and password on the chalk board was a nice touch. The house was a lovely old house with modern amenities. I don't think it mentioned anywhere a simple ""4 bedrooms up, one down"". That would have been helpful. Master bed was super high up and required us old folks quite a leg-stretch to get in. All rooms were pretty, and comfy nonetheless. The sitting/fireplace area in the downstairs bedroom was a bonus. The driveway was long and wide enough to fit all our cars (guests stopped in for community and refreshments after funeral). School Street was quiet. Kids liked the swings in the back yard. Friendly/quiet dogs live next door. There were plenty of pots & pans for cooking, as well as usual kitchen dinnerware. I believe we all felt right at home. Thank you!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,My colleagues and I reserved the whole house for a weekend event at Antioch University. There were plenty of comfortable beds and towels for us. We all settled in and felt right at home. Keene is a great little town and what better way to experience it than in a 200+ year old home
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Great house with good space for our team who were staying while doing races in Dublin. Perfect for a group!
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place
Amazing old house!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,I would recommend this place to anyone staying near Keene. Nice big house with plenty of room and parking.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This is such a quaint and cozy house. It was far better than we expected. Demelza was responsive and accommodating. I wish we had known this place when my son was going to school here. Perfect location near town. I highly recommend it.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fun historic house decorated thoughtfully, great place to stay with family. Lots of space and fully stocked kitchen with everything you could need. Awesome master bedroom. Location was spot on; set back on a quiet, historic street a couple blocks away from shops, restaurants and bars downtown. Will be back for our next visit!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Walkable to downtown, safe, and easy. Thanks!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anytime I’m in town I try to stay at one of Patti’s properties. All of her homes have a unique charm that is always awesome. This one had tones of art. Banksey style pieces all over. Awesome spot, close to the bars and restaurants."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the space!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home is comfortable and very clean, and the neighborhood is quiet.

It’s conveniently located close to downtown; shops and restaurants are within walking distance."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the 2nd time I stay at one of Patti's places. The place actually is bigger than pictures lead you to believe, which was great. The amount of books in the home to read and look at is a true art historians dream. Patti is very quick with responses, and a pleasure to communicate with. My children loved how clean everything was and even attempted to help keep the place tidy and clean. I can't wait to stay at another location that Patti maintains."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay overall!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location with quick access to main street and fun house with all of the art. The only real negative was the uncomfortable couch. The living room is so nice and has a large TV but was hard to get comfortable and relax. Everything else was great.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti's place was in walking distance of downtown Keene and all the restaurants one would need. I had to work quite a bit of the trip so I appreciated the separate working area, wifi, and private space. Patti was responsive within 1 hour of any questions and provided clear instructions. Very clean and organized. I would stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this historical gem! Such a fun whimsical place with easy walking distance to shopping and restaurants. Like Mary Poppins carpet bag, outside looks small but the inside feels big and happy and is a joy to explore.
Patti responded within minutes and was so kind to give us some history as well as local places to find things we needed.
We had planned to go out and explore the town but were so content and comfortable that we found ourselves just hanging out. A great place to chill.
Was also thrilled with the bed. Firm mattress was marvelous for my bad back - but soft enough for my shoulders… often a rare combo.
We will be staying here again as well as checking out Patti’s other listings. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic place! Super quiet. Great location, too. We’d definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely stay at this home. Wonderful location- private and quiet home (we loved admiring the wonderful artwork!) and most importantly, downtown was an easy & quick walk! Thank you Patti!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Keene has so many great restaurants and bars a quick walk from the house. The house was a great jumping off point for adventures in New Hampshire and Vermont. After adventure filled days, it was an extremely comfortable place to come home to!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great house! Very cozy and close to downtown Keene
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Patti’s place was just as described and easy check in. Clean home spacious. We had an easy walk to downtown. Couch was super uncomfortable. Too small for adults. The beds were not the best either. Overall a good value
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved our stay! Patti was a great communicator and the rooms were clean and spacious.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here with our two small children for a few months and loved the location! Easy to walk downtown, multiple parks nearby, and in a pretty quiet neighborhood. Patti is a great host and was very accommodating to some requests we had with quick responses."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location with inviting decorations that make you want to stay longer!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Patti's place was perfect for us! We were working remotely for a week and had family business to attend to in the area. Patti's house was comfortable and clean and had plenty of space (and good internet / wifi) for us to set up and work. The art touches are wonderful and the home had everything we needed. Loved being able to walk downtown to shops and restaurants. Thank you Patti!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredible value for this gem of a house. Even if this art isn’t your thing, you can’t help but love the full effect of this place. Even more, it is walkable to downtown shops and restaurants, has great prep space and table space for cooking and eating, several bathrooms and beds, and all the amenities you could need. Highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I thought that the house was super beautiful! I went there with my dog, mom, sister, and girlfriend for a family vacation over New Years. My girlfriend and I used the house as a launching point for some ski trips and is located within an hour drive of Okemo, Sunapee, and Crotched Mountains. Additionally, my mom and sister really enjoyed staying at the house due to the spacious area, nice kitchen, and the home-like feel."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I stayed in the Art Gallery for a month while visiting family and working remotely.
The place was perfect for us. The home was big enough that we could each have a separate working area and even be in Zoom meetings at the same time and not disturb each other. Internet was great and we never had any glitches in Zoom video calls.
Patti was amazingly responsive and responded within a few minutes each time we contacted her.
The location of the Art Gallery in Keene is great. I do a lot of ""walk and talk"" one-on-one meetings at work and found some great places to walk around the neighborhood. The home is also close to downtown Keene and we could walk to everything we needed (we drove to the grocery store) - we recommend the Prime Roast for coffee and Brewbakers for a legit donut/baked goods (the everything scone!). Parking was easy and the home itself is off the main streets a bit so it was very quiet.
We had a great visit!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location just outside the shops and restaurants in downtown Keene. Clean and quiet.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Art Gallery. The location is convenient and quiet; check-in/check-out and parking were easy. The house was well-equipped and perfectly clean. So comfortable! The art in the house is really interesting with something to tickle the fancy at every turn. And the many art and art history books were a wonderful treat. We enjoyed choosing books from the shelves and sitting with them over coffee and chatting. The large TV in the living room was great to relax and watch a show at the end of the day. We wished we’d had more days to enjoy the house and the area. Thank you, Patti, for providing such a nice place!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Keene for a nearby wedding. Patti's place was just great - as pretty in person as in the photos, perfect location to the center of town, and nice and clean."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here for a quick weekend trip to run a race. Conveniently located, and a very quiet area. Always a plus when I get to bring my dog along."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very cool spot to stay in Keene. Very short walk to downtown!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The Art Gallery is exactly as ""pictured"", remarkable art throughout the residence.
The house was spacious and with very comfortable beds. Check in was easy and the house was immaculate.

We are looking forward to our return next year.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a great stay at Patti's place. The space was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Patti communicated in a timely manner, and sent over some things that were missing quickly. Highly recommend."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Patti’s little slice of heaven was amazing! So comfortable and inviting in a historic part of town with many other historic homes surrounding it.
I would highly recommend her place when you’re in town and Lindy’s Diner for breakfast!
I will use this property again in the future!
The old books and hardwood floors made it seem like home. Thank you for having us!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Delightful place to stay No problems at all and the one internet connection issue was immediately fix
Great reads and assortment of books
Needs a space heater for the extra cold winter mornings other than that I can’t complain looking forward to my next stay!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very nice place! So happy we found it. Just few minutes to walk to downtown. Dog friendly!

Great stay overall!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for hosting, Patti! This was a wonderful stay. We enjoyed the home and all its amenities. The location is very convenient and a quick walk to shops and restaurants in Downton Keene. And of course we loved looking at all the books inside the home!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful spot to spend the weekend visiting Keene. Patti was so kind and quick to reply when I had a question. If I make it back to the area I have full intentions of renting from her again!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is old but it is so comfortable and clean. The unit we stayed in was spacious and we felt right at home. It would be nice to have a couple of chairs to sit out on the porch! The porch is so cute!
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Several owner articulated 'rules' regarding pets and refunds came late and/or contradicted Airbnb stated policies. Minimal or broken down sitting limited my ability to sit (bad back). Overall, a nice apartment, but bring your own pots if you want to cook anything other than frying. If you have a bad back, bring your own board to place under cushions of couch and bedroom easy chairs. If attracted by low price, do check the added fees now much more easily found."

Convenient parking!"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would leave 5 stars but the Wi-Fi was very spotty, wouldn't stay connected and was unreliable. And then there was the parking issue, parking is in a lot behind the house with lettered spaces that were inaccurately marked and some people came out clearly annoyed and complained about us parking in the ""wrong"" space, we were parked on the letter F. Other than that, the space was great and in a great location."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Always enjoy all of the apartments in this building, this unit in particular is very spacious and as always, can’t beat the location!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! Love the location. We walked each morning to see what we could see in the neighborhood before heading out to explore the greater area beyond. The accommodation was so quaint and had what we needed and felt like a home away from home. I LOVE ALL THE BOOKS!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Everything was wonderful, very comfortable, clean , lovely kitchen, all the essentials. Great , great location. Host Patti was SUPER helpful and quick to respond. 😀"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"a sweet place to spend time while in Keene. it’s easy to walk all over town from this location. the parking lot was easy and felt secure. i enjoyed taking a bath, the spring flowers outside, the incredible book collection, and using the kitchen which was stocked with appliances. several different coffee makers so everyone can start the day their preferred way. great closet space! friendly neighbors. the place has windows which face the street, it’s by no means loud, however i am used to total silence at night and utilized ear plugs. wifi wasn’t working & Patti immediately responded & took care of it. i would stay here again & recommend it."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was a nice place to stay! Patty was very nice. The home was very large and spacious which I loved! I loved seeing all the books in the rooms. Plenty of restaurants and shopping downtown, all within walking distance. The neighborhood is lovely! All the old houses are beautiful."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay in Keene! Patti was a great communicator and so helpful with extending our stay and allowing us to check in a little early. Great coffee station, with the very basic kitchen supplies. Wonderful location, walkable to downtown. Pictures don’t do it justice, this place is roomy! Would absolutely recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome apartment! Cute place, comfortable, clean, with a great location as well."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can't recommend this apartment enough! The location was perfect to explore Keene and New Hampshire, it was spotlessly clean and it had everything that we could have asked for. A few things that really made this apartment stand out (apart from the books!) were the great shower, the comfortable beds and the user friendly kitchen. 10/10 would recommend to anyone."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Patti was absolutely wonderful! The place was clean and stunning with everything as pictured. The facilities were everything you would need for a shorter or longer-term stay. Patti was quick to respond to messages and was very organized. I would definitely recommend staying with Patti to anyone looking to visit Keene!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If Keene is your destination, you will absolutely want to add one of Patti's listings to your itinerary. This is our second stay with Patti, as we have searched for a new home in the area. The location is ideal and all of our basic needs were met with ease."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great find in Keene, NH. The books and artwork here are just amazing. The space is large, comfortable, and very clean. I would come back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little house! Perfect for us and our 2 small dogs. Shower has great water pressure! 10 minutes to downtown Keene with great restaurants! 3 breweries right around the corner! We took advantage of the small fire pit in the back yard and enjoyed the sounds of nature at night! Be mindful, it’s tick season so check your fur babies before they come inside! We would definitely book again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was absolutely adorable. We thoroughly enjoyed staying for the night. It was so clean and everything was exactly as expected. Market Basket was less than a 5 minute walk away. We hope to be able to stay here each time we come out to Keene in the future!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julie is THE BEST! Such a sweet person. We loved our stay here (myself, my husband, 18 month old, and dog!) we would happily stay here again.
Loved all the earth friendly options available inside too! Recycling bins, plastic free detergent sheets, etc."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute place! For being almost 100 years old it is very well maintained and up to date. A short drive to downtown, lots of shops and food near by. Back far from the road. Trails out back. Wonderful spot and Julie was very welcoming and communicative. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an excellent stay! The house was so close to town which was nice and off the road enough that it was very private, quiet and cozy. The inside was comfortable and everything was set up so nice. Julie was a fantastic host and I will definitely be staying there again for my future trips!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great cozy and comfortable place to stay. The location is great. It is a short drive to downtown and surrounding Keene areas and a grocery store is within walking distance. The yard was a particular gem for pets. It is a deep woodsy yard with lots of room for the dog to get exercise and explore. And the price was very reasonable. We plan to stay there again in the future.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were driving up to Okemo and stayed at this lovely place for one night. It had everything that our family needed and the host was responsive as well. Highly recommend.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay in a quiet and comfortable location.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Julie, was one of the best hosts I have experienced. She ensured the house was extra clean as I have a little one that would be crawling around on the floor. Additionally, she went above and beyond to add amenities like a pack and play and high chair so I didn’t have to worry about traveling with them. Many places said dog friendly, but her home really was. She even had dog dishes for me to use. I will absolutely be booking with her again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great little house. Julie was great. Very accommodating and flexible. Would highly recommend!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time for our weekend getaway. House was nice and toasty during the cold weather and everything we needed was there during our stay. We did some hiking during the weekend with the pups and ate dinner both nights at Tempesta's (old relocated and renamed from Jim Eddies) as we do during every stay in Keene. It was perfect for us and Julie was amazing to work with.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Julie's little house for the past 3 weeks with a friend during the week for work. This house is perfect for 2 or 3 people. It's very private, and clean with a full kitchen which helps alot. Market basket is within walking distance and you can drive to Walmart in 4 minutes. The little house is located just a short drive away from main street in Keene. Julie is an excellent host and very respectful and responsive. If I need to stay in Keene again for work, this will be it. I'm not a fan of the plain Jane hotel scene. I'd prefer my own house for the same price."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing experience.!!! Would recommend
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Julie’s little house was perfect for our stay! The location was right in town with plenty of property to let our dogs explore! The place was clean and provided everything we needed to call it home! We truly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come back!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Small, cute, and cozy. Just right for one or two people who want to cook their own food. Full size stove and refrigerator. Super convenient to downtown Keene, including the Colonial Theater and the Monadnock Food Coop. Easy private parking. And far less cost than a motel."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay if you are visiting Keene. Downtown was very walkable, great surroundings and neighborhood. We enjoyed sitting out on the front deck. Street parking was very easy, there is parking on site but we found that it was easier to leave the car in front. Both bedrooms were great, lots of light and clean. Bathroom was solid, nice kitchen too."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very sweet place. Great books to read while you stay
We were in all day so we couldn’t make use of the relaxing atmosphere but it was nice to come home to a clean and quiet space"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,easy walking distance to downtown
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"As always another great one of pattys properties never stay with anyone else! Homes are always accurately described, super clean and patty is always super helpful and answers any questions quickly.
Thanks so much look forward to next time."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The accommodations were great, just as pictured. The location is perfect for walking downtown, providing easy access to everything you need during the stay.
Patti was a wonderful host, with exceptional communication skills. She was always prompt in responding to any requests, making the entire process seamless.
I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Patti's place again in the future. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a comfortable and hassle-free Airbnb experience!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent Airbnb felt like home just like the pictures
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We had a great time at Patti's house in a good location
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was lovely! Lots of space and such a good location to downtown. The only thing was that the pull out couch was broken so very uncomfortable to sleep in (fine to sit in as a couch).
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,My stay in Patti’s place was just delightful and Patti was a wonderful host. She was very responsive and I enjoyed my time here and would be delighted to book here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Patti's place in Keene was just as described and perfect for our trip. Would stay there again. Thank you!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Patti was very friendly and responsive and the house is in an excellent location. There is lots of interesting art and many unique books all throughout the home. I had everything I needed to feel at home for an extended stay, and the bathroom is quite spacious, I enjoyed the vanity area. The balcony is a treat! Make sure to use the dedicated parking lot for night time."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was cozy and warm.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place , great host"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti’s place was perfectly located for us to walk to downtown Keene. We appreciated the designated parking spots. She has lots of interesting art, books and memorabilia!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Comfortable and spacious.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Patti went out of her way to help me and be so sweet. The place is even better than the photos!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Spacious and comfortable.
The firm beds are greatly appreciated."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very good
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was really lovely to stay in a historic home in the center of Keene. We really enjoyed the neighborhood and area and loved the thematic decor. The mattresses are indeed quite firm, but the linens were lovely and soft. Our favorite part was the stately balcony facing the street, and the two separate desks for us to work remotely. I did expect it to be a bit cleaner, but overall we thoroughly enjoyed the uniqueness of the space, and Patti was a very good host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Patti was friendly and always quick to reply. The apt is in an almost 200 year old home and just beautiful. The furnishings and decor are quirky and comfortable. This isn’t modern and fancy, but it’s comfy and has so much personality! Thanks Patti!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Patti's place. The walkability to downtown was perfect for visiting the many restaurants, bars (and great coffee places!) The place has a really cool/funky vibe with touches of turn of the century charm, but with a modern flair (and modern amenities.) Basically perfect for our weekend in Keene."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is roomy and convenient, but definitely needs more care and love. Kitchen area is barely functional, with only limited dishes and no cooking utensils. Pull-out bed didn’t work and needs maintenance. The place is located in one of the main streets so there’s noises even at night, prepare a set of ear puffs might be a good idea."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Patti's place was great! Could easily walk to town and enjoy the local restaurants. Clean space and accurately described - I would definitely stay here again if traveling to Keene!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quaint New England place. Walking distance to Main Street Keene.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent location within walking distance to the downtown.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was an excellent apartment for our group of 6 adults and one infant.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love the old world, and this house had so much history. If I ever come to Keene, I will ask Patty for a place. Thank you Patty."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, it was a comfortable stay and Patti was a responsive and good host. The house was clean and spacious and located conveniently in Keene. Our only complaint was the high cleaning fee which essentially doubled the cost of our stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved staying here. The house had a lot of character and charm. The artwork was enjoyable too! Parking was convenient and grounds were well kept. I live locally and I will use this for guests in the future! I’ve told my friends, so they will too!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Beautiful place, well taken care of. Very clean and comfortable. Nice kitchen to cook, many restaurants and shopping near by. Walk to downtown and 1 mile from Cheshire Medical Center. Patti has been wonderful. Very quick to respond and accommodate. Would definitely recommend 👍"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We stay with this host every time we can! Traveling for biz for extended times and it always is perfect. The host is super helpful and the properties are the best in the area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I had a great week during my stay here! The location was easily accessible to downtown, and walkable to many things! The only downside to the downtown location is that the apartment is on a busier street, which can be loud at times, but overall I’d say that the convenience to most amenities is worth the extra noise. Otherwise the apartment had everything I needed and more, bonus points for having an actual coffee maker and grinder! Would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location - walkable to Keene's Main Street. There was plenty of room in the apartment. Beds were comfortable. Patti was very responsive to our needs.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Totally recommended.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Had to made a reservation on short notice due to work in the area. Patti responded quickly and effectively.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay. Great location! Great accommodations. Very relaxing.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As always….. great host with standards and great staff. Thank you
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very unique, private space. We loved our stay. Walkable to downtown Keene. A bit cool in the winter, being a beautiful older home, but there are extra comforters and a space heater available. Patti was super flexible with our check out and very communicative. Thank you for a lovely stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. Amazing location and kind host!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home in Keene is a fabulous find! Our hostess provided everything we could have possibly needed to make our stay comfortable and convenient. We would highly recommend Patti!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place--very attractive, very comfortable, very helpful and thorough information, very convenient location."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great house in a great location. Easy to access, plenty of parking. House was nice and clean, big rooms, nice style to each room."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay in Keene. Communication with Patti was excellent and check in was seamless and flexible. The suite was accurately described. Its an older structure and has its quirks but that is part of the charm. If you stay in an older home you should expect some unique features and yes, some squeaks! Exterior definitely shows its age but like they say about judging books by their covers don't be concened - the interior is in good shape. The decor was interesting as well - notice the wall hangings/maps and photos as they capture something about the area! The proximity to the downtown is wonderful. The downtown is simply a gem of a New England village. I recommend the Thai Garden restaurant and Prime Roast is a wonderful local coffee shop. Surrounding areas are beautiful as well and readily accessed from this location. I worked most of the day during my stay and had no issues with WiFi or other disruptions. The overall cleanliness of the suite was very good. Bathrooms and kitchens are key for me and both were spotless! Overall I tend to look at value as the bottom line. In the end I feel the rate was very fair given all the suite and location have to offer!!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great location just a short walk from Main Street. The beds were uncomfortably firm and the pullout couch is very small. All in all we had a nice visit just not very restful.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay, thank you!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Convenient to downtown Keene with good parking. Very spacious; ample for two couples or with kids.
Not a ""Cooks Kitchen.""
We enjoy the character an antique home can bring but the apartment would benefit greatly from a bit more love."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, tastefully decorated apartment in Keene, NH! We stayed for three nights and had room to spread out. The beds were incredibly made -- comfortable, with the coziest cotton bedding (my favorite!!). Thank you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti was very helpful and highly communicative with us during our stay. Location is super convenient to downtown Keene - you can walk everywhere in under ten minutes. Nice to have easily accessible free parking, as well. The apartment is in an historic building so things are just older (wonky floors, doors don’t always close easily), but everything is appointed well and very clean. Laundry is shared between other units, but it is free. The only negative part of our experience was there was a mouse found in the garbage can upon arrival. The host was gracious and apologized and promised to address it right away. Great customer service. The unit was exceptionally clean and it appeared to just be an isolated one-off of being in an older building. Overall - very good stay. Thank you!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations were amazing!! Great location and clean and everything worked great!! I will be back!!
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, great location! Six minute walk to the downtown shops and a 3 minute drive (or 10 min walk) to the food co-cop! Internet was very, very fast (we got 450mbps - which is probably the max for modern wifi systems). The house is an older house (200 years old I believe), so it will have some quirks. Host was very responsive and great."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! It's a 200 year old house! It comes with the feel, charm and history of an old home. That means the floors squeak and not everything is at a perfectly right angle. We loved that. You can spend hours to look at all the old books.
Easy to walk downtown in a few minutes."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay mirrored pretty much what others have written. Pros: great location if Keene and the region is your target. Clean. And I’d add great parking. Cons: the house could use some love inside and out - though that didn’t affect our stay in any super tangible way. The bed situation is tough. You have to like firm beds to get a good night sleep. and the third “bed” is a small folding couch. It’s somewhere between 4x4 when folded open. Maybe 5x5 at most. So only good for one child, not two. Definitely not adults (unless they are uncommonly wee). If you have an appreciation for wall art, this is the place for you! Wish we had more time to explore all the books."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Interesting old building with character. Convenient location.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient to everything in Keene.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Beautifully decorated apartment and at a perfect location steps from downtown. Patti was terrific to work with and we will definitely stay here again during our next visit to Keene!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Patti's communication was superb and she was flexible with changes to the reservation were made after the initial reservation. The location of the home is very convenient to downtown and where I was taking classes during my time in Keene. The layout of the house was perfect for sharing with friends and/or other students. The exterior is in need of attention as it states in the listing, but the inside was comfortable and it appears Patti is making efforts to renovate the property."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay during your visit to Keene. Walk to shops/restaurants. Fun things (books!) to look at in the apartment. Would highly recommend 😎
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Patti,
Your place is Awesome!!
If you are looking for an experience of a small vibrant town (Keene, NH), consider staying here. Clean, bright space(s) and a ""stone's throw away"" from downtown.
Thank you Patti.
Jessie & Co."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful older apartment very close to downtown. Patti answered all of my questions in a timely manner. I would definitely stay there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What a wonderful place to stay.
Thank you Patti!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place matches all the information and Patti was great with communicating. The place is a short walk to downtown Keene and the apartment is very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again:)
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We feel compelled to post a few problems we had with the Airbnb though it is quite cute and well-located. The problems we had: 1) the final night of our stay the heat was on so high and unable to be turned off that we had to leave in the middle of the night because we were unable to sleep and literally drenched in sweat (though we opened all the windows to try to cool it down); 2) there was an old sharp nail sticking up from the wood floor near the kitchen which almost seriously cut my foot; 3) the front door lock was almost unworkable to the point that only my husband was able to get the key to work after many tries; 4) the center stair chandelier light switch didn’t work so the light always stayed on and we had to unscrew the light bulbs to shut it off at night; 5) we weren’t able to get in contact with the Host during our stay to get these things fixed. Like we said, the place is cute and well-located, so we hope the Host will fix those problems for future Guests."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti’s place was such a spacious & beautiful space to stay. I loved the historic charm of the space! Patti was very responsive & friendly to any issues we had. I’m originally from the Monadnock area & came to visit for a family celebration. There was plenty of room to have some family over to join us for a few meals so we didn’t have to eat out the whole time. The kitchen was well stocked except for cooking utensils. (I was lucky I could borrow a spatula from nearby family to make eggs & pancakes.)
I would definitely stay here again as well as recommend it to friends & family."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Patti is the consummate host - helpful, communicative, thoughtful, and available. The rental unit was clean, spacious and beautifully put together. Our stay was comfortable and everything we needed. Thank you for the wonderful time there 🙏🏽"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Faulkner House was a pleasure to stay at for our weeklong visit in and around Keene. The apartment was clean, warm and generous in size. Mattresses are firm, yet we slept comfortably. The location is perfect, a short walk to all the shops, restaurants, coffee and nightlife of downtown Keene. Please note the washer/dryer are not in the unit, but in a shared laundry space with other apartments. We had a wonderful stay and highly recommend The Faulkner House for comfort and location."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Patty’s place is wonderful and the location can’t be beaten!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, clean and cozy"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti’s place was exceptionally beautiful and spacious. We needed some time to decompress after working tirelessly for weeks and this was it. The town of Keene is also very cute and the abundance choices of restaurants was perfect. I would highly recommend booking her place!
Cheers,
Akhi"
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location about three minutes’ walk from downtown Keene. Check in was a breeze and the house was clean. The house is 1910 meets 1980s updates, with some holdover appliance colors from the 60s, and the art that vies for wall space will have you skipping from Picasso to Abe Lincoln to Japanese ducks. This all comes together in a crazy clash that means you’ll have something to look at everywhere you go. 😁 If you’re into ghosts, you’ll find a quiet presence to sit with in the south bedroom. Thanks for the stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great for exploring all that Keene has to offer. The convenience of checking in is a bonus. The flat is comfortable, the kitchen fully stocked for cooking."
2022-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very lovely place and well priced. The only thing we had an issue with was the beds. There is a foldout couch for the third bed but it's quite small. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay with Patti in Keene. The apartment was exactly as pictured and had an antique colonial vibe to it
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Patti was very helpful and responsive. I had to come up early because of a snowstorm and she let me in early. The location is great and walkable to downtown.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was amazing, super close to everything and super comfortable. I had to extend my stay by a day and Patti was super responsive and I was able to enjoy the home for an extra day. I hope I'll be able to stay here again when I come back to visit."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to stay
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, roomy, comfortable, and clean, would recommend this place to anyone"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would definitely stay here again. The unit was spotless, quiet and the location is perfect, just steps from Keene’s vibrant downtown."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed staying at Patti's place. Very spacious apartment near Keene center.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place
Host is really cool and very quick to response"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay! The location is perfect with easy walking to everything in downtown Keene. The Suite is charming, well-decorated (without tons of clutter that we often find) and clean!! The host was responsive and available to answer questions— even on Christmas morning. We’ll definitely consider renting this place again on a future trip to Keene. Thanks so much for making this special place available!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of the apartment is nice enough, but the outside is suffering from some neglect. I think the most important thing at an Airbnb are the beds, and these were not great. Nor were the pillows. The kitchen could have used some better supplies as there weren’t even 2 regular wine glasses. The location was good and we walked pretty much everywhere in Keene. If memory serves, the door will automatically lock, so do NOT shut it unless you have the key.
Bedding and kitchen upgrades would have bumped up my rating."

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is clean and awesome location to go down town or hike !
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti’s place is lovely, comfortable, pleasingly decorated with antiques and reproductions. As others mention, the outside needs some paint, but the inside is well-maintained. The linens were nice, and all of the rooms are well sized. Something you can’t tell from the pictures is that the entrance truly is private. The doors on the ground floor that once opened to the first floor rooms are completely sealed off, so it feels private and safe during Covid. The front patio would be a great place to sit on a warm day. It’s located on a prime street with many classic houses. It felt like a treat to stay there. I’m always happy when an Airbnb includes a library of books, and this one does."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a perfect place! Beautiful touches, warm, and stylish. Very spacious and a great stay."

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was spacious, comfortable and very convenient. This 2nd floor apartment in a charming historic home provided a comfortable home base as we explored Keene. We felt that it was very clean and met our expectations for COVID-19 sanitation. We did quite a bit of cooking, and found the kitchen to be adequate. There were a few staples stocked in the kitchen. The apartment is located well for walking downtown. Parking was also convenient. The only downside is that it is an older building, which looks like it could use some exterior maintenance; however that did not interfere with the quality of our stay. We would definitely recommend Patti's place."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space was much bigger than expected and checkin was easy. Everything we needed was provided and so close (walk-able) to main street. There was a bonus private parking space just out back too. Can't wait to return to Keene now that we know this place exists.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti’s place was wonderful! We were looking for a weekend getaway and settled on Keene because we had never visited there before and the apartment looked nice. We were not disappointed! Keene is charming with the town center a short 3-minute walk from Patti’s place. The apartment itself was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Really, it’s the entire second floor of a lovely house with a private entrance. The pictures accurately depict the space. We would definitely return."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti’s spacious apartment is conveniently located within walking distance of Keene’s Central Square, which includes restaurants, shops, a church and movie/events theater. The Phineas Handerson House appears to be historic, with various additions to the property, which is currently divided into 5 apartments. Her place is accessed by going up a few steps at the front of the building, through her own private entrance foyer and up rather steep carpeted stairs to the second floor. The apartment is chicly furnished with antiques and interesting pieces with tasteful eclectic art and prints on the walls. Patti is a gracious host who provides a variety of thoughtful amenities (grab bar in tub/shower, wall magnifying mirror and counter top mirror in bath, good towels and bedding, an extensive book/reading collection, basic kitchen supplies and equipment and plentiful paper goods to name a few). Bedrooms are large and beds comfortable. Patti provided good communication. Free daytime parking on the street in front made unloading and repacking easy. Specific overnight parking spaces are available to guests directly behind the property. We enjoyed our brief stay in cozy comfort while exploring a bit of Keene and sampling some great food (Thai Garden, The Stage Restaurant, Luca’s Mediterranean) and would happily choose this airbnb for a future visit!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti's place was clean and appointed with all the basics for a couple of days exploring Keene, NH.

The house had an interesting, historic charm and I would definitely stay again!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great large space in a great location at Keene’s center.
We spent 3 nights in this beautiful 2 bedrooms and living room apartment. It has a separate part in a period house.
It was wonderful to find that Patti stocked the kitchen with some goodies for us.
The space was large and comfortable with parking space in the back. Short walk to great coffee places and many options to eat.
I Highly recommend to talk a walk to see the many new murals that are located near by.
We drove 10 minutes to Surry Lake - it’s free and almost a private spot.
Now we need to plan our next stay at Patti’s during the Fall!"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice comfortable space within spitting distance of downtown.
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was nice, comfortable and safe. I would say the location was the best part-you are only a short 5-10 minute walk from downtown! There was what appeared to be leftover food on the kitchen counter from a previous visitor and a broken hair dryer, but Patti took note of this and apologized for any inconvenience. Overall, I would stay here again."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Phineas Handerson House was the perfect accommodations for graduation weekend. The location is ideal as you can easily walk to town for access to restaurants, bars, shops and campus. The accommodations were clean with plenty of room to be comfortable and just relax when we needed some down time, hang out and sleep. Out host, Patti, did a great job communicating with us leading up to the weekend, checking in and responded quickly to any questions we had and was very accommodating with any special requests that we had. I wish we had discovered the Phineas Handerson House four years ago when our son was a freshmen. All in all, it was simply a great place to stay for a terrific weekend!"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti is a wonderful host. The house interesting, clean, and welcoming touches. Loved going through the old books in the living room. The breakfast food, snacks and coffee she left was so convenient and good. We didn’t have to rush out and buy groceries right away. Walking distance to downtown was great. Will definitely stay there again if we get back to Keene."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location-a five minute stroll to the heart of Keene. Lots of room, a fully functioning kitchen, a parking spot available. Pretty awesome to be in an antique house. It was clean (impeccably), and comfortable and welcoming. I would stay here again."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful space. There are two real beds in private bedrooms. There is plenty of living space.

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming old home which is just a couple of blocks away from Keene’s downtown area. You can walk to any one of the many coffee shops, restaurants or shops downtown. Patti offered great suggestions for places to try and they did not disappoint. The accommodations were very comfortable, two bedrooms with queen sized beds, a family room with cable tv, and an eat-in kitchen. All are located on the second floor of a two family house which provides plenty of room and privacy. There were many little personal touches which were a nice surprise. Patti was very friendly and easy to coordinate plans with. If you are looking to visit the Keene area, this would be a lovely place to stay."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice clean space convenient to everything Keene has to offer. Check-in was a breeze. Would def stay again.
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our 4-night stay at The Phineas Handerson House over the Christmas holidays. We were already familiar with Keene, having visited the area many times in the past, but we had never stayed in an AirBNB. The house is within walking distance to downtown and has a convenient parking area behind it off a side street.
The photos of the accommodations are accurate. There is ample space to move around in all of the rooms. There were only three of us, but it would have been just as comfortable for four people. (We did not test the sofa bed in the TV/sitting room, so I cannot vouch for or against it.)
The linens and pillows on the beds were very inviting and the mattresses were comfortable for sleeping. The towels in the bathroom were plush and cozy. The shower is quite high, which would be great for tall people, and there is a long, deep bathtub, which seemed like it would be ideal to soak in.
The kitchen was well stocked with plenty of glasses, dishes, silverware and cookware, as well as a coffee maker, a toaster, a microwave and a full size refrigerator. There was even a dishwasher, although we didn't use it.
The wi-fi access was secure, strong and simple to connect to. The rooms were very clean and all of the amenities were quite useful to us during our visit. We would not hesitate to stay here again in the future."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient, comfortable, and quiet space"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A jewel for a stay! Clean, quaint, and convenient."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found the place very easily, as it was on a main road. The instructions on where our place was was spot on as well as instructions to get to our apt in the building. The place was immaculate and just as described, and Shane even provided some snacks and waters. I would stay at the house again most definately, but would pick a different apt at the house/location. The only reason for this is our apt was at the front of the house on a main road that seems to be on a truck route, so it did get a little loud sometimes with the passing traffic. This is not a reflection on the host or the cleanliness and coziness of the apt."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Clean, comfortable and inviting. Shane was very responsive!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I very much enjoyed my stay at The Murdock Suite, located in the big house. The house was well maintained and very clean. There is ample space for six people. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking, which I did take advantage of.
Plenty of towels in the bathroom, which were the big thick kind to dry off with. The shower had plenty of hot water and was easy to get of. The beds were super comfortable and the pillows were great to bury your head in.
the only drawback, is , if you're not used to traffic this might be loud to you. The house is adjacent to a heavily used road during the day, it does get quiet at night, but you can hear them up until around 900 PM.
Other than that , the house is defiantly worth staying at. The shared patio has tables and a gas stove to cook, with plenty of room, for a feast. The downtown area is a stone throw away, and worth a trip.
I enjoyed this Airbnb stay and would stay here again !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved the place! When we couldn’t find the remote to the TV, Shane’s wife was kind enough to bring another one by!
I have to apologize though because I accidentally took two of the kitchen wash rags! I will throw them in the mail or drop them by when I’m in Keene again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was a perfect place to land while in town! It was peaceful and spotless. I love the decor. Furniture is super comfortable and the space is really bright and just lovely! It was also spotless!! No complaints! It was close to perfect for my needs!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A fantastic place to stay and would come back again if get the chance to again. Big, spacious, comfy and such a complete kitchen, felt like being in a lovely warm house more than being in a hotel. really loved it. Big fridge, comfy beds, extra blankets, soft pillows, well stocked bathroom, lovely and clean. The only thing I wish it had….. I’m short… so the shower head was so high up!!! Wish it had a shower that was height adjustable- but that’s me being a shortie not anything to do with the accommodation. Fast internet- great contact, clear instructions, def a 5 star stay. Well done Shane on offering such a lovely place for visitors- thank you so much for being so excellent ❤️❤️"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a little less than a week and the space was just perfect for what we needed. It felt homey but not cluttered. Everything was spotless and aesthetically pleasing. We worked remotely and the wifi was strong enough to support two video conferences simultaneously. The space was equipped with anything we needed and it turned the experience from being average to above average! Thank you, Shane for the lovely space and communication!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great older but updated house. Perfect for our busy 10 month old as the house was simple and clean. Lots of linens and well-equipped kitchen. Right across the street from a Dunkin and easy access to other amenities.

The room was beautiful! Huge comfortable bed, super soft linens, great bathroom amenities as well. If you’re someone who loves baths but doesn’t have one at home, make use of the bathtub and bring some bath bombs :) good water pressure, nice and hot too.
Walls were a bit thin, but nothing that detracted from the stay. I just used a white noise machine and that did the trick.
I felt secure with the multiple locked points of entry. Keene is super walkable, and this location was perfect, as it is steps from downtown!
Highly recommend!"

Two of the three ceilings bulbs were out. Stairs to second floor not deep enough (undoubtedly due to extra high ceilings) and were difficult to manage. Would ask for first floor next time."

Next, the check-in process was simple but if you book rooms 7 or 8 be aware that the steps leading to those rooms are very steep! It takes a little bit of maneuvering to get your luggage up. But it’s certainly not a deal breaker. Lastly, the home has great historic character and thoughtful details like coffee and bottled water. The location is perfect. We will definitely stay here again!!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Burrell house. We stayed in the Granite Room, which was charming. The bed was both very large and comfortable. We liked learning about the history of the house. The renovation of the house is wonderful."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We travel to Keene often to see friends and former coworkers, and typically put up with the cookie-cutter hotels that are obscenely overpriced. We were so thrilled when we found The Burrell House.
First, the spaces are so charming and comfortable. The two rooms we ended up utilizing were clean, spacious, and had their own A/C window units that cooled the space down remarkably well on such hot and humid days.
Second, you can tell Josh takes great pride in his property, and maintains it meticulously, inside and out. The attention to detail was amazing, from the lavender-scented bags in the bathroom and bedroom, to the retro appliances in each room, and the thoughtful amenities provided (a little tray of ice made for us in the freezer when we arrived, a full trash can instead of those dinky little ones, etc.). The rooms are beautiful and have so much character, and everything inside feels purposeful and perfectly in place.
Lastly, you cannot beat the service. We ended up extending our stay and requiring some specific accommodations in order to get ready for our engagement photos. Josh was responsive, professional, and so helpful. We messaged via AirBnB, he called with updates and answers to our questions/needs, and when we ran into him in person, he was very personable. He even suggested a way to save us a few dollars when we needed to extend our stay.
Long story short, we spent three nights for around what one would have been in a hotel on Main Street, and enjoyed it immeasurably more. Better price, quality, and service for a great location that's historic and beautiful. We don't have enough good things to say about The Burrell House and its employees."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Burrell House was perfect for our few days away. We liked how we could get up and walk into town whenever The room was very nicely decorated and clean, with a nice supply of towels. The added Keurig with kcups was a nice addition for that morning cup of coffee we enjoy having without having to go anywhere. Microwave and small fridge were great to have too."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay! Huge, spacious room with all the amenities we needed. Close to downtown- we walked almost everywhere! Josh communicated quickly throughout the whole process and had wonderful suggestions and information for our stay."

Their were a few appliances, like a crock pot, in the kitchen for longer stays. A drip coffee maker is there along with a flavored coffee and a dark roast.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This Airbnb is one of the only few places that offer what the early stage of Airbnb host use to offer.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Vivianne is a great host, all of the little touches are so thoughtful. The space is great and centrally located. I do not drive, so the location was great, 7 min walk to downtown. Communication was excellent, and our chats, usually in the morning, were always pleasant. Vivianne is a music teacher, so I took advantage and booked Uke Lessons with her. All things considered, this is one of the best Airbnbs I have stayed at!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This Airbnb was cozy and in the best location for the downtown restaurants, shots and surrounding outdoor activities near Keene. Vivianne was an excellent host!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Vivianne's private apartment was just what we needed for a quick stay, after a long day of driving. There were lots of little touches - like beer and chocolate! - that were there for the taking, and unfortunately our time was too limited to enjoy it all. We got a great night sleep and would definitely book here again when in Keene and unable to stay with family."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"10/10 would recommend this place! Cozy bedroom space, exceptionally clean bathroom and kitchenette, and very private and quiet throughout the duration of our stay.

The kitchenette was spotless and there was ample dresser and closet space for my things. The hostess was there when I arrived and, because she lives downstairs, was very available and friendly.
A place to re-visit when in town next!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 2nd stay at a location, hosted by Patti. Very comfortable and clean.
Definitely a historic house... steep stairs to enter and squeaky floors. Slept comfortable and loved walking to Main street for dinner. Would stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I love staying at this house! Perfect space for a weekend getaway. Such a quaint and quiet place. Patti is the best host!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely felt at home for this quaint, retro as depicted apartment, as it was perfect for my needs of that being a ""travel nurse working in VT. I was hoping to rent this out for the duration of my contract, however, the monthly rate to include the discount is more than a bit beyond my reasonable price range, considering I am a NH homeowner as well. Aside from that, I adore this apartment, the location, the convenience, the decor as no doubt, 5 stars to meet my needs that of being a super cute, cozy apartment to relax after a long 12 hour shift while on a 3 day stretch!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place. Easy walk to downtown.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location. Quirky, fun place."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The apartment we had was upstairs. This was good walking distance to downtown. Quiet from downtown. Parking is close by. Cute simple clean apartment.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I really enjoyed my time in Keene at Lynda’s Suite. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The area was lovely and I felt safe. It was a real bonus that my dog Daisy was able to join me. My favorite part was that it was such a short walking distance to Main Street, which is really terrific. Such a great variety; shops, food, and entertainment. And everyone that I met was quite friendly. Would definitely stay again. The only thing I would point out is that there are stairs that might be difficult for someone that has physical limitations."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely apartment a 6 minute walk from downtown Keene! The place was clean, spacious, and very well-decorated. Would absolutely stay here again! The host was responsive to questions and helpful. Please note that the bed is on the firm side - this is my preference but in case that is relevant info."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A nice spot for a quick trip to Keene! In walking distance of shops and restaurants downtown. Just what we were looking for!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We didn’t see a house number at first we were about to turn around on Union Street and realized that was the way to where Patti said to park behind the house. Easy access to locate key and get inside. Although we knew about the steep stairs, as seniors they are not our friends and will look for first floor units in the futures. We did appreciate the cleanliness of the apartment and the convenient location, close to quaint town of Keene. We would stay at another of Patti’s places."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super great spot. Comfortable, clean and convenient."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti’s place was in the perfect location, it was great to be within walking distance from downtown."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Have stayed here few times and recommend this ABB to friends and family
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I stayed here to attend a family wedding and visiting with relatives. The apartment was perfect. A quite space to take a break from the chaos of visiting with family 🤣 The apartment was equipped with everything we needed for our stay. The location was great for us! Literally less than 10 minutes away from everywhere we went. I would absolutely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here! Super clean & uniquely decorated. Had all the amenities I needed & more than enough space for myself + just a few min walk to downtown. Patti gave helpful, detailed instructions for parking and check-in. Would 100% recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Adorable unit with amazing art that I know has personal meaning to Patti’s family. Lovely original wood floors in living room, hallway, and bedroom; great character everywhere. Kitchen setup makes fantastic use of a smaller space and is very well-stocked. Window air conditioners worked great. Patti and crew were very responsive and helpful at all times. This is a great value for the price. This is not a criticism, as it is well-documented in the property description, but the stairs are quite steep and not easy to navigate with larger luggage, so it would be wise to pack two or three smaller bags than one large one. Many thanks, Patti!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean and takes dogs. Those don’t usually go together. Plus great value for the location (a few blocks from downtown). There is also a largish park nearby to walk dogs - it runs a few miles alongside the river. It’s not fancy- basic and simple, but with amenities such as shampoo, coffee, spices. The price is exactly right for what the space offers."
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"There were pros and cons to this place.
Pros: it was very clean and the A/C units kept it nice and cool, even in July. The location was perfect, only a 5-minute walk to the square in Keene. And there were 4 pillows on the bed, each a different kind and ranging from firm to soft, so you could pick which worked best for you.
Cons: the Wi-Fi kept going in and out, the mattress was very firm and not all that comfortable, the couch didn’t have any throw pillows or anything so it wasn’t comfortable to lounge on, there were ants in the kitchen, and there was no floor-length mirror, or any mirror that showed more than my head and shoulders. I couldn’t see any outfit I put on until I got into town and saw my reflection in a storefront window.
All in all, this place probably would have been fine for a night or two, but I was there for a week, and it wasn’t comfortable enough for that long."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely small apartment in an old home close to everything in Keene. The remodeled apartment was
spotless and comfy. Patti's communication was helpful and timely. Great weekend away for us. We loved our stay. Do not hesitate to stay here."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great quick stay at ""Lynda's Place"" in the Handerson House. Patti was a great host and I didn't run into any issues.
The space was much bigger than I needed just a solo traveler but the extra space felt nice and comfy.
I liked all the eclectic art and historic posters that she has decorated the place with."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Travel RN here. Perfect 1 bedroom apt close to Cheshire hospital. Clean, affordable, and centrally located. I would def. recommend! Great stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! We had 3 people stay and it was total spacious! It’s about a 2 min walk from down town keene where there is plenty to do! And it’s far enough from downtown where it’s peacefully quiet. The place was very clean and felt very home! 10/10 would highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place has everything you need for a comfortable and convenient stay in Keene and was very clean! Easy to find and has all the essentials. The bed/pillows/linens were also quite comfortable.
The only thing I'd note is the unit is on the 2nd floor and the stairs are a bit steep and narrow so if you're someone who can't climb stairs well, it may be a challenge. It appears she has other units on the ground level, though!
All in all a wonderful stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a weekend getaway! Great location to Keene’s downtown area. Patti was a great host, super responsive, and provides all the essentials!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We have had an employee staying at the property for a month and really enjoyed it. We try to use this host and one of their multiple properties every trip to the area. Patti is a wonderful communicator and even jumped in and helped us when an employee misplaced a key. 10/10 recommend all of these properties.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My first week there was fine, I became ill and had to leave early, so can't report on the second week. Patti was very responsive to questions about the heating during two very frigid days and a repair to the door. Bed is comfortable. Keene is a lovely town, very friendly."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was clean, warm, and welcoming. The location is great and parking was convenient. Everything was great!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay! We did a long term stay for work and it was perfect. We worked night shift so most days sleeping was good and quiet. Very light in the bedroom so bring sleep mask! Walkable to down town, restaurants, and other things Keene has to offer. We always felt safe and in a good location. The place was probably the cleanest Airbnb I have ever been in! This is something I am really picky about and went above and beyond my expectations for cleanliness. Parking is tight but manageable! Overall great place to rent! Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would highly recommend this property. It was clean, comfortable and the location was within walking distance to town."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely apartment with all the conveniences. The bed and pillows were perfect. Nicely decorated and in a location convenient to town. Steps up to 2nd floor are a bit steep and awkward for carrying up heavy luggage, but once in the apartment everything is well situated."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We truly enjoyed our stay and will be back again or at least book another one of Patti's properties in the future. This one was super clean, updated and quite comfortable. We were super impressed as well with the communication when we had a question...fast!! All in all we highly recommend this AirBnb. Also, the location was within walking distance to downtown Keene. A huge benefit!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really found the perfect place for me. Clean relaxing and close to downtown. Easy in and out and Patty was a fantastic host. No hassles and description was spot on. Definitely be staying here again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space is great! The location is wonderful; nice and quiet but still very close to everything on Main Street! Super easy to find and check-in.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So close to downtown shops, restaurants and great coffee. Clean and convenient - we enjoyed our stay with Patti."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great stay. The location was perfect and the place had everything I needed. Patti gave great instructions so check and check out were very easy. I would definitely stay again
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super comfy, enjoyed very much."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a very nice place in a good, quiet neighborhood near downtown (walking distance). The apartment was clean when we got there and check in was easy. There's a parking lot in the back that you can park in so that's great, especially when we came back late to the apartment from working and there was still a space to park. The laundry is included, it's a dryer and washer and there's laundry supplies as well if you forget anything so that's nice too. The number one thing for us was being able to telework and we were able to do that, just connected our ethernet cables and good to go. So anyone can easily telework here. There's a place called Country life vegetarian that was delicious (open Mon-Thur, 11am-3pm) they make their own vegan food (pizza is on Wednesday, don't miss it!) and have other things to buy (body care supplies, healthy food ingredients, etc.), Farm Cafe was good too, their deserts were delicious (try the cookies!), also Archway Farm is a farmstand (self serve store) that has farm meat,seafood, bread, etc. (depending on the day) and yummy healthy homemade popsicles and the monadnock food co-op grocery store has a lot of options and you can order food & smoothies. We went to Robin hood park (near downtown) for just a few minutes but it has good walking trails, children's playground and a pretty pond to look at if you don't feel like walking. The host Patti was very helpful, easy to approach, answered all my questions and so pleasant to speak with. Overall this was a great stay and if I could I would stay here again. Thanks Patti!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lynda's apartment is a fantastic space with everything you might need....and more. I am especially grateful for the great communication because when I arrived after a long drive, I was trying to unlock the WRONG key box! When I messaged Patti, she answered right away so I wasn't left sitting on the front step. The location is great and I will look for one of Patti's places to rent the next time I am visiting relatives in NH without a doubt!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This is a comfy unit. It’s walking distance from Keene downtown with restaurants, Monadnock co-op and a fun sweet shop. Patti responded immediately if I had a question or a need. The stairs to this unit are steep but I did not find them to be a problem."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space in a great location, just minutes from the downtown Keene. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My friend and I stayed three weeks during a training and couldn't say enough good things about this apartment. Patti got in touch immediately upon arrival to check we had everything we needed and immediately responded when I wrote to ask a question. There's a bedroom with a bed and a pullout couch which was decently comfortable. There was coffee, nearly every coffee maker you could hope for, great kitchen utensils, spare bathroom essentials if you forgot something, ac for those hot summer nights, super safe parking and my list could go on. We will definitely rent from Patti again!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Patti's apartment was spotless and incredibly comfortable. The location is perfect, we had a great weekend , check-in, parking everything was easy and awesome!
Tim"
2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great place to stay as a single or couple. Location is perfect, very clean, laundry was handy, etc. Unfortunately, we had an infant and the insanely creaky floors and doors woke him up so many times. It also says that the bedroom has a queen but it seemed more like a double (I could be wrong but we have one at home and my partner had to sleep on the couch while I took the bed with my son). Whatever size bed it was, it felt like sleeping on a a wooden plank and I'm still hurting from it."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Patti’s place was great. Close to town, convenient."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cutest apartment in an amazing location!! My boyfriend and I were looking for a weekend get away and this was perfect.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean & comfortable, & sooo convenient! We had everything we needed. If you like a firm mattress, then this bed is for you. It was a fun experience to ""live"" temporarily in an historic home."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great accomodations! Accurately described.
2021-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The location of Patti's apartment is very convenient to the center of Keene. However the bed is uncomfortable to sleep on, I pulled my back out the first night and my husband and I hardly got any sleep due to it. For the remainder of the time we stayed in Keene my husband slept on the couch hoping we would finally get some sleep, it was still uncomfortable because you can feel the springs of the mattress. Would recommend upgrading the bed frame/mattress. Please note that the stairs leading up to the apartment are steep."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Would recommend.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will definitely be back!!!!

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was very close to downtown (3 min drive) and Mt Monadnock (30 min drive) which was exactly what we were looking for. The place was pretty comfortable and VERY clean, which we definitely appreciated. Patti gave us very clear directions about how to find/work everything."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lydia’s Suite was exactly how it was described. Great location, cute and immaculately clean apartment, and had everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay here again."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed in multiple units in this house and they are all fantastic and Patti is a great host. You cannot beat the location and proximity to town. We’ll be back soon!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was very clean and we had everything we needed. Thank you so much Patti. You made our stay that much more pleasurable. We will definitely be back.
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying at the apartment and it was a great location for us in accessing the town and for me, the university close by which I walked to. Apartment is in an older building but the apartment has nice renovations and a cool vibe to the art and decor inside. Quiet area which is also nice. The kitchen was lacking some things which may have been due to previous renters taking items- no full set of eating utensils, no frying pan or toaster which is what most living spaces have. It did meet most of our basic needs though. The bed in the apartment was uncomfortable and left us with sore backs. The sofa was more comfortable. Overall, it was a nice stay and Patti is very responsive. We would consider renting again."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location that looks exactly like the pictures! Patti is very responsive and the check-in process was a breeze.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! Very comfortable and convenient. If you want to visit Keene this is a fantastic choice!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is great. It's in downtown and at walking distance from different key areas of the town. The house does not look great outside and may not look well maintained (the roof seems in bad shape) but the appartment is clean, well maintained and nicely furnished and decorated. The bed is confortable. But neighbours can be noisy and we are extremly close to each others."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Close to downtown, nicely updated apartment, very clean, and air conditioned. This was especially welcomed the week I was in Keene as daily temperatures were always close to 90! It is a second floor so be sure you can do stairs."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had a very nice stay here. everything is renovated and you can tell the host put a lot of work into this apt. our stay was nice and the location was good. only complaint was the $100 cleaning fee for an apt. that is so tiny. might be worth it for a weeks stay, but it's more than a nights stay. something to consider when booking."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Patti has created a cozy place that is truly spacious with great light! We enjoyed our stay and the convenience of being in the center of shops, restaurants, and activities without all the noise — a real gem! We'll be back!"

The apartment is furnished with everything you need for a short or long stay, and I recommend it to anyone exploring the northeast!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a much needed get away. Patti's location was perfect. We needed a safe space for time away from home during these difficult times, in this short time a beautiful, clean, and welcoming space was provided. We cannot recommend this place enough. Keene is awesome, the Co-Op is outstanding, community is kind. It's a central location. Book this place ASAP."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little spot for a quick trip to Keene. Very clean and comfortable. We really liked having access to a kitchen and the bathroom was nice. The pillows on the bed were are only complaint but it’s just because we don’t like soft pillows.

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love staying at Patti's place and would definitely stay there again in the future! The apartment is spotlessly clean, spacious, and had everything I needed. I especially appreciated the extra towels and blankets, and nice shampoo and soap in the bathroom. It is a very short walking distance from downtown Keene, in a great location. I would easily stay here again and recommend it highly!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pattis place was amazing!! Not only was it within walking distance of downtown, it was far enough that traffic noise did not interrupt sleep. The place was nicely decorated and Patti was really good at getting back to all of the questions I had prior to the stay and while we were there. The best part was that she was willing to accommodate our tiny dog. Definitely will be staying at one of Pattis places again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful chic spot in a perfect location to enjoy downtown Keene in the fall. Patti was super amenable with our check in and check out times. Is recommend this spot to all in the airbnb community.

It is very close to downtown just like a 5 min walk which is a great place with great places to eat. My fav is Fritzs the best fries ever! Patti was a great host who even refunded some of my money due to the stove not working while we were there. We really enjoyed our stay! Thank you again Patti!"
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy location with parking, and host responded immediately when the stove shorted out and she helped us figure out how to reset the breakers. Bed was great, cable tv was awesome, and other than a few tiny issues, it was a great space. Super tiny issues: only one plug in the bedroom means we both couldnt charge our phones at night at the same time in the bedroom, only one plug also means the a/c has to face the bed directly which sucked; and we're a bit sensitive to smells so the glade plug-ins all over the apt were a little overwhelming so we unplugged them all during our stay (we recognize this isnt an issue for most people). overall, enjoyed our stay and it was bigger, cleaner, and nicer than anything else we saw in the area."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot! Extremely accommodating host. Highly recommend!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Patti's airbnb in Keene NH was great!

2020-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was certainly very clean and the kitchen/bedroom are quite nice. It was a little hot, the AC is ok but if you want fresh air the windows are older and only a few open well. You also might want to bring some more dishware such as pots and pans as the plates and bowls are melamine, so bringing paper disposable is a good idea if you're wary of that kind of thing. And don't leave slightly late it gets in the way of the next cleaning. Hope you have fun in NH!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice space in the heart of Keene. Comfortable and roomy for two. Very clean.

2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Located right in the middle of town, just off the square, this little apt could not be more convenient. Let’s see: clean, neat, crisp, easily accessible, parking, great directions. Perhaps the stairs are a tiny bit steep. But honestly, I would stay again any time. Patti is right there to answer should you need anything. And pet friendly. That’s a huge plus ❤️"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The location was perfect for the 5 days I was in Keene and I will be looking to stay there again when I return.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The suite was in a great location, close to downtown and bike trails, in a nice neighborhood. The layout of the rooms was also great. I appreciated the snacks and oatmeal and coffee and tea. It just needs a little more thorough cleaning to be ideal. Overall I really appreciated staying here."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Padma was an excellent and thoughtful host. I arrived on a hot day and the suite had been cooled down for me in advance. I’d received very clear instructions and was perfectly comfortable throughout my stay.

Enjoyed a morning hike around the lake at the park.
A quick drive to Main Street restaurants,
And a perfect base camp for our stay in Keene"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Padma’s place. The location was exquisite and convenient, the space was quite bigger than we expected and well equipped. Snacks were a wonderful surprise too. We cannot recommend enough staying here since Keene is a nice town with a lot to offer. Thanks again Padma!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had another great stay. It’s very comfortable and peaceful at Parma’s space. We have stayed here three times and the convenience and hosts make it an easy choice for the Keene area!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a large, lovely apartment for someone who can do without a kitchen--although there is a little kitchen table in the living-dining room, and a microwave and coffee and tea and a cabinet with dishware--and lots of little treats. This room and the bedroom are quite spacious and simply and tastefully decorated. The bathroom is a decent size, too, and it and the rest of the house have an amazing amount of storage, should you need that. Beautiful old house with wide floorboards--that somehow don't creak at all underfoot. Nice sofa with lamps on both ends--and the bed has the same, which, as avid readers, we greatly appreciated. We felt very much at home in this house and will absolutely stay there again when we're in the area. One warning: the steps up to the apartment are steep and the treadles are not very deep, so you need to take your time going up and down."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay in Keene! Very welcoming and had everything that my wife and I needed for our weekend stay. We’ll definitely look to come back next time we visit.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent little spot, very comfy and well supplied."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very adorable, quintessential New England style. My husband and I loved our stay here. It was very comfortable, and we felt right at home. It was super clean! The location is also great as it is close enough to downtown keene that it is walkable but tucked away for some peace and quiet. There are 2 rooms (one bedroom and 1 with a sofa bed) and there is a breakfast nook in the other room where the host generously provides all sorts of coffee, teas and snacks. The place had everything one would need. The checkout was super easy. Totally recommend! We would stay here again!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice New England setting. Two Private rooms upstairs. Wide pine floors and nice carpets. A pretty large living room space with coffee area at one end. And a nice bedroom. I’d stay here again. Felt like home.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming, cozy little one bedroom with an ""attic apartment"" type of feel. The steps are a little narrow and steep, might not be for an older guest or one with some mobility issues. The bathroom is spacious. I wasn't clear how many other units might be in the house, and whether guests were staying there, so I was a little hesitant to do my morning exercise routine on the older wood floors, not wanting to wake someone up early in the morning. I did it very quietly. There is a cute little kitchen area with a microwave and generous snacks, but a little dish detergent, kithen towel, and sponge for the bathroom sink might have helped for washing tea cups, spoons, and bowls. Overall I felt very comfortable there, and appreciate the super clean bathroom. Not too fancy, but just enough and just right!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little place. Very clean and accommodating. Will definitely be recommending to other Antioch students.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment is lovely with many wonderful snacks and touches to make it feel like home. Thank you!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute and extremely clean. The bed is super comfortable. No kitchen but there is a microwave and coffee maker. Great place to stay!

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and spacious. Super comfortable bed, slept like a champ! Be aware stairs to place very steep and narrow so not good if you have mobility issues."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure to stay at Padma’s home. Her instructions for checking in were clear and thorough. This made our check in process very easy after a later than expected arrival. We were excited to see the nightlife attractions just five minutes down the road. The location is just a few minutes away from several stores while also being tucked away in a quiet area. The upstairs apartment was tidy and tremendously comfortable. Padma’s home was stocked with complimentary snacks and kitchen supplies. These came in handy and mirrored the convenience of a hotel room, lacking a kitchen but well equipped with coffee, tea, a microwave, coffee maker and electric kettle. We hope to visit NH again soon. Thank you for the wonderful accommodations!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Definitely recommend! Very close to downtown and about a 30 minute drive to Mount Monadnock.
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for the training I was attending. It's also not far from town and a local park. We enjoyed our time there, but do think it would be best for short stays vs. the 7 days we were there. With no way to cook or wash dishes, it made it a bit challenging (personally not fans of washing dishes in the bathroom, but I suppose you could). The bowl of treats/snacks as well as coffee, tea, and a pitcher of filtered water were very much appreciated upon arrival. There is no TV, which I guess I didn't notice in the listing, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Decks of cards or more games would have been helpful to pass the time in the evenings so recommend bringing your own. We ended up buying cards to keep us busy.
It was relatively quiet and the bed was comfy. No problems sleeping for us! It is a lovely space to use as a home-base for exploring the area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All good
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely and charming! The suite had everything I needed and was a great value, and Liane and Padma were so helpful and responsive Easy walk to downtown shops and restaurants. I highly recommend it!!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"if I ever need an Airbnb here again, this'll be my first choice."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The rooms were very comfortable, private, and quiet in the evening. Close to everything!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here a year ago and liked it a lot, and came back a 2nd time. We totally enjoy the place. It's very clean and well-equipped and everything works amd there are enough electrical outlets and so forth. The location is very close to downtown Keene but is very quiet and peaceful. It's not modern, like most hotel rooms, but we find that charming, and we recommend it highly for the right people."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very convenient, comfortable accommodation. Slept very well after a long day’s hiking. Appreciated the nice amenities. Thank you, Liane and Padma!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, comfortable, clean, and so relaxing."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The suite is spacious and cozy. The location is good for walking to the nearby park (about 5 - 10 minutes), downtown (20-30 minutes). Walks are very pleasant. Keene is full of classic New Hampshire architecture. The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Easy to walk places, quiet at night! Highly recommend."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and nice place. Hosts were excellent with communication making sure we had everything we needed.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is really an incredible find for those seeking to visit Keene. The price is right, and the location is perfect. The rooms are clean, open and comfortable. My favorite part is I don't feel like an interloper is someone else's home. I don't feel like I'm taking up space, and I am rarely aware of the fact I'm sharing the home with the owners. I highly recommend staying here even if you're just planning an overnight stay in the Monadnock area."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Padma’s space is gorgeous. So easy to get downtown—we walked both nights. The suite is so roomy and also cozy. She was so welcoming without being overbearing. Everything was wonderful. She went truly above and beyond—down to including coffee and yogurt for breakfast. I have absolutely nothing but good things to say about my stay.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Very cozy and very clean. Plenty of room. Private and comfortable. Great communication with hosts. Felt very safe here. Walked to town as well. Delicious snacks provided and good coffee! I loved the nice bathtub. I would recommend to anyone considering staying. I will be booking again in the future.

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t hesitate to book this spot, it was one of our best experiences with Airbnb. I appreciated having two separate rooms since I’m an early riser and my husband likes to sleep a little longer than I do. Having our own thermostat also was nice since we like things on the cooler side. Lots of thoughtful touches, snacks, drinks, yogurt, coffee, etc. feels like home, very charming and cozy. We never left to explore the town, so we will be back. A great place to unwind and take a break from life. Clean, quiet, comfortable bed. Perfect!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was out second stay, and what a lovely stay it was. My husband and I felt relieved to spend time in this quiet and cozy living space during the holiday excitement. As before, the mini fridge was stocked with a few treats; teas were provided as well as a Brita filter and an electric kettle. We had plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable. Every room was spotless and furnished- speaking of which a new mattress had been installed! We slept in perfect comfort and security. I highly recommend staying here should you need a place in Keene! Better than any local hotel as far as I've experienced."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, hugs the edge of town, and comfortable and welcoming environment for a very fair price. Would absolutely recommend!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cosy airbnb.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect stay for my husband and I. It has a private entrance and staircase that leads up to an adorable set of rooms on the second floor. There's more than enough space for two people. The rooms were CLEAN. I couldn't find a speck of dust or grime anywhere. The amenities left included coffee, a Keurig, and even yogurt in a mini fridge. The heat was easy to adjust for comfort, and the shower had plenty of soaps and shampoos. The bed was comfortable, even though it sank a smidge in the middle, and the dark curtains allowed us to either keep the room dark or let in the readily available natural light. It was also quiet, allowing us to recharge after a long day. The energy was great as well. We were both very comfortable in the old house, and hope to return in the future."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We chose to stay in Keene in order to have relatively easy access to Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts for the Fall foliage. We made a good choice as Padma’s place proved to be convenient for our journey. This is a good place if you want to enjoy quiet and peaceful surroundings while still being a 5 minute drive away from downtown Keene."

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space for us was great. The hosts very helpful and responsive. We would definitely return. (Stairs would be challenging for people with hip or knee issues.) A charming and comfortable space for us.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent spot for the quirky, random town that is Keene. I was here for a disc golf tournament/vacation, and the place suited me perfectly. It certainly has a lot of character - vintage and charming. The A/C units in each room were nice and bed was comfortable. I enjoyed the tub as well. No TV, so I brought my laptop and streamed Netflix/Amazon. I would stay here again if visiting Keene."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"The Cottage was a delightful, peaceful accommodation. I arrived at midnight and was welcomed into the cottage with no problems. I found the bed comfortable and the living room area charming. There was a coffee machine for fresh coffee. Plenty of towels and linen.
I would definitely stay there again. Hopefully, next year!
Thank you Padma"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Liane was our contact person and was very responsive , friendly and helpful. The apt was spacious, quiet and a great location to the Keene downtown area. The ONLY downside is if you want a meal in the apt., the kitchenette has no sink/running water, but this was not a deal-breaker for us. great accommodations, great hosts, great location!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was perfect for us and Liane was a great host. It was very comfortable, clean, and close to the place I had my meeting and the downtown area. It was so nice to have a separate living room. So much better than a hotel. I will stay here again next time I'm in town."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was excellent and the host was very accommodating and friendly.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great private space within walking distance to downtown.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a pleasant place to stay with easy access to town and easy access to a park that you can walk in. Literally the park is a 2 to 3 minute walk and downtown is a 5 to 10 minute walk. Everything is clean easy check in, quiet and a very enjoyable stay. I plan to stay here again if it’s available when I come back."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, well stocked and very tastefully decorated. The hostess communicated well, was unobtrusive and things were as described. The antiques, somewhat steep stairs and wide-planked floors give this a definite old (yet modern) New England feel.
At one point, in my head, I described the place as a bit quirky, but after visiting the home of friend in Keene, I realized that this place was Keene Quirky, which is almost exactly the reason for using AirBnB. This is an experience and not just a place to stay.
For us, it was a very pleasant experience."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a very nice stay, they were very communicative and accommodated my late arrival to the area. I would recommend this location for your stay in Keene, close to anything you need in the city."

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An affordable, comfortable, and spacious rental within walking distance of a lovely park and short driving distance from downtown Keene. The open and quick communication on the host's part additionally benefits the Airbnb experience."
,,,"Arrived to find two type written pages of rules for staying there. One stated there was no parking on the street or you would be ticketed, so I was told to park in the drive way which was one lane, and required that I leave my car keys in the hallway in case someone needed to move my car. Also, stated in her rules that she reserves the right to enter the apt when guest is not home to adjust the thermostat. There was only a slide lock on the apt door for security which was loose and difficult to use. I immediately packed up and left feeling very uncomfortable with the whole situation."
,,,Plz don’t come here was told to leave because I had a child and 2 family members stop by. I was in town for a funeral and had to pack up and leave with my child by 11 am the next morning and she claimed there was 100$ for a refund but was not there and have not got a refund
