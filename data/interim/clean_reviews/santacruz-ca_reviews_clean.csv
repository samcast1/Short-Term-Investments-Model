2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Omar was a great host! He was an excellent communicator and responsive when I reached out with questions. The house is lovely and clean, as well as a close walk to the beach. We definitely want to return to this wonderful location."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is the first time I've had to cancel a trip. Both my children were very sick and we kept hoping they would feel better. That said, I think it's worth sharing that Omar was very friendly and communicative. All his emails were clear and easy to understand. Perhaps we'll cross paths again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay. Thank you, Omar!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place. Just like the photos. Close to everything — restaurants, beach, etc. Private backyard. Would definitely stay again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The place is absolutely stunning, with a modern and spacious design. The kitchen surpasses our expectations, being more equipped than even our own. Omar, the host, consistently impressed us with his prompt responsiveness and proactive attitude."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, wonderful location!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Omar’s place for a long weekend. It was perfect for the two of us, had plenty of space, a nice green backyard, and pleasant front porch to enjoy the morning coffee, and very clean. Even though it’s close to a busy road, the bedroom is surprisingly quiet and road noise from the porch is faint. We would love to stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Omar’s house is great! It’s in an excellent location with a super short walk to the beach. The house is very clean and has literally everything you could need in the kitchen. They had some toys for kids and even board games. The beds are SUPER comfortable, I was worried about sharing a queen with my wife, but it ended up being super comfortable for both of us. We have a 1 year old and the only complaint is that the window coverings didn’t block any light at all, resulting in really bad baby sleep. We recommend bringing portable black out curtains if you need them. The master bedroom has sheer curtains as well if you’re a sensitive sleeper. Huge backyard space, gorgeous front yard and deck and beautiful garden! 10/10 recommend, we’d stay here again in a heart beat. Thank you for such a great vacation!"

There was a comprehensive house rules/info book that includes recommendations which was super helpful. Luckily for us, the hot tub worked and we got to hot tub in the rain, which is one of my all time favorite things to do. The house was immaculate, cozy and appropriately stalked with the essentials. Oh! And you can log on to the WiFi through the Airbnb app! Mind blown. I love technology."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This a great location that puts you in walking distance to the boardwalk, west cliff, and our favorite breakfast spot Cafe Brasil.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely adored our stay here! The cottage is beautiful and charming & sparkling clean! Had all the basic amenities and then some. The patio felt super private - we weren’t able to get the hot tub to warm up enough to use it, but it wasn’t a deal breaker for us.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ciara's place was wonderful! My wife and I booked this place to celebrate the 2nd half of our retirement vacation. Home is super well equipped and was just right for us. We used the hot tub every night as well as a few nights up front with the fire pit. Neighbors were all very friendly and the walk down to the pier was just right to stretch our legs each day. We followed Ciara's recommendation to visit arches state beach park and were not disappointed. There is a wonderful ""warehouse"" neighborhood on the north side of Santa Cruz that has wineries, breweries and great dining. It is right of Hwy 1 on the west side of road. Thank you Ciara for a wonderful stay!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. Place was cute and clean. It felt odd that there was no heating as our stay was in November and it got quite cool at night. Wish there was a washer dryer as well!

It is a nice place to stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a charming and comfortable getaway near UC Santa Cruz, (we came here for our son’s graduation), look no further than Mermaid Cottage. From the moment we arrived, we knew we were in for a relaxing stay. The self-check-in process was a breeze with the lockbox and easy to follow instructions from the host.
The atmosphere of the cottage was incredibly relaxing, and we particularly enjoyed the back deck. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed to prepare meals, and the coffee maker was a delightful bonus. While we brought our own favorite morning coffee, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the coffee maker could also grind coffee beans.
When we inquired about hosting our two sons who live in the area for lunch, the host Ciara promptly responded and allowed us to do so.
Overall, our experience at Mermaid Cottage was fantastic. It provided a comfortable and convenient base for our visit to UC Santa Cruz, and we appreciated the thoughtful amenities"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Very clean. Hot tub was a nice addition. Walkable to boardwalk and downtown
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures match what you get. The home is very clean. Ciara is very friendly and responsive. The home was located close to the boardwalk and to the restaurants we planned to visit. You can tell the owners really make an effort to make sure their guests have a great experience. The hot tub was a great perk!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very conveniently located near the ocean and downtown. It was quiet and I could concentrate on my work. The proximity to the ocean was great for surfing. The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need. Jacuzzi was perfect. It is also very private. I would return to see this adorable gorgeous home and Mermaid again.🧜‍♀️
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ciara was so helpful and everything was as expected. Location was super walkable to downtown yet in a pocket of Santa Cruz that felt very safe. Back deck area felt private and the house was spotless.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures matched the housing extremely well. Ciara’s is very helpful, and quick at responding. The kitchen was stocked with all the utensils I needed to cook. Will be staying here again soon!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Looks exactly as it does in pictures. Beautiful, clean, and cozy. When it comes to the decor, it is probably one of my favorite airbnb’s I have stayed at. So many beautiful details. Location is close to the boardwalk and downtown. Would definitely recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mermaid cottage gets ALL the stars.
Peaceful, clean, and full of amenities. We literally almost baked a cake, there were so many supplies and ingredients. But the beach called us…you know how it goes!
The home design and cleanliness was top notch. The plants made us feel good, like living in a beachside jungle bungalow. I definitely took notes for my future home design ;)
Place is great for a couple or small group. Cannot recommended enough and will be booking again when we hit up Santa Cruz again. Thanks Ciara"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and clean - thank you.
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I’d like to start out by saying Ciara is super sweet and I had no issues with her or the home, however I feel as though before you rent this home you need to know a few things… if you do decide to use their beautiful driveway to park The front of your house is free game. And teenager smoking pot to middle-aged men bumping rap music at 10:30 at night. You are right next to an a two-story apartment complex that is peering into the backyard. Going topless in the Jacuzzi is not an option. You have little to no privacy. Everybody’s windows are open. Everybody’s door is open. You can hear everyone’s arguments and farts, which means everyone can hear you and your farts. The bed in the master bedroom is so comfortable however my sisters twin mattress that folded into a queen was really uncomfortable for her. This home is super clean and has beautiful plants placed throughout the backyard."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, everything was within 5 min drive time. House was cute little cottage, very relaxing.. highly recommend this place! Communication was excellent."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice location and a responsive host. We did encounter a little mishap with the cleaning services when we arrived, however Ciara had the cleaning service called and fixed the problem within 30 minutes of us checking in. This location was close by everything that we planned on visiting, the boardwalk, the beaches, downtown were all within 5-10 minutes driving. The space was well furnished, sheets were cozy and had all the kitchenware for us to make dinners for our 5 year old son. The only 2 things that I wish they had was a children’s stool for the bathroom, so that he could reach the sink when we were brushing his teeth and a mat in the shower to prevent slippage. Outside of that, great getaway spot, would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Santa Cruz!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Mermaid Cottage is exactly as described. It is beautiful and cozy. Ciara is awesome, prompt and courteous. We would absolutely stay here again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a gem of a find! We loved our stay. It’s a cute cottage that’s quiet and yet so close to so many things. Would definitely recommend and plan on staying here again in the future.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful time in a wonderful space, beautifully curated by responsive and helpful hosts. Grateful for the time spent in this oasis :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ciara’s place is super cute and comfortable, and has any and all amenities you’d need for a short term stay. Everything in her home is very considered, including an easy coffee setup for the morning, plenty of towels for the shower and hot tub, and even extra sunglasses in case you forget yours! She is very communicative and friendly.
We are planning on coming back!"
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great for our stay in Santa Cruz. We enjoyed walking the area and coming home to a hot tub.
Wish the hot tub was easer to heat up felt like a lot of work. Ciara helped get the heat up in the tub for our stay.
Thanks"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this place - nice kitchen for cooking, hot tub for relaxing, location for walking to the lagoon/wharf/restaurants. Easy 10 min drive to campus. Ciara was very responsive and helpful to our questions. Really hoping to make this our regular spot when visiting our daughter at UCSC!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice centrally located unit that is clean and inviting . Good hosts .

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and comfortable. Walking distance to great restaurants. Ciara had great local recommendations. Highly recommend for your Santa Cruz stays. Hope to be back soon and definitely would stay at Ciara's again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent oasis in the heart of Santa Cruz yet located in the most peaceful surroundings. What a gem! Excellent spot to explore all of Santa Cruz. And if you’re into nature, there is a beautiful boardwalk nature park just at the end of the street. The main area of downtown Santa Cruz with it’s excellent cafe’s, bars and shops is less than a 10 minute walk away. I’ll definitely be back to spend longer."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little mermaid cave is a total jewel. It is immaculately clean and has all of the things you need to feel comfortable, cozy, and relaxed. Our stay felt private and peaceful. The host has thought of everything and the attention to detail is inspiring!
It’s no surprise that life is better, down where it’s wetter, under the sea! 🧜🏼‍♀️"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was super cute, clean and full of everything you needed. Ciara’s house was fully stocked, super bright and welcoming. We celebrated my husbands birthday and I asked Ciara if she could decorate with a few Birthday decorations and it was perfect. She even surprised me (us) with a cute little cake 😊. She was very thoughtful and responsive. The home was in a great location and the hot tub was a great bonus. Thank you Ciara for letting us use your home, we will definitely book again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I love this cottage. It was perfect for my family of 4. It was well decorated and clean. They even dropped off extra beach towels and goodies for my kids. I felt very comfortable so quickly, it was a great getaway for us."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome place! You should consider it as a unique experience, not as a luxury hotel. It's inconvenient to get down the ladder if you want to go to a toilet, you won't want to shower if it's chilly outside, but it's definitely worth it to stay there for a night. The tree house is a beautiful piece of art and engineering, the place is amazing, you are right in the middle of a redwood forest. It's super quiet, it was a pleasure to wake up there in the morning and look at the redwoods through your ceiling and walls. When we stayed there the weather was quite chilly, around 10C/50F at night. But an electric blanket worked very well, we even turned it off because it was too hot at max power.
The only downside was an almost finished toilet paper roll that ended right in the middle of a business, and there were no replacement at all! Luckily we had one in a car, but that's not what you expect paying 1k for a night."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We originally planned to come out for our 1 year anniversary back in 2020, but that trip never happened... for obvious reasons. Four years and 1 kid later we finally made it out here for our 5 year anniversary. It is an understatement to say that this place was worth the wait! The pictures on the site do not do this place justice! Our stay at the Pine Cone was nothing short of magical. Shannon and her staff provided a world class experience and I cannot speak highly enough about our stay. if you're considering a stay at the Pine Cone, Do It! Thanks Shannon for providing the perfect venue for our getaway!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The only thing that I can say it AMAZING !!!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My partner and I had a great stay at the Pinecone despite it being rainy! Check in was very unique because our host (Amber) kept good communication and was flexible on having us check in past the 4pm period. The rundown was very easy to understand the safety of going up and down the Pinecone. The inside was pretty clean for a treehouse and the windows were clear enough to enjoy the scenery. the bed was comfortable and had heated blankets. (I ended up getting too hot in the middle of the night!) Waking up was amazing to hear the birds and have the trees surrounding you. We didn't get to use the shower but the bathroom system was maintained well. There is a light above the stairs so if you had to wake up in the middle of the night and crawl down, you would be able to find your way down. The only heads up I will give to others that need to pee a lot is try to plan your trips so you don't go back and forth! Great experience & would be willing to come back!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved it! Clean and comfortable place. The stairs were steep so be prepared. The overall privacy is good, but we did have some people come and camp near us on the ground during the night time. All in all, a fun and unique experience! Would visit again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an unforgettable weekend at the Pinecone Treehouse! Tucked away in a private setting, this unique treehouse is an architectural marvel that blends beautifully with nature. During the day, the sunlight filters through the trees, highlighting the intricate design of the Pinecone, and at night, the place transforms into a magical retreat under the stars.
Shannon is an outstanding host—thoughtful and attentive, ensuring that every detail is perfect. Her communication was excellent, making our stay smooth and enjoyable. This treehouse is not just a place to stay, it's a wonderful experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a special getaway. Thank you, Shannon, for making our weekend memorable!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying at the pinecone was a true experience. From the adventure of climbing up into the pinecone to watching the sunset and sunrise from bed, it was beautiful and we felt immersed in nature - exactly what we wanted. The communication was impeccable and made for a very easy stay. Thank you so much for sharing this incredible experience with us."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,although we touch rain the experience was incredible
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing experience!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time staying at the Pinecone. The views and surroundings are stunning and the short drive into Felton and Santa Cruz is hard to beat!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,A unique experience with beautiful surroundings. Responsive host. A place for the adventurous of spirit.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really unique and beautiful stay. Not too far off the beaten path, but enough to feel secluded. Definitely need to battle some butterflies the first time you climb up and down, but you get used to it after long. Thanks Shannon!"
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"As an avid traveler, I always look forward to unique accommodations, which is why I chose the treehouse. The concept when you arrive is genuinely breathtaking. However, my excitement was short lived when entering this architectural marvel.
The first thing you notice was the visible wear and tear. Insulation tapes hung loosely from the windows, a seemingly easy fix that was inexplicably ignored. Several windows were chipped, and a few light bulbs were out. It's disheartening to find such neglect in a place unique like this one.
Furthermore, the heater, vital for a comfortable stay, failed within half a day. This lack of maintenance doesn't just dampen the experience; it raises concerns about what else might be overlooked, unsettling for anyone hoping for a peaceful night rest.
Now, if your goal is to impress your social media followers with stunning visuals, then this treehouse will check your box.
However, for $800+ you can have a 5-star experience at many hotels with breakfast. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay in the Pinecone Tree House with my adventure buddy! A huge storm passed through the area for our stay which made it quite the adventure. Highly recommend this once in a lifetime place to stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The host was very responsive and flexible with the check in time and with us changing it as well. The Airbnb was amazing, loved the tree house , it was so cozy."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our overnight stay in the Pinecone was nothing short of magical.
We stayed during the rain, but that made for a more beautiful retreat being indoors hearing the rain trickling all night and into the early misty and mystical morning watching the fog pierce the trees surrounding us. The string lights, which are dimmable, make for the ultimate fairytale-feeling ambiance in this treehouse, along with the cute hanging plants on the windows.
Our trek to the bathroom was quite frequent as we enjoyed wine and hot cocoa in the Pinecone all night, but it was a fun and scenic journey up and down the ladder even through the light rain.
I’d say the underdog of this whole place has got to be the bathroom. It’s a separate unit with a large window that opens to your own private forest view that makes you truly feel like you’re out in the wilderness. The bathroom supplies a hot rainfall shower with probably the best direct forest view you can ever get.
Thanks o2 treehouse for the memories!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Took my girlfriend here to relax for the weekend. The experience was amazing and she loved the open shower. Totally worth the money. The ladder to get in the pinecone does move as well as the pinecone but you do get used to going up and down.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Phenomenal view and experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I booked the Pinecone on a whim for our 17th anniversary, and it was well worth it. It was such a unique place to stay. We stayed on a rainy, foggy night in December, and the sound of the rain and gentle sway in the wind was so peaceful. The 360-degree views were amazing, not to mention looking up at the treetops, clouds, and stars (when we were lucky enough to have breaks in the clouds). We were a little worried about staying warm due to the season and weather, but the small propane heater kept the interior at a comfortable temperature. Climbing the 30-foot ladder was not for the faint of heart, but was so much fun. The option to open the sliding doors on the bathroom to have a more open-air shower was a great feature. We went to dinner in Felton, which was only a short 15-minute drive, and the trip into Santa Cruz the next morning was about the same. We loved everything about our stay, and we'll remember it for the rest of our lives."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had the most amazing stay! My husband was so surprised! It is a one of a kind stay.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time at The Pinecone! Perfect get away right before the holidays and the hosts were so nice and helpful during check-in. We did go during December so it was pretty cold but nothing some extra layers couldn't fix. Very cozy inside had electricity for light and to charge electronics. The bathroom was also a treehouse and had lots of hot water for a comfortable shower. Overall we had a great stay at The Pinecone and would recommend it to friends!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a special and unique stay. Being suspended in the air amongst the trees in a glass pinecone is not like any other experience I’ve come by. So cool, so fun, and so relaxing."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An unbelievable experience in the most extraordinary location — like glamping in an alien space ship nestled in the highest branches of those gorgeous trees.
Once you’re inside the treehouse, it’s beautiful, private, and the views are glorious. Thoughtful lighting creates this dreamy mood, and the bed is so so so comfortable. I haven’t slept this well in ages!
Truly, a remarkable experience — tho as other reviews mention, that ladder is crazy steep! A bit nerve wrecking if you’re not good with heights!
A one of a kind experience. So happy for it!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked an overnight stay at The Pinecone Treehouse as a surprise birthday gift for my husband, and we had such a great time! I didn’t tell him anything about it, so he didn’t know what to expect. His reaction to seeing it for the first time was priceless. We could not get over how amazing and unique it was, suspended in the trees! Seeing and using the ladder for the first time was scary, but we got more comfortable with it the more we used it. The room and bathroom were very well-maintained. The room was really cozy and comfortable, and the propane heater was easy to use and warmed up the space nicely. The bathroom was clean and had hot running water. Shannon and Amber were very easy to contact and communicate with. I would love to stay again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just unbelievable
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lived up to our expectations. Sleeping in a cozy treehouse suspended from the redwoods can't be beat. The pinecone's design is super cool - a view of the trees and sky everywhere you look. The hosts communicate well, and it was such a fun adventure. Would stay again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We spent our 17th Wedding Anniversary here and it was Beautiful and Romantic! Thank you Shannon for easy communication and Amber for being a wonderful host.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We REALLY enjoyed staying at the Pinecone! Such a unique and interesting lodging experience, one we will never forget! We’d definitely love to come back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Once in a lifetime stay! My wife had been wanting to stay here since the YouTube video came out. It’s such a unique spot tucked away in the redwoods. My wife loved the experience.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay! The views were incredible and it was a truly unique experience. The hosts were communicative and gave clear instructions before and during our stay.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What can I say?! This Airbnb is a DREAM come true! I’ve been eyeing this pinecone treehouse for a while now and my girlfriend and I finally went for our anniversary and it was just as expected. The pinecone was even more majestic in person and it reminds me of an alien spaceship. The climb up to wasn’t bad at all and the inside was really cute, cozy, and whimsical! The bathroom was really rustic and there’s nothing better than staring into the redwoods while using the bathroom haha! The hosts were wonderful to chat with and we had a blast staying here. I would highly recommend this to everyone and we will definitely be back!! :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great choice for a getaway trip!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,WOW is an understatement of this beautiful secluded gem!!! This was on my bucket list for a while and we finally got in and what better luck than on our anniversary weekend. My husband and I have traveled all over the world and this was a one of a kind unique experience literally in our backyard as we only live 40 minutes from this wanderlust magical pinecone! We felt very at peace and ease as we listened to nature as we glared up into the sky and redwoods while laying on the bed. A truly out of this world experience. Would highly recommend and would love to come back one day and take our son when he is old enough to enjoy such beauties among us.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really special Airbnb—waking up in the magic of the redwoods around you is about as good as it gets!
Getting up and down the ladder required attention, but felt much easier after the first go.
The view, location and hike recs were all perfect. Loved this trip."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the most unique stays I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing! The Pinecone Treehouse provided peace and serenity with a truly magical feel. The beauty of the structure left me in awe. Waking up to the sun rising, high in the redwoods was surreal.
Shannon provided info that let me know exactly what to expect. This was beyond helpful and allowed me to prepare accordingly. I communicated with Amber who was SO helpful and walked me through everything upon check-in.
I am happy to have marked this off of my “wanderlust” checklist!! I highly suggest that you RESERVE NOW!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing! The views at night and in the morning were breathtaking. The surroundings were so peaceful. Be prepared for steep stairs, so pack light!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: most breathtaking beautiful and unique Airbnb my partner and I have ever stayed in! Picturesque, scenic, “bragging-rights” type of a place.
Cons: it’s not insulated! Needs a lot of repairs and maintenance. Very masculine vibe. Feels like camping / glamping. A one night stay felt like enough.
Was hoping for a romantic date…. And to connect with nature…. but was hard to really enjoy the space being so cold on the INSIDE with only 1 small heater. We realised the windows were either broken / or just open and letting in the cold. The tree house, despite being out in nature, felt to us disconnected from nature. (Just a personal observation.)
One little suggestion might be to add a hot tub into the bathroom and upgrade the bedsheets to a nice linen. (I brought a linen throw with me, a speaker and dimply lit camping light, and it helped create a nice vibe. Would be nice had little touches been provided, as well as an electric water boiler and tea station.) ☺️❤️🌸"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay most beautiful place in California
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great experience, very unique, very peaceful and very BREATH TAKING surroundings! I love the bedroom!!
Totally worth it! Only comment I will make is that if you plan to stay here make sure you don’t have any arrangements or reservations prior to your stay. You do have to meet and greet a host before you have access to the house and it can take 10-15 minutes before you go on and about with your day. I think that’s important to know! Shannon is very responsive and quickly to re solve any small unexpected issues! OVER ALL IM VERY PLEASED!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The architecture and the location of this tree house are absolutely unique! The only criticism that I and my wife have to note is the mattress. Since this tree house is only suitable and designed for overnight stays, the mattress as a central element should be correspondingly high quality and comfortable. Otherwise, it has been a great experience that we can recommend without reservation."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beyond my expectations! I would highly recommend anyone who likes the outdoors to check this place out! The host was also very helpful.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a surprise for my husband, he was so amazed! It was such a beautiful and yet adventurous experience for him. We had such a great time !"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This stay was super peaceful and nice for a mother daughter getaway where Shannon was super accommodating and check in was easy and the overall Pinecone was exactly what I expected. It was peaceful and beautiful and had everything we needed. Such a cool stay!!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Pure magic. What an incredible space. To sleep, floating amongst the redwoods in the center of daughter trees where the mother tree once was. What you will expect and beyond anything you could ever imagine. Pure bliss and just absolute awe at the beauty that this space is. Thank you for the gift."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An extremely unique place to stay! The treehouse is in a quiet location. Appreciate the natural surroundings and the modern convenience of the bathroom/shower just below the treehouse. The bed is very comfortable and loved staring up and out the ceiling at the trees. There was just a bit of rain during the night and the sound of the rain hitting the trees was so relaxing. There is a grill and picnic table so be sure to bring your picnic supplies. We grilled burgers for dinner. Our host for the evening was Abi who was super helpful with getting us some supplies we needed to make dinner. She also met us at the gate to the entrance of the property and escorted us to the treehouse, making check-in super easy! Thank you for a memorable stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect weekend spent
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I had been trying to book the treehouse for over a year when all of a sudden a date opened up and for our anniversary no less! We couldn't have planned it better! We had such a great anniversary weekend in Santa Cruz. First ziplining in Mount Hermon, then staying at the treehouse and finally a tour at the Lick Observatory. We appreciated being able to check in an hour early right after ziplining. Alastair was very responsive and accommodating! The treehouse was as magical as we expected. The smell of the composting toilet was a little stronger than we hoped for but luckily it was warm enough to leave the windows open which helped. We had everything we needed for a wonderful anniversary and it was definitely worth the wait!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was incredible!! Everything I had hoped it would be. We even had fog in the morning which was ethereal. It was shaded by trees most of the day except late afternoon. Brought some colored lamps and such to make for some really fun night photography. Do not forget bug spray in august. :)
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It's a great location. It's in the woods, but it's actually very, very close to lots of things to do in Santa Cruz. We checked in and then went for a sunset hike, came back to the treehouse and woke up in the Redwoods. Then we went surfing the next day."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed at the pinecone treehouse for a night and it didn’t disappoint. The place completely matched the description and was breathtaking. I would highly recommend for a weekend with your loved one.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a once in a lifetime trip. We loved it. It was in a gorgeous location and was such a unique experience. I am so so glad we made the trip.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The experience at The Pinecone Tree House was truly lovely. The communication with Shannon was smooth and efficient and Chandra, the person who welcomed us, was very kind. The place itself is simply beautiful and has a magical touch that captivated us. We are genuinely happy to have had the opportunity to be there and enjoy its serene and peaceful ambiance, from the day to the night when the sky looked breathtaking.
While our stay was wonderful, we believe that, considering the price, some additional amenities could be added to further enhance the experience. For example, having a mini-refrigerator would be great, and perhaps a small gesture like a chocolate on the bed would be a lovely touch. However, overall, we are very satisfied and happy with our stay.
We sincerely thank you for providing us with such a special and memorable experience!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This experience was definitely something I'd recommend to anyone who loves adventure and different from the usual accommodations. It was a thrill to ascend into the treehouse and wake up to a full window view of God's beautiful creation. I was a bit nervous about the climb up to our little nest, but the structure was well built and there was no reason to fear getting up the ladder.
As odd as it sounds, we also loved the bathroom. The entire experience was a 10! The host was very communicative about what I was to expect, directions were clear, and we were received with a very friendly greeting."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,🤯🤯
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a neat experience! I loved staying in the pine cone! The beauty was unparalleled. Shannon and Amber were great at providing me with information and made the whole process simple. The bed was comfortable and taking a showing in the treehouse bathroom was amazing! The stepladder was a bit tricky at first, but soon became pretty easy. I would recommend that guests bring a flashlight (or headlamp if possible) and bring an extra tote bag or small backpack for bringing supplies up and down the steps."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Really great experience!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks so much for an awesome night away o2 Treehouse team!! We had a great time celebrating our anniversary. :)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was magical experience 🤗
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful experience!! Such a cool treehouse
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a fantastic time at the pinecone! I proposed to my partner there and it was beyond magical.
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"First, the concept is wonderful and unique. I give it A+ for this creativity and my husband who IS a glamper while I am a camper, was really looking forward to this stay. Unfortunately we spent the night wide awake till 3am thanks to a house nearby (according to the host) that was playing incredibly loud clanging music till that time. I have audio recordings of this and messaged Airbnb and my host at 11pm, 1am and finally 3am (to airbnb requesting a partial refund because I was so mad). Imagine paying $800 for this stay and not being able to enjoy the peace and quiet in the woods? It just seemed like a cruel joke. Bed was saggy surprisingly - most glamping Ive stayed at the beds are comfy. You have to bring your own fuel for the stove. And in the middle of soaping myself, hot water turned icy cold. $800 for this does not make sense to me. The host offered me an extra night (thank u!!) but had to leave since we had plans. She refunded me $200 (thank you)! - Appreciate the gesture!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s an unparalleled experience in the midst of tall pine trees. A small oasis suspended in air where one can feel tranquil.
The hosts were communicative from the get go about setting reasonable expectations from this experience to enjoy it to the fullest. We were assisted by Chandra on our day of visit and she gave my wife and I, a very warm welcome as we got escorted from the entry of driveway to the pinecone. She definitely help reduce our anxiety and get us excited about the stay.
The Pinecone itself is spectacular. The construction and how everything came together is a piece of art in itself. Its a nice spacious place with 360 degree views of the forest. The very slight swinging of the Pinecone as we moved inside or with wind made is feel more connected to the nature.
This place is definitely one of the best tranquil glamping experiences my wife and I ever had. I hope more people get to experience this."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I could give this treehouse more than a 5 star rating, I would. It exceeded my expectations and I was officially able to cross something off on my bucket list after waiting for 3 years. This pinecone is not for the faint of heart, but waking up 30 feet above the ground to a breathtaking view of the CA redwoods made everything worth it. Shannon & Amber were both incredibly responsive, provided very clear instructions, and were readily available if we had any questions. Can’t wait for my next trip out here!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience! Thank you.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's all of your dreams come true. This place is exactly what you imagine it to be -- the hype is entirely accurate. May you experience the same magic that I did! ❤️
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the most incredible experiences! I got a night in the pinecone for my son's 30th birthday. He has known about this for years and has always wanted to go. It definitely lived up to his expectations. They are still processing how magical this was. They enjoyed being in the pinecone, being outside of it (surroundings were beautiful) and they even enjoyed the bathroom! Very much a wonderful, unique experience!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing once in a lifetime experience. How many chances are you going to get to stay in a pinecone? BOOK THE CONE.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay!!!! I’m not super outdoorsy so one night was the perfect stay for us. Definitely recommend! It’s the most magical stay I’ve ever had! Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A once in a lifetime experience. Yes climbing down to the restroom was hard. But with her description we were warned. Totally worth it. AMAZING!!!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really loved staying at the unique Pinecone Treehouse in Bonny Doon....it was exactly what the pictures and description made it sound like, and both Amber and Shannon were very responsive and communicative in the days and hours leading up to our check-in. Amber met us at the gates and showed us around the property--but it was brief and to the point, just the way we like it after a long drive! We loved the peace and quiet of staying in the treehouse and the bathroom/shower amenities were totally fine (in fact, gorgeous to look out into the woods from the open air 'window') for this camping/glamping experience. The treehouse was clean, at night there were lights down below and within the treehouse for easy visibility in getting around. Truly a unique and memorable experience-already so many friends who saw my photos posted online have inquired about details, it's so original and beautifully rendered-from a creative and engineering standpoint...I highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"In a world of pure imagination a “pinecone” floating in the Redwoods. This one of a kind Airbnb is breathtaking, unique and simply romantic. Beautiful location and such a peaceful property. It was a wow-worthy experience!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an amazing place - we had a wonderful time in the pine cone. Thank you for having us :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a unique experience! We really enjoyed it!
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Chandra is such a warm and inviting person. We had some hiccoughs with our check in and stay but both she and Shannon were very responsive and accommodating. The pine cone is uber romantic and unique and quite the site to behold.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This stay was one of a kind and the hosts were great!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pinecone was a truly unique experience. A beautiful camping experience suspended in the trees.
I think it’s important to note that you will be glamping- with a beautiful pinecone in the air, rather than a tent. The bed was cozy, the heated blankets kept us warm, the shower was warm.
Make sure to take any food and drink with you and leave it in you car at the bottom of the tree so you can grab snacks and drinks throughout the day. Only bring what you need for the night in a back pack up into the pinecone. Everything in, everything out.
We were pleasantly surprised that there were Uber that could take us in and out of town. We went out to dinner and then came back to enjoy the beautiful scenery and environment.
Jamie and Shannon were super responsive and helpful when we ran into a couple issues. Over all I would recommend anyone experience it if they get the opportunity."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a incredible experience. Worth every penny, amazing hosts and very responsive.
Highly recommend for a beautiful getaway"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Special experience, nice host, follow your next project"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pinecone treehouse is absolutely magical, and at the same time, rustic… Chose this location for our engagement proposal, and was definitely the most unique place we’ve ever stayed,
As other reviewers have stated visiting during the rainy season made the stay even more enchanting, with the clear roof and walls, being able to watch the raindrops come down and hear them as you drift off to sleep 💤
We visited during one of California’s famous atmospheric rivers
Highway One was flooded 5-10 feet underwater along the coast with an hour and a half detour and we saw several cars flipped over upside down and accidents in multiple locations on our way to and from so it’s no small wonder with such an intricate structure that there were a few small leaks, which I’m sure the owners will tend to at the soonest opportunity when the weather clears."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you very much for the stay at the tree house, it was actually a wonderful experience for me and my wife who were celebrating our anniversary. It was what we were looking for in a stay, it was very pleasant and unforgettable for us.
New thanks for being and existing with this type of projects that support and encourage love and value for nature"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An experience like no other! To sleep under the stars and wake up the wilderness in high up in the trees was truly a surreal experience! Would highly highly recommend this place for an intimate getaway.
Very detailed instructions were provided way ahead of time. There was a propane-powered heater as well as a heated blanket for chilly nights with great ambient lighting."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The pinecone is definitely a cool and unique spot. As a person who is very scared of heights i was able to go up and down, however the experience was somewhat stressful for me at least. (6 foot ladders are about my limit)."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You will never ever stay in a place like this again! A forest bath like no other.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is definitely a magical experience. We arrived, but there was a glitch with the check-in process. The staff who were introducing the place to us had some difficulties, but Shannon was very understanding and allowed us to do a late check-out. The entire place was amazing, and the heated blankets provided enough warmth for us throughout the night, so we didn't have to use the heater. They even provided us with extra blankets. Shannon also allowed us to use their camp stove, which made our anniversary an incredible experience. Overall, I would say that this place is definitely worth the money!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved our time here! Thank you again!

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible magical life changing night in the pinecone treehouse. Really magical and beyond description. Thanks Chandra for hosting and checking in with us and O2 team for building this spiritual oasis
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,my wife and I spent a weekend here for her birthday and it was an amazing experience! the architectural design is so unique and just suspends you in nature. Chandra welcomed us at checkin and was super helpful to get us oriented to the pinecone. I definitely recommend staying here for your glamping getaway!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once in a life time stay surround by nature and all its elements. 1-2 nights is the perfect amount of time here. The place feels very sturdy and safe. If you come in the winter, bundle up! They provide heater and heated blanket which were so helpful! Chandra help us check in and was so kind to meet us an hour earlier than the check in time and allowed us an extra hour at check out. The views are unmatched and it’s truly an experience."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a cool and unique experience!!! Sleeping amongst the trees and we were lucky enough to experience a rainstorm. Felt like we were camping but on another level. Would recommend booking for summer months for some added daylight hours if only staying one night! The shower was such a peaceful and unreal experience, however compostable toilet is not for the faint of heart. The check in host was very helpful and had a lot of knowledge on the area with recommendations on what to do and where to eat. Close to cozy small towns with great shops and eats. I would gladly come again!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This treehouse is truly what you would expect from the photos! If you want a private getaway with your loved one, this is definitely a special treat. The drive may be a bit windy to get to but this place is very secluded. It is in a gated community so it feels safe. I would say it gets cold but they provide a portable buddy heater and electric blanket which helped! Like many others warned, if you need to use the bathroom alot, it takes some effort to go up and down the ladder. Think of it as glamping with immaculate design. We only stayed one night as it is a bit pricey but if you can afford it, dont hesitate and book this place!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an incredible and unique experience. If your a outdor person I think of a more unique experience than this one. Highly recommend.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place to stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the pinecone was magical! We were in awe of the beautiful structure over and over. The communication was top-notch and friendly. Check-in was a breeze! Shannon and Chandra were so friendly and informative! The bed was warm and comfortable, and even in 40 degree weather, we didn't need the heater or electric blanket provided. The ladder is intense, but do-able once you get the hang of it! We brought a camp stove and lots of snacks/dinner, so we didn't have to leave at all, which maximized our time there. It's an anniversary we will never forget! Thank you!!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Words Cannot Describe.
- Utterly amazing! Architecturally fascinating and a one-of-a-kind experience! Absolute MUST!"
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Wonderfully beautiful Airbnb! Beautiful among the trees!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This treehouse is a very special place. We had such a fun night and really appreciated all the help from the hosts beforehand and even being available during the stay. We watched the sunset, moonrise and sunrise from inside the Pinecone."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The pinecone treehouse was an amazing experience from start to finish. I highly recommend staying here as the pictures do no real justice! It is a masterpiece with every detail being unique. Glad I got to stay here with my boyfriend for his birthday it was the perfect getaway!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great time staying in the Pinecone! Bucket list item checked off. Surreal and lovely experience.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We greatly enjoyed our night at the Pinecone Treehouse! It’s a gorgeous little nest and was so cool to wake up swaying amongst the trees!
Shannon was quick to respond and checkin was a breeze.
Would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Pinecone treehouse was my wife and I’s wedding night location! It was the perfect way to complete a perfect day! Shannon and the O2 team helped me figure out how to make it all work, over the course of months! They were fantastic and we highly recommend!! Thank you guys!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was an amazing experience in the forest
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Pinecone was a magical experience for us. We planned our stay on a night of full moon, the canopy was bright overnight and the temperature was just perfect. If you are into engineering, you will spend hours understanding the work that went in to building, hoisting and securing such a heavy structure in the canopy. We found it easy to get in and out of the cone via the nautical stair (we are 62&68 years old, super fit). Also, the hosts are very responsive to the guests needs and professional in the way they run their business. It was a once in a lifetime experience worth living, if you are into glamping & treehouses! Make sure to travel light in a small backpack! Lovely!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is an amazing experience, a night at extremely unique treehouse."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough! The pictures will never do it justice! The minute my fiancé and I pulled up to the Pinecone, we were both speechless at just how amazing it was. It was like staying in a work of art. The bedroom is beautiful with lovely plush bedding and twinkling string lights. They even have a hammock underneath, which we used quite a bit. Chandra, our host, was amazing and made sure we had everything we needed. The bathroom was also incredible. You just cannot beat the rainfall shower in the middle of the redwoods. We found ourselves spending more time in the bathroom than usual just taking in the beautiful views. If you have an opportunity to stay at this lovely location, definitely jump on it. We cannot wait to come back and hope to explore even more locations and treehouses!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were delighted to get a chance to spend the night up in a magical pinecone tree house !
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pine cone is the 🐐 and totally worth it for a special occasion.
Shannon/Chandra were very responsive and helped with questions before and during our stay. Everything was clean and the water was hot.
100% recommend!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An absolutely gorgeous stay that my partner and I will remember forever as the setting for our proposal! Would love to return some day
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place in the middle of redwood trees! It's a stunning structure and we very much enjoyed waking up under the canopy in the comfortable bed! It's in easy distance to Santa Cruz with many restaurants a 15min drive away. And once checked in, we could come and go as we pleased."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As all the other reviews say, sleeping in the trees truly feels like a once in a lifetime experience. Waking up to a circle of trees around us was unforgettable. There was a ton of communication and lots of helpful tips shared with us that made our stay even better. I’d definitely recommend traveling with your belongings in a backpack for ease of using the ladder and pro tip that we didn’t have service at the gate so it made contacting the host a bit tricky at first - but we had service in the pinecone and the wifi was great so just a heads up for when you arrive at the gate and need to message the host. We got a late start on the morning and they were super friendly and offered a later and very flexible check out time. It was truly a great experience and the hosts were amazing - we’ll definitely never forget our time at the pinecone!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AMAZING unique once in a lifetime experience and AirBnb. We have been to a lot of treehouses/Hobbit Hole/etc. but this one was hands down the most extraordinary yet! We only stayed one night, but it was such a magical night! Inside the pinecone is so cozy and magical and perfect. The climb up/down was very easy for us and made for such a unique experience. The outdoor shower was amazing, always love getting to shower in the forest! There was a power outage in the area (not the owners fault at all) sometime in the night and into the morning, so our devices did not charge and we had no power all morning and checked out at 11am before it came back, but honestly when you are there things like power are trivial. The nature, the art, the ambience... that is what it is all about. We read and soaked up nature without the need of power. Honestly it does us all well to truly disconnect every now and then and appreciate the other things life has to offer. Also such a short drive to Santa Cruz where we spent an evening out at the amazing restaurants and the next day shopping at all the great shops and enjoying amazing coffee from Verve! We love this area and I would stay over and over again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,There are no words to describe how amazing the Pinecone Treehouse is. Truly a once in a lifetime experience that will leave anyone breathless. Shannon was super responsive and communicated everything very clearly. Chandra made the check-in process a breeze and walked us through everything we needed to know for our stay. She even recommended some great spots to eat and grab coffee nearby in downtown Santa Cruz. The Pinecone truly is an architectural and design masterpiece.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The hosts were nice and the pinecone was very pretty :)
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pinecone treehouse was a relaxing adventure. Situated in the middle of the redwoods, the adrenaline-heightening climb up the steep ladder to the pinecone is worth it for the cozy bed and 360-degree view of the forest. Unfortunately for us there was a PG&E outage in the area during our stay, so we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful shower to its full extent, but despite that minor setback we very much enjoyed our restful stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for a great , unique stay . You will never regret time and memories in a such cool place !!! We are still amazed how this construction hang on the trees just like that ;)"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing experience,definitely worth it....so unique and beautiful place,unbelievable....thank you for sharing your place with us,super cool time."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the most unique place I've ever stayed and highly recommend it!
Truly an amazing experience nestled in a beautiful forest.
The bathroom is really impressive as is everything."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Definitely the coolest and most unique places we’ve ever stayed! It’s like staying within a piece of artwork! Visited in June and the temp was perfect! Everything was as described and the hosts were very attentive! So grateful for the opportunity to stay here!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a totally unique experience. We loved it!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a spectacular place to stay! Even the gorgeous photos don't fully do the place justice. It rained during our stay, but we were super cozy in our bed and fell asleep to the sound of raindrops all around us. Dustin was the perfect host, and we also got some excellent restaurant recommendations in Santa Cruz. Could not have asked for a better experience!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a unique experience, and one that makes you feel like you have entered a magical place. Highly recommended and our host was amazing."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was so enchanting and surreal. A space to rejuvenate and be in nature. At first the sounds and sways of the treehouse were a little unnerving but Chandra was super reassuring in letting me know it was completely natural with the wind.
The shower was the best experience just looking out into the woods.
Can not wait to come back! Thank you for creating such a magical space"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute and fun experience! Would recommend :)
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You won’t regret your experience here, it’s magic."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Pinecone is easily one of the coolest structures I've ever slept in! It's an absolute work of art. Check-in was easy, and the communication is great! It's even much closer in to Santa Cruz than I realized, so even though we forgot to bring coffee that first night, we were only a short drive in the morning. Thank you Dustin!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Yes, you pay a premium -- but it's well-worth the price. Likely the most unique stay I've ever been in to date. The team was absolutely amazing from start to finish and extremely quick to reply. Thanks again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing, unfortunately, incredible place to stay!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This treehouse experience was spectacular, one of a kind! Nothing better than being immersed in nature and waking up in the treehouse was like no other experience we’ve encountered. It’s a beautiful location with hiking trails nearby. The shower is the most amazing I’ve taken in my life with an open view of the forest! It’s definitely a once in a lifetime experience to enjoy the treehouse & all it’s surrounding beauty. If you love nature, love the outdoors - don’t hesitate!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our getaway in the Pinecone! Dustin and the hosting team were super communicative and accommodating. All the suggestions and instructions around staying here were accurate and helpful so we knew how to best be prepared. We did not need the heater, as the bed blankets were warm enough! We did pack some extra blankets which were nice to use as we sat on the little floor cushions and had wine and snacks. It was incredibly quiet and peaceful.
The pinecone is also close to town, so we came to check-in and get the info on the lights and safety and then went into town for supplies! We brought back pizza which we ate at the picnic table, looking up at the pinecone :)
Highly recommend for a glamping getaway!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,No words to describe…Waking up in the morning with my hubby & being inside of pinecone. Fresh oxygen & amazing view. The bed sheet kept us warm all night. I was excited for being a squirrel for one night… hehe lol 😂 Thank you for fulfilling my bucket list!!! P.S… Best shower EVER!!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time. The treehouse is a unique experience in an absolutely beautiful location. The hosts are very friendly and helpful.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check in, amazing spot!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Well stocked with towels, shower essentials, blankets, lights. Lighting in the pinecone and around location was adequate. Bring snacks!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This stay is beautiful! Definitely unique and an experience unlike any other! The communication was superb being a unique stay that entailed camping and home features. They made sure we were comfortable with ascending and descending the ladder and made sure we had anything we needed. We enjoyed the hammock and waking up in the trees. Even showering with a forest view was one of a kind. It was so beautiful! Grateful to have found this stay, thank you."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this place for my girlfriends birthday and it showed fully booked but they were kind enough to make space for us for a night upon special request as I wanted to surprise her.
We were greeted by Chandra who was a wonderful host to us. She took us through everything as the place is totally unconventional. Our stay was very comfortable, a perfect place for a special occasion. And to make it even better it rained in the evening and it was a view beyond words for a rainy night in the woods suspended in a glass pinecone! The morning was a beautiful clear sky and we were mind blown! You’d be really lucky if you get to experience it all. They had a nice heater to keep us warm throughout. Also do not miss out on the net underneath the structure. It’s a fun place to hangout too.
The open bath was a cherry on top as if it even needed more. We loved the whole experience. It was a beautiful memorable stay for us, definitely makes up for a special occasion if you want something extraordinary.
Also special thanks to Chandra. My watch had fallen down on the road where I parked and I had lost hopes but she specially went back to check on it and hand delivered it. I cannot thank her enough for the gesture.
Overall it is a wonderful space with wonderful people. I totally recommend going there for an out of the box experience."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It was an amazing experience! The location is the best you can imagine for this type of the staying. The house is defenitely a place where you can relax, very quite, only sound of nature!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an awesome place!!! Splurge and stay here!!!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a fun stay! So unique and really well maintained. Highly recommend!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is easily the most amazing trip that we have ever been on. The place itself is such an incredible art piece that is a must-see in person, but then getting the chance to stay in it is unbelievable. Climbing the ladder, while daunting at first, is actually a breeze after a couple trips, and we immediately let go of all the fears. We also got the chance to stay in hot, cold, rain, and sun all in one go, and we felt comfortable the whole time. We didn’t even need to use the heater. The only scary thing was that the whole place will rock and spin a bit (not a lot) in the wind, which was jarring at first, but we felt so safe that we almost forgot about after a couple hours. The bathroom is also amazing and looks out into the woods. The hot water gets HOT and you can close class doors to keep the heat in a bit more too making it very comfortable.
Another big thing to note is that while the treehouse is deep enough in the trees to feel secluded, you’re also a very short drive from Santa Cruz. We barely wanted to leave the place, but when we did for food, it was extremely easy to drive out and come back in, and there’s lots of great restaurants and things to do. And the dirt road up to the treehouse is not long nor hard to drive at all.
Overall, this was a phenomenal experience. We couldn’t ask for anything better!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a spectacular stay and what an experience! Communication about checking in was very clear. If you're looking for a unique stay, this is it."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This experience was once in a lifetime. There are just enough amenities that you would need like heater, headlamps, bug spray. The bathroom has really warm water which I very much appreciate. Given these amenities, I suggest to pack really light with everything fit in a backpack."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is WOW! Checked all the boxes, peaceful, creative, and beautiful. Communication was so easy and helpful.
The stairs were scary at first but once you go up and down you’ll get the hang of it.
The bed was sooo comfortable and blankets provided kept us warm.
Shower was so nice and steamy in the cold mornings.
This place feels so homely not to mention the surroundings are so quiet.
Honestly pictures do not do this place justice. Gotta experience it for yourself (:"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow!!!
It's even better than the pix
Especially if you're lucky enough to get perfect not so cold but cold enough to keep the squitos away sort of weather.
Amazing thing and the pix def do not do it justice.
And on top of that the hosts are wonderful
Can't recommend it enough"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One word: wow.
IMPORTANT: READ THE CHECK IN INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. Even if the gate opens, it’s imperative you wait outside the gate so you don’t accidentally end up on a neighbor’s property.
By doing so, you’ll help keep this place around and it is SO worth it. If you’re thinking it will be cold, I went in early February & found the comforter on the bed to be extremely warm. The shower also has hot water. (And had to be the most scenic and relaxing shower I’ve ever taken in my life).
Overall, would absolutely recommend, Santa Cruz was an easy drive away for other activities. If you’re afraid of heights, the ladder will be scary for you, but otherwise, the ladder is not difficult to navigate (you just need to focus). (:"
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"My mom and I really enjoyed ourselves. It was magical and such a unique experience that we will forever remember. Hopefully I can bring my son when he turns 18, but then again, he may not want to hang with his mom by then. Your communication was fabulous and dependable. There were a few things that could be leveled up, especially as people are paying a significant amount of money. The heater did not work (and though you offered to replace propane tank in an hour, it was late so not worth the hassle), and the windows could've been cleaned (per my mom). It was 33 degrees overnight, but luckily we wore layers and the comforter was SUPER warm! I understand the windows have since been cleaned and what a tough job that is, but it is also part of the allure . Aesthetically speaking, there were light bulbs missing and a few that didn't work. WE ADORED the bathroom and it was definitely the best shower of my life (so glad I read the reviews because I almost didn't shower). I loved the morning deer visits! Definitely a bucket list trip!! I recommend eating in Santa Cruz and visiting the UC Santa Cruz Botanical garden. THANK YOU!!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredible atmosphere of tranquility and beauty. This is a unique and memorable place to stay.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was truly a magical experience to stay at pinecone house for a night.
My boyfriend and I stayed in Jan and the weather was pleasant and there was no wind. The treehouse is surprisingly stable and insulated from the outside world. It’s chilly at night but the blanket keeps you decently warm. There were occasionally moths but otherwise not bothered by bugs.
The bathroom below was extremely clean and beautiful. The pump and heater wasn’t turned on during our stay.
We were pleasantly surprised that there was electricity and WiFi! At the treehouse! Very handy for charging up some electronics and lightweight use.
We read more about o2 treehouse and other creative works from the team after our stay and we are super inspired. Keep up the good work and thank you for building the pinecone house and keeping it well maintained for people like us to visit and stay!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Awesome awesome awesome definitely unforgettable, I have nothing bad to say Chandra was an awesome host along with the rest of the team who were great. Just suggest if you are scared of heights do not do this."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly what I dreamed it would be ! Such an amazing stay and beautiful scenery. It was a bit cold but we expected that during this time of year . Definitely dress warm in the colder seasons and bring boots/ shoes you don’t care about because it can get muddy. The hosts were great and very welcoming. Definitely recommend
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great stay and a unique experience everyone should take time to try a stay at this Airbnb!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A truly unique, amazing experience! Shannon and the team were super responsive and we had a wonderful time. Like other reviews mentioned:
-Make sure you're comfortable with heights and climbing a steep, 30-foot alternating rung ladder. I'm ok with heights and even then was a little nervous on the ladder the first couple of times.
-The bathroom is down the ladder and several feet away - it's not the easiest to reach in the nighttime, so be aware if you're someone who usually wakes up in the night to go to the bathroom.
-don't pack a lot - a backpack is best for going up and down the ladder. I carried both a backpack and food tote and that was just manageable. A suitcase would be really tough.
-Definitely bring long underwear! We stayed on Jan 1 - temps didn't go below freezing, but were just about. It can get cold up there, but Shannon & the team put several heavy blankets on the bed for us, which were super comfy.
All in all, highly recommend!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exactly as lovely as we expected… it was very clean when we got there and everything was explained well (even though I had to ask for information that was literally right in front of me in the handy guidebook oops) the treehouse is so much fun and it has such a lovely view and it sways in the wind which was delightful! What a wonderful and magical experience! It is definitely a lot like camping but much much better! Couldn’t have asked for more with the host they really went out of their way to make us comfortable even though it was a holiday! A must see if you love the outdoors and want to see them from a comfy treehouse!
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"For the value/ night at this treehouse I have to say our expectations were very high. Once we got there we were a bit disappointed as to how messy the area around the tree house was. Totally understand that trees fall and all of that but there was abandoned furniture and other random objects rotting around. Overall the treehouse is a unique stay, super nice to be listening to the rain amongst the trees. The hot shower was very nice. The space heater is more of a decoration since the treehouse ain’t fully enclosed the heat doesn’t retain at all but the bedding is VERY warm and kept us cozy alll night long. The host did do a good job at communicating with us and accommodating us. I really don’t mean for this to be a very “harsh” review, but I want to be honest about the expectations we had and our over all experience."
2021-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful, truly unique treehouse experience! The lighting, actual treehouse and decor is stunning!! If you're looking for a ""glamping"" sort of experience, I would absolutely recommend this place. I would, however, like to add a couple of notes of caution that I hope would help future guests during booking:
- The treehouse has no insulation so assume the temperature inside is the temperature outside
- There is a propane powered small space heater provided but you cannot run it throughout the night so it gets really cold especially since we went in the peak of winter
- The bathroom is very clean and has hot water provided but it is cold in there too. Also, note that there is a compostable toilet provided"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It’s a magician amazing experience with the treehouse windows opening up to the skies above. It is a steep climb of stairs to get in but that was anticipated from the reviews. Once inside it’s an amazing feeling being in the bed and looking up through the trees. The bedding is warm and comfy. The portable heater heats up but you will want to be under the covers in a cold night for sure. The lighting inside can dim to a very pretty glow. The shower is down the stair in the bathroom of course, so be prepared to have to go up or down the steep steps in the middle of the night if need be. The shower itself opens to a beautiful view as the hot steam feels oh so good as you gaze out into the trees. I loved it as did my girlfriend…. She was surprised and she thought it was amazing like I did"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"AWESOME PLACE! i have to say i been wanting to stay at this place for while and yes it was worth it, Great experience we had a lot fun. KiKi was very helpful she explained and answered all our question this is a place you wanna add in your bucket list. If you go during winter time take warm clothes! It gets pretty cold at night."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is magical and the Pine Cone is a piece of art - we're so lucky to be close to such an amazing experience in the heart of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The team organizing this is awesome, communication was great and they were flexible with my request around my husband's birthday, which I truly appreciate. The bed and sheets are super comfy and warm, the area is peaceful, there are hikes nearby... What else can one wish for an unplugged weekend? We slept to the sound of rainfall and woke up to serene, misty mornings. I would definitely go back."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,An experience like no other! Highly recommended!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pinecone treehouse is a little slice of heaven! It was definitely the coolest place we've ever stayed. Like the others have said, I recommend bringing things in a backpack. If you are afraid of heights I wouldn't recommend it because the ladder up is definitely an adventure. If you're on the fence - book it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is pure magic - I can't recommend it enough! Just a heads up that the ladder really is a bit steep so definitely bring a backpack for your stuff.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A magnificent piece of Art floating in the middle of the forest. The Pinecone Treehouse is absolutely stunning is every single way!
Dustin and the team were fantastic and communication was great. Thank you so much guys!
Oh, and be ready for the most unforgettable shower :)"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This treehouse is truly magical! An amazing place to unplug and enjoy the nature. Very short drive to Santa Cruz. Highly recommend.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Pinecone, wow. Just wow. An unparalleled experience, definitely lived up to expectations. Clean and beautiful, inside and out. Thank you to the host as well as the creators of this inspiring property. Thank you!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing stay! I would 100% stay here again. Definitely make sure to bring some water bottles and snacks on you, in the event you don’t end up leaving the pinecone. The space itself is beautiful, pretty pricy but if you have the extra money and enjoy the camping-type setting, then I would say spend it!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dustin, and Shannon were kind, friendly, and informative. The communication was detailed and helpful. Kiki was our check in coordinator, who gave us a great and welcoming run down of the treehouse, and Niko, the social media guy, was also friendly and helpful. All 4 staff were kind, welcoming, helpful, friendly, and seemed just as excited for us as we were to stay. The Treehouse is gorgeous!! The directions were easy to follow. We got food recs from the awesome staff, and this is a great, central location to the Wharf, Boardwalk,Downtown, trails, and the college. The views are like no other!! I recommend checking out the YouTube video for a small sample of the beautiful scenery, and to get a visual of how the Treehouse is set up. The designated parking was convenient, the stairs have sandpaper for easier grip, the bed is so so comfy too! Bring extra bedding just in case. There's a heater provided, but we didn't run it all night for safety reasons. The bathroom has a gorgeous view with Earth-friendly features, and the water gets really hot! We especially enjoyed laying in the comfortable bed and being able to see the woods from all angles. The owners are near by, but the local residences are just far enough away that you feel fully immersed in the Redwoods and Pine. The wifi is stable, the provided towels are big and soft, and we really appreciated the head lamps! We loved everything about this PineCone Treehouse. Thanks again, O2 team!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stay at the pinecone treehouse for my husband's 50th Birthday, and it was one of the memorable places we had ever stayed. I am sure that we will remember how we celebrated his 50th BD!
We had a wonderful time and was a special experience! Thank you!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an incredible experience 💖💖
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This experience is worth every dollar! We are so grateful to have experienced sleeping in a pinecone. We’re still mesmerized how this was engineered, it’s truly a work of art and a once in a lifetime experience to stay in it! We felt totally safe and at home, it’s the perfect balance of feeling like you’re in the wilderness but also knowing that the host Jamie lives on the property if we needed anything. There was heavy rain during our stay and that made it even more magical, going to sleep to the sound of rainfall was so cozy. The bed and blankets were extremely comfortable, the string lights were a romantic touch and even the bathroom is an experience in itself. Showering with the windows open to the view of the forest was blissful. Also special mention to Shannon for being so great to communicate with. I’m an AirBnB host myself and was really impressed with the easy communication and her hospitality in helping me move my dates around when I couldn’t make my original booking date. All in all 11/10 experience! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a unique stay. Sleeping in the pinecone and listening to the rainfall made our experience more enjoyable. It was scary for me walking up the ladder at first because I’m afraid of height, but after a few times up and down, I was ok with it. The area was so peaceful with beautiful trees surrounding. Having a toilet and hot water to shower were a plus. We definitely enjoyed this one of a kind place. Thanks for sharing your unique place with us."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dustin was a fantastic host. There were literally no difficulties booking and checking into the space and we had an absolute blast. This really was a seamless experience that I would highly recommend.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This listing is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I've been trying to book a stay with O2 Treehouses for a while now so I'm so happy I finally got the chance!
My girlfriend and I stayed fo stayed on an unseasonably warm fall night, so did not use the space heater although one was available. The description of the unique location was extremely accurate, with all the disclaimers and amenities made very clear. The hosts were super communicative and helpful with our arrival and checkout, even though were were slightly late to the checkin.
Although it is on the pricey side for an overnight stay, I would say that is is completely worth the extra $$$ for the experience alone :)"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Dustin and the hosts are helpful and communicative. the space itself is for anyone who enjoys climbing architecture and the outdoors. Somewhat open air but bed is warm and comfortable
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Speechless! You’ll never have another Airbnb experience like this one. I was a little surprised by the movement of the Pinecone at first but after some time you feel like you’re being gently cradled by nature. Like living in natural wonder, it was quite like a fairy tale experience!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a one of a kind stay. Truly special. Feels smaller than it looks but also feels incredibly large. It’s off a dirt road in a private residence above the UC Santa Cruz campus in Bonny Doons, and it was amazing. It’s something I checked off my bucket list and don’t think I’ll ever stay anywhere like this again. Dustin and the o2 team are amazing for having designed this. The place has its rough edges but… it’s a pinecone suspended from the trees, you’ll never see/experience anything like it again.
Few things
- if you’re scared of heights, might not be for you. It’s 30 feet in the air, suspended by 5 wires, and its really stable, but had a friend who came with me that decided they couldn’t sleep there due to the heights, though they visited.
- there’s one power strip and WiFi, and the shower is absolutely incredible… but when you’re in the pinecone expect some camping conditions outside the bed. There are some bugs/moths/spiders around the area and you need to expect that. You’re truly in nature and it’s beautiful.
- There’s a netting area you can hang out right below the main floor that’s pretty incredible/comfortable.
- During the day it can be hot, and at night it can be cold. No real windows in the place that open (when I visited), and there isn’t ac/fans etc, so just expect that. Santa Cruz and Bonny Doon are beautiful, go explore during the day - Santa Cruz’ as a city has amazing food and places to visit.
- nighttime + sunrise are incredible to be in the pinecone during. Can’t emphasize that enough."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a true experience. My wife and I spent one night in the Pinecone and it was amazing. The structure is remarkable. I found myself appreciating construction over and over. Once we got comfortable being suspended from trees in a structure that moves, we enjoyed the main area and the “hammock” area at the bottom of the Pinecone.
Waking up in the morning and being in the trees was beautiful. My wife said multiple times that she felt like she was in a birds nest.
We were both surprised at how quiet it was. We brought dice and cards and played games on the picnic table i to the night. There are some string lights by the picnic table and in the Pinecone which are nice.
I recommend this place for a unique experience and getaway. You need to be comfortable with climbing the ladder but once you understand how to navigate the stairs, you will love this place.
Thank you for sharing your place with us! Hope we can come back here or stay at another o2 Treehouse property in the future."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay there, this could be one of our most unique short vacations ever. Thank you Dustin, Kiki, and everyone that helped to build this special treehouse."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Well we’re still on a natural high from staying at the pinecone treehouse. Have never had such gracious caring hosts before ! I would compare them to my Sherpa in the Himalayas. Any questions were taken care of immediately! This treehouse is absolutely out of this world. Magical, spiritual , romantic , and I would say I chance in a life time if you can book a date. Thanks so much to Dustin and his team. Looking forward to more of his creations in the future. Jim and Carol"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Truly an unforgettable experience. Worth every single penny.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I first want to say a huge thank you to Dustin. I had booked this place last year when an opening magically appeared, but Mother Nature kept getting in the way and to make my stay as great as possible, Dustin kept accommodating me. And that did not go unnoticed! So by the time I finally got here this weekend…. All I could think was breathtaking! My friend and I had a lovely overnight getaway and we were both so impressed with the pinecone. At night it’s magical the way it’s lit up. We were worried we’d be cold at night but we actually got really hot and the bed kept us plenty warm. The open shower in the bathroom was great as well, I loved that you had a view of the redwoods. Dustin and his team are great and have created such a cool place for people to enjoy."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We recently stayed at the treehouse and had a wonderful time!
Dustin, our host and the rest of the team were very accommodating and the treehouse itself was amazing...a very unique experience in an extremely quiet, serene and peaceful setting."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing stay. Everything was perfect and exactly what you saw in pictures. Such a quiet and relaxing stay. Hosts were amazing with their communication and with anything we needed!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The experience was nothing short of magical. We stayed for the first couple nights of our honeymoon and it was the most unique possible stay we could have found. I wont lie, glancing down the ladder was a bit more intense than expected, but still totally worth the experience!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I and my husband stayed here for 2 nights for his birthday gift. He literally said that this was the best gift he got from me so far. This place is just mesmerizing. Its a true meaning of Glamping. It feels so different waking up to the sound of nature. The ladder ascending/descending would be a little tricky for the first time but soon after few tries you get used to it. Dustin and his team are super friendly and responsive. They even texted me the second day of my stay to make sure everything is ok with us. The pinecone itself is so picturesque and you can capture beautiful shots for your IG (if you’re an IG user like me). Book the first available spot when it gets open. It’s getting booked really fast. I’ve been after this for more than a year and I was so lucky to have the chance to experience staying in this awesome place.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful and amazing! Wonderful stay and the hosts were so nice and accommodating! Worth every penny!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The steps climbing up can be a little sketchy but think positive and you will be able to make it to the top. Worthwhile.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,the most amazing couples place to stay in CA. Period! such an unique immersive experience. You feel connected to nature but at the same time with the best comfort possible. My favorite part was the dawn! You wake up with an amazing sun raise and chirping. Really looking forward to come back!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved every bit about the Pinecone. Its beautiful, small but very comfortable, the bed kept us really warm, and all basic essentials (shampoo, soap, extra towels, and etc.) were offered. I highly recommend staying a night here!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We got a bit scared climbing up the stairs for the first time, it was pretty steep so I wouldn’t recommend people with acrophobia for this. But after the first try, climbing up and down became easy and fun.
It was truly a unique experience."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This treehouse is absolutely amazing!
It was like a dream!
Such an unforgettable experience!
The whole communication and check in process were really good.
The only thing that wasn’t good enough is the windows are too dusty, which almost blocked some of the view!
But overall this experience was definitely the most unique one I ever had!
Thanks to everyone who has been answering all my questions and helped me checking in!!"
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique and fun experience. Jamie, Dustin and team were very communicative and easy to work with. It’s also a short drive to town, which was a welcome surprise!
The pinecone itself is almost exactly what you would imagine from the photographs.
It is not quite as private as I expected. There are other people living on the property, but overall people keep to themselves."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It’s so uncommonly rare to be privileged with such a mystical and magical experience. The Pine Cone offers an eye-opening mixture of magical vision and artistic engineering.
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Really unique and cool experience. The bed in the trees is incredible, and it’s a joy to wake up to the sounds of the forest while being in a very comfortable bed. The whole experience is thought out and the instructions were very clear.
The room itself is fairly large and feels very safe and sturdy. You can’t really feel it sway that much - when you stand you can see it moving a little bit, but I’d say it’s significantly less than we anticipated.
The check in process went without a hitch and the host was very welcoming. There were no issues finding the place, and it’s really close to Santa Cruz proper, which was a nice surprise,
Our showers hot water didn’t work for the majority of the stay which was pretty unfortunate, but they said it was due to the propane tank being out of fuel and was fixed the morning we were supposed to check out. Dustin and co gave us a late checkout to allow us to shower. Not being able to shower was fairly frustrating as the cold water was absolutely frigid, so make sure you shower before hand in case it doesn’t work."
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The pinecone was as amazing as it was from the photos! We took great picture of it just with our phone.
Although the pinecone is made of glass, it was quite stable. The stairs was steep but also a great fun experience to climb up and down! We liked it. Because the room is on the upper part of the pinecone, the windows are facing upward. So other people can barely see the inside from the ground.
We were also lucky to spot deers in the woods.
We do see people got displaced from the fire living nearby. They were quiet and friendly :)
Some small things we found a bit inconvenient - one was that there wasn't hot water. So we wasn't able to take a shower. It was really cold at night, so a hot shower could have been helpful. We wasn't able to connect to wifi but there were cellular signals. Another thing is the compostible toilet. I was sensitive to the smell when opened the hole. But the ventilation of the restroom was great so most of the time it's the fresh smell of the redwoods."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this location and experience. I'm a sucker for treehouses and very proud to say that I'll be looking forward to attending more treehouses of all types in the near future. This stay was very special for me since my brothers and I use to build our own as kids.
A few tips:
The heater(s) may not work (it didn't for us) so you might want to bring extra clothes.
Bring an extra roll of toilet paper, always have extra.
The road down to the treehouse is drivable for most cars, just go slow and you'll be fine.
The Wi-Fi is spotty at best and it didn't work for us, but it's nature so it won't hurt not having it.
The ladder is best suited for taller people, if you're short you will get that blood flowing.
Make sure the backpack you bring isn't a wide one since it might not fit through the floor hatch/door.
We enjoyed the experience and the architecture of course. If you're doing it for IG... this is for you. If you love nature and glamping... this is for you. Please believe if you're afraid of heights this is most certainly not for you. If you take your time to read the reviews you'll be fine.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you're looking for a unique stay in the trees, this is an awesome experience! The climb up and down can be a bit intimidating if youre scared of heights, but felt perfectly safe getting up and down the ladder. The pinecone itself is a beautiful structure and just fun to experience. It was a great night in the trees!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a truly a once in a lifetime magical experience! The design and engineering of the structure is absolutely incredible! The design triggers the imagination and we were able to disconnect from the world suspended in the trees!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Responsive owner. Nice place. Had everything we needed. Thanks for having us!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quite an enchanting and romantic tree house. At night, it looked like it was floating up in the air. It evoked a feeling of being in a storybook. Gave us Studio Ghibli vibes.
Jan was very responsive and communicative. Overall, my partner and I had a magical and memorable adventure. :)"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very special treehouse. The location was perfect, the treehouse perched high in the Redwoods with the back deck west facing for some magical sunsets. The fog rolls into the mountain ridges and the tree lines for a truly mystical vibe. So peaceful!! The wrap around deck was furnished nicely with tables and chairs. The inside was well appointed and luxurious. Exceeded expectations and was extremely comfortable and cozy. The amenities were above and beyond, so many personal touches! The kitchen was nice for cooking some simple meals and fridge was a decent size. The treehouse was so nice and enjoyable we would have loved to prepare more meals and not go out. It took a little bit of skill in the kitchen to prepare some food with limited space and only one burner and the toaster did not work. Over all it was well stocked with pots and pans, silverware and dishes. Everything we needed was available. I would love to stay again, it was wonderful!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely amazing place to stay. Super unique and cute and clean. We had a great time. Highly recommended!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I adored this place. It was just what we needed to reconnect. We will most definitely be back again to enjoy the peace, quiet and serenity. Thank you! ☺️"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cool stay at Pacific View Treehouse! Pretty easy to find the location, just have to be looking out for the turn when driving down the winding highway. The place was something out of a fairytale. And not to mention super clean, easy to get into, and well outfitted with all basic amenities. Beautiful view from the deck that showcased foggy, misty hills in the evenings and early mornings, and illuminating blue skies on the green scenery by day. Not that much can be done for this, but my only wish is the road was out of sight/ear shot. Not particularly disturbing but noticeable.
Overall wonderful place to stay, we really enjoyed our time and experience. Jan provided a nice, extensive list of different to-dos in the area which was especially helpful for finding food and hikes. This list was provided once the reservation was confirmed so we knew well in advance different options in the area. 10/10 would stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful and clean treehouse—exactly what you think of when you dream about a little house in the trees!—and the hosts clearly were very thoughtful about stocking amenities! Kitchen had everything you needed if you wanted to cook, as did the bathroom. The treehouse itself was of course an absolutely stunning escape and waking up to the sound of rain was such a lovely experience. Thanks for having us—we had an absolutely amazing time!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such an amazing airbnb experience! We loved staying at the beautiful treehouse - everything about it was so thoughtful. Highly recommend for a weekend getaway for the most relaxing and lovely stay :)
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I spent the weekend here for his birthday. We were both in awe of how amazing this treehouse was, definitely surpassed the pictures online. I would highly recommend. Jan was very responsive and super helpful in offering up some local spots we were able to get to during our stay. The space is filled with everything you would need to make yourself feel right at home. I can’t wait till we can make it back for another visit!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our 2-night stay at PVT exceeded all our expectations! It's beautifully built and decorated and had all the amenities that we could've needed for the weekend. The seating areas on the balcony were wonderful for enjoying the views during meals. The fireplace in the bedroom was perfect for the cold nights and was surprisingly powerful! Jan provided some thoughtful recommendations for hikes nearby. Her directions came in clutch because google maps took us in the wrong direction. And shout out to the Logan who was quick to help us when we accidentally locked ourselves out of the outhouse haha
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The PVT is a really nice treehouse. Having never stayed in one, I do not have a point of comparison, but this one is really nice. It is small, but every inch of the tree house is well utilized. It was a little difficult to have to use the bathroom separate from the treehouse, but I understand why that was done. The staircase is very steep and probably wouldn't be good for large or unfit people. The bedroom window did not have a curtain on the side facing residences, but we hung up a blanket. I don't want those points to take away from a great a novel experience. This tree house is really nice and the location is peaceful and quiet and the host was super helpful and responsive. I would book this place again if I wanted to experience a tree house."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bucket List - YES !!! We stayed two nights at PVT and LOVED every minute! The location is gorgeous. We drove up from Los Angeles and the last 30 minutes driving past O'Neill Forebay and the San Luis Reservoir and the green hills was such a nice entrance for this scenic getaway. The treehouse is in a small grove of redwoods and looks out over a huge meadow with an incredible view. We enjoyed many hours on the balcony - playing board games, talking, watching hawks circling over the meadow, and soaking up the panoramic view and breathing the fresh air. We wanted to maximize our time in the treehouse, so we brought our food with us. We appreciated the mini fridge, microwave and dishes. We watched movies at night and the heater kept us cozy. We also drove to Mt. Madonna County Park, which was just up the road, and went hiking one weekday. We had the trail to ourselves and were thrilled to hike in the redwoods. PVT is classy! Every detail of PVT was perfect and we hope to return!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse was so beautiful. Peaceful surroundings. At one point it got really foggy and it felt like we were in the clouds. Once it cleared it smelled like fresh trees. The house had coffee pods and little snack bars, which was a nice little touch. I would recommend this place for any couple trying to get away from the stresses of life."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"PVT was such an amazing experience. I took my visiting boyfriend who’s not from the area to show off the beauty of California and the treehouse did just that. The architecture, design, and decor did not disappoint. I made the unfortunate decision to arrive after sunset, which I would not recommend, however the host was extremely helpful to provide direction because it does get pretty dark at night. Temperature does get rather cold, but the heater upstairs keeps the bedroom nook pretty toasty. I would recommend to keep cooking expectations to a minimum. If there was a mini toaster oven/ air fryer that would’ve made toasting my bagel bites better than microwaving them lol. All in all, pretty awesome experience and the views are just immaculate!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I needed a quick PVT was perfect. It’s a quiet getaway, has a unique touch with an awesome experience. We LOVED the drive up, it felt like we were driving through an enchanted forest! The greenery and how the sun peaks through, she was absolutely a passenger princess.
Once we arrived and saw the property everything was just as described, and BETTER!!! They did a great job having everything we needed, even board games and wonderfully smelling scented candles, great touch! This place did not miss with the details or the thoughtfulness. If you can’t tell we ENJOYED PVT! You won’t be disappointed. I would recommend grabbing some snacks/food before your drive up. I would give this place 10 🌟if I could, excellent job and thank you PVT!!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is unique and amazing. You can tell that it was built with attention to detail. Even though it's a treehouse, it feels roomy enough for two people. It may be more expensive than some other places you'll find in a search on Air B and B, but believe us, it is totally worth it! A truly unique place to spend a night or two!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful private retreat. Host was very helpful and the place was super clean. Only issue was finding it because it was so well hidden (which is what I signed up for). But once there...it was glorious. Highly recommend for peace and solitude.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such an amazing weekend get away. Unlike any place I have ever stayed. Although I am from the area, I did not feel like I was in Watsonville at all. The views were immaculate and the location is completely private. The attention to detail was astounding, from the green details throughout the house to the local soaps and wax melts given, we could tell how much love and effort was put into this treehouse. We loved the games and had a great time enjoying the peace and quiet. We drove 10 mins down the hill and grabbed Cassidy’s Pizza for dinner, so close and convenient and recommend for anyone staying who wants an easy to-go meal. :)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Absolutely wonderful (and comfortable) treehouse. I have already been recommending this place to friends.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay and would recommend this place to anyone that has any interest in staying here. In the future we definitely plan to stay here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse is beautiful and so very cozy. The views are spectacular and the stunning natural surroundings are very peaceful and relaxing. We had such a wonderful time, I didn’t want to leave!!"
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The space was fantastic and was more than I could have expected. With the unusually cold temperatures the space was a bit chilly tho. Also communication could have been more effective, we were not provided the code for the gate and had to wait over an hour. I would still recommend staying here as the treehouse is so amazing and the attention to detail inside is immaculate"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Me and my girlfriend stayed the night here for part of our anniversary. It was a surprise to her and one that left her speechless. A beautiful place and location- really gives you the feeling of being off the grid somewhere special. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something like this!
Thanks again for everything Jan!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. We absolutely loved it. The upstairs bedroom was so cozy - it rained while we were there so we got to enjoy the sound of raindrops on the roof, the cool mountain air, and a toasty little fire in the mini fireplace. There are two outside decks with amazing views of the forest and the valley.
Suffice it to say that owning a treehouse is now on my lifelong lists of goals."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was beautiful and peaceful! Very unique!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome treehouse!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The PV Treehouse was absolutely stunning! Beautiful views and such a cozy place to stay. Jan was a great host and even left a welcome letter and some sparkling cider for us on check in.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I’ll never forget this stay! The treehouse is absolutely perfect! The place was soooo clean and organized. Jan was clear with her instructions and super nice/responsive. The detail put into the construction of the treehouse and outhouse is one of a kind. This is the perfect treehouse getaway. It has everything you’d need for comfort but still feels like you’re in a treehouse. I can’t say enough about this place and would recommend to anyone. We didn’t want to leave! Thank you for the wonderful experience.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely place, quiet and peaceful vibes. Made for a memorable getaway."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I only stayed in the treehouse for a short time, but it was AMAZING!! Jan was extremely communicative and proactive about checking in with us after the crazy storm that hit. The place was unique and romantic and perfect for a special weekend getaway. Brand new, super clean, and very cozy. It was private, quiet, and peaceful and Jan/Logan made us feel completely at home. I've always wanted to stay in a treehouse, and this one was the best of the best. So glad we stumbled upon this place!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had the pleasure to stay at this awesome tree house! Took the wife for her birthday and we both enjoyed every minute of it. The only thing that would’ve made it more magical was if it was raining hahah. It feels like they put a lot of attention into the details to make it homie and one of a kind. We will definitely be coming back for a weekend getaway in the future. Highly recommend checking this place out. Jan couldn’t have made it easier for check in and check out!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jan’s treehouse is one of the most special airbnbs I’ve ever had the chance to stay in. My partner and I were looking to get out in nature in a cozy space, with great views of the mountains. We got this and so much more from Jan’s place. The treehouse has everything you need and many charming details to appreciate. You can tell from the level of detail, love and care she has invested in the space this was a true passion project. Highly recommend a stay here!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a lovely stay at this beautiful treehouse! Instructions were clear and the place was stocked with amenities. One thing we noticed is that the bathroom smoke decor is a little sensitive to steam which made for a bit of an alarming shower. Once we figured that out it was fine. Everything is clean, organized and they do a great job of making use of a tight space. It is comfortable and homey, perfect for a cozy weekend getaway. This is such a memorable place to spend the night!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s perfect for a couples gateway
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely a lovely experience. The treehouse was comfortable and cozy. The environment was relaxing and simply beautiful. Waking up with the redwoods was surreal! Making a delish cup of coffee and sitting on the deck each morning recharged our spirits. Highly recommend .
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a fantastic time. The tree house is magical. It has all the amenities you need and is really well designed. It was raining when we arrived but that turned out great. With the sound of rain and a small fireplace next to the bed we had the best sleep in years. Would highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great birthday/anniversary weekend getaway! A quintessential escape at this cozy treehouse in the mountains of Watsonville. Near local farms and lots of fun spots to hit on the drive. Headed up with the intention to spend most of the time in Big Sur, but was pleasantly surprised by the location of the AirBnb. Thanks Jan :)"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The treehouse was super awesome. It was very secluded, a really cool deck, and beautiful views. Super cool looking and photogenic place. Directions and check in were very easy. The views and deck of the treehouse were great. The bedroom was very cozy and has a small electric fireplace and TV for movies with window views. The treehouse was stocked with cooking utensils, glasses, silverware, a hot plate, board games, snacks, etc. Pretty much anything you need for a cozy little cabin stay. Great get away for a couple!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend this place. Terrific location, easy walk to the water, peaceful. Beautiful house--the kitchen is particularly lovely. Very comfortable. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I absolutely loved my stay, my family and I didn’t want to leave! So close to the beach we took the kids to the arcade, only 4 mins away!

2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great location , beach is a few blocks away . House is beautiful and the hot tub was a plus. We had 5 of us ladies and felt very safe in the neighborhood. I did read the reviews about no wine glasses so I brought our own , though I didn’t see any reviews about limited towels. 6 towels for 5 ladies staying 3 nights is clearly not enough. Our host was very responsive and quick to respond to any questions. The only other recommendation other than bring towels is to bring ear plugs if your staying in the room that has the tenet above . They are very respectful but sound travels from above"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great House! with all you need.

2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice neighborhood. It was easy to walk to West Cliff to see the ocean and the surf. We were able to walk to the wharf. We were also able to walk to an area with good coffee and restaurants. Enjoyed the hot tub and the well-stocked kitchen. The beds were comfortable. Enjoyed the keyless entry. The communication was good and check-in and check-out were straightforward. The only thing we had slight struggle with was the television as the instructions were not very clear on how to watch live TV (eg Warrior basketball games). We did finally figure out how to charge the remote and watch the games. Had a great time!
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"House was clean and nice however the pictures did not match, there were loud tenants partying all night and the cleaning fee of $260 for one night was not disclosed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our post Xmas family hang in Santa Cruz was just as we hoped. A perfect winter beach dream. Ovr’s home was spectacular! Easy access, parking out front, a couple of blocks from an incredible ocean view, immaculate house while also being homey & comfy, better than expected, more beautiful than photos depicted, every kitchen utensil & appliance you could need, clean hot tub, cozy living room to watch movies, read or play games, comfy beds, and a lovely back patio to BBQ."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home, host was relatively responsive considering there are multiple properties"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was absolutely beautiful. It is light and open, and well cared for. The kitchen was perfect for preparing big meals, and has every tool you can think of. We loved the jacuzzi and the yard.
The only possible downside was the occupied living space/rental unit above the back bedroom - the stairs are over the bed, and even normal/considerate use occasionally interrupted sleep. But they were clearly being good neighbors."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved this house
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Second time we have stayed here! Clean, large, open, walkable to the beach/west cliff drive, close to downtown. Definitely will return!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location in a safe neighborhood walkable to the beach! The cleaning fee was more than I was used to seeing, but it was well worth it as the house was spotless. All amenities were provided for. The bed in the front bedroom could use a bit of oil/tightening(?), and we were never able to figure out how to log in to the streaming services on the TV, but neither problem was major for a 1-night stay. The hosts even said they would look into a white noise machine we left behind! Great service and property."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot , very comfortable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spent a week here with my boyfriend. The host was super responsive when we asked if there was extra propane for the grill. The house itself was so comfortable and cozy. It was really nice having the hot-tub and outdoor shower. The kitchen had everything we needed. The neighborhood is quiet with plenty of parking and a super short walk to the coast. Highly recommend this place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great stay. We were here for a wedding and walked everywhere. The house was clean and had what we needed to cook. The hot tub is wonderful. The TV was a little difficult to figure out, but the wii device was left on. The temperature was beautiful, so no hvac needed. Note that you do need to leave by 11. We left at 10:54am and the person arrived to start cleaning. It's a very pretty home."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very well-equipped kitchen, great for cooking home-cooked meals. The house was missing a few basic supplies (hopefully these will be fixed for the next guests) but overall we had a fabulous stay and loved the location, kitchen amenities, comfy beds, and outdoor shower. We hope to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice and quiet place for a family retreat in Santa Cruz. The Coastal walk and Boardwalk are in walking distance. We would love to come back one day.

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was matching the descriptions and our expectations. Had a great stay.
Only point was that one of the bedrooms (with washer and dryer) is not well sound isolated and we were able to hear the upstairs neighbours really well."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place. Stayed with some extended family and kids and had plenty of space for everyone. Huge kitchen and very luxurious interior. Kitchen was extremely well-stocked, could have cooked multiple gourmet meals there. Indoor/outdoor space with jacuzzi was awesome. And most of all can't beat the location. Quiet neighborhood but still walking distance to the Boardwalk, beach, and amazing views on west cliff drive."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The house is gorgeous and set up really well for family dinners & relaxing in the hot tub or back yard.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house has everything we needed, and was very clean. Wi-Fi worked perfectly, we were able to work from home without any issue. House is located in a quiet neighborhood, and it’s best to have a car to go around because there are no restaurant super near. Overall recommend the place, the host was also very responsive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay. Very clean, couches and beds were comfortable. You can walk to the boardwalk if you’re determined, but it’s 3/4 mile, so we drove and paid to park since we have two small kids. Wonderful location for a morning jog, as you can go straight east until you hit the ocean, and wrap around to the south along the coast until Lighthouse beach, and then straight back north for a great little 1 mile loop. Outdoor shower was great after long sandy beach days. The kids had fun playing in the gated front yard while we relaxed on the porch. The front bedroom gets A TON of light in the morning through the skylight, so make sure a morning person is in that room. We will stay here again!"

We simply did not want to leave, and are already thinking about making a return trip!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet spacious house walkable to the Boardwalk. With the outdoor shower and half bath it’s basically got two bathrooms, which was handy as I was there with four teens. One thing to note, the windows in the common spaces lack screens (windows in bedrooms all have them) but we didn’t find too many bugs getting in. Kitchen is a dream and had loads of cooking gear. Would recommend."

Host was attentive and communicative.
Highly recommended!"

The house is located in a beautiful quiet neighborhood and conveniently located just a 2-3 minute drive to the boardwalk and ocean. This house has so much space for our family of 4 and my mom.

House was very clean and hot tub was clean and well-maintained. We used the outdoor shower every day! This was one of the most well-stocked AirBnB kitchens I've encountered--really appreciated that. One of the sliding doors in the house was a little wonky, but that's my only complaint. We'd stay here again."

Best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had! 10/10!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful house! Perfect location, great for families or couples, a wide variety of games and puzzles. Approximately 3 blocks to the ocean and a quick walk to the boardwalk. Would highly recommend and stay here again."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This modern, clean and comfortable. house embodies a vibe that is cool and relaxing. The beautiful grounds, comfortable furniture, large kitchen, and spacious hot tub provide comfort and convenience. The beach and nearby boardwalk offer entertainment just a short walk away."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The location of the house is perfect. Easy walking distance to the boardwalk, beach and some great restaurants and coffee shops. The quality of the communal areas of the house are also very nice. The bed in the 3rd bedroom is essentially just a mattress on the floor so ok for young kids but not very comfortable for adults at all. The quality of all beds, bedding and the bathroom (water pressure poor / blocked drains) are not as perfect as the living areas of the home - they need a little more TLC for the price point of this property. Overall a nice property we were just expecting a little more for the price."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Our group really loved this Airbnb! The hot tub was amazing! Great beautiful neighborhood with walking distance to the pier and shops! Would definitely stay again
2022-04-01,4.0,Group trip,I’ve stayed at many airbnb’s in Santa Cruz and this spot was perfect for our large family. Minutes away from the beach and wow that kitchen was stunning. The hot tub was amazing top notch jacuzzi. Can’t wait to stay here in the future!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is great! Prime location, very clean, easy check-in, fast communication, and perfect for our family of 4. We got in late and the place was easy to find and check-in. There was even a supply of Keurig k-cups so we were able to have coffee the next day before hitting the grocery store. We walked everywhere. It’s 15-20 minutes to almost everything in town that you’d want to do. This town is made for walking and biking! We came for mountain biking and discovered a trail just a few minutes away to put us on a safe route to hit Wilder Ranch. And it has a couple of lemon trees in the yard which is what we love about California! We were able to make the 16 hour drive in 1 day from Seattle to get warm weather and sun. We definitely recommend this house and Santa Cruz!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,absolutely gorgeous place.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came with my parents, my wife and kids. The two living spaces really made the place feel big. The floor plan and living spaces were eloquently designed. My wife and I walked out the door, and found some competitive doubles volleyball across the street, while the kids hit the beach. The house had some really fun bicycles, and then also a plethora of surf boards. My daughter and I went back out to the beach after dinner and there was a fun band playing. Just the right mix of solitude at the place and people and things to do steps away."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location- house is awesome. This will be our go-to spot when in SC

I stocked the fridge and loved cooking in the kitchen- lots of sunlight, lovely plates, glassware and silverware. Beautiful ocean views during the day and fireplaces at night kept the ambiance at all times. Bathrooms are super nice- loved the upstairs shower with the skylight/option to open for warm breeze. Sunsets at the beach were sweet, never crowded. Hosts Evan & David were responsive and always helpful. Highly recommended!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our rental in Santa Cruz. We were so close to everything we needed and the house was perfect for us. The house was clean and had everything we needed to feel comfortable. If your looking for a great location in a house with all the essentials this is it.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a special house in an a brilliant location. The beach is small, perfect, and right across the road. We were there in the winter so it was great for walking on the beach and watching the waves from the house. The house feels newly constructed and is high quality. We enjoyed the hot tub."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic property - the remodel was very well executed. The skylights with motorized shutters and opening made the environment very light and open. It's just across the street from the Twin Lakes beach and the yacht harbor is right around the corner. Well stocked kitchen was a welcome surprise. Including e-bikes and making kayaks available is another way that this rental goes to the next level. Would for sure stay here again in the future.
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Beachfront with all the necessary amenities. Perfect for two couples or 5-6 people.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb stay my family has ever had!
This house was absolutely gorgeous!! It looked even better than the pictures. So modern, comfortable and clean. The balconies have perfect beach views. The living room downstairs has a remote that makes a large flatscreen rise up out of a hidden place that was perfect for movie night. There is really great heating in the home, and the bathroom flooring is heated. The beds were so comfortable. Plentiful linens, towels, pillows, soaps, and blankets. There were enough electric bikes for us all to go cruise around town which was so much fun, I couldn't be happier we got that unexpected experience!! There were also paddle boards, surf boards,and kayaks (which I will have to try next time) We had a wonderful time and will definitely plan to come back. Anyone who stays here will love it. 10/10 would recommend!! Thank you Evan for being the best host, and making us feel right at home. You're awesome!!
-oh and WE LOVED THE HOT TUB TOO! 😊"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place! Just steps from the beach, with incredible ocean views, we did not want to leave the house. Morning coffee as the sun came up while we watched the waves was the highlight!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The beach house is bright & beautiful, well stocked (sharp chef’s knives!), and the location is prime…you can bike to the point market in 1 minute!! Jackie was an exceptional host and hooked us up with some great tips to make the most of our stay. When we discovered a piece of the bed frame had come loose, she responded promptly and came over to fix it at a time that was convenient for us. 11am checkout means you can take those chill vacation vibes with you when you leave. Highly recommend a stay at this gem, we can’t wait to go back! 💎"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Extremely helpful host, all the amenities we needed for a family of 3 and nice walking trails near the house. Would book her place again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a great time at the Pleasure Point Beach House. Jackie made it very welcoming for us and the dog. Back yard was a perfect area for the dog to play and catch some rays. We also enjoyed the front porch for morning coffee and to watch the people/surfers head to the beach. Location was outstanding, just a few short blocks to the beach. While the street was a little busy, the house was quiet and comfortable. And such a cute house as well!"

The house was very clean and had comfy beds, a well-stocked kitchen, and plenty of beach items (chairs, towels, sand toys, boogie boards). The beach cruisers were also a lot of fun to ride around. The house is on a quiet street and the backyard was great for hanging out and for our dog to run around. Pleasure Point is a great place to walk along the ocean and watch the surfers. Jackie is an excellent host--always friendly and responsive, and she kindly left us a welcome gift and a toy for our dog. I highly recommend Jackie's place and hope to be able to come back for another stay!"

Not only is the location within easy walking distance to the beach, but it’s well equipped (I mean, everything we could need or want is there, including a swath of awesome board games), comfortable with great beds, a comfy sofa, and a large dining table with great decor. It also has a fabulous backyard with a patio and grill.

We were in town for UCSC family weekend and our daughter stayed with us so we appreciated the second bedroom and the roomy living room and kitchen. And the washer/dryer were big and perfect for our needs! The house is super cute, a couple of blocks from the beach, and the neighborhood felt safe and quiet. It was so nice to have a driveway, as lots of cars were always parked on the street. Jackie was super responsive and friendly!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved everything about this beach bungalow getaway with all the amenities!! Only 2 short blocks to the beach to watch world class surfers! 🏄‍♂️ Or take a quick bike ride to shops & restaurants (or order delivery!) If considering & it’s available you should not hesitate to book immediately and prepare to rejuvenate!☀️🌊 (Also prepare for your wife to cry when you leave! 😅) Quaint porch for a quiet cuppa or intermittent people watching, private yard for bonfires, BBQs, & outdoor shower to get the sand off after ocean adventures. Host provided beach bikes, boogie boards, board games, pack n play, high chair, firepit with wood & Duraflame logs, abundant linens/dishes, plenty of Pete’s coffee/raw sugar, wonderful welcome goodies & adorable beach themed squeaky toys for our pups, (which they instantly dragged everywhere, slept on top of, and adored!) We felt totally welcome 🙌 and are already planning a return visit! 😍 Loved every moment at this sweet retreat.💕Thank you!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second time staying here and everything was perfect again! The location is great, a few short blocks away from Pleasure Point, so we enjoyed walking down to watch the surfers and hit the Penny Ice Creamery on 41st four days in a row. The kitchen has all of the amenities you need to cook at home and plenty of space in the pantry/laundry room for storing extra stuff. Our dog enjoyed the welcome toy and the spacious backyard. We'll be back!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second visit at Jackie’s Pleasure Point House. It is the airbnb where we feel like home.

The location is great and walkable. We hope to return soon."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our repeat stay at Jackie’s beach house. Our family of four and our dog always feel at home. Just two short blocks to the ocean for great views and the Point Market for breakfast burritos.
Jackie is responsive and proactive should needs emerge (and they almost never do)! We will definitely be back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jackie’s place felt like home right away. She somehow managed to have everything we needed while also maintaining a spotless and organized home.
We brought our dog who loved the backyard and short walk to beaches. We followed the host’s advice and got the breakfast burrito from the corner store by a local surf spot and were not disappointed to say the least.
Thank you for welcoming us to your space and surroundings. We’re looking forward to returning soon."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jackie's place is the best air bnb we have experienced. great location. Our furry friend loves this place. Great backyard. Love that she always makes it personal. Great beaches near by. We will always return when staying in Santa Cruz.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are repeat customers and Jackie doesn't disappoint! She's one of the few Air BnB hosts that invests in her home ongoing. Love it! She recently upgraded the pots and pans and also installed a new oven/range. She is literally the perfect host! Kind, helpful, loves to provide suggestions, and most of all she is super responsive to anything we might need.
We adore this home too! Jackie keeps it scent free which is a blessing to us and to anyone that has chemical and fragrance sensitivities. None of that stinky stuff here! The home is darling, from the front yard-through the home-and into the enjoyable backyard. everything is a treat and is everything that we could ask for.
But wait... there's more! The location! Very close to the beaches along Pleasure Point. We could sit out there all day and watch the waves-surfers-seals-otters-etc. Get a breakfast burrito at the market too! Heaven! The area is very walkable too. Nice homes to admire. Enjoy!!!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Family of three stayed with our 1.5 year old toddler at this super cute beach house!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! It's a compact house, but super comfortable and efficient. And best of all, it's within easy walking distance to the beach.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is our fifth stay at Jackie’s place with our grown son and dog’s and had the best experience imaginable. The house is located just 5 minutes from the beach, and we walked there every single day with the dogs for them to get their “beach time”!
The place also comes with bicycles, beach toys, fire pit with wood in the backyard for s’mores!!, so you’ll have everything you need during your stay. We loved the small details like a hand-written welcome note, bottle of wine and new dog toys!
The house is located on a quiet side street, but it’s possible to walk to shops and restaurants in less than 15 minutes."

A very lovely place. It's clear that Jackie takes care the place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are returning guests at Jackie's beautiful house in Pleasure Point, which should tell you how much we love the home. Jackie has done a fantastic job to offer her home to vacationers. It's the perfect size for us, and is simply a joy to stay in. Coffee in the morning, lunch on the back patio, evening cocktail on the front porch, dinner at the table... walk to the beach... it's all perfect!
The best part of this home is that it's scent-free! So many other vacation homes that we have stayed in stink to high heaven! The overpowering smell of cleaners, air ""fresheners"", dryer sheets, scented soap, and all kinds of other chemical-based products hit you as soon as you open the door. But not here! Jackie maintains a 100% scent-free home, which is a blessing to people like us that have chemical and fragrance sensitivities. We love that Jackie values these things!
We will certainly be back, and this is the only place that we will stay! Thank you Jackie for being such an angel!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Jackie’s place was absolutely perfect for our Santa Cruz getaway—she definitely thought about the guest experience when stocking the place! It feels like home. We loved the backyard for our pups. We didn’t want to leave! We will be back.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is an amazing cottage located exactly where you want to be in order to have walkable beach access, cool views of the surfers, delicious eats and super comfy home. We loved our stay here within walkable distance of everything. The huge plus for us was that the place is pristine clean, has SO many wonderful little touches (dog bowls, delicious coffee, warm blankets for breezy nights, modern kitchen, cute decor, endless really). We were here as a couple visiting friends in Santa Cruz, golfing, and just generally relaxing with our dog while our house had some work done it. However, would love to bring our 2 yr old grandson some day as Jackie had a cute wagon filled with sand toys, a high chair, safety plugs on all the outlets, and lawn chairs available for guests. You will feel fully pampered at this darling place!
Don't miss burritos at Point Market and Falafel Bowls at Zameen's all within walking distance. For a longer walk, downtown Capitola is less than 2 miles."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place near the Point with an amazing host. Jackie ways very proactive, reaching out during the course of our stay to ensure we had everything we needed. She made sure there was a high-chair and pack-n-play for us when we arrived, and had extra outlet covers shipped to us to be sure we had enough (there were already plenty, but she wanted to make sure everything was perfect). The beach house was awesome, clean, and just as described. Great private backyard, perfect for grilling while the kids play in the grass. Having access to bikes, beach toys, and a wagon made trips to the beach a breeze (along with the outdoor shower for keeping the sand outside). We loved our stay and would happily stay with Jackie again."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,we stayed here for 3 nights with our two Yorkie poos for a long weekend. we loved it! our favorite thing was probably the fenced in backyard because our puppies could run and play. they were so happy! they also loved the toys that the host left as a gift for them! the house itself is super cute and very spacious. everything looks like it is from a magazine! the kitchen is pretty well stocked with dishes. there are lots of boardgames to play. I only slept in the bed in the room with the backdoor but it was really comfortable. the sofa is big and comfortable too. the outside area is really nice in the back with chairs and a firepit and there is also a nice porch on the front. there is a driveway to park in. the beach is walking distance. I don't think it's even two blocks away. there is a convenience store by the beach. there are also lots of little local restaurants nearby. the neighborhood itself is super cute and quiet. lots of nice beaches nearby. I would def stay again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous stay and awesome home! Loved this AirBNB. So many top-quality amenities including fluffy, thick towels and a well-stocked kitchen. The bed linens were nice too; smelled fresh and clean. It's also spacious and comfortable, with a great backyard. I have stayed at many AirBNBs (and VRBOs), and Jackie's place ranks in the top.
As a host, Jackie is responsive, friendly and helpful. We will be back!"

The house is comfy/adorable with a well appointed kitchen and great outdoor space to hang out and do all the pre/post surf things. Traveling with kids, she has a pack and play, booster seat, kid friendly table ware, a folding wagon, and all the sand things already at the house. Easy walk to surf, playground, coffee and restaurants or even quicker on one of the beach cruisers at the house. Jackie is super kind and easy to interact with. We absolutely love the place and hope to come back soon!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a great way to spend some stormy weather in Santa Cruz. Jackie was very responsive and helpful in any concerns.

- clean, comfortable and close to the beach."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We celebrated Thanksgiving here, and appreciated the well-appointed kitchen. the dining room, and the lovely back yard, perfect for two toddlers to romp and frolic. We didn't take full advantage of the bikes, beach toys, and outside shower (a bit too cold in November!), but it was great to know that we could."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is in a wonderful location close to the beach. The place is very clean and has every amenity you can think of. There is bikes, beach chairs, beach towels, a wagon full of beach toys, a large backyard and that is just for your activities. Inside is very clean and spacious. The Host is very kind and quick to return on messages sent.
Highly recommend!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is such an awesome beach house! The place was perfect for our family. Lots of games, beach, toys, etc. The place was super tidy and very comfortable. The location has to be the best available in Santa Cruz. We had a car and did lots of excursions but I could imagine just chilling out in the area without having to drive anywhere. I hope we are able to return one day. Thanks, Jackie!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This rental is well equipped with everything that you need for your stay and is very comfortable. Perfect location with only a short walk to Pleasure Point and the beach. Highly recommended!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was PERFECT! Jackie was an amazing host who accommodated both of my dogs after chatting it through. Her house was STUNNING and so conveniently located! Not only the house was in great condition but all the amenities were in great shape! Traveling with 2 dogs means having to cook in the house I stay in so it’s really important to me to rent a house with a good working kitchen and good pots and pans, etc. All kitchen amenities were more than I could’ve asked for! The location was perfect in a quiet neighborhood and we just loved every second of it. The outdoor shower came in handy many times after a fun filled day at the beach! We had a wonderful time and we’ll be back!! Thank you Jackie for being a wonderful host and allowing us to enjoy your beautiful home! 🐾🐶"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome house in great location. The house is well equipped and great for kids. Jackie is super responsive, too. We had a really enjoyable stay!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute home away from home. Walking distance to the beach and friendly neighbors.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our fourth year staying at Jackie's fabulous beach house and it never disappoints. Our dogs look forward to the short walk to the beach each morning for hours of playtime, only to come home for a short rest before heading to a local dog friendly brewery or restaurant. The house always has everything we need with plenty of appliances/kitchenware, cruiser bikes and one of our favorites, the fire pit (stop by Lucky's for a quick already made up bag of all the fixings for Smores!). We are already looking forward to our next stay."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jackie's house is in a fabulous location! There are restaurants, beaches and shops in walking distance. We also appreciated that the house was in a quiet neighborhood. The house has everything you need to have an amazing vacation-comfortable beds, a cook's kitchen, sand toys for the kids, cruiser bikes, a fire pit in the backyard and an outdoor shower. The home has been remodeled and the decor is great! We didn't have any issues during our stay and communicating with Jackie was very easy. Our family looks forward to returning!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a fabulous house in a fabulous location. The house is beautifully set up with really nice quality items and perfectly laid out. The garden is delightful - we and our dog spent a lot of time just enjoying the sunshine there.
The location is hard to beat. It’s a short walk to the beach - great early morning walk for the dog when the tide is low - as well as the cliff top walk. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in easy walking distance - we had a lovely meal at Suda, excellent breakfast burritos from the local market, and delicious ice cream from Pennys.
Jackie is easy to reach and responds quickly - we had a couple of questions that she answered right away.
We were so sad to leave this sunny gem and head back into cold and windy San Francisco. We will definitely be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We LOVE Santa Cruz and we LOVE this location. Pleasure Point is the perfect distance to both the Boardwalk and then over to Capitola. Having the coffee shops, restaurants, ect on 41st is great so you can stay on foot or bike as much as possible. You will love how the house is just blocks away from the beach and strolling along the East Cliffs.
Jackie has thought through so much with how the house is appointed from the linens and kitchen to the bikes, beach towels and sand toys. We brought a toddler on the trip with us - she explored the fenced in and safe backyard and loved finding ""hidden"" seashells.
Having stayed in SC and spent $400+/night for a hotel - the freedom and flexibility the house provides is a HUGE value."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our favorite spot in Santa Cruz. Perfect location, quiet, clean, and well-equipped. Don't forget to check out the outdoor shower!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great little house! Awesome location within walking distance to Pleasure Point, quiet, clean, and well-equipped for five of us and our pup. The weather didn't allow us to enjoy the beach as much as we would have liked, but we would love to stay here again and use the great beach gear (bikes! chairs!) available. Jackie's home had everything we needed to cook a few meals, and enjoy our time together. The outside shower was fantastic to hose off our feet and wash off our dog so that we didn't track sand indoors, and the bed was so cozy that it was hard to get up in the morning. Communication with Jackie was pleasant, quick, and easy, and we had no issues with anything during our stay. Loved it!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is an amazing getaway!! Jackie was a wonderful host ! Location of her property was perfect. 100% recommend & an extra star for being dog friendly!

Highly recommend staying here, close to everything and plenty of choices for restaurants and markets."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Exactly as expected. Great home. Convenient location. Friendly host. Recommend.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jackie’s home is an absolute dream. It’s all been re-done, and everything is intuitive and just seems to work. From the linen duvets to the luxurious bath products to the bevy of beach gear, everything has been thought of and provided. Jackie was super easy to communicate with and I’m sure would have been helpful if we’d needed anything, which of course we did not, because everything was already there.
Regarding location: the house is absolutely walking distance from the beach! I was worried that close to water would not mean close to beach access, but there is a great kid beach you can walk to (and of course, pleasure point for surfing).
Best advice: don’t sleep on the outdoor shower! It is amazing, especially after a day at the beach!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jackie’s place was clean, comfortable and the perfect place for our family. The backyard was a nice place to relax and the location was great. We loved it!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We live in the area but rented Jackie's place while we tented our house. The location is so close to the beach. It's clean and updated nicely.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best time at Jackie’s place! Her home was spotless and had everything we needed to enjoy a quick getaway with our 2 yo—fully stocked kitchen with toddler friendly dishware, beach towels, tons of beach toys, laundry, board games etc. We loved the proximity to pleasure pt beach (8 min walk with a toddler) and coffee shops, restaurants etc. It was also an easy drive to downtown Santa Cruz, Forest of the Nisene Marks, and tons of beaches. This home is perfect for families (especially those with dogs!)— plenty of space in the home and yard to enjoy. Jackie was warm, responsive, and welcoming! We can’t wait to come back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Well stocked and perfectly located. Can’t beat it for a family with little kids and adults who want to surf. Loved the fenced yard, beach toys, and easy stroll to coffee, snacks, and Coast. Host was kind and easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend!"

We would recommend this rental and would return ourselves without hesitation."

The location is excellent, just a few blocks from Pleasure Point and The Point Market (excellent breakfast burritos). The yard and outdoor shower were so great. We definitely will come back!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jackie's place is a perfect quiet getaway. The house is clean and cozy. The location is a perfect 5mins walk to the coast. Our family had a great time. Appreciated the welcome gifts as well. Highly recommend this place.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jackie’s Pleasure Point Beach House is a wonderful retreat. From the house to the yard and extra amenities it is all very well thought out. The location is one of my favorites in the Santa Cruz area. Friendly neighborhood and easy walk to the beach. Parking is easy and the driveway fits two cars. Thank you for a great stay and we hope to be back.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jackie's home was the ideal spot for my family and two doggies. The house was spotless and there were more than enough essentials to make us feel at home. She even left two identical dog toys for our guys so that they wouldn't bicker. We'd happily stay here again!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My daughter and I loved staying at Jackie’s! We were greeted with a personal message on the chalkboard door and a bottle of wine. Throughout our stay I kept thinking this was probably the best stocked Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. The kitchen had all of the pots, pans, utensils, etc. needed to eat in and cook. There was even a drawer full of ikea plates, cups, bowls and utensils for kids. We made use of the fire pit in the backyard, and my daughter loved what she coined “the mermaid room.” The location is amazing - walking distance to the beach, the market, coffee, and donuts. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little beach house! We loved our stay and would certainly stay here again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We can't wait to come back! Jackie's beach bungalow was everything we hoped for and more. It was clean, comfortable, easy access to the beach and had everything we needed to make our stay simple and fun. We LOVED having the beach cruisers to use and plenty of sand toys and towels. The kitchen was well stocked. Lots of fun games. We enjoyed hanging in the back yard, sitting on the front steps and watching the surfers go by, and quickly biking to the beach, point, and to 41st street for coffee/breakfast. Super easy check in/out. Also with two toddlers it was very convenient to have access to a washer and dryer. Jackie was incredibly responsive and friendly. One of our best AirBNB stays ever! Perfect for young families (our kids are 1 and 4)."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Pleasure Point Beach house was the nicest Airbnb we’ve ever experienced. The beds were super comfortable, the house was well appointed and very clean.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect beach house. The backyard is wonderful and the location is great. Lots of bonus amenities that were super kid friendly like beach goodies and plate ware. Highlight of our California trip.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I once lived in Santa Cruz for 3 years, so I can reliably say that this is a quintessential Santa Cruz style stay. Right next to East Cliff and top rated surf spots. Down the street from an excellent place for burritos. Cruiser bikes available to avoid traffic. Walkable to several beaches. Outdoor shower to clean sandy feet. Backyard fire pit to keep warm on cool and breezy nights. Plus a local host who is willing to help with the things you need.
There’s not much to say that hasn’t already been said in prior reviews. When everyone says the same thing in reviews, it’s because the place is certified solid. Highly recommended!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This place is fabulous. Seriously. We had a lovely stay.
It was very clean. The remodel work she did inside is very tasteful and very high quality. We loved the feel of the place - very comfortable without any clutter. Sheets and towels are very nice. Kitchen is stocked with utensils and some basic items - it was a breeze to cook some family meals.
The beach supplies are amazing - we used the beach chairs, beach towels and umbrellas. Bikes, kids toys and wagons looked great as well (though we didn't use them). And it's a great location.
The host sent a text to welcome us and offer to help with anything. And another text the next day to let us know we could ask if we needed anything. So she made it clear she was available but didn't keep texting.
A fabulous stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband, toddler, golden retriever, and I felt SO comfy and at home. We loved having a wagon available to pull our tot with the beach toys. We had everything we needed to feel like we were in our own house."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Jackie is an excellent host and communicator. House location and amenities are perfect for visiting the ocean with ease.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love staying at Jackie's place and never want to leave!

If looking to stay in Santa Cruz, Pleasure Point neighborhood, this house is a gem. Thank you Jackie for another fantastic week. Hope to back soon!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a wonderful place to stay right in the heart of Pleasure Point. The house has been beautifully updated and furnished, with high end appliances and fittings. Not an insta-IKEA type of Airbnb- thought and care has gone into the detail of the house and it really shows. There’s a fantastic enclosed sunny garden and the ocean is just a brief walk away. Very pet friendly with easy access to beaches and hikes. Bikes were fun to use and cruise up and down the cliff tops. And there are amazing breakfast burritos at the pleasure point market - plenty of other choices on Portola and 41st street. But you may not want to leave the house! We loved our stay and will be back. Thank you!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is definitely one of the finest Airbnb's in Santa Cruz. This was my family’s 3rd time staying at Jackie’s Beach House - we honestly feel like it is our home away from home!
We didn’t think it could get any better but Jackie made some great improvements since out last stay and we loved them!
Beautiful house (and neighborhood), with every amenity you can think of. Two blocks from the dog friendly beach, which is lovely - our four-legged kids had us up early each morning for their walk!!
Communication was excellent - you can tell that Jackie cares about her guests. Highly recommended, and we can't wait to come back."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This place is sublime. The location can’t be beat…just a few minutes of walking to the beach and some cute local restaurants. The place is so comfy and the garden spacious and a great place to grill and hang out. Everything feels new and up to date. Love the outdoor shower. Jackie is extra responsive and helpful. We couldn’t have enjoyed it more!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful location and home! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be back in the future.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The worst part about the house was having to leave. From the gracious pre-trip question answering and easy check-in process to the plush towels/great shower/beautiful home/ideal location, this was an Airbnb home run. Did I mention the hammock and fire pit in the backyard? Perfect spot for a romantic or family getaway. Easy walk to the beach and full-menu Point Market & Cafe, the house comes with bikes and a wagon full of sand toys - no stone unturned. Just a wonderful space, highly recommended!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved every second of this stay! Gorgeous home with lots of character and comfort! Location is amazing and I can't wait to return!
Beds were super comfortable and the rooms were bright and spacious!
Kitchen was perfect and well stocked!
I was glad that a floor fan was provided for one of the rooms and I did pick up a desk fan to use on the nightstand for one of the other rooms...as there were some warm summer nights and the house doesn't have ceiling fans/AC.
Can't wait to return! to Paradise! Thank you Jackie!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay at Jackie's beach house. Usually I prepare myself for the Airbnb photos to oversell a property but the beach house was absolutely perfect. It was really clean, it had everything we needed from soap to boogie boards and everything in between. The yard was gorgeous and inviting. We would live in this house all the time if we could!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A+ experience.Everything from the pics os to be expected. Great location, clean home, and very warm welcome. We enjoyed our 4 days, and our dog did too. Well be back!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Jackie's beach house, and had everything we needed. Homes in Santa Cruz can be quite small but Jackie's place felt spacious and the yard was large enough for my son and our dog. everything was spotless, the beds were comfy, the entire house was beautifully decorated and located walking distance to Pleasure Point and the market. We would not hesitate to stay again and Jackie was such a kind host. She checked in with us to see that we had everything we needed and even left my dog a Kong toy (and us a bottle of wine, which was the perfect temp in the wine fridge!). We can't wait to stay again."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was amazing in every way. It's a beautiful house in a super convenient location near the beach. We had a wonderful time there with our toddler (she especially enjoyed the backyard)
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jackie's house was fantastic. Pet and family friendly. Walkable to a few different beaches and surf breaks. Two cute bedrooms complete with roomy closets and bedside USB chargers. Sizeable kitchen with a variety of cooking supplies - all the necessities for us to make some meals - and ample seating. The full laundry room, board games, Disney+ Premium, beach cruisers and toys (including wagon to haul them) plus fenced backyard with firepit, hammock, outdoor shower, and grill puts this place over the top. Seriously, everything if well thought out to make things easy and comfortable. Don't miss the burritos at the Point market or little surf shop and Chinese on the main drag. Near shopping if you forget something. Thanks for a great surf staycation!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jackie's place was absolutely perfect, indoors and out, one of our all time favorite stays! Our family of four humans and one furry creature had plenty of space and were all so comfortable there... it really felt like we could settle in and be home for the week. Jackie was super responsive and helpful both before and during our trip, and the neighborhood is quiet and restful with tons to do within walking and biking distance. Thank you Jackie!! We definitely hope to return!"

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We originally re-booked Jackie's Seacliff Family Beach House because we loved it (and highly recommend it as well) but in deciding to bring our small dog this time, ended up checking out The Pleasure Point Beach House and had an amazing stay! From booking to departure, Jackie was a wonderful host again, kind and responsive, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. As with the other house, the Pleasure Point Beach House was super clean, beautifully furnished and stocked with everything we needed. We loved the calm and relaxing modern beach decor, the gorgeous kitchen which made preparing a meal as enjoyable as enjoying takeout from the many delicious options in the area, the super comfortable beds, the great shower water pressure, the lovely backyard which our 5 year old and our dog enjoyed, the location in a safe and quiet neighborhood, and the walking distance proximity to an easy and wonderful walk along the ocean from which we enjoyed watching the surfers. Thoughtful touches such as a storybook collection, games and child-friendly dinnerware made the stay extra special for our little one. It felt like a true home. All in all, we loved our stay and highly recommend both listings!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay at Pleasure Point, the house was perfect, clean and comfortable! Perfect yard for playing with our toddler in a safe contained space. We had a great time and really appreciate the effort Jackie puts into welcoming her guests! Thank you Jackie!"

We walked to the point to watch the surfers and enjoy the sunset every evening. It's the perfect getaway. We felt comfortable and safe. The home is immaculate and well-appointed while also being perfectly chill and cozy. The bedrooms and the bathroom were spotless and updated. The water pressure was better than at home. We are definitely looking forward to a return trip.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing find, awesome house, beautiful yard and a short walk to the surf.
A hot outdoor shower post surf is the best thing ever !!"

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was so cozy and impeccably clean. Exactly the beach get-away we had hoped for. The home looks newly remodeled with lots of beautiful beach art. We enjoyed the location, the house is in walking distance to the point and 41st which was a huge plus with the little kiddos.
The house was very kid friendly. The kitchen was stocked with kids plates and utensils. There were kid books, games and an awesome enclosed back yard with a fire pit. Although we didn’t get a chance to use them, the house also had 5 beach cruisers and beach supplies.
We would definitely come back and stay here again! Thank you to the host, Jackie."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We unfortunately were evacuated from our home due to potential debris flow. We lucked out and found Jackie’s home. It was perfect and she was a perfect host.

I would absolutely recommend to stay there!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Such an incredible spot for so many reasons!! First and foremost, the location couldn't be better. You are a very very short walk away from the ocean and multiple surf spots, the point market - the best place for breakfast burritos, coffee at Cat & Cloud - a great local coffee shop, 7-eleven, sandy beaches for a picnic, the main 41st street with multiple shops and restaurants, and many other spots. If you're a surfer, you'll realize there is quite nothing like WALKING out of the house with your board and jumping straight into the water. Secondly, the amenities are vast - you've got a place to park your car, a large backyard with a gas grill, firepit, and most importantly a hot outdoor shower. The place has everything to make you feel right at home - super comfy beds, a wine fridge, laundry, and a fully stocked kitchen. We would stay here again in a heartbeat, heck I'd spend my whole summer here if I could!"

We were evacuated from the fire area, and Jackie went way above and beyond, bringing gifts for our daughter and our family, and checking up on us regularly. In addition, the house was beautiful.

The beds were super comfy and we slept really well. The kitchen is well set up and had everything we needed. There was even a wine fridge! The shower has great water pressure and the provided toiletries and cozy white towels made it feel very luxurious. We brought our dog with us, and she enjoyed the fenced-in backyard while we enjoyed the fire pit. 41st Street is walking distance (you walk all along the ocean - gorgeous!). There are beach cruisers provided (which were an unexpected surprise!). We were able to log into our Netflix account to watch movies in the evening. She had several board games available as well. Jackie’s place was truly a home away from home and a real gem. We will definitely be back!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is our second stay here and it sure wont be our last.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Jackie's property for two nights and could not have been more please with our stay. Jackie was super welcoming and easy to communicate with at all times. The home was super clean, cozy, modern, thoughtfully decorated, and offered all the amenities that you could need to make you feel like you were at home. The house was perfectly located to enjoy all that Pleasant Point has to offer including the local beach, surf spots, cafes, and restaurants. The delicious local wine, dog treats, and beach cruisers available were an extra touch that did not go unnoticed. We have stayed at an abundance of airbnb properties worldwide and Jackie has created the perfect home away from home. We are already looking into finding time to come back!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really great house in a wonderful spot. Bright, clean, modern, beachy, Jackie's place was well put together and easy to slide in and like. High marks across the board. We'd love to stay again someday!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable beach house is so awesome I'm actually afraid to say how good it is because it's bound to become so popular! From the moment we booked, Jackie was proactive in communicating with us. Upon our arrival we checked in with ease and found the house in pristine condition, something that I can attest is extremely rare in Santa Cruz, having lived there for eight years. We were delighted to find a kitchen fully furnished with cookware, utensils, cutlery, dishware and glasses, gas range and oven, dishwasher, nice refrigerator, and a built-in wine and beer fridge under the counter! Modern laundry machines that worked great. TV was set up with streaming services and a sound bar that also had bluetooth connectivity for listening to music from our phones. Comfortable furniture in the living room and two bedrooms with very supportive, comfy beds. Bathroom was very clean and in great condition, with a big rain shower head and plenty of clean towels in the linen closet. Bonus points for the deluxe toilet paper! Radiant heater quickly took the edge off of the morning chill. Several beach cruisers in the garage that we didn't end up using, but all appeared to be in great condition. Nice front porch for relaxing with a couple of comfy chairs. All windows were double pane, opened easily, and latched securely. Wood floors looked original and were in excellent condition. Lots of fun artwork around the house with a beach theme. Ample driveway could likely fit multiple cars, nice to have off street parking. Nice, mellow neighborhood that is two short blocks from Pleasure Point, a very popular local surf spot with a market that has amazing breakfast burritos! I really can't say enough about how wonderful it was to stay in this house. Choose Jackie's Pleasure Point Beach House when you're visiting Santa Cruz!"

Such a great surprise to make our beach trips last longer with the kids. House was spotless and clean! We loved our stay!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place that is super close to the beach! Simple note to self: there are Lil critters (skunks) that like to be a bit nosey if you accidentally leave your pet/service dogs food out. Not a pleasant smell once you’ve realized your dog is just as curious as they were.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful house located just two blocks from the beautiful Pleasure Point. It comes equipped with everything you need for a visit to Santa Cruz, including bikes, BBQ and ample outdoor space. Our only regret is not staying longer."

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jackie was an incredible host and offered an amazing home! We loved being there, it was super cozy and updated/modern with the perfect amount of beachy vibe. The kitchen is a Dream - extra plus was the coffee and the bottle of wine she left for us. Pleasant Point Market is just down the road (walking distance), and it was great to grab a breakfast burrito and sit on the benches watching the morning surfers. Truly magical. Our toddler loved the house (and the chalk) and the pup was obsessed with the yard. It was also so fantastic to have that outside shower after going to the dog beach for a play session. Jackie was readily available at all times, and there were no issues while we stayed at the house. We have already booked our next stay - can’t wait to be back!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at the Pleasure Point beach house!!! Everything was super clean and welcoming. This house literally has everything you’d ever need for a vacation at the beach. My husband and I stayed for a weekend wedding and we left wishing it was our home.

We had such a nice time walking over to get our breakfast burritos at the market and watching the surfers through the mist. We had everything we needed for a wonderful family vacation and would highly recommend this home!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I think my six year old daughter said it best when she found the kitchen drawer full of kids dishes and cup and utensils “wow - she really did think of everything.”
This place was such a find. Close to everything we wanted to do and full of charm and style and it was clean. All of the above is not always easy to do in a beach town, but this house had it and more. Bikes and boogie boards and fire pits and grills and an outside shower and all the stuff...
on top of all that, Jackie was a great host. She helped us locate surf lessons before the trip and checked in with us along the way to make sure we were not needing anything.
Can’t wait to stay there again!"

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is the best home we’ve stayed at during our 10+ years of traveling to Pleasure Point. The location is amazing and the home was perfect for our family (2 and 4- legged).

We always stay at a different location when tracking to Pleasure Point, but we will be staying here again!!!"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jackie's house is a perfect beach home. Its old-school charm mixed with modernized amenities creates a comfortable ambiance. First thing in the morning, we would walk down to watch the surfers at Pleasure Point while we collected sea shells in the tide pools. We were able to use Jackie's beach cruisers to ride down to the cute shops and delicious eateries on 41st. Amazing! In the evenings, we would rinse our sandy selves in the outdoor shower and enjoy the fire pit in the large backyard. We enjoyed our stay 100% and hope to be back soon!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was skeptical when I saw 'sanctuary' on the description originally, but oh what a sanctuary it actually is. A true oasis of calm and peace, walking distance to a ton of yummy food, good coffee, and shops. Yet, it's close to the beach, peaceful, and quiet. The room was super cozy and had everything one might need. It felt soulful and warm, with so many beautiful touches, including a lovely koi fish pond and a friendly cat named Bamboo.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best Airbnb experience I’ve had in years. I’m back in school, getting my Masters so I needed a quiet, tranquil, private living space.
The set up is really cozy and the bed deserves mention. Getting a good night’s sleep depends on a good mattress and bed frame. 🥰
Diana is a superb host and supports the privacy I was seeking. I am returning in a month and thrilled about that.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peacefull and relaxing place. Love the layout of the Zen Garden Sanctuary. Great Tori Gate and Koi Pond. Small but cozy room to rest. Found a lot of inspiration to upgrade my own backyard sanctuary. Just 2 blocks to ocean, excellent location. Definitely would recommend and would come back again."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is super small., bathroom especially. Unfortunately I would not stay here again as for the size."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Diana was very friendly and helpful. The space was wonderful and peaceful. Don’t forget to say hi to the friendly cat and coy. We also saw many monarch caterpillars on the milkweed plans next to the entryway.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Zen Sanctuary was even better than described. With the windows open at night, we were lulled to sleep by the tranquil sound of the waterfall in the koi pound and the sweet soothing song of the wind chime. The location could not be any better. Less than a 5 min walk to the ocean and amazing sunsets. We would definitely stay here again!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was wonderful. We booked Diana’s Zen Garden as our 10-year anniversary getaway and we couldn’t have chosen a better place.

They assisted me and my fiancé with many things prior to and after our wedding, and provided a quiet and peaceful space throughout my visit. I enjoyed it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Without a doubt, one of the best airbnb places I have stayed at yet. If you are trying to de-stress, need a quiet space for recharging between your exploring Santa Cruz, or just need a chill place to relax at the end of day, this fits its bill as a place for meditation. Rub the lavender and rosemary between your fingers. Feed the friendly koi carp. Or just sit back in your chair by the koi pond and listen to the windchimes thrum in the gentle breezes off Monterey Bay. Highly recommend this place, and look forward to staying again the next time I visit my family in town."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at the Zen Sanctuary. The place was a little oasis on the Westside of Santa Cruz and there is so much to do nearby. The hosts were lovely and made us feel right at home. Would recommend this stay!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A quiet, peaceful place just a few blocks from West Cliff and within easy walking distance from both Natural Bridges and restaurants/breweries/wineries along Swift street. On the property the garden area with its babbling pond was absolutely beautiful and a very relaxing place to eat a meal. The bedroom has a separate entrance on the side of the house through the shared garden and feels very private. The kitchenette with a minifridge, microwave, and coffeemaker in the repurposed half of the closet was clutch for eating on a budget. I never met Diana - she was out of town for the majority of my stay - but she was responsive on the app, and I had everything I needed anyways. Will definitely be keeping this listing in mind for the future!"

The bed was heavenly and the gardens, koi and chimes were a needed break. So quiet too, low key neighborhood for max sleeping hours."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Diana's place is exquisite. The room was quiet, private, clean, beautifully organized, stocked with everything you might need, cozy, and totally comfortable. Because it was set up so well it felt large. Both the room and the garden are charming and a pleasure to occupy. Everywhere we looked we saw a new detail--whimsical, beautiful, or both. The pictures are accurate but don't do it full justice. Diana was so helpful and kind. I can't recommend her place highly enough."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diana's home was lovely and her patio was absolutely beautiful. I wish I had spent more time with her koi, but there was so much to do out and about in Santa Cruz that I spent most of my time out walking. My only regret was not getting to meet her cat!"

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location, ambiance, serenely created environment for an airbnb is remarkable. However, Inside the room, I had wished to have a bit more space to stretch and do simple yoga.
If arrangement of the bed hadn’t occupy the center of the room, and be moved a bit to the one side, the room could have given an area for stretching.
Bed was super comfortable.
Very quiet and restful room."

For us, a big bonus was that this place is a very short walk to the water!"

I highly recommend staying here for your travel in Santa Cruz.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a incredibly nice, relaxing space. The host was responsive and provided detailed information about how to make use of the room. We both greatly appreciated the natural light in the room, as well as the soothing sounds of wind chimes and water flowing throughout the day. One small cautionary note for travelers, which only applies if you intend to be trekking around the area (like we had to): Lyft / Uber are not terribly present in this part of Santa Cruz, it seems. We had a very difficult time getting timely or reliable pick-ups through either service. To reiterate: we loved the room itself -- just make sure you have your travel well-planned in advance (a rented car might be wisest)."

It could not have been more quiet, beautiful, and what a deal!! Walking distance to the beach.

I suggest keeping the windows open to fall asleep to the sounds of the fountain and wind chimes. I enjoyed talking about the chimes with the hosts and learning about Rhythm Church. The hosts are kind, helpful, and really accessible if you need anything.
While here, I recommend:
-taking in the ocean scenery while walking along West Cliff
-grabbing some drinks and eats at Venus Spirits"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Away from the bustle and the crowds, this gem is quiet and private yet, within walking distance to food, coffee and the ocean. I loved talking to the koi fish and cat every morning and would definitely stay with Diana again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The Zen Garden is in a wonderful location just a couple blocks from West Cliff where you can walk along the ocean and observe wildlife. The room/setting is very comfortable for a single person or couple who do not need a kitchen. There is a coffee/tea set up a small fridge and microwave which worked well for my needs. There is a lovely Koi pond in the yard and the fish greet you every time you walk by. I had an extended stay of more than a month and was very comfortable.
Diana was flexible and checked in periodically to make sure I had everything I needed. I highly recommend you give Zen Garden a try. I certainly would stay again!"

Diana and Arthur were both welcoming and had great suggestions for the area. The unit had its own entry, felt private, and we didn't worry about disturbing Diana and Arthur as we came and went. There were great restaurants, tap rooms, and cafes within walking distance and easy access to the ocean a few blocks away.

The price of the stay was very reasonable. A good value. We would definitely stay again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will be transported into another world when you open the side entrance that leads to your room. The coy pond, plants, flowers and sculpture are lovely! Great bed and pillows. I felt very welcome! Thank you Diana!"

Although, to get the best experience of Sant Cruz and the surrounding area, a rental car is a must. Cliff Drive and the arch are a very short walk which was very nice. Wonderful place!"

You won’t be doing much cooking, but we had several comfortable take out dinners and very enjoyable breakfast coffee. We’d definitely come back!"

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really cute place with kind and considerate hosts. We loved meeting the local outdoor cats and feeding the koi fish. It’s a short walk from West Cliff Dr which is a super fun place to walk or ride. The space is just one small room with a small bathroom on the side of the host’s house but it’s enough.

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diana's place was perfect for me. It had everything I needed and nothing I didn't. It was so rejuvenating to listen to the chimes and watch the coy in the pond, or take a short walk to the ocean on that spectacular coastline. Diana was very responsive and Bamboo did indeed greet me when I arrived. What a charmer :) I'm already planning my next visit."

2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely home. The garden and koi pond is far beyond what I expected. They've really achieved a true sanctuary. The home truly is two blocks from the stunning coastline. Diana and Arthur's AirBnB has many thoughtful touches. They've left chocolate, have a refrigerator, food to feed the fish, coffe and tea, even a Britta filter for water. The bed is very comfortable and there are extra towels if you need them. Light sleepers should install a white noise app or bring noise cancelling head phones. Their home is NOT noisy but the room is connected to the house so there is a bit of natural blending of noises that happens. Parking is free and plentiful and the neighborhood is safe and friendly.
My only true complaint? I did not get to meet their feline guardian... next time!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay at Diana's place. The room was very clean and the koi pond was such a nice touch. The location is unbeatable, it's only about 3-5 min walk away from the ocean. I got to go on a few hikes which are the main reason for my trip. I'd recommend it to anyone who looks for a quiet and beautiful place to unwind."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Diana’s place is lovely. It is quiet and comfortable. The little “kitchenette” in the closet had everything you need. The WiFi is great. I had to attend a zoom meeting one day and nothing went wrong. It is 2 to 3 blocks from west cliff drive and the trail. Walkable to natural bridges state beach. I would highly recommend it.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Seriously a gem. The koi pond is a great place to spend a slow morning, and it was nice that the house was a couple blocks off the main drag so we didn't have to worry about traffic and parking."

Made for a really good quick getaway
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband said it was the ""most accommodating place we've ever been to"". She had extra amenitiesavailable if we forgot something.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay at Judith’s place was overall one of the most positive airbnb experiences I’ve ever had. She is so kind and friendly and the place was clean and peaceful. Everything was super clean and we were able to hang out by the pool outside. My friend and I were in a tough situation and Judith went above and beyond to help us out. I really didn’t expect so much kindness from a stranger but she really went out of her way to help us out. 10/10 would recommend! Thank you Judith!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judith's place was exactly what we were looking for, as two friends needing a place for a night after a wedding at nearby Waterfall Lodge. Everything inside was as described and in perfect condition, with nice touches such as fresh coffee, shower amenities and nice decor. The only thing worth mentioning was that our (pre-arranged late) check-in was a bit of a nightmare, with the wrong code being given for the door and then no response from Judith for around 50 minutes at 11pm. We felt terrible having to knock on her door and wake her up (she lives next door) but this did eventually allow us to get inside with the correct code. Other than this mishap, all was great. Thank you so much and sorry again for having to wake you up."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judith's space was perfect for our stay! We were going to a wedding in Roaring Camp and wanted to be close to Scotts Valley/Felton. Santa Cruz is a quick 15 minute drive and everything was conveniently located for our stay. Judith provided a welcome guide with restaurant and store recommendations which was really helpful. The space itself was clean and very cozy; very good energy inside and out. If you are looking for a place to call home while you hike in the forrest or check out Santa Cruz/San Jose, this is the place for you."

Really comfortable bed, really nice shower, and small kitchen area. It had everything I needed and Judith immediately responded to any questions I had. This is a quiet neighborhood in a beautiful area and I would highly recommend this lovely place to stay. It made me realize what I have been missing by not visiting the Santa Cruz area more. The Henry Cowell State Park right down the street is beautiful. I loved having this comfy place to come back to after a day of hiking and swimming with my family."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a quick overnight stay and everything was perfect. Very clean and cozy. I even enjoyed the pool as weather was warm enough outside
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Judith's place was so great! It was the perfect little getaway in Santa Cruz and is my new favorite spot to stay at if ever in the area. I cannot rave enough about the location, hospitality, comfort, and ease of this home. Bed was super comfortable, was only a 10 min drive from anything we needed, was next to wonderful coffee shops for that morning comfort, and was in such a beautiful part of town with so much access to nature if you wanted it.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A must stay location for the right amount of vacation. The way it is laid out makes it truly a unique and humble home away from home. You can be sure you’ll be warm or cool if needed anytime of the year. The outdoor space available including the pool and the scenery around cannot be matched by any hotel or luxury location. That’s my opinion. I went to college for a few years there and to come back with an impeccable level of customer service, going above and beyond, including a guide to the area with points of interests. Judith is a personal concierge (by her own graciousness) on top of being an amazing AirBnB host. Sincerely thank you for the opportunity to stay at your humble place. It was a home away from home to visit where my heart, including my friend Michael, left a little of ourselves behind."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Judith is an awesome host. is home away from home 😊

Loved how close it is to the majestic redwoods and all of the great restaurants close by. Would definitely stay again- highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judith is an amazing host. I was able to coordinate a luggage dropoff with her prior to check in and had arrived in scotts valley in the morning with no plans for the day. She gave me great recommendations on good places to check out in town and I had a great time. The bestest of recs always comes from a local.
She is also very thoughtful, thorough, and detail oriented. This space is stand alone with lots of privacy, a kitchenette equipped with goodies for a quick morning snack, and a pool in the backyard if you’re into swimming and visit during the summer.
You’ll definitely leave this airbnb pleased and well rested. Bottom line, I felt very much at home and welcomed during my stay and will be coming back to her place if I’m ever in town again."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beginning to end, staying at Judith’s is where professionalism meets warmth. For me, it was the little touches, two types of milk in the fridge, personalized welcome letter and clear instructions throughout. This spot is the definition of hidden gem!"

It was the exact type of romantic, quiet, and clean space that I longed for. Also, Judith answered all my questions promptly and I very much felt like a guest than a customer in her home. Next time I am in Santa Cruz, I will look for Judith's home rather than choose a hotel or another Airbnb."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This area was very nice! Secluded enough to be great for an intimate getaway for couples but close enough to a variety of food and convenience stores where you could pick up anything you might forget.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judith's place was incredibly comfy! Spacious and cozy place to sleep and shower. She had a cute kitchen set up too! My favorite part was the quality of the linens.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Judith's place was a delight, a magical tiny oasis for people like us who love refreshing private pools, cleanliness and an almost palpable thoughtfulness and care in the air. This tiny bungalow had everything an individual or couple could need, including impeccable cleanliness and little touches like compost, wall heater, built-in screened windows in the back door for secure cross breeze, powerful shower spray and ready hot water and more. We loved the pool, the nature surrounding it, the thick towels, the towering trees, ""shade"" umbrellas and solid lawn furniture. We found ourselves refreshed in every possible way. Thank you for opening your home to travelers like us and for helping us make fond memories! I highly recommend Scotts Valley Bungalow."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First time ever booking an AirBnB and it exceeded my expectations! I will definitely be booking again next time I’m in Santa Cruz!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent space, great amenities, comfortable bed. Very relaxing vibe. Highly recommend for a quick overnight trip. It's very small so only 1-2 people max."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my favorite air bnb I have ever stayed in! The location was perfect with a rental car for driving to the Santa Cruz boardwalk, hiking in the redwoods, visiting local wineries, and taking longer day trips like Big Sur and San Francisco! Not only is the location great, the neighborhood is quiet and cozy, and Judith’s welcoming amenities can’t be beat. The room was spotless and clean, with nearly any item you forgot to pack sitting there for you. For example it’s a small touch, but a fridge full of bottled waters was so helpful while on vacation! My partner and I enjoyed the pool in the gorgeous serene backyard, and had everything we need in this comfortable spot. Thank you Judith!!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect stay for 1-2 people. The bed was soft and comfortable. There is no television so bring a laptop if you want to watch tv. The neighborhood is quiet and only 10-15 minutes from Santa Cruz. I recommend a visit to the Henry Cowell Redwoods, the trails were lovely and a great workout. The MAH in Santa Cruz is worth a visit and tickets are donation-based (pay what you wish). The weather was amazing when we stayed in mid May. It’s a little warmer in Scott’s Valley than SC so bring summer clothes. There is no A/C but the fan works well to cool the room. We would definitely stay here again and plan to return later this year!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Judith’s place was perfect for our stay. We only needed it to sleep but would also be able to stay here more days if needed. Was also a short drive away from downtown area. :) would definitely stay here again.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really quaint little guest house. Was a little hard to find in the dark, but Judith’s instructions were super helpful and I made it there fine. Don’t trust Google maps. You haven’t arrived when it says you have. The place was clean and well-equipped with plenty of towels, cutlery, and cleaning supplies. There was also an air filter. Toilet was one of the more eco-friendly ones that flush was a button that’s a little hard to press if you have long nails like I do, though. I also didn’t see Judith at all during my stay, which suited me just fine, and checking in and out was very convenient. Good vibes, v chill."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at this Airbnb. Easy check-in and communication with Judith; very comfortable and cozy space; lots of thoughtful touches and supplies. It's in a residential location so you have to drive to get to any coffee shops or restaurants. We were underwhelmed by Scotts Valley (the closest commercial area), but totally charmed by nearby Felton, and of course Santa Cruz is only a 10-15-min drive away."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You can expect a very cozy stay in the hills of Santa Cruz. It was such a nice and relaxing stay, wish we could have stayed for longer. The drive itself up to the house is awesome! Would definitely suggest just booking the stay to anyone who is thinking about it."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This spot is so tranquil and I loved the nature and wildlife all around. The Airbnb has so many thoughtful touches and is separated from the main house by the garage so it feels like you really have your own space. I loved my stay and hope to be back!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first ever Air Bnb experience. This place completely blew me away, the attention to detail, the customer service, the amenities, EVERYTHING was great. At no point during my stay, did I need anything that wasn't provided. Right off the bat, I could tell how much respect Judith put into her Air BNB and maintaining it. After leaving this air bnb, I was sad cause I don't think I'll find another Air Bnb quite like this one."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a great time very easy and had great communication
,,,extremely disappointed. host did not respond for HOURS and we had traveled from out of state for a WEDDING. we had to get ready at the venue because of the lack of response from the host. absolutely *worst* experience with an airbnb host yet.
