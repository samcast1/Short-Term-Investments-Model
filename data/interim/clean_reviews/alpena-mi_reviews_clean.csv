2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Matthew was a great host. The house was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with items , a perfect spot for a northern Michigan getaway."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a wonderful stay at Matthew’s place. Growing up visiting Alpena and surrounding areas, this location was spectacular to visit downtown. For a big family like ours, all of the essentials were there and then some. We were impressed by all the of little touches of hospitality (things for the kids, cooking supplies, fans, games, books, you name it, it was there). Matthew is also the most communicative host I’ve ever had, and we travel a lot. I felt like I could text him with any questions and he was responsive and thorough. We would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This met our needs & everything was clean and comfortable. Matthew was excellent with communication and we enjoyed our stay here! The location was great! Thanks!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came to Alpena for the bird migration and found many trails and parks. Great time!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was super. It was walkable to almost anything Alpena has to offer. The house was clean. I did have one small issue when first arriving and the host snapped into action and took care of it immediately. He even texted me advice on where to watch the northern lights that were coming one evening. We enjoyed our stay so much and would stay here again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Well, welcomed!! Lots of communication. Lots of everything you could possibly need. You feel comfortable being there."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing stay! Just perfect! House was so clean and tidy. Matthew answered any questions immediately and was very helpful. Location is central and walkable. We can’t wait to come back!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Always a great place to stay and amazing hosts. The little welcoming touches are perfect.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect little spot to relax! I came up to Alpena to visit some family & friends while teleworking during the day. Wifi was steady allowing me to work uninterrupted. Matthew was extremely proactive, the weather wasn’t the best during my stay, possible snow, and he made sure my mom and I were parked properly. My dog Paprika loved the backyard. There were so many supplies in the house, dedicated dog towels/blankets, kitchen utensils, even an Easter egg decorating kit for the holiday! The beds were extremely comfy, as well as the couch. 10/10 stay, will 100% rebook with Matthew if available next trip to Alpena"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This little home away from home in Alpena is absolutely worth every penny. It’s nice and cozy, right by the water, and super close to town. The host Matthew made our stay by far the best Airbnb experience I have had to this day. He is extremely responsive and kind! Gave us local recommendations and made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay perfect. The space was very dog friendly and our four-legged baby loved the fenced in yard. We definitely would stay with Matthew again and highly recommend anyone considering staying with him!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home and location. Within walking distance to the beach in the summer. Within a couple minutes to downtown dining, bars and shopping. Being able to bring a four legged children is an amazing added bonus. Games and books kept our children entertained during our winter stay. Will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Once again we enjoyed our stay and the responsive and kind host!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a great home! Matthew was quick to respond to any of my needs. Plenty of parking. My wife and I drove separately so there was room for 2 vehicles in the driveway and room for more. We did not use the bedrooms upstairs but they are very large and well kept. The huge kitchen had all pots, pans, and utensils that we needed. A very nice family room with a couch, a large ottoman, and nicely placed LED TV. Just a wonderful home to relax in and enjoy!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay here and we already booked a third! We aren't big city/town folks but this place is in a convenient location and still very quiet. You can easily walk to nearby parks on the water, and only about a mile walk to the coffee shop downtown.
In addition Matthew is a great host."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Very responsive to any questions or needs. Great location, easy walk to the water. Great cozy stay, Roger approved (the dog! ) !"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The property was as described in the listing and photos. It is an older property but well-maintained, and equipped. The location was the main attraction to us being just a couple of minutes walk to the shores of Lake Huron and a few minutes drive to the center of Alpena."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Definitely went above and beyond tons to make pure Christmas’s stay great!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice cozy home. Enjoyed the electric fireplace while watching tv. The Christmas tree was a nice touch for the season
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfortable, and clear instructions and expectations. This was our second time here. We get to Alpena a few times a year, and are happy when Matthew’s place is available."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice and comfortable. Super pet friendly.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Matthew’s place was awesome. From the welcoming of our pets to the quiet atmosphere. We will definitely keep this in our stay again column.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time! The house is only a block from Lake Huron with very close access to a park & lake front views as well as the pier. We enjoyed crisp Autumn walks on the pier. Super refreshing and gorgeous! Matt welcomed us with a greeting on the Chalkboard on the front porch and also a personalized card on the dining table. We felt right at home!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were very familiar with the area that this B and B is located, and it was just what we were looking for to get away for an extended weekend to visit our 1-year-old Great Granddaughter who lives nearby. We traveled up to Alpena from 5 hrs. away in Ohio. Not only was Matthew's place easy to find and matched exactly what was listed and expected, but Matthew's response times, his courteous nature, recommendations of activities and eateries, and most friendly demeaner were unmatched. It happened to be peak season for the fall colors so we could not have timed it any better for what is already a Lake Huron hot spot on its' own, regardless the time of year. There is so much to see and do in the area and this location puts you smack dab in the middle of it all. I would highly recommend Matthew's place to stay, as you will not be disappointed.
P.S. We do not have a dog, but very cool that this place goes out of its way to ensure your best friend is Welcome and feels right at Home! BONUS!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Best AirBNB experience to date! All necessities required for a wonderful stay are 5-star…cleanliness, comfort, amenities, location, etc. This place has anything that you could possibly need whether you’re a couple, a family with children of any age or, in our case, traveling with a dog. Don’t worry if you forget to pack something…chances are you’ll find it there! Finally, the efforts of our host to make, not only our stay, but my husband’s 60th birthday, so special, were simply extraordinary! In addition to a personalized greeting card welcoming us both, a birthday card was left for my husband with a generous gift card. If that wasn’t already well beyond our expectations, Matt came by with a very nice cigar for my husband. Thank you, Matt, for your thoughtfulness and treating your guests like family…you are a remarkable host! We love your place and can’t wait to visit again! Hope to see you soon…with better weather next time to enjoy the lovely patio and yard!! Cindy and Dave"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Spotlessly clean, myriad amenities for any length of stay, plus a full laundry! We could want for nothing more in our accommodations. Many personal touches throughout the home made us feel welcome. Being pet-friendly was a huge plus, ensuring our personal enjoyment. Highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Matthew was very accomodating. He communicated well when we had questions. The home offered many things that were unexpected and provided a thoughtful process in providing things we might need. Such as a bottle of isoproply alcohol I forgot to pack, bandaids, etc. There were things we would not have needed but another family may require. Such a well-prepared home to meet all our needs as if we were staying in our own home. I especially enjoyed reading through the House Rules booklet. We were able to put out the trash from the home so it would not leave an odor.
The boys and I were putting together a puzzle that was available at the house. We hope to stay again next summer when we visit Alpena again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay was great! Easy to find, clean, and looked just like the pictures! Matthew was very friendly and responsive. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"i was sooo lucky to find this house. Perfect location handy to everything in Alpena, only a block from a pretty little beach park. Sidewalks to walk my girls and a fenced in yard.
Supplied with everything you could ask for.
And Matthew, the host, was amazing. I felt safe and comfortable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Matthew's place! Location is great...just off the main road (US 23) and close to beach access to Lake Huron. The house was very clean and included all the necessary amenities for our comfort. Communication was easy and always responsive. The things we look for in an Airbnb are value, pet-friendliness, cleanliness, proximity to area attractions and being in a safe environment. Metthew's place exceeded our expectations in each of these areas. We sincerely appreciate the warm hospitality and gracious generosity of our host!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay in Alpena was great! Matt was a great host and made sure we were all set and even left a card for our anniversary upon arrival. Location was awesome…close to the water with lots to do and the yard was great for our energetic pup 😀 Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place and very friendly host!
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Matthew was a great host. He was very kind, and helped us with any information and questions we needed in order to have a great stay. My friends and I were looking for a getaway before we walk for graduation at the end of the month and we are all glad we chose to stay here. The home was as pictured, with fully stocked kitchen, bathroom, etc. Everything you could think of and much more. The weather was accommodating so we were able to walk around the shops and sights of downtown Alpena. It was definitely worth waking up early in the morning to watch the sunrise, and even saw the Lunar eclipse one morning. We could tell Matthew really cares about trying to make sure his guests have a stress free and safe vacation and I would recommend this Air BnB to anyone who is deciding to travel to Alpena. Thank you so much Matthew for letting us stay with you !"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very responsive and communicative host. Personalized card welcoming us awaited on the dining room table at check in. Soft pillows and comfortable beds and linens. Plus: If I had brought my pups on this trip, the space would have been a dream for them with the available dog toys, towels, lint roller, water bowls and backyard."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The only suggestion would be additional seating in living too besides couch. Otherwise, this was a great location."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew was very accommodating! I requested the booking with very short notice and he got right back to me and made it work beautifully!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an excellent stay in ALPENA for the weekend. Everything was as described. Matt was wonderful. Highly recommend.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Matthew is a great hosts. We had a personalized greeting at the door and a welcome card. House is beautiful and roomy with everything you could want available. Had an issue with the coffee maker that was fixed same day. He was very responsive and communicated well. Highly recommend!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Matthew has a beautiful place in a great location! He was ultra-responsive and proactive with recommendations via text for what to do on a colder day. By far one of the better hosts we have had.
Alpena is a great spot for a lot of different outdoor to-do’s. We were up there for our kids, 5 and 9 yo, spring break and wanted to go fossil collecting up at Rockport and on some of the area beaches. Knowing this, Matthew had recommendations ready and also had a couple of buckets ready for us to use.
5 star host!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay here. The house was clean, true to the listing, and comfortable. We also appreciated the detailed and helpful information on checking in and property expectations."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So glad we had a chance to stay at this gem! The home is clean and Matthew went above and beyond to make our stay great. He even thinks of the little things like providing a picnic basket and blanket to use. There's a whole section of beach towels, outdoor kid toys, animal bowls and toys... just things you may not have thought or had room to pack but make you feel right at home. Matthew is a great communicator and has some good restaurant suggestions. I would also add The Nest and RBs are great places to eat! The beds were clean and comfortable, and we had everything we needed provided at the home. His cleaners even found something of our son's that had slipped between the couch cushions and he mailed it home for us, he just went above and beyond even after we left to make everything about our stay with him amazing."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Matthew’s place was the perfect home base for our excursions to Thompson’s Harbor and Rockport State Park. The house was well stocked with everything we needed and the fenced backyard was a big plus as we brought our dog.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,He was very concerned and helpful during our visit.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first Airbnb and i wasnt sure what to expect when actually arriving and seeing the place. The photos were very accurate to what was listed and seeing it in person was even more suprising with how clean and well kept everything was!
It felt so nice to bring my two dogs and not have any worries since they prepare for dogs if they come along ( AMAZING THE THINGS THEY HAD ON HAND FOR THAT!!! )
I am from alpena so i know the area very well and felt very safe being there as its in a nice quiet block but also close to any store or the beautiful lake and beaches. Cant wait to book again in the summer time!
Matthew was so responsive and kept everything in the driveway for the winter time safe and clear of snow! I had a few family members visit since they live in alpena and they were impressed as well and also thought the price was very affordable and they will be recommending their family members to book this home as well :-)"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay! Was exactly what we needed, what we were hoping for, and made us feel at home!! Thank you!!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The residence was very clean. It had everything you would need to make yourself at home, and the price was much cheaper then other BNB’s in the area. Matt was helpful and I would rent again from him!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first pet friendly trip. Matthew was so kind and thoughtful that our trip was a success! There was dog blankets and towels, toys, and food and water dishes that were available for us to use. He also had a beautiful yard out back that was fenced in with doggie bags and a trash container for us to use. Plus, Matthew was very quick to respond to any questions. He was able to give good suggestions for local restaurants. The house was quiet, peaceful and easy to find."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place definitely lives up to the super host rating.💕The home was easy to find and access especially when we came in and it was dark. The utility room entrance is very nice and accessible for pets as well. Everything was nice and cozy, immaculately clean with many amenities should you forget something. Matthew is thoughtful was very responsive and kind to think of pets; providing extra pet waste bags if you run out and designated towels and blankets to help keep your fur babies comfortable and clean.
The dog run is such an amazing feature our pups loved it, it was also easy to access from the patio and the fencing was very sturdy and well maintained as was the landscaping.
It’s also within walking distance to the heart of downtown and you can literally see the water from the east facing windows.
Don’t miss out on this one if your thinking about it book it!!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet setting off the busy road. Easy access to the lake and downtown. Great place to stay.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay ! Close to town, convenient & very clean."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We decided on Matthew's home because of the great reviews, house has a king size bed on main floor. It exceeded our expectations. It is an older home but in excellent condition. We felt right at home as soon as we got there. Matthew paid attention to details and gave us some suggestions for things to do besides the plans we already had, which was the sleigh ride at Thunder Bay resort. I highly recommend this ride too. You get to see elk and have a great dinner in the woods.
I will be happy to recommend this home."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Matthew was absolutely fantastic throughout our stay checking in with us, making sure we had everything we needed. The home was exactly what we needed for our quick trip north. We were in town for a family funeral and with a lack of pet friendly hotels this was perfect for us! Great outdoor fence space for our fur babies as well as a pet friendly home. Thank you so much for making this a painless and comfortable stay! Would highly recommend! I will also add that it is directly across the street from the lake so in the summer this property would an amazing place to stay for lake fun!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Only a very short walk to the public beach and near everything. A great stay in a very clean and welcoming home.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect in every way. Close to everything I needed. Amazingly clean and had everything I could possibly need. Super great communication always. Helpful and quick to respond. Definitely will be back.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Clear instructions from Matthew and easy check in. Should be noted this Airbnb is a duplex type dwelling.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place and it had everything we needed. The location is perfect, and you can walk downtown to the shops or to the beaches. We unfortunately were visiting during a freak winter storm and were stuck inside most of the trip but Matthew was very accommodating and was out shoveling the driveway as necessary. We stayed for Christmas and the decorations and board games gave it a nice homey feel."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Matthew was great with communication. The space was comfortable and the amenities were even better than described. We would stay there again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location is ideal - less than a block to Lake Huron, and short walks to the many beaches along the lake in Alpena.
Matthew makes you feel at home right away with a welcome message in the home.
And it is both spacious and cozy - still not sure how he pulls that off."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very stocked home in a great location! Curling up on the couch in front of the electric fireplace with my pet Polly made it that even more enjoyable! Cooking was a breeze with how fully equipped the kitchen was and the beds were so comfortable, I hardly wanted to leave!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great stay.
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,This was the best stocked and most accommodating air bnb I have ever stayed at. I want to say Matthew goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. The house was even decorated for Halloween. It was awesome. I would rent from Matthew anywhere he had a property! The place was also sparkling clean and located in a great spot for anything you want to do in Alpena.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew's place was in a great location in Alpena - close to US 23, the lake, and other things to do in Alpena. It's very comfortable as well and had everything that we needed. Finally it was very clean - we didn't even notice any stains or smells from previous pet guests (we didn't have any pets with us on this trip, but it looks like a great place for pets!)
Also, Matthew is a really good host. He made extra efforts to communicate and provide us with a good experience and left personal notes to make us feel welcome.
One thing that wasn't super clear to me when I booked - there is an attached structure in the back of the house that I think is Matthew's residence when in town. We were a little confused at first, but it didn't affect the rest of our stay at all (the entrances are completely separate so still private). Just think that would be helpful to clarify :)"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Matthew's place is clean, well-stocked and in a good location close to beaches, parks and shopping. Aside from that, Matthew is a very gracious and accommodating host."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home has everything you need to enjoy a nice stay in Alpena. It is located within walking distance to many parks and water walkways which we enjoyed throughout the weekend. The home was comfortable and stocked with essentials- especially those you typically forget at home. Matt was the most attentive and responsive Air BNB host I have ever worked with. He made recommendations upon our request throughout our stay and that helped us decide what to do/where to eat. He left special touches including little dinosaur toys for our toddler who is Dino obsessed (we checked out Dinosaur Gardens) and champagne for my husband and I who celebrated our second wedding anniversary while we were in Alpena. Everything was perfect, thanks so much!"
2022-10-01,3,Stayed with a pet,Be aware that the home is attached to the owners residence. Absolutely no privacy.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in Matthew's house in early October. The house was very cute, and we appreciated all the touches that made it so comfy. We especially appreciated the fenced-in yard for our pups. It was a very nice visit."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Due to a family illness we had to cancel our travel plans and reservation, but Matthew was very understanding and went out of his way to offer us some alternatives for a future stay. I would give him 5 stars for customer service and I am sure that is a reflection of the quality of accommodations you can expect from his listing on airbnb."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt was very responsive and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. The house is spacious, clean and well-stocked. Near downtown but located in a quiet residential area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I chose this house specifically because of the rule allowing pets. I was in Alpena to visit my husband who is training at the local CRTC. I needed a place to stay that allowed my large 100lb+ dog. Matt's house was extremely clean and it was actually even more than what I needed. There is a master bedroom on the first floor which i used and 2 upstairs bedrooms. Because I was traveling with a work obligation, I needed a remote work area. The upstairs bedroom seemed to get the best wifi. You can tell this host takes pride in their home and making sure everything is perfect. I would highly recommend this House to anyone ! also there is a nearby Starbucks- it's win win !"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was nothing short but amazing. Matthew was such a great host and very accommodating, especially for our toddler and 2 pups. The home felt very cozy and it is in such a great area, and walking distance to the marina. The bedrooms have that cabin feel and the memory foam mattress toppers were the perfect touch. We loved that there were separate baskets for the dogs (which include blankets/towels) cleaning supplies, a basket with toys for little kids. We felt right at home here and definitely recommend this home to anyone looking to stay close to downtown alpena."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for a stay in Alpena! Plenty roomy for the whole family and pets and located only a few minutes from downtown.
Matthew was a great host and the house is stocked up with plenty of amenities. Could not have asked for anything more."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended. Hope to be able to return. Home is very well maintained and easy to get to and right across the road from Lake Huron. I could hear the waves in the evening. Very cute, safe, walkable neighborhood …lots of small parks to see and experience the Great Lake. All the comforts of home are available here. Matthew has thought of everything. He is very responsive to questions during the stay. Loved the touches such as a personalized welcome board upon arrival. My dogs felt welcomed with dog blankets and toys available as well as a fenced yard. Kitchen was very well stocked and made cooking very easy. King bed and bedding are very comfy and cozy. Very close to stores and restaurants and local activities, farmers markets (seasonally), etc. Centrally located to many popular scenic attractions, light houses, etc."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean, spacious and in a great location. Beds and furniture were comfortable. Kitchen was fully stocked. Beaches and parks were within walking distance. Awesome fenced in yard for the dogs. Host was very detailed and communicated well. Would stay again if in the area."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful house with easy access to beaches and downtown!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home truly was everything we were looking for as a family with two young children and a dog. Location was perfect, walking distance to beaches and parks. They thought of everything, from the s’mores supplies, kids toys, dog blankets, and sweet welcome sign/note. My son says he can’t wait to go back to the “White House” next year!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a fabulous stay at Matthew’s home in Alpena. Check-in was easy, we were greeted with such a nice welcome note, and the house was impeccably clean. The host thought of everything we could have needed, including anything our dogs needed. The fully fenced backyard was wonderful and my dogs loved it! We also loved that the house is within walking distance of downtown and several waterfront parks. It’s a quiet neighborhood and it was the perfect atmosphere for us to relax in. I can’t think of a single thing the hosts could have done better. We hope to be back again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great host, really responsive and thoughtful!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was very clean and well equipped with basic household items. The location is great. The beach and restaurants are all within walking distance. We traveled with our two dogs, so it was nice having the fenced in yard. I would definitely recommend Matthew’s place if traveling to Alpena."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, great host! Just a block from the water and a short walk to shops and restaurants. Nice outdoor seating area and large fenced in back yard, which was perfect for our dog."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I would definitely recommend booking with Matthew! The house was clean, close location to the beach and downtown! Pet friendly too!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really cool family friendly place! House is open and inviting. Loved the welcome sign! As a family, we appreciated not having to haul along large items for baby as pack n play and highchair were provided upon request ;-). Loved the close proximity to beaches and the thoughtful personal touches/items provided for beach, kids, and dog. If you can think of it, this home likely has it (i.e. q-tips in the medicine cabinet and SHOUT stain remover). Loved the recycle cans! Neighborhood is pretty quiet. If you like taking walks on any of the paths at the nearby parks, watch out for the goose poop. Great home and great stay, thank you!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay in Alpena! Perfect location, great communication, and a wonderful place!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Perfect house and location for a lake getaway! Short walk or even quicker drive to multiple beaches. Downtown Alpena has some great food/drink spots and is super close. The house and yard were perfect for our dog and us for the week! Matt was super responsive and helpful during our stay. Would definitely recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"COMFY beds, VERY clean, GREAT water pressure, and very well stocked! We loved being able to have our dogs with us, they loved our walks to the local park nearby and the backyard was very convenient to play fetch, complete with a tennis ball! We had a very relaxing stay, whether we stayed in, hit up a few shops and restaurants downtown or walked the local parks. Would definitely come back!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay! Great place! Helpful host! Lots of nice touches—beach towels and items, basic food items, pet supplies, games, and they even went out and bought a new fan when I asked if there was an extra one. They take good care of their guests."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay in Alpena within walking distance to the beach, the town, the pier. The house is very clean and has plenty of amenities and anything you might need during your stay. Beds and linens are new and if you bring a dog everything is covered for your pet, including dishes, clean up bags, blankets, fenced yard, etc. Great Airbnb!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location- small beach right across the street and 10 minute walk to giant beach with amazing splash pad and park! Very cozy home with plenty of provided toiletries, cleaning supplies, towels and nice linens. Quality pillows! Very pet friendly with a fenced in side/back yard. Hosts are very attentive- this was our third stay and hope to be back!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place

2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Matt's Airbnb while I was going to school and doing rotations at the hospital in Alpena. Matt is an absolutely phenomenal host. He is so accommodating, and very responsive to any questions you may have while ensuring he gives you all the privacy you need. He does a wonderful job keeping the house clean and stocked with any supplies you could possibly need. The backyard is absolutely PERFECT if you any pets, and the outdoor fire pit is such a nice touch. It is across the street from a gorgeous park on the water, and just minutes from downtown. Thank you so much for being such a great host Matt!! I can't wait to come back and enjoy the house again soon."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent location, super clean, and nice outdoor space that would have been great if we'd been there in the warmer months. Overall, good place to stay."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was within view of the lake, the hosts were fantastic with accomodations, communication, and plugging local events and places to go.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My wife and I have stayed at a bunch of airbnbs around the world and this was one of the best and definitely most accurate as the details and photos are spot on. I reserved this place for work as I was tired of hotels and this place was so much nicer to come back to rather than a plain hotel room. Matt, the host, is great and very easy to communicate with. The house has everything you need and even things you might not think you need as it is well stocked beyond the basics. Internet was excellent and high speed which is also used for the TV which is beyond what you would ever get at a hotel with various apps and premium channels. I loved the grill and firepit and if I brought my wife and dogs I know they would have enjoyed it, especially the big backyard for the dogs. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future if my travel schedule and availability work out."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We’re glad we didn’t pass on this option! Matt was very thorough with instructions and communication, and there was not one thing that we needed! Our dogs had a huge area indoors for their kennels, as well as a fenced in yard that was large. The location is perfect and the neighborhood safe. This property is well cared for and comfortable, and we would recommend it for your family, as well as those traveling with dogs."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Matt was a great host- very communicative and helpful. The house was cozy and clean- and being dog friendly was such a huge bonus. Well worth the value! We will be back.
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Very clean, well-stocked Airbnb! We loved having a fenced in yard we could bring our dog. There were so many personal touches that went the extra mile for making our stay feel like home away from home. Beds are very comfortable and hosts were very responsive when we had questions."

2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is very clean. Matt and Lisa definitely go the extra mile for all guests, including pets and children! They have big baskets full of pet supplies, children's toys and beach supplies. And lots of containers for recycling! Beds were very comfortable! Communication was above average! Great location, with beaches and parks very close, and walking distance to town. I definitely recommend this place and we will be staying again if we go back to Alpena."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. The host was quick to communicate. Check in was easy and just as explained in the description. It was clean and well supplied. The location is great as it is very close to the beach and restaurants within a short drive or a longer walk. The neighbors were friendly. When we stayed there was construction on the street, but we were still able to park in front of the house. Although we didn't use the grill, fire pit, or patio it was nicely set up and would be wonderful. I was impressed with the baskets of supplies for dogs, the beach, and children. The fenced in yards were convenient for letting our dog play in a safe place. We brought our dog crate, and it easily fit in the living room without being in the way. The provided dog blankets meant our pup could sit on the couch with us just like she does at home. When we go back to visit Alpena, we will definitely stay here if it's available."

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Matt's home was a fantastic place to spend our weekend getaway. The location was top notch (walking distance to beachside parks and downtown shopping, restaurants, etc) and the house had everything we could possibly need and more. Matt was a stellar host and was extremely hospitable from the time we booked our reservation through the day we checked out. I would highly recommend others to explore this hidden gem in the Alpena area!"

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Matt’s place was clean and tidy and full of great conveniences, including a large yard for the dog to run, complete with a squirrel to chase. The house is located within walking distance to sandy beaches and only a fifteen minute drive from Rockport State Recreation Area, a fantastic place for fossil-hunting! Communication was clear, the beds were comfy, and we really enjoyed our stay! Do not hesitate to book when in the Alpena area."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Top notch stay! Great value, roomy house. We loved the big dining table and the kitchen was well equipped. Comfy bedrooms and lots of little extras for kids. These hosts really go out of their way to offer the extras for comfort or entertainment!
The outdoor space with fire pit is a little smaller than I had pictured, but we were here for other reasons and it didn’t matter much to us.
Communication was fantastic - easy, fast responses, and kind. Thanks for making our visit even better than we hoped!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Always feel comfortable and relaxed there. Matthew is very accommodating and we couldn't think of anything we needed that wasn't provided. The best airbnb we have stayed at.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"GREAT EXPERIENCE! We had such a fabulous time making memories at this house! It’s close to the Bi-path, downtown, and all the beaches and parks. It’s situated on a quiet street. Our stay was comfortable, and cozy. The space is beautifully decorated in its simplicity while also organized, functional, and clean. It was prepared with all the little extras you might need—spices, toiletries, beach towels, good-quality pots and pans, games, toys, etc. The beds were super comfortable and we slept well. There was plenty of room for our little boys to play, and the space was decorated minimally so they could play (respectfully) without fear of breaking some special trinket. We played a lot of hide and seek—the house has great closets for it! Matt and his family have done an absolutely wonderful job making the place feel like home. Matt was quick to respond to any of our questions. He is very approachable, thoughtful, and conscientious. Check in was easy. We can’t wait until we can stay there again soon and visit our beloved Alpena."

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! The location, price, amenities and overall house are great. My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back again. Mike is a phenomenal host. We couldn’t be happier. Very walkable area, right by the water and numerous waterfront parks. Great private patio area in the side yard with picnic table, chairs an above ground fire pit and a gas grill. Large fenced back yard for pets, kids, yard games or hanging out. We would definitely recommend this place."

Highly recommend and will stay again next time in Alpena."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,These were some of the best host... their place was very clean. They paid extra attention to small details like a thank you note to our family and good luck wishes to our hockey boys. The welcomed our chocolate lab whom we bring all over for our 7 year old who has had two open heart surgeries and had Down syndrome. Finding a place that accepts dogs isn’t always easy and they not only welcomed Koda but had dog blankets and dishes. We are a family who values time and travel together. The hosts were exceptional and their place perfect location and exceptionally clean! Great communication! Comfortable beds and pillows! Would highly recommend.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time and our dogs loved the space and the yard. There's lots of little extra dog friendly touches that we really appreciated. Matt is super friendly and very quick to respond to any questions. It's also a great little neighborhood with nice neighbors.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matthew's place is wonderful! My parents, husband, two dogs and I stayed two night, and the house was a cozy space for us to relax at the end of our days of exploring. The house was so clean, the beds comfy, the kitchen full of supplies, and the dog supplies showed how really welcome pets are. We didn't take advantage of the firepit, but we did utilize the bigger yard for the dogs to run around in. We also loved the nice walk from the house to the water and to downtown. We would absolutely stay here again! My dogs would too. :)"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend staying here for your next trip to Alpena. Myself, my fiancé and another couple stayed for the weekend in March. We also had our three large dogs with us as well. It was so nice that this home was pet friendly. The fenced in backyard was great for them and we would have loved to spend more time out there had the weather been nicer. The home is close to everything and there is a park on the lake just around the corner. Matt was easy to communicate with and the house had everything you could ever need including stuff for the pets. We will definitely be back soon."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and coworker have stayed here numerous times for work in Alpena, and have never been disappointed . Everything was food and communication between the property owner has never been a issue, they will stay again when in Alpena."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful up north getaway! We spent 4 days at Matts working from home with our two doggos. It felt like home away from home. The large fenced in yard/courtyard and amenities like water bowls, dog blankets, disposal bags etc. were wonderful for pet owners. There are few Airbnb’s that go to that extent to make people’s trips that much more comfortable. Home and kitchen were fully equipped with everything from spices, toiletries if you forgot any and blankets. Home was very, very clean. We were within walking distance from downtown, wonderful coffee shops, restaurants and stores. Lake Huron was directly across the street. Matt was awesome with communication and provided us great hiking recommendations, firewood and s’more supplies for a bonfire. We were sad to leave! Can’t wait to come back in the summer!!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and coworker have stayed at this fine property a couple of times for work and will again. It is very clean and these folks are more than accommodating you will enjoy your stay.

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Matt’s place was exactly as described, plus more such as plenty of coffee & tea, s’mores supplies, & hot chocolate. The kitchen & bathroom were fully stocked with anything we could have needed. Our dogs loved the fenced in yard & we were thrilled to find a place where they were welcome. Location was perfect; walking distance to downtown & many parks along the water. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A clean, comfortable spot for a winter weekend getaway. Loved how easy it was to walk downtown or drive to nearby spots for snowy walks.

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is cozy and very clean. Nice personal welcome note and had s’mores supplies new and ready for us to have a campfire!

Cant wait for the next trip!

2020-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Staying at Matt’s beautiful home in Alpena was the single best Airbnb experience I have had to date. As a young professional looking to stay in Alpena for a month for work, I did my homework beforehand. Matt’s place offered the most in terms of amenities and location (very close to downtown and the beach), all within a reasonable price range. There was even an outdoor patio area complete with a firepit and grill! The best part was having a HUGE fenced in yard for my two doggos to run around in!! The place was very clean upon arrival and Matt always went above and beyond to respond to any needs or questions I had during my stay. Alpena is a beautiful city with much to offer in terms of outdoor activities and small town charm. I've already booked my next trip to Alpena with Matt and I recommend you do the same! ;)"

easy in/out direction for unlocking door. great location, and SUPER quiet rooms. a very peaceful rest was had."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would stay again. Perfectly located, I never used my car once. Easy parking and check-in. Very beautiful historic building with tall windows. Included tons of informational brochures about Alpena which I found incredibly helpful. Lots of extras, like chocolates, portable beach chairs and towels, coffee for the AM. Had everything you needed for cookware too. Plus a comfortable space to work. Felt very safe. Enjoyed the higher view. Only critics I have are that I could definitely hear the folks next door through the walls, and it was a bit odd that there was no bathroom door on the master suite (the bedroom itself has a door of course, and the guest half bath in the front also has one). Just minor things worth mentioning in case that matters to someone, but overall a great stay. I would recommend it."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Location was excellent. Two blocks to the park and lake. One block to downtown.
Renovations to this historic building were well done."

We would definitely stay there again.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a little trouble finding the building but Chad was very helpful when we called! He had everything set up so it was easy access once we got to the building.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely apartment with lots of room. It was nice to have the additional half bath so we didn't wake each other in the morning.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Chad's place after we decided to shorten our 30th anniversary trip. (My husband bought me a pool for my birthday two weeks before, so we needed to downsize our trip.) We found Chad's place while searching along the northeast coast of Michigan. We knew nothing about Alpena, but Chad's listing caused us to pause and check it out a bit. After a few minutes of searching, we decided that Alpena had a few interesting things to do and booked the apartment.
Alpena is almost like a Hallmark movie village, and Chad’s place is right in the middle of it all. We were able to walk to the grocery store, walk to the park by the lake, walk to dinner several nights at a variety of places, walk to cute shops, walk to the sunken ship tour boat, and bike to the sand beach a short distance south of the downtown area. It was an easy and beautiful drive to Presque Isle where we biked to both lighthouses and hiked at Thompson’s State Park. We also visited Rockport State Park and hiked in the quarry.
Check-in was easy. The apartment had a code for the door. When we walked in, we were greeted by 12-foot ceilings and an immaculately clean space. The kitchen, dining, and living room areas are open and surrounded by tall windows with blinds for privacy. The kitchen had everything we needed to make breakfast each morning. The bedroom and master bath are spacious. The bathroom has a shower with two shower heads and fluffy, soft towels. The queen bed is so comfortable!!!
Chad had excellent communication and left brochures and maps to help us find our way around. We were in town for really only two short days and three nights, but we packed in so much and really enjoyed ourselves, the apartment, and Alpena. We will definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful apartment in a great location! The cleanliness was superb, and the space is beautiful. Right next to Downtown Alpena and the beach. Would 100% stay again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice place, comfortable and clean. Lots of parking, easy access."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fully recommend this place to stay while in Allpena. Beautiful, comfortable, and clean apartment in a cool renovated building. Within walking distance of downtown Allpena and the scenic areas along Lake Huron."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Pete's place was exactly as shown and described. Awesome new flooring, paint and ""Up North"" appropriate furnishings. TV and WiFi worked flawlessly. My son really enjoyed playing PS4 nightly.
What really stood out was the cleanliness of the home and the endless number of added amenities. We didn't get to enjoy the provided Smores kit as we were too busy enjoying hiking and exploring area. House was truly pet friendly with provided dog dishes, yard stakes for teether, dog toys, treats and even towels meant for the dog. House had everything to fully enjoy and was decorated to make my family feel at home. Pete was very responsive in communications, and it was obvious he wants you to enjoy your stay. Will stay again in the future as we have family in the area."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I only gave 5 stars, because I couldn't give more. Incredibly welcoming cottage and was exactly like the photos and description. Pete made everything seamless with his quick responses, which made extending our stay incredibly easy. To say it was pet friendly is an understatement, there's a great yard for the dog and they included towels and dishes for the pets. The sprinkles of added value throughout the house were such a charming touch, coffee, snacks, even a smores kit! I would highly recommend this over a hotel if you're heading to Alpena, it's a MUCH better value! I can't thank Pete enough for the wonderful home he provided us while we were there."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A wonderful stay - super clean and such a charming place. Loved the park across the street for walks. Amenities galore …including games, books and snacks! We’ve stayed in a lot of airbnbs and this one is very special and a top favorite of all time! The attention to detail is off the charts!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places we have stayed. Very clean, private, and I have never seen so many little ""extras"" from a host before. We will defiantly stay at Pike House Park Place the next time we visit Alpena."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Was pleasantly surprised at how spacious it was and accommodated all of my family members perfectly. It was nice and private and had plenty of space for my dogs to stretch their legs in the yard. They were nice enough to leave items like Dunkin Donuts coffee and a S’mores kit for my family to enjoy during our stay along with all the little extras required for cooking, cleaning, and comfort. Thank you for trusting me and my family to bring our loved Great Danes along with us on vacation for a family wedding. We will definitely be back and added bonus it was a mile from other family living in the area. Highly recommend"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the location. Every aspect of our experience was flawless, leaving us with no hesitation in making a future reservation."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had the best family get away at Pete’s place. We loved the privacy of the yard and the lake was just a short walk away. Most of all I loved that the whole family could come, even the dogs. We cooked out of the grill, enjoyed s’mores, and even saw the Perseid meteor shower right from the yard. Such a great place, we will definitely visit again.,"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Pete was very responsive when we needed to reach out about the coffee maker not working. We woke up the next morning with a new one on the porch washed and ready to use. We had plenty of space for our family of 5 and the outdoor space was very peaceful.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect! Everting you could hope for was there but it still wasn’t cluttered. Great games and toys for the kids too! The host was always super responsive and eager to make the stay as wonderful as possible. Thanks for a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We stayed at the Pike House for a week. We were impressed with the size of the house and yard. Many activities available from games to movies and toys. The kitchen was well stocked with herbs and spices, staples such as olive oil, snacks and water. The beds were comfortable. We stayed in bedroom on front of house. Plenty of hangers in closets, cute decorative themes in every room and plenty of seating.
We will stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pete was an excellent host! We had a lovely stay and he had everything we needed and more. Love the touches for our furry friends and the guest book was extremely helpful in finding local attractions as well as giving a low down on the property! Rent from him, absolutely worth it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay and this house had everything we needed for our family trip.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The space and grounds are just as described in the listing. There were a lot of surprise extras that I have not had in other locations, which makes this place stand out a little bit more. The owner is quick to respond to questions and was helpful. I know there will be future stays here not only by me but by other family members as they were just as impressed with the care and amenities provided. It felt like home only cleaner."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pete is a wonderful host and the place felt like home the minute we walked in. It was very clean and cozy. The attention to little details was very impressive. We would absolutely book again and recommend to all our friends and family. The dog toys and towels were such a welcomed touch. Thanks again, Pete!"

Very spacious indeed!!
A stones throw to the action of downtown but not too close!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have been coming to Alpena since I was a young child and I have to say that I will definitely stay here again! It was located right in the heart of town so access to everything was very easy. The home was wonderfully stocked with little goodies, very clean and beautifully furnished. My daughter especially enjoyed playing the electric piano. Now we have to buy one for home. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is adorable. It’s a delightful place to stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing host and wondeful house! It is seriously so cute!!! Definitely well staged! Jennie was extremely responsive and so easy to work with! I checked in quite late, as my flight was delayed and she went ahead and left the outside light on to make it easy for me to locate the house. That was just the beginning of the little extras that Jennie provided. The house had everything you could need from laundry detergent, ziploc bags, shampoo, coffee/tea, sugar, spices, etc. You literally only need to bring what food you want as everything else was provided. Huge plus in my book! The house is in a great area and within walking distance to some shops and such. Highly recommend!! I look forward to renting from her again next time I'm in the area."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay if you’re traveling to alpena!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and Jennie is great. The home has a lot of original features and all the modern amenities you need.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jennie was a great host. She responds very quickly and described the place exactly how it was. She answered right away and was very kind the entire time.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a great place to stay, we came up for the weekend for a hockey tournament. My son played Sunday morning and she was willing to let us do a late check out as he played early enough to not be able to do it after the game in time. The only downfall was that my handicapped mom came with and we did not realize all the bedrooms were on the 2nd floor (I may have missed this somewhere though). But we would definitely stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jennie was very responsive. We did have to reaout to her about a couple things that were out of anyone's control and she responded immediately and was very friendly and helpful. Great house and great host.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,The house was great but working with Jenny was even better! The furnace unfortunately quit during our stay but she was on top of it right away and even offered to pay for a hotel until it was fixed. We also had on extra vehicle than what the driveway could hold so she offered to park it at her house. Truly can’t speak highly enough about Jenny.

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful cabin on the water channel. Located in a quiet but friendly neighborhood. I appreciate the open spaces for groups to hang out and smaller spaces for individuals to enjoy too. Federico was a very helpful host. We drove in during a winter blizzard and he was very communicative on several questions we had during our stay. I am most thankful for when we got snowed in and my Jeep got stuck, Federico was able to call someone to shovel out the cars. This was a very big help and relief!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was an amazing home for a cozy relaxing getaway! I would 100% stay here again in the future! Everything was clean and looked exactly like the pictures!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a lovely home! Both our boys are in the military and we were unable to see them so my husband and I decided to take a short vacation for our first Christmas as empty nesters.

The neighborhood is nice and quiet. we had a wonderful time! Thanks again! John and Kim

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We stay in Alpena once and month and this was our favorite place by far! The scene was beautiful and all the little amenities made it feel like home. We had absolutely everything we needed and more! They were so accommodating with our requests and were willing to help with our dogs (who were outside of their restrictions).
We could not be happier. This is by far the best place/accommodations we have had and we have stayed at a plethora of Airbnb’s. If you want a quiet, beautiful getaway-you won’t be disappointed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was beautiful and peaceful with lots of activities available (indoor and out). As a family of 5 we found the cost was a bit high during “off season” as it was too cold to appreciate the many amenities (kayaking, outdoor fire pit etc) but it was definitely reasonably priced for larger families which it can easily accommodate 8 people and being able to have our fur child with us was definitely worth it. No regrets staying here, hosts were quick and easy to communicate with and the place was extremely well thought out and welcoming. Almost resort like. We travel to Alpena at least 2-3x per year and will definitely check if this rental is available when we do!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing getaway.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This place was simply amazing! Me and my social worker friends were in desperate need for a relaxing weekend getaway where we could stay at a house and have everything we needed right there. This place was more than perfect for it. It looked exactly like the pictures and was very clean including the kitchenware! Our personal favorite was the hot tub and the stars were so visible at night, it was just an amazing experience altogether. Could not recommend this place more and we are already planning to come back to this place in the summer and make use of the kayaks as well. I could not recommend this airbnb more!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My fiance and I stayed here for our 5 year anniversary we absolutely loved it and felt right at home.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Emily’s! My family and I stayed for three nights at Emily’s home for a family event we were attending in Alpena.
First of all, the location was beautiful - so peaceful and serene and right on the water! There were two kayaks and two longboards available for our use and we absolutely loved our time out on the water - what a delight!
Emily’s home was well appointed with everything we needed and had a lot of very nice modern updates. There was plenty of space for our family to hangout - both inside and out! The swinging bench outside on one of the porches was also such a great touch. Home was also very clean and beds were comfortable.
Emily was also very communicative and responsive and accommodating of our needs throughout the stay!
Overall I would highly recommend a stay at Emily’s if you are in the Alpena area!"

Emily’s place was great - it actually felt like home, she provides almost everything you would need from home (I didn’t use it but there was even a high chair!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We are a production company, and we lodged one of our star talents here; he loved it! Tammy was so friendly and kind, and her place was just beautiful! She also answers right away, which in our business was VERY helpful! The house was extremely clean and located in a perfect spot for someone who didn't have a car! Outstanding experience in every way!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Came to Alpena for my best friend's wedding. Had a wonderful time there and stay at this listing. The house was perfect size and very clean. Love the wood floors and carpet in the bedrooms. beautiful kitchen. highly recommend 😊
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is adorable, clean, updated, and a walkable distance from downtown AND the beach. You can't really ask for more in Alpena.
The kitchen is beautiful, the house is spacious, and my wife and I felt very comfortable there. A great home-base for exploring the town and surrounding areas."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked Tamy’s place based on all the positive reviews and our experience was consistent with the positive comments. We had a family of four in town for two days for a wedding at Long Lake. It was comfortable and convenient. We walked to downtown for dinner and morning coffee.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location within walking distance of downtown Alpena, a couple small public beaches and playgrounds.
House was recently renovated and very comfortable and cozy. Not to mention immaculate! Kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to put together some simple meals.
Thank you Tamy for sharing your home!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We've stayed in Tamy's places a few times now. This house feels just like being home. It's very clean and comfortable. Close to the beach and downtown. Great location. Tamy is responsive. Highly recommend this place. When we come to Alpena, Tamy's place is always our family's go-to."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,as always a great place to stay! Walkable and great location.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamy was a great host! She communicated well and was even able to let us check in early which worked out nicely for us. The home is in a great location, less than a 5 minute walk to Thomson Beach which we enjoyed. We were able to walk most places and if not it was just a short drive. The house was very clean and updated. It had everything we needed to cook and the washer/dryer was a plus. 10/10 would recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Tamy is a wonderful host, communicates well and checks in to see how you are doing and if anything is needed. We loved staying in this beautiful, cozy, comfortable charmer. Everything you need is provided and in walking distance of park, marina, water and pier."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful and very clean, and Tamy was great, making sure that we had everything that we needed. The house is easy walking distance to downtown and to both Bay View Park, which has tennis courts, basketball courts, and summer concert events, and Thompson Beach which is sandy and a great swim spot. The place has a nice big kitchen, a grill, and you can sit on the front porch and great the morning dog walkers and the unusual number if recumbant bicyclists.
We very much enjoyed our stay and felt that if we had needed anything, Tamy would have been available. Everything was perfect."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamy’s place was perfect for our family to stay. A spacious 2 bedrooms with a great sized living room and kitchen. I always appreciate when a place is mostly “kid-proofed”, no clutter or easily breakable things in reach. It was perfectly clean, comfortable, and Tamy is so friendly, kind and helpful. We definitely recommend a stay at her place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Stay, great home!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just fabulous. Thank you Tamy!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Tammy for hosting us. We enjoyed our stay in your beautiful home. We enjoyed our walks downtown for ice cream and to the parks. We loved porch sitting at the end of the day. It rained on our last day so didn't get to enjoy our beach day, but would definitely come again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home in a great location! We stayed in Alpena to visit with friends over the 4th of July Holiday. Home is very clean and well maintained! Home location is great - close to downtown for the parade and to the fireworks. There is shopping nearby and a park within walking distance. Host was great with communicating about check-in and out and expectations. She had the home ready for us early and allowed for a late checkout, even without us requesting either. Very accommodating! I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location. Hosts are super helpful."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed over a week,"Great place and location, we do not recommend this otherwise great house for people with difficulty using stairs. Tamy is a great host, communicative, and most helpful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved your place. The weather wasn’t the greatest so being in your home was a plus
Instead if a cramped hotel room. Location was perfect for our group."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great place. Tamy was an extremely accommodating host. Offered early check in. Always responded very quickly to questions. Would recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy's place is a nicely renovated and has all the comforts of home. Close to everything in this small town, and just steps from a small park with a beachfront on Lake Huron. Definitely would stay here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Treasure--Tamy’s hospitality is top notch!
Her home is clean and spacious! Walk into a full kitchen, dining table, fast internet, sweet view, and convenient location. Answer to a prayer!
You won’t find toxic air plugins, bad coffee, single ply toilet paper, or cheap toiletries. I enjoyed a peaceful atmosphere, conducive to prayer and zoom meetings. Tamy is quick to respond and share local favorites. Yes, to Mango’s protein bowl. Hope to be back in the summer."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tammy’s house is lovely and in a great location. We would definitely come back.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy's home is lovely and she is a wonderful host. The house was clean and well stocked. The wifi was fast and consistent. The kitchen had some spices and condiments which were very helpful. We loved the proximity to downtown and parks along the lakeshore. The only slight negative was that when we had the windows open at night, the noise from the train and cars on the road was quite noticeable. This cannot be helped due to the location on a somewhat busy road."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time here. No complaint. Comfortable and quiet
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Small older home that was clean and cozy. Comfortable for two people. Enjoyed our stay!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome spot in Alpena!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and spotless! Yes, it looks like the photos. We cook in mostly so we appreciated the kitchen amenities. Comfy beds and furniture is always a plus! Nice location near most everything we wanted to see. Look forward to visiting again this fall and will definitely stay here again. Our favorite spot was Rockport State Park, a rock lovers dream!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Esme’s place in Alpena! We felt right at home in this cozy house. The kitchen was well stocked, there were lots of clean towels and the bed was very comfortable. We enjoyed walking around this quiet neighbourhood as well as finding trails to hike that were close by. We would stay here again if we visited Alpena."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen had just the right amount of dishes and extras in it. The shades on the windows were modern, easy to raise and lower every evening. Bedding clean and comfortable. One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at. Super affordable"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was very clean, spacious, and felt right at home. Although we did not use it I appreciate the little snacks you had in the cabinets and how it was stocked with spices. I felt there was plenty of space for my suitcase and items I brought rather then useless decorative clutter. The hosts were very responsive and check in was easy. Felt very modern and updated. Thank you again for making our stay so cozy and comforting!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay! House and area is very quiet. Host was very responsive with any question! Will book again on our next visit.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for our weekend getaway! It was located near all the restaurants and museums we wanted to visit. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook full meals. We would certainly rent again if we returned to the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to stay. We will definitely be back there soon!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay here. We were comfortable right from the start, everything was so clean, tidy and cozy. Everything was in pristine shape, and you can tell a lot of thought and care went into the designing and furnishing of the house. Melissa and Esme were wonderful, and responded to messages very quickly. The layout of the house was perfect for our family, and the rooms really are light filled, which was refreshing and revitalizing after such a long gray winter! The house is very close to the downtown area and the lake, and in a quiet, family friendly neighborhood. We will definitely stay here again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As usual, we had a wonderful stay. We have been to many Airbnb homes in the area and this one by far has been the best. Let me tell you about some things that my wife and I really like. First of all it is clean, and that is very important to us. The kitchen is spacious and equipped with all pots and pans and utensils you will need. The family room is one of my favorites. It is very large with two sofas and a flat screen TV. The bedroom mattresses are extremely comfortable. I have a bad back and it is pretty rare that I find mattresses as comfortable as these. One of the other things that I really like about the home is that it has forced air heat. Many of the homes in the area have baseboard heat and they take a long time to warm up. Forced air heat warms up quickly. Also, response time from the owner of the home is also important. If I do ever have a question, all I do is send a message to Melissa and she response within 30 minutes. Highly recommended, but it does book up quickly!🙂"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very clean and comfortable."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely play to stay. Very clean and comfortable.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, great little house, quiet neighborhood. Very clean and well appointed. A coffee lover’s dream - there was a 12 cup drip coffee maker, two french presses, a coffee grinder, and both ground and whole bean coffee in the cupboards - as well as bagged tea and an electric tea kettle. Idk if that’s standard, but we appreciated it! Everything we needed for our weekend stay was at hand. We had a smashing breakfast at John Boy’s (definitely a hidden gem - the Giant Cinnamon Rolls were DIVINE), and sampled Mango’s Tequila Bar’s dinner (VERY tasty!!). Visited some of the Maritime Heritage Trail and Bay View Park. We packed a lot into our stay! Planning our next weekender already, and will definitely look to see if this home is available for our next visit."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely fantastically updated home, plenty of light ,new appliances, great location, and very comfortable bed and living room furniture! House heats up quickly after leaving for awhile, assume the opposite is true in the summer because"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was incredibly helpful. I booked the location a week later than I had intended. I didn't realize my mistake until I was on the front porch! Esme went into problem-solving mode immediately. The house was quickly cleaned and ready for an impromptu stay. Esme made it work, and I appreciate the quick accommodation."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,One of my favorite Airbnb’s in Alpena.
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as pictured and described. Prompt response to questions and concerns. Very well appointed and clean but not what I would consider immaculate. Beds were clean and comfortable. We happened to stay during a blizzard warning and inquired about snow removal - which they had but they didn't come until 9 pm when the blizzard warning was canceled at 4 am earlier that morning. Thankfully we had 4 wheel drive and a shovel to get out and drive the few blocks to get to a main road. I would definitely consider staying here again for the price and convenience. However, if you are sensitive to mold, there is one window in the kitchen that has not been replaced despite all the other updates, new windows and renovations - it had mold along sill. We noticed it when pulling the blinds down. The bathroom also had noticeable mold along the bathtub seal. We didn't notice a strong mold smell upon arrival but they had recently sprayed air freshener and we brought an air purifier from home."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed staying at your home Esma. The family room was large with plenty of comfortable couches and chairs. One of the things we really noticed is how quickly It warmed up inside. With you having forced air instead of baseboard heat makes a big difference. The kitchen was clean and well stocked. The bedrooms were spacious, and the beds very comfortable. We also used your dryer in the basement and noticed that the floor was freshly painted and it was very clean. Every couple of months we come up to visit my daughter and her family who live in Lachine. We will definitely be back again.🙂"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The house was a peaceful escape.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our second stay here and it was just as great as the first! We definitely felt right at home.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at this home. The small-town charm was so nice, and the slower pace was a great getaway from Southeastern Michigan. We already have a list going of things we would like to come back to the area for when it warmer and will definitely consider staying in the home again."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Felt like home. Comfortable. Would stay there again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice place in a good location. would stay again

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Exactly as pictured and very clean and tidy. Comfortable beds and the kitchen was fully stocked with dishes and cookware. We enjoyed our stay and would come again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My Wife and I were very pleased to stay at this house in Alpena, it was clean and well stocked with all the essentials we needed for our stay. Esme was very quick to respond anytime we contacted her and the area was beautiful and in a great neighborhood. We used the house as a place to sleep while visiting family but there a lot of places in the area to visit for activity’s or just site seeing."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a lovely stay! Would stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean and comfy! Great location and walkable to downtown and local restaurants. Melissa and Esme were very responsive and helpful. Would most definitely stay here again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay at Esme’s place.
Updated house, very clean, comfortable beds, well stocked modern kitchen with everything we needed. Convenient location in Alpena would definitely stay here again when in town!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a couple days with everything close!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family has been to many places and this will be a favorite. Lots of light, quiet neighborhood, nice set up, great kitchen and very comfortable. The place was spotless and had everything we would want. We'd give it an extra star if we could!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for allowing us to enjoy your home
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute house in a quiet neighborhood that was close to everything. There was everything we needed in the kitchen and bathroom. There was plenty of hot water. Appreciated the room darkening shades throughout.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay at the house. We were exploring the Alpena area because we hadn’t been to that part of the state. It was immaculate and beautifully decorated. It was a cozy spot to return to after a day of visiting parks and lighthouses. I have to mention that the bed was so very comfortable. We will definitely book here again when we return.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a good stay! The house is very clean & well supplied with everything needed for a comfortable stay. We would stay there again in the future.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I really enjoyed our stay. Everything was spotless and just as pictured. Very quiet neighborhood. Our favorite discovery was the cribbage board — we had forgot to bring one.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is so wonderful! I can’t stress enough how happy I was to stay in such a peaceful, clean, and comfortable little home. It’s just the right size, the beds were perfection, the bathroom spotless and the kitchen so bright and useful. There were so many thoughtful touches, like the stocked kitchen, including coffee which I forgot, so thanks for that! And little cosmetic items in the bathroom, electric conveniences in the bedrooms, and certainly the keyless option too. It’s much bigger than I anticipated, which was nice. Very tranquil, quiet neighborhood, and very easy to check in. Also the host was eager to help IF I needed it, which I didn’t! We back to visit this beautiful town in the future and will absolutely be recommending and staying at this home again. Thank you for such a great time!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a very accommodating home. It was clean and free of clutter. It had all the amenities that we would need for our stay. Not far from the downtown area. Great quality restaurants nearby. And close to the beach as well.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Only suggestion would be to install locks on the doors to the bathroom and bedroom, perhaps also to the basement as well. However understand that could present complexity since the door to the garage is locked as well.
Other than that everything was great no issues. Nice place.
Melissa, the Co-Host, was the main POC for this trip and she was great!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We couldn't have had a better experience! Great space, super clean, lots of amenities, host was almost instant with responding, and lots of other things that made us feel right at home. We will be booking with this host (and hopefully this exact home) on our next visit to Alpena."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, light-filled home base for an East Coast tour de force!
The host had everything in place and her help was spot on and kind.
Looking for another reason to make up to Alpena to stay in this lovely home!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! We enjoyed our stay very much! Very accommodating! Will stay here again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for our weekend stay in Alpena.
This home is so clean, well taken care of and well stocked with many items in the kitchen.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful stay. We appreciated the late check out and the quick response time.
The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. One mile from the lake.
The house was welcoming and had everything we needed. We cooked big breakfasts, made picnic lunches, and had big dinners at the house every day. The kitchen was well stocked with spices, cookware, pans, coffee, and even Cholula and Tabasco sauce. The windows helped everything be bright and cheerful. The bed was comfortable with soft linens. The bathroom clean, towels nice and overall welcoming. We would definitely stay again.
Again, we really appreciated the late check out so that we could sleep in late, have a relaxing morning and big breakfast before we left.
Thanks for your hospitality and the use of your beautiful home!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic space! Very clean and responsive hosts.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the linens, towels, shower curtain, double shelf in bathroom by the sink is a great idea, filter on shower (A+)-allergic reaction to chemicals in city water! Great parking!!! Lots of natural light, didn't arrive until 6:00 AM (after a 20 hour drive) so room darkening curtains were a another A+ for us. Sheets and comforter so comfy--love the toilet!!!!!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very clean and nice place to stay. The price was fair and located near everything in that area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very easy clean private quiet would recommend and stay again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I stayed at this Airbnb for a weekend, to be able to attend a wedding. First and foremost, I was very pleased with how accommodating the host was. I asked if a late check out was available, the the host gave me a more than gracious check out time, which worked perfectly with baby's nap time! The house itself was very clean and spacious, while also feeling cozy. The house also had all the amenities that would be needed. I enjoyed staying here, and will definitely be staying again when I'm back in Alpena!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully decorated and super clean!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean made us feel right at home. It was centrally located in town so most everywhere we wanted to go was close. Our host was very responsive. Everything was as described. Great place to stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,I loved our experience ! Everything was clean and i felt at home! I hope to stay here again in the future!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Loved Esme's home! We stayed for two weeks during a home renovation project. Esme's home is open & welcoming. Nicholas & her communicated promptly and went above & beyond to make our stay comfortable. Highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Esme was a great host and very responsive. Everything was very clean, and as described in the posting. Would definitely stay again if the opportunity arises."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! The house was a perfect place for our weekend getaway. Had everything we needed and was very clean. Nicholas was very helpful for any questions we had and was quick to respond. Will definitely recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place; booked again for coming week. Quiet, clean, well equipped. Wish list: dishwasher other than me."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Happy with our stay at Pike's, thanks Pete."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have you ever stayed at any vacation home, about which you can't find a single fault? Well, we have now. It was perfect."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,The pike house was beautifully decorated and i loved the high ceilings. The house was easily accessible. Pete was was wonderful to work with. He responded quickly to all my questions. I would highly recommend the pike house to all who are visiting the Alpena area.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The house is newly remodeled and very comfortable. Thoughtfully decorated for the holidays, with several nice touches. Will be my first choice to book whenever I return. Pete is a great host."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This our third time staying here. As always exceptionably clean and comfortable. The Christmas decorations were a really cool touch.
I did have a small issue ( my bad) and Pete stayed on the phone and walked me through it and was very patience with me.
Will definitely be back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,All was great!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was fantastic! Very clean and cozy, great amenities. The location was great, within walking distance to lots of great downtown restaurants and shops. thanks for being a great host!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time visiting.
It was even better then the first time. Pete and Isaac are wonderful hosts. They have have thought of everything to make you comfortable, if they have not thought of it you probably don’t need it.
The location is very convenient to downtown and the harbour. I forgot how nice it is to be able to walk to several excellent restaurants.
It was really hard to leave after the weekend.
Thank you Pete and Isaac for hosting my brother and me."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was very happy with this stay. The place was very clean and just as stated.
I have stayed at enough airbnb properties to say that the Pike House Retreat was above and beyond at having anything one could want.
I never expect more than the basic things that should be available, but this was amazing at the level of thought and true care that was provided for a happy guest experience.
I do not impress easily, and I was impressed.
Anyone looking for ease at staying in Alpena with close proximity to many things should consider this a great option."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time a the Pike House!
Thank you Pete!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’ve been coming to Alpena for years, but have always stayed with family. This last weekend we needed to find a place of our own and we found it here! The place was easy to find and one of the cleanest airbnbs I’ve stayed in. I really appreciated the extras - toys for young kids, spare quilts and linens, coffee and creamer. Thanks for sharing your space with us so we could have a “2nd home” for the weekend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were meeting up with my sister and her husband for a couple of nights in Alpena. The house was well equipped and served our purposes as we spent time together in the area. You can tell the owners give a lot of attention to details. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described and very clean. Also, it felt very comfortable…just like home."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home. One of the cleanest I’ve stayed in. Updated and cozy. Great communication.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean. Very quiet area. We loved this cute little home for our stay in Alpena. Would recommend to others.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Pete’s! This location can’t be beat if you’re looking to explore the town on foot. If you’re not, then just staying in, relaxing, and enjoying the amenities of this cute home is enough to satisfy. We always “overpack” when staying in an AirBnb, anticipating needing this or that, but Pete’s place was stocked with anything you’d need and more!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pete’s place was outstanding! It was one of the most well-equipped airbnbs we have stayed at- the kitchen and bathrooms were fully stocked with thoughtful touches (spices, hot chocolate, extra bottles of water, extra toothbrushes and a first aid kit). There were books and games too! It was such a comfortable home to stay in! Do yourself a favor and book this place. There’s so much to do nearby!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our 2nd stay at Pete's Place. It can not be beat. Downtown Alpena is only 4 blocks away so walking there is very fast. This year he did add a wooden patio with a patio set. I would never even think about something different. Actually I fully intend on reserving for next within the next couple of months.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful overall! Very clean. Little personal touches were definitely noticed and appreciated (personal greeting on the whiteboard in the kitchen, extra supplies for the bathroom , kitchen and bedroom). GREAT downtown location. The only critique is that the air condition was not centralized (1 unit in each bedroom, but 1 of the bedroom air units went out on our first night; at least another air unit in the living room would’ve been appreciated during this extreme heat we’re getting this July - thank you for the fans though Pete, that helped). Other than that it was spectacular and we would love to come again next year!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! The house was very clean and well equipped with not only the basics, but many thoughtful extras. My 2.5 year old was especially grateful for the toys! Pete made himself available, but there has been so much thought and detail put into everything that we didn’t need to contact him. Will definitely book this house again for future travel to the area!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pete was a great host. everything the listing said about the house was accurate. he responded quickly when had a question, even allowed earlier check in. extremely clean and fresh feel to the home. the kitchen was stocked with needed dish ware, pots, utensils. wonderful thought of little extras too!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pike House retreat is probably the best value you can get in Alpena MI.
Beyond clean and comfortable beds."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pete and Pike House was just what we needed for our short stay in Alpena. The home was clean, well equipped, and tidy. Pete as a host was very responsive, all the while giving us privacy with the comforts of home. Would definitely recommend staying here to others!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and easy access. Alpena is a great town and you should visit Pete’s place.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding host as always Not one thing I can think of that I needed. (Thankfully. As I forgot my toothbrush this time). Super clean and tidy with everything you can possibly think of right there. Attention to detail is amazing. Always quick on communications and very pleasant and professional to work with. Returning for all my stays in alpena. As a travel nurse the need to feel safe and in a “home” away from home is on the top of list. He didn’t disappoint at all.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was very well appointed and I didn’t want to leave - every little detail Imaginable was thought of!
Thanks for a wonderful stay - hope to come again!!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,10/10 would stay again. Cute place with great attention to the details
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Pike House was perfect! Everything was so clean & well maintained. The check in guide was thorough and helpful as well! Plus there were many small aspects that were so appreciated. It was SO nice to have a stocked kitchen with oil, spices, paper plates, etc. Those things are so thoughtful! The house is so cute & in such a great location!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the cooler temperatures we enjoyed Rockport State Park, the NOAA museum and Ocqueoc Falls. Dinner at Fresh Palette was great! Walking about the downtown area was cool, I particularly enjoyed the quieter atmosphere vs Traverse City or Petoskey."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and nice place.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a lovely stay. The house was cozy and thoughtfully curated for guests. So many extra thoughtful touches. I highly recommend this place for a cozy quiet stay!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay! Within walking distance of downtown. The recommendations were also incredibly helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect house for our getaway to Alpena!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cleanest place I have ever stayed. Way cleaner than a hotel. The location is absolutely fantastic. You are within walking distance from 6 or so restaurants. Has great parking. I will stay here again if I ever go to Alpena again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here. Cute home and nicely decorated. Very comfortable and close to downtown. Gourmet coffee, tea, cocoa, bottled water and a full cookie jar. Nice touch!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was really nice! Great walking distance from anything downtown, the house was clean and check in was a breeze. I would not hesitate to rent this place again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,From the communication to the comfort of the home this location was fantastic all around. You can tell that the host takes great pride in every aspect of the hosting process. We were blown away by the cleanliness of the house and all of the updates that have clearly taken place in the home. The level of care that is taken with this house is something I think is rare in rentals like this. I would recommend this property and any others this host may have if they are even half as nice and well maintained as this one. Our little family felt so comfortable there and we’re very happy with our stay. Thank you Pete. Keep up the amazing work!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice clean place with all the comforts of home. Plenty of extras if you forgot to bring anything. Very convenient location. We enjoyed our stay very much. Would definitely recomend if you are staying in Alpena.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pete's place is perfect! We loved our stay. It is in an excellent location for walking to restaurants in the downtown area. We attended an event held at the river near the museum, so walking there was also easy. The house is incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and thoughtful touches for guests were much appreciated. We will for sure be booking here again next summer! Thanks for making it so easy and relaxing, Pete!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing to come to my mind is that the Pike House is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!
Not a single hair or speck of dirt to be found. It has been completely renovated with new carpet/flooring, fresh paint and updated window treatments through out, and much more.
This home is very well organized and stocked with all the essentials. The ROKU TV was a plus. There was a nice little book collection to chose from as well. Night-Lights are provided. Bedrooms are equipped with window unit A/C. There is plenty of closet space with hangers. Super cute decor & style. No clutter.
The full sized washer and dryer came in handy. The kitchen has nice appliances and everything you need. Cleaning supplies available. Owners also provide you with a special Pike House blend from Hubbard Lake Coffee (full-size coffee maker) that we enjoyed every morning. You are within easy walking distance to downtown Alpena for shopping & dining. Lots of parking available downtown should you chose to drive. Felt very safe.
We were in town for the Annual Brown Trout Festival/Art on the Bay and were so thankful to have sunny, warm weather. Lake Huron is beautiful. The Pike House is a great value for your money when you see what the Holiday Inn Express is charging these days. Highly recommend."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful house, great location, 5 minute walk to pretty much everywhere.
Pete is a great host!
Rolette"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay! The home was great and affordable for our brief stay in Alpena!! We appreciated all the information shared about the area!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a charming house. The decor is up to date and tasteful and the hosts have thought of pretty much everything you might need during your stay. There is even delicious private branded coffee. From the house it is a very easy walk to all the amenities that downtown Alpena offers.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an adorable gem so close to downtown Alpena! The place was SO clean and put together and everything we could have needed (and more) was available to us for our stay. Thank you so much for such a wonderful place to stay! ❤️
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a hidden gem! Very close to downtown, a quick walk, bike or car ride away (we used all three modes of transportation). The house was super clean, very inviting, and stocked with amenities, even the small ones you might have forgotten. Pete has a great list of local restaurants and places to visit in his guide. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spotless, comfortable, excellent location and Pete the host is very helpful if needed."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great stay! The house was very clean, recently renovated, and had everything we needed. The hosts were friendly and very responsive. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay. Lots of cute little personalized touches that make you feel more at home. Wonderful communication and accurate description!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. House was very clean and welcoming. Location was great and super close to everything. We loved walking around the town of Alpena. Pete was a great host and provided us with a comforting house to stay in with extra added amenities. His list of information on places to eat and activities to do near by were perfect. Would highly recommend staying here. When we come back to Alpena this will be a go to stay for us. Thanks again Pete!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Pete and Isaac were very accommodating to my fellow guests and I. They provided us with all the necessary information, and had numerous resources for things to do, places to eat, etc. Something else that I appreciated was that they provided us with a list of emergency numbers in the area, which is not something I’d thought about until I read them. Definitely something you’d want to have in handy if you need them.
The house was spotless and much bigger than we actually thought it was. The interior was clean and we had more than enough space (there were three of us). We enjoyed settling in for the night after coming back home, every time.
Now, there were some areas of concern – though nothing to do with the house itself or the hosts. Firstly, something that we felt one should know is that the area this neighborhood is located in currently has a smell that permeates the town. This may not be relevant by the time one reads this review, but we stayed in April of 2022. We looked into it and discovered that the nearby factory has stockpiles of unused, decaying wood. We could not smell it on the inside of the house, but it was noticeable outside and at all times.
Secondly, without sounding too judgmental, the neighborhood that the property is located in, is what one might refer to as “sketchy.” There was very little light at night, and in the daytime we noticed several individuals that were behaving in concerning ways, with some potential drug use inferable from their behavior. We were not approached, but were careful to keep our distance. I will admit that at some points we did feel afraid of encountering an unwelcome character.
Once again, this has nothing to do with our hosts, or the house itself. We have nothing negative to say about them or the residence, this is just information about the area that one might like to know beforehand. Everything that was less than ideal was completely out of control of our hosts, it is simply information that we feel should be shared. We write this review not to disparage Pete or Isaac in any way, and are grateful to them for allowing us to enjoy their property. Aside from that, though, we really did enjoy our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot to relax after a few long days of baseball!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great all around! Tammy is very proactive, and communications were great. The house is in a great location, everything was clean and orderly, and in good working order. Would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and cozy home! It had everything we needed and more!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a pleasure to stay at this home. Everything inside has been updated. very comfortable beds, spacious kitchen, family room, and bathroom. It is right across the street from the lake. There is a lot to do in Alpena if you take the time to look around. Tamy's home is one of the cleanest we've ever stayed at. Response to any of my emails were timely. That being said, we didn't have any issues so our communication had to do with the courtesy of letting her know when we were checking in and when we were checking out. Real easy. it's been a pleasure staying with you!🙂✌️"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I have stayed at Tamy’s place multiple times now and hope to come back again! The houses are always very clean, Tami is always responsive and provides very helpful information! She’s a great host!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love staying here! Tamy, the host, is great to work with! The house is always clean and comfortable and very well stocked. Close to downtown Alpena, great restaurants and Lake Huron is across the street!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Tamy was wonderful during the month I stayed at her home. The downtown is easily walkable, the home is right across from the lake, and less than 10 min from the hospital. I was up here during a massive snowstorm and Tamy had someone come over to snow-blow the parking lot so I could get in and out since the plows were busy elsewhere."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Sunrise Side Bay View Home. Tamy is the best host ever. I had a special need that she was able to accommodate and I really appreciate that. The home was very clean and had everything we needed. We had a winter stay and I noticed a shovel and ice scraper was left for our use. Luckily we didn’t need them but this is just an example of the thought that the hosts put into what amenities might be needed for the guests.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our favorite place to stay in Alpena! Excellent hosts!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time we've stayed there. Exceeded expectations each time. House is immaculate. Great location.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very enjoyable stay for our week-long fishing trip. Every part of the house is beyond satisfaction. Convenient parking and close to the boat ramp. I'll book it again if our competition is in this area in the future.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tammy's place was spotless. Had everything we needed and more and lots of recommendations for in town. The beds were super comfy and it was nice and cool inside during this July weather. She was very responsive if we needed anything she was at ready to help. Very enjoyable experience.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tammy’s place was great. It was clean and comfortable. We did see comments about how it wasn’t walkable to downtown but we walked downtown the first morning and picked up coffee. Enjoyed seeing all of the historic homes on the way there and the parks on the way home. Nothing like walking out to the lighthouses in the morning with your coffee. It was right on the main road which was convenient and the traffic was never an issue. We will definitely stay again!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great! It was extremely clean and had all of the amenities that you needed. It is within a 100 feet of a park with a public beach on the lake. You are within walking distance to another great beach with a splash park and also the downtown. You can walk to several restaurants and there is a great one within 200 yards across from the beach. Tamy was great and very helpful throughout the trip. My family plans on making this trip again and will definitely try to stay at the same place!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great first Airbnb experience! Easy self check-in, super clean home. Appreciated the mudroom for leaving all our sandy beach gear, and the kitchen complete with the pots/pans/etc we needed to prepare some of our own meals. Great communication and close proximity to our favorite Alpena spots."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay. Convenient location. Comfortable bed.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy's place was perfect for what we needed and more spacious than expected. If you're interested in exploring the dark sky, It's a 20 min drive to Rockport state park and not too much further for the 2 other dark sky parks. The weather wasn't great so we spent a lot of time indoors even though Tamy provided tons of ideas. It was a peaceful trip."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! The house was SUPER clean and worked out nicely for our trip to Alpena. The house has everything we needed for a long weekend. Tamy was very responsive and friendly. We will definitely stay here again when we are back in town. Thanks Tamy!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamy and her husband have set up a wonderful getaway. The house was spotlessly clean (we walked around barefoot and did not get dirty marks on our feet).
It had all the amenities to make us comfortable, including hooks on the doors and a laundry basket in the bathroom. It really is these little things that make a good place great and Tamy has done that here. My husband and my son both read parts of some books from her shelf and my daughter danced in the house constantly.
We enjoyed the area and walked to the beach/ park across the street for a little evening stroll every day. We were also a very close drive to downtown Alpena. We can’t wait to get back to Tamy’s house."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamy’s place is in a great location. Easy to walk to the beach, the pier and downtown. We enjoyed our time there. Tamy makes everything easy at the house. It has everything you need."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful place! Tamy communicated with us before we checked in. Everything was top notch! Very very clean . This was our first AirBNB We loved it.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First experience with an AirBnB and it was great!! House was spotless and very cozy, so many extras provided too."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamy's place is a great value for those wanting to see all that Alpena has to offer! The house is very clean and her communication was excellent. The best part of Tamy's place was the location. Only a 15 minute walk to all of the great amenities in Downtown Alpena, a 10 minute walk to the large beach and playscape, and a small beach with lake access right across the street. If you want a great getaway and don't want to have to drive much when you get to your destination, this is the place for you. We will be booking again the next time we visit Alpena!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the first time we stayed at this particular property. We did stay at another property of Tamy's prior to this. The home is very clean, free of clutter and you will just feel like you're at home. Well stocked. Great water pressure in the shower. Tamy is a great host. You could not ask for better. Thank you again Tamy. We will return."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place to rest and recoup after a long trip and lots of activities. Always in touch. Amazing stay beautiful home and great host!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy was very thorough with directions, gave us a ton of recommendations, and was easy to communicate with during the entire stay (and before/after).

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamys place was great, location to downtown was less than 5 minutes. Beds were very comfortable. I usually stay in a hotel when I travel with my family, but after this experience I will definitely use Airbnb again!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house in Alpena! Walkable to downtown to restaurants and shopping. Right across the street from Lake Huron and a public beach. The house itself is super clean and offers everything you would need for your stay. Tamy is an excellent host! We always enjoy staying at one of her places!

Location is really nice but, it is on a busy (noisy)main road.
Absolutely loved the home."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Definitely would recommend this place and will absolutely return to ANY home this host owns.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tamy's place was clean and comfortable. I mentioned in one of our conversations that I'm a photographer and she was quick to give great recommendations for trails and places to visit that might offer picturesque views. She was available to answer questions and answered quickly. I recommend this house for any time of the year.

Your place was very welcoming and peaceful!!! The chairs by the front window, SUPER SOFT. Shower head in bathroom fantastic and my daughter said your coffee was amazing."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location—2-minute walk to Thomson Park, 10-minute walk to Starlite Beach (& Pompeyos Mexican Grill, which I strongly recommend—esp. the seafood chimichanga!).

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely lovely location. Had everything we could have possibly needed for our stay. Tamy was an excellent host and made sure we were comfortable! I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Alpena!

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean / private
No check out list
Easy check in - no contact check in
Fun fishing & local things"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a family reunion this past weekend. The place was very clean and in a great location by beaches/parks and town. Lots of space for parking, and all the amenities you may need were available.
Thanks for the free wine tasting and the coffee. I would absolutely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy was excellent. She was communicative, helpful, and kind. She offered recommendations on places to eat (Red Brick and Barrel was AMAZING like she said!) and could always be easily reached. Her home was beautiful, and very clean when we arrived. She has the house supplied with pretty much anything you need, including cooking essentials. We will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A delightful little house a few minute's walk/drive from the center of Alpena. It's across the street from Lake Huron, and although you can't access the lake right across from the house, there are several little public parks along the road where you can. We used the house as a base for fossil and rock hunting on beaches in the area -- Presque Isle and Rockport State Recreation Area and other local beaches. There were just 2 of us, but room for many more! The house is charming. The shower is amazing! The kitchen has everything you would need to cook for yourself. There's a gas grill outside. The only thing that would normally be a deal breaker for me is the lack of usable outside space. There's a bench behind a small wall, but it's not really somewhere you'd want to hang out for long. That didn't matter at all to us as we were out all day. Tamy was wonderful -- texting with info and answering all my questions. 110% would come back."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tamy is a great host! The home is beautiful and clean! Great central location. Tamy was responsive and thorough throughout our stay. I highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place. The new Television was amazing. Our family felt at home as soon as we arrived. Tamy made sure we were taken care of. We hope when we visit again this place is available.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful home and a welcoming host! You can't beat the location - walkable to downtown and just steps from the Lake. Location aside, the house way very clean and stocked with most anything we needed. Tammy was very communicative and kept in touch to ensure our stay was a pleasant one. We have stayed in several homes throughout the town and this was by far our favorite! We hope to book another stay with Tammy at this location."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Simply lovely! I never get tired of this spot. The house is immaculate, beds are comfortable, cupboards stocked with just enough. Everything needed is provided and more. Perfect place to rest, visit, sightsee, swim, read, etc. We will be back."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,I am very particular about the cleanliness of places I stay at away from home and it’s comforting to know that Tamy’s place is always clean. We have stayed here several times and its always a refreshing and pleasant getaway.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying here! Great location, very clean, comfortable, and has everything you need. We are looking forward to staying here again in the future."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Looking for a great place to stay in Alpina? Look no further. This is a great place to stay for the whole family. Very clean and a great location. A grocery store is within driving distance to cook your own meals. The beds were comfortable and Tamy is a great host. My wife and two daughters stayed 4 days 3 nights and had a great time.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamy's place was amazing. It had everything we needed, especially a view of the beach. My kiddos loved the beach, splash pad, and playground. It was absolutely in walking distance, but we chose to drive to make it easier with our cooler and beach things. Sipping coffee on the front stairs in the moring you could sofly hear the water. We will definitely be back."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay and loved the location!!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, very clean!
This house is walking distance to at least 3 beaches, as well as a great park for kids. Starlite beach is my favorite! It's also a short drive to downtown where there are shops and restaurants. The house is clean and has so many of the essentials that you need but don't want to pack. Beach blankets, chairs, and sand toys are all provided which is super convenient. Having 3 bedrooms was a huge perk and I love that there is a washer and dryer so we didn't have to go home with a bunch of dirty clothes. Highly recommend this place!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This home is as advertised (better, actually)! It is so comfortable and in the perfect location. We stayed here for a full week and will continue to book this place every time we are back in Alpena provided it is available. The host is super easy to work with and get in touch with. It is absolutely a new favorite of ours!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect set up for a small family our in our case a sister's trip! The house is adorable and fresh and in a great location. Tamy has truly thought of everything and we appreciated that! She even goes so far as to leave a special blend of coffee for your use (which was delicious). If we are ever in the area again, we wouldn't hesitate to stay again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place for kids (3 and 1). Very cozy! Geographically placed close to a bunch of parks. Tamy was very attentive to our needs and was easy to talk to.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy’s place is the best, down to every last detail! Conveniently located to walk or bike ride to town or the beach across the street. Even if you just wanted to stay in, everything is so clean and comfortable and stylish. Perfect in every way!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Definitely recommended! Tamys home was cute, clean, and had everything we needed. 4 adults and 3 children had all the space we needed!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is great! Not only is it spotlessly clean, it is tastefully decorated as well. The entry room is large with lots of room for shoes, luggage, etc. kitchen is well-equipped with gas stove and great table/chairs. Bathroom is good size with nice towels. Large living area, 3 bedrooms - all with ceiling fans and luggage racks! Right across the street from Lake Huron. Convenient. All in all one of the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The accommodations were exactly as expected. The sunrise views of Lake Huron from the kitchen and living room windows are beautiful. It is very close for walking to two Parks for playing with kids if you don't mind walking a few blocks. There's a swimming beach very close. The only downside, if there is one, in the front bedroom if you're a light sleeper it might be a little noisy because it's a heavily traveled road, but it didn't bother us."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wounderful host, very kind and communicates perfectly. Very happy with the house and everything that was there. Will be planning another trip with kids next time."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, perfect location"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had the pleasure of a lengthy stay in Tamy’s home while I was in town working as a travel RN. We were kept warm and cozy through the winter, allowed us to see some absolutely gorgeous sunrises over Lake Huron, and easy accessibility for afternoon strolls around downtown and the lake front. The kitchen was well equipped for eating in and the beds were all nice and cozy. I cannot recommend the home enough!!!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely home with views of Thunder Bay to use as our home base while we explored the new-to-us Alpena area. We will be back!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our return visit. It is the perfect place to get cozy and unwind in the cold winter months. Tamy is very responsive and checked in to make sure we were all taken care of. We loved the coffee too!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place. Three bedrooms are sound-dampening so slept well. Even in the cold with snow, it was warm and inviting."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy’s place is great! I took my mom on a weekend trip to Alpena for her birthday and it was perfect. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked with everything we needed, plus extra. There are multiple parks within walking distance, as well as the downtown area just down the street. We perused the shops downtown, got coffee at Cabin Creek Coffee multiple times, and got takeout from Red Brick Tap & Barrel. Everything was phenomenal! It snowed about 8” (maybe more!) the first night we were there, so we ended up driving everywhere. We really enjoyed our stay at Tamy’s and recommend a trip to Alpena anytime of the year!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house! Very clean and well organized. Tamy was great with communication and she was wonderful enough to leave us a roasting pan and baster for our Thanksgiving turkey! We will definitely return.

2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time in Alpena and the surrounding area. Tamy’s place was the perfect place to unwind after long days adventuring in the beautiful up north.

The keyless entry is great! The home is beautiful and includes things that many hosts do not provide...like beach towels, lawn chairs, umbrellas, even coffee! Alpena is an great small town with beautiful historic homes, sandy beach, ice cream shop and coffee shop in walking distance. We enjoyed lots of hiking, lighthouses and breweries nearby."

The added touches (aromatherapy diffuser, local wine and coffee, beach towels, etc) all contributed to making us feel welcome!"

2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tammy’s home was cute, clean, and very close to several parks. Walking distance to a small park with a small beach and about a half mile drive (or walk) to a larger beach with a playground and splash pad. You must cross a busy road but we had no trouble with that. Throw in a wagon and you are set. Tamy was very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great space, great location, great host!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay at Tamy's place. Very nicely remodeled home with plenty of room. The place was supplied with everything we needed. Loved being across from the lake and within walking distance of a very cute downtown. Would definitely stay here again!

House was well stocked and comfortable and the beds were extremely comfy! Would recommend this house and will definitely stay there again!
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved it and will stay again! Location is awesome and close to downtown. Stylish decor. Comfortable beds. Very clean and appears to be freshly remodeled. Gorgeous oversized baseboards and trim. Love that we could see the waves from the window and we were just a few doors away from Thompson Beach. Plenty of parking in paved lot behind the home, also belonging to owners."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy is a great host! She's extremely easy to communicate with, and the house was even better than I expected! It's centrally located in town, was very clean, and was a very nice space. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. I'd definitely stay there again!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a great time in Alpena. We were visiting family, but this place offered a great opportunity to be close to the water and explore the town!! This place is beautiful and fully stocked. The directions about the place were very clear and easy to follow."
2019-09-01,5,Group trip,Tamy clearly cares a lot about her guest experience! She goes out of her way to make sure everything about the place is perfect. I am one that prefers to cook while I'm away from home and her kitchen was fully stocked with everything kitchen appliance and utensil I could hope for! Not only that but there was the bonus of great organic coffee and a bottle of wine. We truly felt like we were very special guests! Not only that but the location is fantastic and we were able to actually talk to a handful of places!!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Tamy’s House is in a great location. It was walking distance to the beach and downtown and only 1.7 miles from a Meijer! The house was beautiful and comfortable and the coffee that was provided was superb! Our kids keep asking to go back to the vacation house!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tamy is a wonderful hostess and so welcoming! Her home have everything you would need for a pleasant stay and it is immaculate!!! She certainly goes out her way to make your stay AMAZING!!! Hope to go back again in the future!!!

2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This fabulous little gem was a perfect Summer Getaway. With beaches all within walking or a 5-minute drive, the beautifully-decorated home, the plentiful towels, comfortable beds and Tamy's perfect local advice for eateries... it was a terrific 3 days. Don't miss this chance to see the stunning sunrise at Thompson Beach (1-minute walk) or to cycle around the Wildlife Sanctuary. Oh, and get some ice cream at Scoops. We can't wait to come back."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful and so well and thoughtfully stocked with amenities. Tammy was helpful and easy to work with. We would definitely go back and highly recommend.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is great...easy walk to almost everything in Alpena. Tamy was prompt with communications and the place was as described. We would definitely stay again when visiting this area.

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute house! The host is absolutely amazing, so kind and responds fast. The location is perfect for families with children. Town isn't far and parks and restaurants are right down the road! We enjoyed our stay and can't wait to visit again! Thanks Tamy!!!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the first time we stayed at a Air BNB and though it was only for a weekend our experience was incredible starting with a wonderful host Tamy. She not only took the time to explained how everything worked and what to expect, but checked in with us several times to see if we needed anything and offered to be available anytime. This experience has converted us to only travel this way, so Thank you Tamy for your kindness and allowing us to to enjoy your adorable clean home. We truly appreciate you welcoming us to Alpena."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised...larger town, without too much traffic. Good restaurants and great places to boat"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great house! The space is bright and clean and in a great location. We really enjoyed our stay.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Tamy is a superb host! She truly is a super host. The space is a great location and clean space. I love staying at Tamy’s.
2019-06-01,5,Group trip,This was the best experience ever! Loves the host. They respond very quick. The house was spotless and just amazing. The area is quiet but has a beautiful scenery not to far from the house!! We honestly was just taken back by everything. We would definitely love to visit again.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tamy's place is great we had a lovely time in Alpena. The home is cozy and clean and Tamy is very accessible.
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Most convenient location in the city. Decor is modern, with all the right touches. Everything is brand new. The bedding is very comfortable with cotton sheets and comforters. The living room is large with a lot of open space for gathering, while the bedrooms are closed off with a solid door for privacy. The kitchen is well equipped with every gadget (and more). The dining room table is a great place to gather and make food. Many condiments provided. The coffee provided is so good that we purchased more at their store adjacent to the house. White, fluffy towels are abundant, as well as striped beach towels to take to the beach. Camp chairs (5) are something that B&B's don't generally think of, but they were handy to take to the several picnics we had. They even have a large umbrella in case of rain. A large TV is in the living room, and lots of DVD's. We were able to use our Netflix and Amazon with the internet provided.
There is a full size washer and dryer, and lots of detergent. Having access to wash clothes is a bonus. And the bathroom and shower are very clean and the colors soothing to the eyes. Tamy really tries to get a ""spa-like"" feeling for the place. Bonus...one can book a massage right next door.
The only thing we regret about this stay is that we wish we were staying longer! We walked to every beach on State Street. There are so many cool things to do in Alpena, 5 days didn't cover what we wanted to see. This was the first trip to Michigan for my three cousins from Newfoundland, Canada. They originally booked a local hotel, but for a bit more, the three bedroom house was so much more enjoyable. They said it was the BEST vacation and BEST AirBnB reservation ever.
Tamy is a SuperHost and was quick to reply with any questions. This will be my first choice when booking AirBnb in Alpena. Thanks for the pleasant memories!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If you are considering this place, don't hesitate. Be aware there is no A/C, which usually is not a problem in Alpena. The house was very well appointed, clean, comfortable,Maithili several special touches. We'd definitely stay here again."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Close to everything beautiful that Alpena has to offer and it is accompanied by an amazing host. I would recommend ANYONE looking for a place to stay in Alpena over any other options.
2019-05-01,5,Group trip,"Tamy has truly thought of everything with this house. She stocked the place with so many helpful little things, from a first-aid kit and cotton balls to spices and cooking spray. Even an essential oil diffuser! The house is spacious with a great layout. We were there for a wedding with friends, and the place worked perfectly for a group. My only wish was for a second bathroom - with 5 people trying to get ready for the wedding at once, it was a little chaotic, but there's a big mirror in one of the bedrooms that helped with that. The view is beautiful, with only a few beach-front houses between this place and Lake Huron, and there are plenty of parks/beach areas within walking distance."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an awesome experience in a great location between Starlite beach and the Historic Downtown. We had everything we needed and they put great thought into the house itself. Definitely plan on going back if Available.
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great location, a block from the beach! Would stay again"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the exact space (and place) we needed for a relaxing summer vacation! The house is in a great location (close to downtown as well as several parks and beaches) as well as lots of great homey amenities (big kitchen with lots of gadgets, grill, bag chairs, laundry). Tamy was an excellent communicator with lots of great tips and fast responses. The town of Alpena could not have been cuter or more friendly. So many great local spots for food, beer, ice cream, shopping, coffee… we’re certainly coming back and would recommend Tamy’s place to others!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is so cute! Just perfect for a weekend away. Everything is immaculate, comfortable beds, centrally located, everything you could want. Tamy is very personable and was great at communicating with us, she even gave us some recommendations on things to do in the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I love so much about this home. Location, comfort, cleanliness, well stocked, and the comfortable beds are the best! Tamy is very in tune to the needs of others, and it shows in every detail in this home. As always, I will be back."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is a great little house. Tami thought of everything to ensure her guests felt at home. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy is a great host. Her place is clean, nicely decorated and in a great location."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay here! Check-in was simple and straightforward. Tamy communicated with us to let us know the garage code ahead of time which was nice since we weren’t sure what time we would be arriving.
The home is an awesome 2 bedroom right across from Lake Huron! Everything was updated, comfortable, clean and beautiful! The windows all had nice curtains and blinds to control privacy and natural light. There were lamps and dimmer switches to adjust to our comfort. Coffee pot with delicious coffee was provided. The tap water was clean, cold and tasted great to drink (so unnecessary to bring bottled water like we often do when traveling). There were several board games, some books and magazines, shower essentials, and well-stocked kitchen utensils. The living room couch was so comfortable, great for relaxing!
We felt like this was a great value and would love to return soon!
The downtown area is just down the road which is where you want to go when visiting Alpena! So many fun shops and restaurants down there."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed our stay! Was nice to stay at a place with all the amenities of home. It’s super comfortable and conveniently located to everything. We highly recommend & look forward to our next stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy’s place is impeccably clean and as well-located as you can get. The kitchen is large and has everything you need. The beds are comfortable. The wifi was strong.
My favorite part was how close the home is to downtown and the water. I enjoy walking around places I’ve never been and I was a 10-15 minute walk from restaurants, stores, and multiple waterfront parks.
Definitely would stay here again!!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, comfortable, and updated 2 bedroom/ 1 bathroom spacious home in the heart of Alpena and across from Lake Huron. Tamy has thought of everything you will need for a weekend getaway or week-long vacation including a new gas grill, essential oils with a diffuser, and so many things to make your stay extra special."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things about our 3 day visit at Tamy’s place! We felt so fortunate to find this place. It was immaculately clean, homey, and very convenient to exploring the Alpena area. We would love to stay here again, especially for a summer visit next time! This accommodation had every amenity you could need. Tamy was very responsive to each message I sent."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful eight-night stay at Tamy's welcoming, very clean and and open home in a great location. We appreciated having the spacious garage, front porch, and excellent location for an easy walk to the lake and charming downtown Alpena. The street can be noisy at times with traffic but it didn't bother us at all and things quiet at night. There is plenty of seating and the kitchen is large and well-stocked. Tamy has thought of everything a guest might need, leaves clear instructions and tips, and responds promptly. We really enjoyed walks around the interesting neighborhood with its varying styles of old houses, many with nice gardens. This was the perfect place to stay for a family wedding and extended getaway. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you, Tamy."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious, beautifully updated, and quiet. While Tamy is not the only host to do so, I personally feel that asking guests to strip bedding etc when you pay a cleaning fee is too much. The cleaning fee is high enough that someone on vacation should not have to deal with this. in itself, I'd fully recommend this place, but feel the list of ""house chores"" can be too long... (Many might not mind having to put dishes in a dishwasher but many probably do not want to deal with having to fill detergent trays to run it and having to strip a bed and move garbage to a second garbage can before check-out...) I can see it cuts costs on the cleaning lady for the host, but that is why cleaning fees are paid..."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was our second stay in Tamy’s home and it was just as wonderful as the first! The house was just as clean and stocked up for our week stay as the last time. Tamy was quick to respond to messages and worked with us to make check-in seamless while we had funeral visitation at the same time, but needed to drop off our things. We will be back again soon!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed our visit to Alpena, much because of our lovely stay at Tamy's. This renovated home is just beautiful and is well equipped. The kitchen is wonderfully stocked with cooking utensils and appliances. The shower is the best, and mattress was great for sleeping. This home is situated in the midst of big, gorgeous homes, you must take some walks and not only enjoy the beach access it the beautifully crafted homes and their landscaping. Tamy recently added a outdoor grill that we really enjoyed. We can't glow enough about this choice."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful home in a great location. Downtown is within walking distance or there is plenty of free parking if you want to drive. Good restaurants and a great brewery nearby. Lake Huron is across the street.
2021-09-01,4,Stayed over a week,Tamy is an excellent host. You will find this home very clean and comfortable. It is close to anything you may want to do.

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tamy’s house is clean and at a great location in Alpena. Hope to stay again!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, beautiful, very clean house. Lake Huron is across the street with some views from the front porch. You are steps away from a park and at the shore of Lake Huron. The downtown shops, restaurants and the pier are just blocks away. We enjoyed our stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house had everything we needed for a rainy weekend in Alpena. Lots of space, full kitchen, comfy furniture, great bathroom. Host we very communicative and helpful. Enjoyed riding bikes to the beach and dinner at Red Brick Tavern. Played in the big garage with our toddlers when the weather wasn’t ideal for outside time."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice home - spotless, well furnished. Everything you could possibly need in the kitchen and around the house. Tamy was especially helpful with restaurant recommendations as well as letting us know about special events that were taking place in Alpena. I would highly recommend this airbnb."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn’t have found a better place to stay. Beautiful town, cozy home, and Lake Huron directly across the street. What more could you ask for?! Tamy is wonderful and very responsive to any questions I had. Can’t wait to go back to Alpena, MI"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is seriously a nice house. Very well thought out, clean and comfy. Easily one of the nicest places we have stayed. We were able to walk to get ice cream and then sat in the sun next to the lake. It is such a beautiful area. Definitely recommend staying here!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tamy treats her guests like friends. She responds to questions right away and offers quick service if anything is forgotten, though the stay was perfect. I could not be happier with Tamy as the hostess for my first stay at an airbnb. Thanks!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This air bnb was exactly what we needed! Very clean place that's within walking distance of the downtown shops as well as the local beach and playground/splash park. Huge kitchen with MANY cabinets to use! Great place for cooking in for some of our stay! Highly recommend this spot and this host! Tamy was very helpful and very fast to respond to us if we ever needed her :)
Also, if you're into lighthouses, there are MANY nearby to visit!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tamy's house was sparkling clean and perfect for our family of 5. The location to the beaches and downtown was perfect! We enjoyed walking and riding our bikes around the area. The garage was perfect for storing our bikes without needing to lock them up. Tamy also goes above and beyond and is a superb hostess! She has really anticipated your every need and provided it! We were so thankful for the little things such as the drying rack, makeup towels, grocery bags, a small cooler bag, camp chairs for use at the beach, umbrella, etc. She also made sure to check in to see that everything was okay and also recommended some fun adventures for our family while we were there! We loved our stay with Tamy in Alpena!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great basecamp for our adventures.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Alpena property is situated immediately across from Lake Huron. Not many places can brag that you can see Lake Huron from the front porch. Swimming at the public beach is a 2 minute walk.
We brought our bikes, and was surprised that at the end of my stay, I had only put 10 miles on my vehicle because I rode my bike everywhere.
This is the third property I've vacationed at where Tamy is the host. This property, just like the other two properties, are spotless and well-stocked with anything you'd like in the kitchen. The gas range, microwave, and double door refrigerator, all updated, made everyone feel at home."

We had a lovely relaxing week."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was my first experience with an AirBnB, and it was great with Tamy as our host! The house is just beautiful and such a great location. Tamy makes sure that everything you could need is there, from the camping chairs to beach towels! The front porch is lovely to relax on and our kids enjoyed watching the cars drive by. Communication was easy with Tamy by text or phone. Everything was clean and looked new in the home. We will definitely plan on staying here again!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Tamy’s place was an excellent place to rent! It was so clean and the decor was inspiring and homey! I loved the essential oils, super comfortable beds and great towels.

Tamy had beach chairs/towels provided which always makes packing a little easier. My family had a wonderful stay. Highly recommend this home!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The space is enormous and well kept. The backyard was perfect. My only regret is that we could only stay one night.
Another bonus is that Jennie immediately got us back a dress we accidentally left at the location. Very proactive and a true lifesaver!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie was amazing! She responded immediately with any questions. She goes above and beyond. She is very thoughtful with her placement of furniture and decorations. She was beyond accommodating.... Truly a gem (the house and her)! The house was spotless and adorable and had great energy! I would highly recommend her place. Next time I come to this area, I will definitely be returning! I love the extra amenities. Thank you, Jennie!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for a family, ideal location near downtown Alpena and the beaches. I'm 6'1, upstairs was a bit short for myself but it wasn't a big deal. AC units were more than sufficient for the space."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Came to Alpena for a friends wedding. The place worked great for our group. Close to downtown Alpena. Place was comfortable once we got the window A/C units going (visited in the summer). 2nd floor has very low and angled ceilings but we were out and about most of the time so wasn’t a big deal! Location was awesome and 1st floor is beautiful with great space and super clean. Very helpful instructions to get in - overall great deal for the space. Would highly recommend staying!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie’s home made us feel right at home for our stay in Alpena. The home was clean and inviting and Jennie was an excellent communicator. She also included some extra amenities (shampoo, conditioner, Q-tips and other cleaning supplies) that were handy for anyone that forgot those items. Location was great - easy 10-15 min walk to downtown Alpena and the beach! We look forward to staying again the future when we come back to visit our family! Would recommend!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I would highly recommend this home for anyone. The house is in a safe and beautiful neighborhood. It's got parks and the beach about a mile (at most) away. The house itself is beautiful, and they have it decorated so that you actually feel at home. They even had extra new toothbrushes in case you forget yours. Jennie was just so thoughtful & quick to respond at all times. I would stay with at any of their properties again in a heartbeat. My kids and I were so impressed. Thanks for letting us stay and look forward to staying again. 😁"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say anything bad about the house or Jennie. The house is perfect for a couple or up to 5 people. It's located in a quiet, lovely neighborhood in a quaint town (swans and deer and dark sky preserves!). The house had everything we needed and more and is within walking distance to downtown Alpena.
The best part was Jennie. I think it was the first time I ever truly felt like I was home in an Airbnb. She was so accommodating and quick to reply. I felt like a pest, but she never got frustrated or impatient with me. She and her husband obviously put a lot of love into this home, I can only imagine what their forever home is like.
Thank you, Jennie, for everything!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Accurate description. Excellent location. Plenty of space. Even has new toothbrushes if you forgot one. Great host.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The little touches at Jennie's place were so nice - 2 of us forgot our toothbrushes, but that was no problem since there were extras in the bathroom. The kitchen was also nicely stocked with spices, which was a lovely surprise.
We enjoyed a relaxing stay while we were in Alpena for the Northern Michigan Fiber Festival.
I will definitely stay here again in the future."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lots of beds which was nice for our family coming into town for an event and we could stay together. Beware there are low ceilings upstairs! Under 5’5” are probably safest lol. There is a nice window unit in the big room upstairs but the smaller one was a little stuffy with the door closed, got hot in there even with the fan and AC. Great backyard area and super close to everything you could need. Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was absolutely beautiful. It was very clean and had everything I needed for my stay. I would definitely recommend this place and will come back!

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful and clean home centrally located in Alpena with lots of places to sleep and a great kitchen and bathroom.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic! It truly is a beautifully renovated and clean home. It is conveniently located to some really nice beaches and other attractions. My family was very comfortable during our stay there.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give Jennie more than 5 stars, I would. This home was immaculate and the best Airbnb I have EVER stayed in. She had everything you need from toiletries, to extra phone chargers, even to water bottles in the fridge. I stayed here with another couple I am friends with and there was more than enough space for the 4 of us. The pictures do not do this place justice - it’s even cuter and more spacious in person."
2021-10-01,5,Group trip,"the house was very beautiful and very clean my family would stay again If we have the need.
host are very quick to respond and help you with any of your needs."

The house was very clean and well stocked. Overall a wonderful place; we'll definitely be back again!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and updated just as described. I wish I could pick the house up and take it with us wherever we travel!! That’s how much we loved it. If we’re ever back in Alpena this is where we will stay! Thanks for being such great host.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, spacious, and comfortable accommodations in a great area. Downtown is nearby and easily within walking distance while you still get to enjoy the peace and quiet of the suburbs in the evening. Also an extremely convenient location for exploring the natural beauty of the lakes and forests of the surrounding area. Highly recommended stay for that ""Up North"" experience."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great stay. We arrived very late in the day, and Jennie made sure the porch light was on so we could find the house. When you first walk in, it’s nice and open, the perfect spot to just drop all the bags after a long drive and grab a snack from the bowl right on the entry table.
Everything you need to prepare food in the kitchen, along with enough food to whip up something in a pinch. It’s only a few minutes from downtown. (Try out the happy hippie food truck nearby if you love tacos! )
The rooms are all spacious and nicely decorated. We brought our 3 teen girls with us. It was perfect to give them the upstairs to themselves. We loved that noise doesn’t travel between the levels."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! Very well decorated and updated. Everything we needed was there, from pots and pans to spices in the cupboard. The ceilings upstairs are low but nothing we couldn’t handle. We will definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There are many good things to write about this place. It is spacious, in a fairly convenient location, and newly renovated. However, even after trying to air out the home over a couple of days, there was still a remnant smell of cigarette smoke through the home (despite their rule of no smoking on the premises). This was difficult for us as we are sensitive to odors. I’m sure there are many who will not be bothered by it, but those who are sensitive may wish to be aware. Otherwise it was quite a nice place. Communication was good, and the kitchen and furnishings were well thought out."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennie was such an amazing host! She was incredibly accommodating and responsive to communication before and throughout our stay. For example, she dropped us a message via AirBnB when there was a local power outage just to see if everything was okay and if we needed anything (luckily, we were in a different part of town and were unaffected). She was also as accommodating/understanding to our schedule as possible, and allowed us a slightly earlier check-in and slightly later check-out; it may have been only an hour or two on either side, but honestly makes a world of difference. The house itself is an incredible value and is well-appointed. No amenities were lacking. The place was very clean when we arrived, and I was even impressed that the carpets seemed to have been professionally cleaned (it had those triangle patterns of any professionally cleaned carpet). The only super minor thing that I wished I knew before staying was that the ceilings upstairs were somewhat low; they are well-marked in multiple locations and our party was fortunately not a tall bunch, but could be something to consider if your group is on the taller side. It didn't impact our stay at all, though. The location was wonderful for our particular itinerary as nothing was more than 1 or so miles away from the place. Our party would very highly recommend anyone staying here for the value, location, and the incredible host experience."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent Airnb experience! Everything exceeded the description and our expectations. Beautiful clean and well equipped home. My son had forgot his Iphone charger and there was a drawer of chargers to use! Loved the area. Visited the small beach on Blair street several times during our stay. Loved walking around the town and shopping.
Thank you Jeannie and Josh!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our family of 6 to stay in! The neighborhood was quiet and close to downtown and the beach. The house itself was incredibly clean and well stocked with dishes/glasses, towels, and anything else we could have needed- even bottles of water and a cute welcome basket of snacks.
We came to Alpena to snorkel shipwrecks and fell in love with the area. We can’t wait to return next summer and stay in the house again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely home - beautifully decorated. Very quiet! Nice linens/towels. Note: AC only In one upstairs bedroom but ceiling fans on first floor work really well. Good kitchen set up - appliances are great. The upstairs’ ceilings are low but great space for kids or those less than 6 ft. Hosts were quickly responsive. All the lamps have usb outlets. Good WiFi.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I would highly recommend this AirBnB! It was the last place we stayed after traveling on a road trip for 10 days. The home is spacious, clean, and comfy. There were only two of us, but this would also be a great stay for a group. There were many thoughtful touches and conveniences of home. There were snacks and bottled water. The kitchen was stocked with pots/pans, condiments, utensils, baggies, chargers, etc. The home is up-to-date and well decorated. The towels were good quality, and I really appreciated that there were two pillows for each person on the bed. It’s just a bummer when a stay has exactly two towels and one flat pillow per person. This was not the case here! There is a book with lots of helpful information, including many great local recommendations, which we followed and had a great experience at all. There’s a porch with seating and a yard with a picnic table. There’s a driveway to park in. The neighborhood is quiet and cute and nothing we wanted to do was more than a quick drive from the house. The communication is top notch, too! It was a wonderful stay! It’s exactly what I hope for with an AirBnB stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Loved our getaway and being able to stay at such a beautiful and relaxing home. Everything was perfect and if you ever need anything or have questions Jennie is right on with responding. Thank you so much Jennie, you're the best!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"An all around 5 star experience. Jennie and Josh have done a great job with their home to make it ideal for visitors. Everything is updated and felt so inviting, and there were great personal touches to make us feel at home when we arrived. The location is great, a nice quiet neighborhood, but just a short walk downtown or to the beaches. There's a large secure back yard, perfect for kids, and for eating out. Overall this was a perfect spot for our Alpena getaway."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was perfect for our stay in Alpena! Very close to all local spots and the hosts provided all the comforts of home.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a beautifully renovated and clean home that was perfect for our family vacation. The home was set with all the kitchen items we needed to prepare meals at home, enjoy some games at night, and relax. The hosts were great communicators and even provided a basket of goodies which our son loved! We had a marvelous experience."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing Place and Host!! Super Clean and extremely close to all of the area’s attractions!! Would stay again!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely stay at this immaculate home. Thanks for providing a fun place for us to stay during our vacation.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great! Clean, quiet neighborhood, great location and lots of thoughtful amenities like coffee, snacks, water and a first aid kit. We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Alpena!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place to stay and we will return soon! The hosts thought of everything and the space was beautiful and inviting. We walked everywhere since it was so close to downtown, and loved staying in at times since it was such a great place!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Adorable house close to the lake and splash pad. Very family oriented. I would definitely stay with my family again. Every detail of the house was beautiful and thought out to make it feel like home for guests.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend! Great area to be in and a beautiful comfortable home!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we had a great experience. The location is perfect. The house is clean and has great style. And the neighborhood was quiet and safe. Jennie was fantastic with communication and made so many helpful recommendations. Our only dislike was there isn’t central air despite the listing saying there is AC. There is a small unit in the upstairs but with two box fans downstairs and windows open, the house still reached 80 degrees making the downstairs uncomfortable to sleep in."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very pretty decor on the inside. Very clean and located in a safe, quiet neighborhood. Centrally located to pretty much anything you would want to do. Nice-sized, fenced backyard if you have children. Added touches that make this stay unique compared to most Airbnb stays. A stocked drawer of personal care items in the bathroom. Bottled water and goodies to welcome us to the home. Jennie was also very helpful with advice on places to visit and eat at. We enjoyed our stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is cute, clean, and comfortable. The host helped us out with food and entertainment suggestions. The ceiling is a bit low in some places upstairs, but it did not impact our stay. I would recommend this property and host."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at this Air B and B was perfect! Jennie thought of EVERYTHING, from sending us a PDF itinerary of local events (our stay included the 4th of July holiday) to having a beautifully prepared home ready and waiting for us. She thought of all the details and missed NOTHING!! We were very comfortable and felt right at home during our entire stay in Alpena. The location of the house was a perfect distance from everything in town, much of which we used our bikes to get to. Our stay at Jennie’s house could not have been better and I highly recommend staying here!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location -Close to downtown and the water. They gave great restaurant recommendations! Plenty of beds - just watch your head up stairs. Would come back.
