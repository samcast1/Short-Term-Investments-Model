2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We throughly enjoyed this ranch home. It’s about 20 minutes away from Sweetwater/buffalo gap and 30 minutes away from Abilene. It’s not for the faint of heart to get to but it’s worth it. The home is located on about 1 acre of ranch land tucked amongst the windmills. The sunrise and sunset are to die for. It’s absolutely filled with peaceful serenity. The house came well stocked with spices and coffee. The beds were comfortable and I appreciated that all the mattresses and pillows had covers on them (and not the cheap plastic kind) there are plenty of throw blankets to wrap yourself up in. We rented it out for visiting family members and they enjoyed the game room. It’s the perfect home for a family gathering. The only thing I could have possibly wished for was a hammock. Would absolutely stay again. Make sure to stock up before heading out there as groceries are not easily accessible.
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This was our second time staying here for the collegiate national stock horse competition in Sweetwater. It is a super easy drive to Nolan county coliseum. It is so easy to relax and host a dinner for a large group here. The windmills are beautiful and the scenery is breathtaking. The owners were easy to communicate with and made sure we had everything we needed.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. House was clean and stocked luckily with a few small items we forgot, land was beautiful. We enjoyed the Clay/ Shooting range. My wife loved the horses and my 9y/o enjoyed too much to list. We will definitely be back. Thanks Dawn"

2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Very homey and perfect for a large group!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here a week and it was great. If you need space in the country to relax, this is it! The wind turbines were surprisingly relaxing to watch. This is was best stocked Airbnb house we have rented. It had plenty of cookware, cups, spices, household items, etc. The land is far from neighbors and the skeet shooting field is fenced off from the back yard. It had a spring loaded and hand skeet thrower. The fire pit was quite high, making it safe for the kids to be around. There was plenty of dry firewood also. About the only improvement to the house would be to have dressers in the bed rooms."

Dawn and Andy were only a phone call away and responded quickly to the questions I texted to them.
We look forward to returning when we have more time to stay and play.

We like seclusion and her place has it. There was only one neighbor we could see way off in the distance and plenty of room for the kids and dog to run without worrying about traffic.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very welcoming and peaceful home. Quiet neighborhood. The prayer garden is beautiful. This is our second time to stay in this home and will stay again when in the Abilene area if possible. Well worth the money.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Forest and Betty’s home in Abilene was beautiful, extra clean and peaceful, it was the perfect home away from home for my wife, her parents and I while we celebrated her brothers wedding. The master suite is on the opposite side of the house from the other bedrooms which is great for privacy.
The garden out back was a beautiful and peaceful oasis that we loved drinking our coffee in during the mornings and stargazing in at night.
Would/will definitely stay here again"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Forrest and Betty were very responsive and their home was beautiful with the amazing patio space as an added perk! Me and my husband brought my elderly parents and his mother to watch my daughter graduate from ACU and none of them have ever stayed in an AirBnB and were amazed that I got that size house with plenty of bedrooms and space for the weekend for the price they charged. It was well worth the price and everything inside was clean and pristine! We are coming back in June to move my daughter out of her duplex and I hope this place is available that weekend because it’s an amazing place. The large towels were also a very nice touch. Thanks for sharing your home!

Plus, you get entire house to yourselves to stretch out and it was oh so relaxing! It’s a safe neighborhood, quiet, and the backyard view was amazing.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had an amazing 2-week stay at Serendipity! We suddenly had to move out of state from Oklahoma because my fiancée accepted a new job so we had to find a place to stay while finding a rent house. This air bnb had everything you could ever need and it was very cozy! By far the best experience I’ve ever had, we didn’t want to leave! We even had our sweet fur baby with us and she loved it just as much as we did."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This gem of a place is something else. I truly enjoy editing who peaceful it was. I enjoyed sitting on the front covered sitting area, while watching the sun set.

Judy is one of the best, most generous hosts I’ve interacted with, and this is the cutest tiny home in the world, I am convinced. SO homey and cozy, and decorated in the most charming way.
Judy went above and beyond: a ton of snacks and water, an adorable sign welcoming me and my dogs, and the string lights lighting up the drive to get to the tiny home are so, so helpful at night.
If you’re thinking about staying here, do it.
Be aware that there’s no WiFi so you are just going to have to enjoy the amazing space - take a swing in the hammock!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was absolutely beautiful! The location was relaxing and you get a true West Texas get-a-way. Judy is an amazing host.

I love the ""tiny house"" arrangement: it's very roomy (for one or two!) The colorful decor and the quilt curtains, the unique step design going upstairs, full size fridge/freezer to put my frozen items in (on my 2 long day drive..) Judy herself is a lovely person, who I visited with both times. She provides kitchen and bath amenities above standard. The deck out front is so comfortable and provides a shady place to enjoy the beautiful outdoor view. I do hope to come back someday, it's such a comfortable place!"

Very private surrounded by trees although nearby the house. I wish I could’ve spent more time on the porch or in the hammock but it’s so hot out right now!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place is so cute! There are not many places to stay in the area besides some chain hotels so having the tiny house is a great addition. The outdoor space was relaxing and the house was cute and had everything I needed. I’d definitely stay again!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We LOVED serendipity. The name is so very fitting. We were just passing though and needed a place to rest our heads since I’m pregnant and can’t do the long hours on the road like I normally would. The tiny house was just as described and perfect for what we needed. 10/10 will stay here again. You’re humble abode inspired us to build a couple tiny homes on property we just bought for family to come stay with us. My boyfriend normally isn’t into stays like this but he loved it so so much. Thank you again Judy for being so responsive and keeping the place in tip top shape ❤️
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Judy was a very responsive host, and her home was so easy to get to, (even though I was traveling and had to arrive in the late of night) with clear instructions. I was so pleasantly surprised at how lovely my stay was and wished I had more time to enjoy the peace and quiet and comfortableness of the home. It was spotless and the added touches were so nice after a long day of travel. I will definitely stay here the next time I am passing through this part of the State! Perfect host and listing!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed in Judy’s other listing “The Hen House” twice, and while in sweetwater, our project ran long. I looked and serendipity was open!

WOW, I sure wish I could have stayed longer, to enjoy the full experience. However the bed was great, the shower is perfect and it has everything you need for a great getaway or after a long day in the field!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We truly enjoyed Camie+Nats place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A nice comfortable place to stay. It is exactly as described and Cami and Nat are wonderful hosts. And we enjoyed having Opal the cat come to greet us and welcome us when we arrived. Made us feel right at home.
Curt & Denise"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Natalie and Cami are great hosts. They are very responsive to messages and keep a nice place. The place has great attention to details and is very well stocked with everyday items that you will need while you stay. The location is beautiful and is nice and quiet. We would recommend staying there and plan to come back again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed here for on night and enjoyed our dinner at Perini Ranch. Camie and Nat (and Sammy the dog) were welcoming and friendly! We even ran into them at breakfast the next morning! We can’t wait to come back to Buffalo Gap!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was one of the nicest AirBnBs we have stayed in! It’s very well furnished with thoughtful touches all around. It had everything we needed and more! The backyard is beautiful and there are multiple wood burning fire pits with wood included! We can’t wait for an opportunity to stay here again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an awesome place! Super cute, clean and well maintained. The hosts were very kind to us and we felt right at home! We really didn’t want to leave."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, peaceful property with great hosts!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a great Airbnb experience. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would in a heartbeat! It exceeded all expectations, and it was obvious there was great care and thought that went into setting this space up. It was so comfy and cozy, and was the perfect place for a weekend getaway. My boyfriend and I especially loved the kitty friends we made :) I will gladly return if in the area again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely stay, great little romantic get away"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect for a weekend in Buffalo Gap. Ate at the famed Perini Ranch - only 5 min. away!
The wood burning 🔥 fireplaces, both inside and out, were really nice. The decor was spot on - clean and perfect ""country-modern"". Next time we will definitely want to stay here, sooo much better than a hotel in Abilene."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a cool place to stay! It was very welcoming, smelled great, extremely well decorated, very private, cool views and very clean. Although we didn’t stay for long, we would definitely go back!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"First time staying here, and we had a great time. The house was lovely, clean, and really comfy. Wish we had more than just the one night there. Can't wait to visit again!"
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The location is secluded. There is a fireplace, but no logs placed inside for our use, so we felt the use of the fireplace was not encouraged. The space was fine for an overnight stay. A 10:00 a.m. check-out time is too early, in my opinion."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, secluded property. Everything we wanted and more."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great! Had a great stay :)

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at this getaway. It was a short drive to ""downtown"" Buffalo Gap and the surroundings were beautiful. I wish we could have stayed longer."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay at the Peace in the Gap ! The house was very clean and comfortable. The location was easy to find and close to Abilene .

We are looking for to our next stay!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfectly peaceful get-a-way for overnight stay. Even though home is on the same property as the main house, it is tucked away and very quite. Home was well appointed with everything you would need to stay one night or one month... comfortable living room, full kitchen setup, washer & dryer, fluffy robes and wide selection of local lotions & potions in bathroom. And a Tempurpedic mattress was the cherry on top! It was the perfect place to return to after exploring Buffalo Gap and enjoying a meal at Perini Ranch Steakhouse. I highly recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place. Nice, quiet. cozy. We loved it!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peace at the Gap is a beautiful home perfect for a relaxing weekend getaway.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a fun space, really enjoyed it!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,GPS takes you 100 yards off where you think which isn’t the host fault. But the whole house felt slanted slightly towards the pond. Other than those 2 little thing the house was wonderful. I really enjoyed it
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cutest and well thought out guest home. Cant wait to go back!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great, little cozy spot to stay. We stayed the weekend and had a blast. Wonderful little setup with enough privacy and a great porch with lightning. Though it was hot (late summer), it was still great outside in the shade of the porch, and of course, inside. Comfortable and clean all the way around. Friendly cats come to visit from time to time too was a bonus."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, peaceful, inviting atmosphere are just a few words to begin to describe our stay but ultimately can’t rant me rave enough about this place! First time staying in an Airbnb so my husband and I were a bit skeptical but Camie and Nat really set the bar. We definitely plan on staying here again, great location and amenities for any time of year. Great peice of land to explore in the spring and summer and great scenery, fireplace, and cozy cabin feel for fall and winter :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house. Buffalo Gap is an awesome area. Great friendly host.

The home was clean, the bed was comfortable & we really enjoyed the record player! The bathroom had a wonderful mirror & the house was stocked with almost anything you need. The location was quiet & peaceful and even had a small pond. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area. Great place!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, our stay was perfectly amazing! Relaxing and cozy just like our own home without all the extra noise from the outside world. Thank you ladies. We will be back =)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a quick get away and this was, by far, the place to stay! It was absolutely the most peaceful and relaxing place we have ever stayed at - the entire cabin and porch were spotless, the bed was super comfy - loved the “all cotton” sheets - the shower was spectacular with the all natural toiletries - the decor was simple and unique with all the little extras touches - nothing was missed! The pond, patio, ducks & cats were a welcomed bonus. Camie & Nat were quick to answer any questions - we were treated like family - couldn’t have asked for anything better - will definently be staying again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peace at the Gap is a beautiful, peaceful place to get away!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing place.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I were looking for a place to unwind and unplug and Camie+Nat’s place was exactly what we were looking for. The place was clean and comfy. The area was so peaceful that I was able to fall asleep in the hammock. Camie+Nat were very responsive. They even provided a grill for us to use. This by far is the best AirBnB we stayed at. Would most definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Relaxing atmosphere, beautiful spot. Staying again next week."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my favorite Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at!! Camie & Nat have put so much attention to detail to make their guests feel cared for and at peace in their beautiful guest home. The interior design is absolutely spectacular and clean. They included the comfiest bed, robes, towels, homemade soaps and natural toiletries. If you are looking for peace and quiet outside, you’ll be be floored to find the most perfect patio dressed with plants, a hammock, outdoor string lights, and a walkway leading out the fire pit and small pond. We absolutely loved watching the friendly ducks and cuddling their precious outdoor cats. Camie and Nat topped our stay with homemade cinnamon rolls and mini mosas. They were super welcoming and forgiving for our timeline in the house. An absolute MUST STAY!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is amazing and so so peaceful!! It was amazing. The place was sparkling clean. Loved everything about the place. The hosts are very responsive helpful and nice!! Would definitely recommend staying here!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"More beautiful than pictures can describe! Beyond scenic inside and outside. Would highly recommend their Buffalo Gap Airbnb and Camie+Nat in general. We're repeat guests because we like their style and locations. Very nice hosts! 100% chance we'll be back!
Easy to follow directions. Made for a low-stress easy trip!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Camie and Nat’s. It was a beautiful place in a beautiful location. The bed was very comfy. There were so many touches in the bathroom and kitchen, they really thought of everything. The cats were the sweetest! I also enjoyed watching the ducks. Communication was also great!! Camie and Nat were very sweet and thoughtful. I wouldn’t hesitate one bit to stay here again the next time I’m in town."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely enjoyed the stay at Camie+Nat’s place. Quiet retreat off the beaten path with a wonderfully decorated and appointed decor! Could not have asked for a better place! Close enough to town to drive a short drive to either Abilene or the quaint town of Buffalo Gap! Will definitely visit again!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place! Was in town for work and was very pleased with the accommodation! Very clean and quiet and was nicely decorated. Cozy get away!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice cabin with a beautiful view. Very welcoming host and it was extremely comfortable.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Camie+Nat’s place was absolutely beautiful! That is probably the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in. The decor is spectacular, they have an excellent record collection (and record player) and the kitchen has everything you could need if you wanted to cook. The patio and back yard was so peaceful to hang out and look at the ducks, or visit with the cat. I will be coming back to Buffalo Gap specially for this air bnb"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was absolutely amazing.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very nice and secluded stay. It is very peaceful and relaxing at this place and I would recommend this to anyone!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had an excellent stay over a very hot Memorial Day Weekend. The back deck view was incredible. We were lucky enough to experience a brief rain storm one afternoon and loved being able to watch it from there. More than enough space to park and unload your vehicle, comfortable bed (we only slept in 1 of the 2), and once you get the space cooled down with the mini splits upon arrival it stays that way. The kitchen had pretty much everything we needed and we successfully cooked several meals. Would certainly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Second stay at Alex’s place and it was just as great as the first. Would recommend again and again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very unique. Great design. Extremely comfortable. Buffalo Gap is a cool place and Perini Seakhouse was everything good we had read about it.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was absolutely breathtaking. It was the perfect spot to get away and relax for a girls weekend. It would be a great couple’s retreat or even a family vacay as well! Loved it!!!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely DIVINE. This is the perfect gem and I found it very difficult to depart from this place. This is truly one you must experience for yourself to really appreciate. I can’t say enough amazing things. Perfection.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW! is a great word for this place. It was more beautiful than the pictures. Sunset on the back porch with a grilled dinner was the place to be in the evening. However, we did go to the local steak houses and were pleased with both. Alex went above and beyond to make our 14year wedding anniversary trip a great one. We loved all the wildflowers surrounding the property, the relaxing atmosphere inside and outside, and exploring the property. We slept in the main cargo. The bed was so comfortable, the hot shower had great water pressure, the kitchen had everything one should need for a meal as well as the grill outside. We can't wait to go back!
Thank you, Alex! For everything!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Alex’s place is beautiful and serene. It’s truly a getaway from the hustle and bustle of life. The train car retrofit was expertly done and provided a nice mix of history and modern comfort.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the place to be to get away from it all! We really enjoyed relaxing on the back deck. This place is unique with a beautiful view. Very clean, very private. Full kitchen if you want to cook, but also not too far from some great restaurants. Perinis in Buffalo gap and when pigs fly in Tuscola are both very good. We even did a little wine tasting at Copa at the Gap…very nice place with a great wine selection. Make sure to turn off the lights on the back deck at night and look up at the stars…beautiful! Hope to come back next year."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We will definitely be staying here again!
We brought salmon and steaks with us, the grill outside was perfect for dinners.
The hammock on the deck was relaxing by the fire pit at night.
The bench swings behind the caboose on the hill for sunset with wine (provided by the host) was very romantic.
Abilene state park was only a 5-10 minute drive down the road, they have an entrance fee of 10 dollars but the hikes are worth it.
10/10 beautiful clean relaxing stay.
Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful experience from start to finish! Thanks for sharing such a unique space!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really nice and unique property that was clean and in great shape upon our arrival. Alex was prompt, friendly, and accommodating in all communications.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we feel extremely privileged to have been able to stay at such a magical place. it felt otherworldly, like something from a movie.
our NYC apartment dogs have never experienced such freedom and it was amazing for us to see them this happy.
we will hopefully visit again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! We wanted something quiet, comfortable, and with great views. This was the perfect place for us. The amenities are fantastic - especially the back porch that had a great view of the west Texas landscape. We enjoyed an amazing dinner at nearby Perini Ranch and a delicious breakfast at The Gap Cafe. If you are looking for a secluded weekend getaway spot, look no further."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down, one of the coolest Airbnbs I've ever stayed at. The railcar actually exceeded our expectations - it looks even better in person than it does in the photos. The views overlooking the creek were incredible and the surroundings were peaceful and quiet - we enjoyed walking down the country roads around the property and exploring nearby Buffalo Gap and Abilene. The railcar was clean, private, and stocked with everything that we needed for our stay; wifi was also good enough for us to both work remotely. Alex went above and beyond by helping me set up a birthday surprise for my friend, which started the trip off on a great note, and continued to be super responsive and flexible throughout the duration of our stay. We can't wait to come back."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great relaxing place to spend sometime to get away from the city! You will gladly be back for more great memories at this beautiful place!!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex’s place is simply amazing! Very unique. You won’t find anything that matches it in the Abilene area. Peaceful and secluded, which is just what we needed after our trip to San Diego. Well thought out design and felt very cozy. Loved sitting on the deck in the mornings and evenings and enjoying the view. Will definitely be back!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a magically tranquil place where you can recharge your soul! I surprised my husband with a trip here for his birthday and it exceeded both of our expectations. It was exceptionally clean, had everything we needed, and was a unique experience. A lot of thought and detail was put in to renovating these rail cars and the view is spectacular! Alex was so genuinely communicative and responsive. We couldn’t have asked for a better host!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect, peaceful getaway for our anniversary. We truly enjoyed the special touches in this one-of-a-kind home, Alex has the perfect setup for a romantic weekend or a family adventure!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect. My wife and I wanted a weekend away with seclusion and peace and quiet. Alex’s place absolutely provided that as well as a unique experience. The pictures don’t do this place justice. While the pictures of the place were great, the actual property was even better in person. We’ve already recommended the place to friends and family and intend on spending time there again. Alex was very responsive and helpful. The recommendation for the steakhouse was spot on and some of the best steaks we’ve had."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, truly an amazing place to stay. Not too far from Buffalo gap, Abilene state park, or the town of Abilene. I would definitely like to visit again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the best AirB&Bs I’ve ever rented. (And I travel quite a bit). It was unique, comfortable, and well equipped. The views were simply spectacular. It’s perfect for a small family or two couples. Lots of privacy and the back deck is incredible. I would highly recommend staying at this property."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We were looking for an Airbnb that was extra special, and we found it here! We were so excited to stay in a railroad box car and caboose! The conversion of these rail cars into an Airbnb is fantastic. The scenic overlook from the back porch is awesome. We were very pleased with our host, Alex, who did an excellent job of communicating all the necessary details to make our stay pleasant."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Like others have said before, this place is special. If you are lucky enough to find this listing available BOOK IT!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking at this review, take it as a sign to BOOK! This was one of my favorite Airbnb’s to stay at. The place was unique, quiet, and beautiful! Alex was a fabulous host and provided everything we needed for a peaceful weekend away from the big city."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was looking for a secluded place with a great view and this place did not disappoint! The back porch is cozy and comfortable. We took meals and never left the place. My dogs loved it and the back porch is completely fenced except for one small part which made it easy to contain them. It’s quirky and unusual but extremely comfortable! I will definitely be staying again! Alex was also very easy to communicate with which was awesome!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alex has created a very unique & relaxing experience. The view is amazing. My wife & I told enjoyed a relaxing weekend here.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down the best Airbnb place we've ever stayed at! We enjoyed a nice, quiet weekend and spent the majority of it on the porch. You know it's awesome when your 13 yr old would rather get takeout and eat it outside rather than go ""out"" to eat. Incredibly peaceful and relaxing -which is just what we were looking for. Nicely decorated with all the amenities you could want. Super comfortable linens and bed. Location is private, but not too terribly far from Buffalo Gap or Abilene. My train enthusiast husband was impressed with the modifications that were made to turn it in to such a unique Airbnb. We will definitely be rebooking another trip here in the future. Highly recommend! You are a fabulous host, Alex!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay and Alex was a great host!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful & quiet! We enjoyed our stay. The pictures don’t do it justice- we will be back!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The rail car was truly the best place I’ve ever stayed! The scenery was peaceful and beautiful. The pictures described it perfectly, but at the same time, didn’t do it justice. It was comfy, cozy, and very well decorated. You’re only 20 minutes from town, but it’s far enough out that it feels like a real getaway.
My favorite spot was the back patio. I ended each night either in the hammock or curled up next to the outdoor gas fireplace.
Alex was a great host. He checked in during my stay and made sure everything was perfect. I highly recommend this place and can’t wait to get back one day!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The caboose and the rail cart was perfectly advertised, but the pictures does not do this location justice. The rail cart has a unique lock on the front door, which was very cute. The space was inviting and comfortable. Alex provided everything that you may need from towels, hair dryers, shampoo, conditioner, coffee, mugs, and a nice bottle of wine. We will return to this location when it is time to recharge our battery from our busy home life. Thank you Alex"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,One of the best experiences I’ve had on AirBnB. What a phenomenal stay! Couldn’t recommend this private retreat highly enough.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous place. Already working on coming back. This place is quiet, cozy, relaxing, and just what we needed. Alex did a wonderful job on decor and all the little touches - but not to overdone. Just what is needed. Yes it's a train car with little modern touches. Thank you Alex!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find near Abilene!!! I'm originally from Abilene, and I usually stay at a hotel while I'm in town visiting family. I found Alex's place while I was searching for a way to make Abilene more enjoyable for my husband, and I DEFINITELY found it.
The train was so cute and quaint. The furniture and bed were super cozy. They did a great job decking this place out. The patio was amazing and had a great view! We were there for Thanksgiving, so I found myself cooking a few dishes in the kitchen, and I had everything that I needed. There is a path to the creek that was super cute (not suitable for those with limited mobility). I can't wait to stay here again when the weather is nice. Sitting out on the patio or in the hammocks down by the creek will be absolute heaven!
The property was so quiet and relaxing. I can't wait to stay here again!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay in the rail cars. It's a unique property with beautiful views set in a peaceful, private location. The design and decor, of both the exterior and interior spaces, is so creative. Alex is truly an artist! We hope to return for another visit soon, hopefully when it's warmer so we can more fully enjoy the outdoor spaces."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the absolute best Airbnb experiences I have had! Every aspect of the stay was incredible - the sweeping views, the stars, the sunrises and sunsets, with only the sound of the wind whistling around the hills, the outdoor living area to enjoy it all, the creativity of the conversion and the decor, the comfort and interest of the furnishings, the hospitality. My girlfriend and I loved our weekend and didn't feel the need to go beyond the gate to the property during our entire stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Book it today!! What a special place to rest and relax for a few days! Alex has a mind for quality hospitality which is demonstrated in the craftsmanship and attention to detail for this unique stay! You will enjoy the comfortable bedding, the charm of a unique place, renewing vistas and ample space to hang out and relax! It’s quiet and revitalizing all at the same time!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jacqui is a five-star host!! Her place is decorated beautifully with local flare, and the kitchen is immaculate and well equipped. We had an unexpected glitch with the internet access, and Jacqui spared no effort to make sure we were able to dial in to an important online meeting, even getting the internet company on the line after hours to make sure our meeting was a success.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Pristine. Beautifully furnished, fully supplied, with many thoughtful touches. Relaxing setting, and I appreciated the nice outdoor kennel. Came in handy for my dog while we were packing up in the morning. We were doing an overnight, and while the two lane road we used to get to it off the interstate was a little hairy in the dark, it was a quick hop back on to I 20 in the morning. But this place is way nice for just an overnight. It really deserves a longer stay."

2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"Upon arrival everything was in great shape and it was a cute little place. However in the bathroom, the rug was messed up. At no fault but our own, we did not inform the host. A few days later after we checked out, the host messaged and asked if we brought a dog because the rug was messed up. I informed the host that yes there was a dog there briefly, but it was only in the house one time when it slipped through the door. Other than that it was in the truck because it was pouring down rain. The host informed me that I owed $25. She said her housekeeper said it was not like that prior to our stay. It was our word vs hers. I tried to reason with the host because neither of us could prove the condition of the rugs. I offered to pay for half to do right by both of us. She claimed this is was business and she could not do that. When we voiced our opinion of not coming back and not recommending this site, she stated she felt threatened.
All I say is watch your back if you book with them."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Seriously such a fun location and spacious, clean, comfortable stay! The hosts we quick to respond and absolutely accommodating! They let my kiddos and family ride there horses hand overall I’m beyond happy with my stay here! 11/10!!!!!!!!! Thank y’all so much for everything!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is large and spacious. It would suit a large family on vacation. I felt being asked to wash sheets and towels was a bit much and try to check out by 11:00. We did manage to get out by 11:45 I believe. The place was reasonably clean and comfortable. We would stay there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jota and Candace were incredibly gracious and their Airbnb was beautiful. We got to pet their horses and hike on their gorgeous merkel property. I feel extremely comfortable staying there. Jota texted me personally to ensure we were happy. They have two beautiful horses as well which was the cherry on top to a wonderful experience. We will be back!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jota and Candace were wonderful hosts! Due to some warm weather, we requested early check in to avoid the heat of the day and they were prompt and happy to help accommodate it! The home itself was a great value for what you get. We were in the area for work in Abilene and it was worth the drive despite being a bit off the beaten path. We really loved the large carport, and the large back porch area. The hosts are on the property, but the home is very private and quiet. Beds were very comfortable— some sort of memory foam type material. We will consider it again if returning to the area for work!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Candace was very polite and accommodating! We had no problem finding the house, and the location is perfect. The property is quiet and secluded, has beautiful views, and the horses are sweethearts! The house was clean and roomy, and all the basic necessities were well stocked. I would definitely recommend staying here if you love being away from the city lights! Oh and too add, our Brittany puppy was comfortable and had a blast!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I enjoyed staying at the property. It's off the beaten path, however that's exactly what I wanted.
I recommend their property to anyone looking to get away from the big city."
2022-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The hosts were kind. Doing the laundry and dishes is inconvenient and not worth the price difference from another rental. The property is beautiful.
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This Airbnb was located out in the middle of nowhere about a half hour from Abilene! Not what we expected but pretty secluded and quiet and I got some great sunrise pics in the morning along with the moon and Venus. The house was very basic but it worked for us and our friend we were traveling with. We could visit in the morning and evening in the common area but then go off to our bedrooms to sleep. There are basic dry and refrigerator goods stocked. The mattresses are comfortable and the shower is awesome! The house was very clean. With all of that being said though, the house needs some TLC. Also, guests are expected to wash their own sheets and towels. It is what it is but I just thought it would be part of the cleaning fee. All in all, it worked for us for a few days. Realistic expectations are the key here."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was all we expected it to be. Quiet, secluded, not far from where we traveled to daily, provided all the amenities we needed and more, the shower was awesome and we liked that there was a washer and dryer as well. Our dog enjoyed herself as well. Definitely recommend."

They left a nice little welcome gift which was so thoughtful. I definitely recommend their property if you want a cozy place to stay away from all the hustle and bustle!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was quiet and serene and dark. A wonderful retreat from the city. The house was no frills, but had an excellent coffee maker and all of the appliances worked.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for a family Easter with our college daughter. We had a few hiccups, but Candace was easy to get ahold of and quick to help. Very down to earth. Lots of space inside and out. Beautiful scenery and we enjoyed hiking about. Comfy accommodations with everything we needed. My horse riding kids enjoyed Tom saddling up the horses for them. Easy drive to Abilene and worth it for the room to breathe! Would definitely stay again."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a great place to stay and gets you off the busy road and busy road of life. Expect quiet nights under the stars, lots of rabbits and ranch style atmosphere. We stayed here over a week and had no problems.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pantry, fridge, and kitchen were well stocked....among the best that we have experienced with airbnb. I had to call once about the TV and Jota came over immediately to show me how to run it. We happened to be there during a cold snap and the furnace kept the house nice and warm. The drive from Merkel was beautifully amazing. We hope to go there again."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were staying in Snyder to visit family, and Alana's rental was very comfortable for our family of four. It is a nicely updated home that looks exactly like the photos. What stood out was Alana's care and responsiveness when we reached out with questions. She responded immediately and went above and beyond to make sure our stay went well. We will definitely consider Alana's property the next time we are in town! One tip - this rental is in a neighborhood in a west Texas town, so on occasion, we heard a barky dog or a passing train. I always travel with ear plugs and white noise apps, but I slept fine without using either."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Alana is an excellent host! She would respond almost immediately whenever I needed anything. The Rhapsody is possibly the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in.

Private parking spot was provided. There was a lot of room in this house and very neatly laid out, especially with having a TV in every room which doesn't seem to be the norm for a lot of places.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is so sweet, we've gone an extra couple hours to stay there!
Alana has a good water filter & great coffee - 2 essentials.
The home is super clean,
The beds comfy,
And plenty of personal touches to ensure you feel like you're staying at a good friend's home!
To top it all off, the final price is decent!!!
->We'd pretty much stopped even looking for places to stay using this app precisely because the final price is up to 350% of the list price! Soo many extra fees negates why Airbnb was successful in the first place!
Alana's final cost is reasonable."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very cozy, clean and well decorated house with room aplenty.
Alana is a super host that goes out of the way to make her guests feel comfortable. We checked in late and there was some internet issues; she worked late into the night to resolve it for us.
The place has some of the best television sets that work and comfortable beds. All equipments are of high quality and each bedroom has a tv as well.
The towels and toiletries are clean and good quality.
Overall we couldn’t get enough of the place since we stayed there for a pit stop enroute our long drive from the west to east.
She also discounted the price when there was delay in resolving the internet issues."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Place is really cute and safe in the small town of Snyder Tx. It was perfect for our one night stay. The smart TVs in all rooms is a plus.
We aren’t use to firm beds like what seems like memory foam. I didn’t mind it but our toddler woke up uncomfortable throughout the night. There are no ice cubes/trays available here either. Other than that I recommend this place for a short stay (:"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Immaculate spot! I’ve stayed in a couple of AirBnB’s in Snyder; however, this home beats them all hands down! Wonderful host with fast communication, easy breezy check-in/check-out, everything you need to cook for your family, all the amenities that you’ll need along with comfy beds with lush pillows and blankets. There is a hair dryer along with shampoo, conditioner, and body soap. The towels were super soft and made me jealous that I have not been able to accomplish that softness in my own towels!
I love all the attention to detail the owner took with furniture, the kitchen and decor. It’s impressive and will certainly be our top pick each time we visit Snyder to see my Dad."

The kitchen has everything you’d need to make meals and has new appliances. There are coffee pods, creamer, and sugar which always helps to start your day. The comforters are a bit firm, but the bedding is a dream and we all slept so well. Next time we are in Snyder, we will definitely check to see if this house is available, but we doubt it will be because it’s such a gem!"

Great weekend vacation away from the hustle and bustle of Midland.
The small details of the owner’s fabrication shop/businesses were an awesome touch."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Kendall's place was amazing! There is absolutely something for every age range to enjoy. We all kept saying that the owner's thought of everything. The kitchen areas (both indoor and outdoor) are incredible and make food preparation for a large group so easy. The lake views at sunset are stunning, the swings were favorites for both the kids and the grandparents, and the indoor games kept the teens happy. Sometimes when we rent Air B and B's, it can lack that ""homey"" feeling but not this place. It truly felt as if someone invited us into their home and said, ""Welcome!"" What a great place!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great host!

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"If your looking for a get away for a large group, look no more. Amazing place, beautiful lake. Everything thing you need. Pretty much, just bring your clothes, and your willingness to have a good time."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house is hidden gem! It’s fantastic for a family get together and he has thought of everything! So much fun everywhere you turn. Awesome large kitchen and outdoor space. The entire family was sad to leave. We will definitely be back.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a wonderful time at this rental. The beds where so good, they smelled fresh. All the games, amenities and activities available were so good. The owner Kendall was also kind.
Only complaints would be dust. Looked like it had not been used in a while. However the kitchen and bathrooms where very nicely cleaned. You could tell it was cleaned, but it might have went through a couple of windy days since.
And the ac units upstairs. I think we might have not known how to operate them correctly. But it was not a big deal.
Overall great place to stay."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome lodge! Excellent amenities and luxurious. Owner was extremely helpful in making our time the best experience!
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Second time we’ve stayed here with our hunting group & wouldn’t change a thing.
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a great house! Rented for the weekend for a group of guys that were hunting locally. They were in ""man heaven""."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a perfect place for a group. We were here for our annual crane hunt with 14 people. It’s a well equipped place and great entertainment each night with the basketball goal and pool table.

2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Love the property! We had a work event and everyone had a blast. We loved being right on the lake. We went fishing and swimming right in the backyard. We loved the layout of the house. Lots of room for everyone.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place has it all. Beautiful setup and plenty of room for large family gathering. This will be our regulars from now on.

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great getaway, exactly what I expected. Beautiful home"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great host, easy to communicate and awesome spot"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,There was plenty of space and activities to keep everyone entertained for our group of 13 even when the rain kept us inside. Everything needed for cooking inside and out was provided so that was very helpful. The host sent someone over immediately when there was an accidental mixup with the water being turned off.
,,,"We were very displease with our stay. The place did not look as if anyone had been by for one last dusting or mopping, there was one half dollar size bar of soap to share between 6 people, and one wash cloth. The diagram shows room 1 with a king size bed, a twin bed and a queen blowup bed, in reality there was only a king size bed (it was made up) we did find the blowup bed and a cot, they do not fit in the room with the king bed. Room 2 does have a bunk bed in it (bottom sheet on it, had to get top sheets and blankets out of the closet and make our own beds). Key does not open the door that is left unlocked for you. GPS will not take you directly to the house."
