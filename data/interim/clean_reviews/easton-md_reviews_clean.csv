2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice place! Host Brenda is super friendly and responsive. We had a great time at her place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brenda was an excellent communicator and her home, yard, and neighborhood are lovely. The beds were comfortable, and having a mini-fridge in the upstairs space was so helpful. We were only there for one night, sadly it was too chilly to use the pool. Maybe next time!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brenda was so friendly and communicative- her space is impeccably decorated and thoughtful extras!
A private & pleasant outdoor space and beautiful peaceful neighborhood.

It was very comfortable. We will be back!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and communication from Brenda. Comfy bed and quaint spot to stay over in Easton.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was charming!! Great spot for 3 of us attending a wedding. Brenda was so friendly and there were many thoughtful touches in the space. The only negative was the steep windy staircase for lugging up a suitcase. But it was a lovely, clean, well-stocked, affordable spot that worked out perfectly for us! Glad we stayed there."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brenda’s house was a perfect crash pad for a wedding in St. Michaels. Her dogs were super cute! Brenda was very accommodating and easy-going.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda was a wonderful host! Very friendly and helpful. Lots of amenities and then some. Pool is a nice addition even though weather wasn’t conducive for use, but beautiful back yard area.
Her dogs Louie and Bear were the sweetest and loves to play, a bonus for dog lovers. Overall, had a wonderful stay and would return if back in the area."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Brenda is such a cool and kind person, and I'm so glad that we got to stay in her place! She was an amazing host and she has thought of every little thing that you would need to have a relaxing getaway. Even though the airbnb is in the second floor of her home, it felt totally private. Her style is so cool and everything was very comfortable and cozy (I don't think I'm the first to say the beds are extremely comfortable). I would say it is a great location if you plan on visiting Easton and St. Michael's. Her house is on a pretty street and across the street from a great park which was an awesome surprise for us because we had our toddler with us. The pool and backyard area at Brenda's are also great and she has two really sweet dogs. Even though it rained all weekend, having Brenda's place to stay in was a ray of sunshine. She was so communicative from the beginning and everything was easy. Thank you again Brenda for everything!"

Brenda’s place was absolutely lovely.

The space is decorated beautifully. We loved the comfortable beds and all the extra touches and amenities. The pool and outdoor space is private and inviting.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home away from home. Brenda is the most thoughtful and friendly host I have met. We had a girls' weekend and we felt like we were staying at a friend's. The tranquil pool and backyard washed away every stress. We have privacy as Brenda was mostly out, while whenever we were both at home, it's simply lovely sharing her home. The sunroom is cozy and the decor throughout the house is tastefully furnished. We were able to help ourselves around the well-equipped kitchen. Her 2 dogs are simply adorable - extra bonus! We enjoyed fine dinning restaurant, music concert, pizza, wine, coffee and cake at Ruby's - all nearby. Instructions from Brenda were clear and accurate e.g. stairs were steep. Watch for low ceiling at some spots for the tall ones! We enjoyed morning breakfast by the pool every day! Overall, it's really a fantastic place to stay! We will visit again!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda is great - very welcoming, helpful, and gracious. Her dogs Bear and Louis are super sweet. Great location next to a park and a rail to trail path that leads several miles and connects to another parks. Location is .7 to downtown so really close. Accommodation was very nice, clean, and well put together with everything we needed. It’s November but there is a pool in the back yard which looked great. Great stay"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot for a weekend wedding in Easton/St. Michael's. The neighborhood is quiet and green, right next to the park. Brenda's communications were clear and timely, the accommodation is generously sized, well-appointed with lots of nice extras, clean, very comfortable. Nice to have a common area to relax and watch tv outside of the bedroom. Wish we were there during pool season! We would come back again with friends for a weekend to enjoy the area. Thanks again, Brenda"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brenda is a fabulous hostess who provides a warm and inviting environment at her charming house. It is just minutes from historic Easton and 15 minutes from St. Michaels. I highly recommend that you stay at Brenda's Air bnb. She has great recommendations for things to see and do as well as great recommendations for places to eat in the area. The photos don't do this lovely little oasis justice.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda is a tremendous host. Our stay (the first in an Air BnB for my girlfriend and I) couldn’t have been nicer. Brenda’s house and our space upstairs was perfect for our visit to attend a wedding. She supplied extra water, coffee and towels. The place was immaculate and the back yard area and pool was beautiful. Brenda communicated everything we needed in a timely manner, and was exceptionally friendly. We had a great time and a great experience. If in the Easton, MD area, I’d strongly recommend Brenda’s place."

2021-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We found the accommodation adequate for our needs. The pluses for us:
1 Brenda was a delightful host - quick to communicate and responsive.
2. The location was very nice. Although we didn’t have time to sit by pool or use the sitting room, both were quite inviting, and available
There was a negative for us. The stairs to the 2nd floor were narrow and steep with a small landing to permit a 90 degree turn. Bob was using a cane and found the stairs difficult to use, particularly when descending If you have a disability, you should be aware of this issue"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda’s chic, soft furnishings make you feel comfy and welcomed. She let us know we could check in early as we had ran the St. Michaels running festival that morning. What a beautiful and serene backyard, patio and Chesapeake style decor inside. Brenda and her niece were fun to have a cocktail and conversation poolside. Bring bug spray just in case. She has the mini fridge in your room with bottled waters which was great for instant refreshment. Keurig machine with coffee pods, creamer and stevia was a wonderful way to start the morning. Enjoyed reading the Eastern Shore travel and pet magazines while sitting at the comfy desk chair and table. Can’t wait to return for another memorable stay the Brenda way! 😃"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda is personable and welcoming. She has anticipated your every need and easily made recommendations for local food, shopping or entertainment. Her home is very clean and well kept, the furnishings are first-rate and the converted attic space is cozy, comfortable and well decorated. The backyard is an amazing space for relaxing and enjoying any down time. I wasn’t there long enough to take advantage of the beautifully kept pool or kitchen but both looked like they would exceed your expectations. Brenda’s pets (a cat and dog) were well behaved and friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Easton, or visit any of the Delmarva attractions that are so close by. If you’re there in the summertime, don’t leave without grabbing some great eastern shore produce from a local farm stand on the way home."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A very friendly host who has a cozy lovely getaway that is quiet, pretty and close to the restaurant area."

Located close to town and near a wonderful neighborhood. Thank you, Brenda!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brenda was a kind and friendly host. She waited up for me to show me around the space and ensure I had everything I needed to be comfortable and feel at home. She provided everything I could have possibly needed and more! The space was comfortable and cozy - I wish I could have stayed longer. There was an adorable cat and dog living there as well. Both were gated off the kitchen on the other side of the house, but greeted me with joy and were a welcome surprise!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brenda’s place was LITERALLY PERFECT!!! The house was beautiful and immaculate. The tree-lined neighborhood was gorgeous with a huge park right across the street.
We had the “attic/loft” area of the house completely to ourselves with pretty much a separate entrance. So a bedroom, small living/office/gym/kitchen space and full bathroom - all private. Also has an amazing backyard with pool and hammock.
Brenda was a gracious host and accommodating host and her dog was adorable and goofy. Recommend 1000%!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda’s house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood across from a park. It’s a great home base to explore several locations in Eastern Shore. The house is tidy and nicely decorated. The weather didn’t cooperate with travel plans, but the bedroom is on the back of the house and great for napping."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay at Brenda's place. She was very hospitable. We enjoyed the privacy of the upstairs space and being able to take advantage of the outdoor patio/pool space on a hot weekend.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such a lovely space and so beautifully decorated. Brenda is such a doll and goes out of her way to make sure you are comfortable and well taken care of.
Location is great, central and close to the cute town of Easton and a quick drive away from St. Michaels."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brenda was a gracious, delightful hostess who ensured that our stay was outstanding. Her second floor apartment was very cool with lots of touches. It was clean and very quaint. Location was a quiet neighborhood. Weather was too chilly to use her pool and outside space. Our biggest issue was the shortness of our stay. Highly recommend."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda’s place was a wonderful find and a great place to escape for a weekend. Brenda’s home is as warm and inviting as she is and her dog Bear is absolutely wonderful. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Brenda is very hospitable and warmly welcomes her guests and gives great recommendations on where to go. I would absolutely recommend her place to everyone and would absolutely return.
Jenn and Jules 💜"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely and quaint place to stay. I would recommend to couples mostly, but also good place for two friends in Easton, Maryland. Brenda was very sweet and helpful and it was a fantastic base to see St Michael’s which is so close. Plenty of food and drink offered in the place and lots of helpful tips about the surrounding area from a friendly host.
Would happily come back here!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a great spot next to park. Brenda and her dog beat are awesome. Highly recommend
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the way that Brenda has set up the space; plenty of room with nice amenities in the living room, and the bedroom truly feels like your own private space tucked away from the outside world, set off as it is with french doors, giving it a bit of an alcove feel. Brenda was very helpful and communicative, and her furry friends, a dog, and a cat that kinda thinks it's a dog, were good fun. The location is also a short distance from Easton's historic district, and is a convenient jumping off point to other nearby destinations, like St Michaels."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brenda was super friendly and inviting! She really is the best super host. Brenda gave me suggestions on where to take my husband for outdoor dining and the apartment upstairs was way better than the pictures. It was super cozy and had everything and more that we needed! Also, wanted to note Brenda took special care to have everything clean and even some things new which is important in these uncertain times.
Thank you so much for a lovely weekend!
Carrie and Pat"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing stay! Went here to escape the city while still teleworking and it was a perfect fit. Brenda has a beautiful backyard and located right next to the park. The upstairs room is basically its own flat. I worked outside the whole time and relaxed in my breaks at the park, plus played with a fluffy dog Bear! In the evening Brenda is hospitable and enjoys getting to know her guests. The town of Easton is the perfect size with the perfect amount of fun - lots of cute downtown shops, art galleries, and restaurants."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, perfectly convenient, amazing hospitality! Well worth it!"

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming home and perfect location!! Brenda is a lovely host and I highly recommend her Air BNB. The swimming pool is a bonus and is very relaxing! 10 STARS if I could add more!!!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Brenda’s place was terrific for a long term stay while my son found his footing in Easton after accepting a job. She is a terrific hostess, communication terrific, clean, convenient to all the Eastern Shore sights. Pool fabulous for those hot summer days! Thanks so much for hosting!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Brenda is a wonderful hostess who was so accommodating!! We were greeted with a smile and were made to feel like old friends there for a visit! She has such an attention to detail and a heart to please her guests, she went above and beyond our expectations. The accommodations was so quaint and comfortable! The bed was super comfortable and had a beautiful living room area separate from the bedroom and bathroom giving my girlfriend and I each privacy. We had our own fridge, and a tv and even an exercise area if we wanted to. The pool was clean and refreshing on the hot day we had. We were close to wonderful shops and a cute town of Easton. We were there to shop in St. Michael’s and, it was not more then a few miles from there where we enjoyed wonderful food and shopping!
It was a great time! We recommend it highly to come and stay with Brenda!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Woooo first review!!! I've been using air bnb for the last 3 years and have stayed at almost 100 locations. This is one of the best places I've stayed! The location is perfect (literally 2 minutes from down town) and next to a park. Everything was neat and tidy. The bed is SUPER comfortable. There are a lot of nice touches like the mini fridge, a maple wood desk for reading or working on your computer, a little workout spot with cycle, weights, and yoga matte, and a big tv. Having my own bathroom was also a huge plus. Brenda is super sweet, made me breakfast the morning I left, and her dog, Bear, is the CUTEST. I will 100% be staying here again the next time I travel local to Easton :)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was wonderful staying here for the weekend! Extremely welcoming, home was cute and cozy, and everything was well maintained and arranged. I would absolutely recommend staying here and would love to book another stay in the future if ever I’m in the area again!
Thank you so much"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Ross’s bungalow and highly recommend it! Every attention to detail was there from cleanliness to very comfortable beds, a delightful outside sitting area with fire pit, a large screen tv, well-supplied kitchen with wonderful little snacks, tea & coffee. When we had a question about the tv Ross was all over it & helped us out right away. We really enjoyed talking with him as he was the consummate host - so helpful but in such an unobtrusive way.
On top of all this the house is in a great location for visiting many of the wonderful historical towns in the area. All in all Ross’s house is one of the nicest Air B&B’s we have stayed in. We would definitely book it again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If your preference is a quiet place off the beaten path, this is for you. Ross’s Bungalow is a gem! I don’t write this lightly. We have stayed at many airbnbs over the years. This cottage is charming, clean, quiet. It is so thoughtfully decorated with many amenities thoughtfully available to make for a comfortable stay. We came to the Eastern Shore to cycle. This is a central location for several bike routes. It is located about 20-30 min from the busier tourist towns - St. Michaels, Easton, Oxford. Easy to explore these towns and then come back to this really peaceful place. It was wonderful! Would have liked to stay longer. Thank you Ross and Chelsea."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away from the city. Amazing hosts! They gave us a guide for the area and it helped us find things to do and cool places to checkout. The home itself was clean and cozy. I will definitely visit again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The bungalow is the cutest place EVER. I work in the custom window treatment industry and the first thing I noticed was their attention detail with the shades. This place has everything you need! They thought of everything. There was not a moment I said, ""I wish it had."" Highly recommend their place!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean and peacefull.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely house and very helpful host, was the perfect stay for our nearby family reunion"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The bungalow was as described. It was very neat, very clean well stocked you felt totally comfortable and at home. This is definitely a location that I would consider coming back to the host was outstanding, and very helpful for the few items that we questioned. ￼"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful getaway bungalow. Stayed 3 nights. Easy to find. Super private. Just a couple steps to enter via front porch from parking area. Keypad was hard to see it’s face in daylight but worked just fine. Super clean. Just the right space for us (2 people) but could accommodate 4. Furniture was comfortable and fit the rooms well. Linens were very nice. Beds appeared hard but then we really slept well, so the beds were comfortable. A bench or luggage rack would be helpful in each bedroom. Plenty of supplies. Didn’t use kitchen much but it was well stocked for any meal. Loved the bowl of provided snacks. Didn’t get to use the outdoor area, but I think that would have been my favorite space if it had been warmer at night. Ross was very attentive but not intrusive. Appreciate the caring and thoughtfulness. Would recommend this nice little home for those looking for peace and quiet."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had to travel to the area for medical purposes. The bungalow was a perfect, quiet place to land at the end of each long day. All the details were so thoughtful and helpful. The place was clean and decorated so cute. Would definitely recommend and would stay again if in the area. The host was very responsive, kind, and helpful."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,I was staying here with my 3 kids while we waited for our new home to be ready and this place made us feel at home and the kids were very comfortable. Loved this little location!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We brought in the New year and enjoyed our stay. Very quiet area and the bungalow was just perfect for 2 couples.
Beds were firm and we slept well. Would have liked a stand or luggage rack in bedrooms as we had to put our suitcase’s on the floor.
We would book again.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little get away, worth the stay, very nice host, they were very quick to respond and super helpful 😊"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Tuckahoe Bungalow - or as our 3 year old starting calling it, TRUCKahoe! :) The location was convenient to visit family in Easton, Federalsburg, Denton and DE, and gave us a peaceful spot to call our own while we were on the shore. The kitchen is well-appointed and had everything we needed to make family meals at home and have snacks and coffee/tea ready to go! The washer/dryer are super clean and easy to use, too. Plenty of linens and towels and necessities available. We were so cozy there and can’t wait to visit again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place. Will stay here again when work brings me back down to the area. Really comfortable beds
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely adorable home and was perfect for our brief stay. The location was nice and quiet, and the house felt nice and cozy. Makes you feel right at home. Ross provided details days in advance on location and also checked in on us during our stay. Would definitely love to come back when in town again!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful stay
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place,clean,quiet.Would highly recommend this place to anyone."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful and quiet retreat! Was perfect for just relaxation after a day of golf in miserable weather. Hot shower, Hot coffee and a dryer were nice to come ""home"" to!
Stay here if you are ever needing a place on the eastern shore. It is quiet, updated and relaxing and very private. Would recommend 100%!
Thank Ross for the use of your retreat."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect location for visiting our family in the area. The bungalow was extremely clean and inviting! We will definitely be coming back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It truly is an adorable bungalow and it was extremely clean. The furniture was comfortable and in great shape; moreover, the bed is fantastic. The home had everything you could possibly need and it was always quiet. You will feel right at home and peaceful inside this house. It is a relaxing hidden gem. Thank you Ross --- even though most of the credit probably belongs to his wife, lol. Regardless, I would definitely choose a property hosted by them again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I were traveling to Saint Michaels for a wedding. We loved our stay in Queen Ann’s. The bungalow was in pristine condition, looks just like the pictures. I honestly have zero complaints and highly recommend this listing. Overall, the beds were comfy, the shower was super clean/nice, the kitchen had everything you could need and the hosts even left a bowl of snacks which was super thoughtful and sweet. It was very quiet, peaceful and private. There is a fire pit and 2 bikes to use. The location was perfect for us but it is in the middle of farmland. Only about 10 minutes from stores, coffee, food, etc. It was only 20-30 minutes from St Michaels and the Chesapeake Bay.
Ross was very responsive and checked in on us before and during our stay. Thank you again for our lovely stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is nice warm and cozy. Very quiet neighborhood. Ross is great host. Thanks
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable little home. It has everything you need for staying one night or one month. Super quiet neighborhood, plenty of room to park, fast reliable Internet, completely stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, and plenty of extra pillows, blankets and towels. I would have stayed longer if I had the time."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My family enjoyed our time! We will be back !!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is our second stay at the Tuckahoe Bungalow. This stay was just as fantastic as the first time. Home away from home for us, visiting family and friends. We will definitely be booking a Thursday highly recommend."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ross & Chelsea's place is truly special. Quiet and private, beautifully furnished and decorated, with an excellent air conditioning system to keep things cool in hotter weather. Perfect place to use as a base to explore the surrounding countryside. Wish we had more days to enjoy it. We'll definitely be coming back for more."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for our family, and was the best value we could find in the area. The furnishings are beautiful and the outdoor space is so welcoming. We’d love to stay again sometime. Thanks Ross!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wow- what a lovely and serene hideaway we found in this adorable bungalow we were fortunate enough to rent in the tiny hamlet of Queen Anne! The owners take pride in providing anything a traveler might need and then some. Everything is tastefully appointed and comfortable - especially the queen bed… honestly, this was a cozy respite to catch some ZZZs within cocoon of a thick down comforter and comfy pillows. They have best linens too: thick, very soft and of a top notch quality The place is super-duper clean & it’s in the middle of a gorgeous yard with lots of trees and even a hammock, BBQ, bikes & firepit.
Ross and Chelsea left us some treats too… (glad to have had soup, popcorn, coffee, tea and little sweet treats)... provided for weary travelers upon a late arrival. Toiletries were also provided. They're seriously great owners.
I can’t say enough about this property except to tell a potential visior to absolutely go for it. We will be back! Thanks again to our outstanding hosts."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting Queen Anne or the surrounding area, this is the place to stay. The cutest home with everything that you could need. Spotless interior, cute decor, and plenty of local recommendations. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The bungalow was exactly as pictured and described. We had a great stay and enjoyed using the grill and firepit. Very peaceful and private. Would recommend for couples.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great find thank you very much!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,I loved everything about it. This is a nice place to stay in!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was perfect for our visit. Exceptionally clean and well stocked. Peaceful and quiet. We loved the “extras” and enjoyed the yard and patio area. Look forward to staying there again!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,CLEAN! What a great place. Actually a gem we found. Super clean. Comfortable furniture. Everything you need. Easy in and out of the house for older people. My husband said the mattress was the most comfortable he’s ever slept on. We really loved your home. Thank you for a great stay.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very adorable place for sure. My husband's home town so he knew exactly where everything was and how to get around. The price was great too.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is really a hidden gem. Super quiet and rural which reminds me of home. House was immaculate and cozy. So cozy that my step son did not want to leave and wanted us to buy the house. My step son actually ended up getting pretty sick while we were there and it was so nice to have the comforts of home! We hope to come back soon! Thank you Ross for a memorable trip!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great little spot. very quiet and felt right at home
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I’m an eastern shore native who moved away a few years ago when the military sent my husband to the Midwest. We stayed at Ross’s place when we came back to visit our family this year. It was quiet and peaceful, but close enough to Denton, Centreville, Easton and the Island for plenty of food options and things to do. Annapolis isn’t a bad drive without beach traffic, but since it was Memorial Day weekend, we stayed away from the bridge. Ross’s place was very clean, well appointed and the internet worked great. I also loved the cottage’s close proximity to Tuckahoe State Park which is my favorite place on the shore for running trails. We would definitely love to stay at the Tuckahoe Bungalow again the next time we visit our family!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable bungalow was perfect. Super clean, very quiet and private, lovely patio area, I liked it so much that I stayed again a few days later! I would have booked it for the entire month that I will be here, had it been available. Thank you, Ross!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"More than enough space for our family. Nicely sized and very clean. Very quiet neighborhood. Home was stocked with toiletries, some snacks, coffee, etc. No complaints!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This exceeded all of our expectations!! A very comfortable and quiet place that is very well cared for and the host couldn't be more responsive. A+++ and will highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of THE BEST airbnb experiences ever. Spotlessly clean. Incredibly thoughtful details. Close enough to visit Easton, Cambridge, Oxford, St. Michael's etc, but far enough to feel like you're out in the country. Just perfect!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We cannot say enough good things about Ross and his home. From peaceful scenery to a seamless check in experience it was amazing. Ross was so very kind to our family and very responsive with answers to all questions. We will be booking anytime we come to visit family for years and years to come!!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay and loved that it was tucked in the woods. We saw some deer and it was very quiet and peaceful. The fire pit was a nice touch even though we didn't use it at the time. We would definitely use this place again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the bungalow. The place is neat, clean, and modern. Lots of nice thoughtful touches and great communication by the host. Plus a great outdoor area to relax. Only a couple minor issues which Ross took care of immediately. I would definitely recommend!
Paul"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved Ross’ bungalow for our stay visiting family on the Eastern Shore. He’s a gracious host and left us some delicious chocolate from a local chocolatier. 10/10
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little bungalow that exceeded our expectations. So many thoughtful details throughout the home. Comfortable beds and a peaceful setting on a quiet street. We saw deer in the yard and the location was ideal for our visit. Wonderful hosts!

We look forward to staying there again. Highly recommend!!!!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent property. They thought of everything. Nice and quiet atmosphere that is an easy 20min drive to Easton and close to hiking and nature. We rented Ross' place for an event at the Tidewater Inn and it was perfect. I will definitely be booking again.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful space! Has everything you could possibly need. Great location. Comfortable beds, great shower. Awesome backyard. Quiet area. Perfect for relaxing, but convenient to local attractions. Host easy to get in touch with and quick to respond. Will be back!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ross’s bungalow was a very nice retreat for us after a day spent exploring nearby Tuckahoe State Park and arboretum.
Ross was very responsive in his communication and everything was just as described in the listing. The place was so clean and orderly!
We had one small issue during our stay and when I expressed it to Ross he promptly responded and took action to resolve it and make sure we were satisfied.
We would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came into town for the St Michaels running festival, and this was the perfect place for us to rest up before the race and to relax afterwards. So clean and welcoming!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were visiting Easton for a bike ride and Carson’s place was perfect. Our first night a couple team mates stayed with us and there was plenty of room for us all. Our second night it was just my family, 2 adults and a toddler. My toddler was in toy heaven and also enjoyed the playground across the street. The house is conveniently located to where we were spending our time and very comfortable and well appointed. We will absolutely be returning!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Enjoyed our stay in Easton. The house was cozy, clean and quiet. A very good location for our activities. Close to many grocery stores and restaurants. Host was very responsive to any questions we had."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great weekend stay! Conveniently located to downtown Easton and to 50. Carson was very responsive.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed here for my sister’s low key bachelorette weekend. Super comfy and quiet area and really close to St Michael’s which is what my sister wanted, about a 15min drive. A lot of space and comfort in this Airbnb. Would definitely recommend!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing time!! House was spotless, clean and our kids had a blast. It was the perfect space for our family and we wish we could have stayed longer! We will definitely try to book again. Highly recommend to all, especially those with little ones!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Carson was a great host and has a lovely home in Easton!
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Really was a great place to stay
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house to stay in, everything was nice and clean.
Very good location."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great! The place was very clean and had plenty amenities! Would definitely stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay in a spotless home. Our 2 year old loved the home equipped with toys and kid-friendly amenities (crib, high chair, stair gate). We had multi -generation group and it worked nicely. Super short drive into town."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great convenient place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carson’s place had just what we needed to enjoy a long weekend on the Eastern Shore.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carson was a fantastic host! He was super responsive and great to work with from beginning to end. He has a beautiful home. It was immaculately clean, and everything was as described. There were plenty of linens, and every day household items. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and supplies. The blackstone was a nice outdoor touch. Check in was smooth and easy. Convenient location next to multiple shopping centers and outlets. Would love to come back and rent again!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had a birthday party in Saint Michaels, which this place was very close to and a lot less expensive than the hotels in Saint Michaels. The mattresses on the beds upstairs needed a little bit to be desired, and the one king size trundle type bed was kind of in a hallway, no door, no privacy for adults.
Otherwise it was a great location. The place was spotless, and I’d rent it again. Thank you."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay for a family with kids. Immaculately clean and would absolutely stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful, very clean, modern and roomy. It’s absolutely perfect for a family with kids. There was a gated staircase, roomy bedrooms, toys and an Xbox. Simply perfect for kids. I was impressed by how clean and clutter free the home was.
My only issue was the beds. Candidly, the queen bed in the master is the only bed suitable for older kids or adults. The upstairs beds all lacked a box spring and had a thin mattress so an adult could easily feel the frame of the bed. For kids, the upstairs was perfect, big rooms and 3 twin beds and a full size pull out.
Very happy with the home and hosts overall. Thank you"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here as a stop between houses on the way to the Outer Banks. Having 4 little children, I know how hard it is to keep a clean house and this place was spotless! If you have little kids, this is the perfect house. We really appreciate the baby gate, lots of toys/books, crib, and high chair. It was great to not worry about towels and linens as well. We would definitely stay here again. Carson was a very friendly and easy to reach host."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic from start to finish! We truly cannot recommend Carson and this home enough. Carson was super nice and responded extremely quickly. The house was spotless and extremely comfortable. I would definitely stay there again if we come back to the are.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here with our 15 month old and it was great. Lots of toys and play areas. House was clean. Carson was very communicative.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"From start to finish this was a great experience house was easy to find it is beautiful very clean and spacious has a great at home comfy feel there are restaurants and Grocery close by neighborhood is very clean very quiet Carson is a great host very accommodating communication is excellent response is very quick,friendly and helpful we felt right at home this was a great quick father's day get away for my family to celebrate my husband we will definitely book again thank you"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay! The crib was extremely clean and comfortable. Kevan was a great host!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevan was very hospitable, friendly and welcoming. The Corn Crib had everything we needed and we loved learning the history of the house and the Crib! Thank you Kevan for the wonderful recommendations around town, especially Out of the Fire and Scossas, incredible food! The Corn Crib is a very short drive to downtown Easton and St Michaels. We had plenty to do and see during our Memorial Weekend stay. Thanks again Kevan!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevan was very friendly and even came to my rescue when I forgot to pack floss. We only stayed one night, so the review is for less than 24 hours. The space was inviting, airy, nicely decorated, calm and relaxing. After traveling and attending a wedding the night before, we just wanted to chill. So after swinging into Lyon Rum/Windon Distillery and a few spots in St. Michael's, we bought a bottle of wine and thoroughly enjoyed the nice sitting area in the back yard. The space was clean and had everything we needed, especially for such a short visit. He even went the extra mile with items in the fridge, such as muffins, sparkling water and other little treats.
The only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, as much as it is the way I'm accustomed to sleeping, is that the bedroom does not get dark enough. There are two lovely skylights, which make the place beautiful. But for those who want to sleep in on a vacation stay, the sun wakes you up bright & early. Pack a sleep eye mask."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay at the crib! Hospitality was amazing and the crib was better than expected. We enjoyed our stay and loved how close we were to everything Easton has to offer. Would stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Crib was the perfect place to stay for our friend’s wedding down the road in St. Michaels
. It was beautifully decorated, and Kevan went out of his was with thoughtful details like a stocked mini fridge including breakfast options. The space is meticulous and full of character . It opened to stunning garden and we instantly felt right at home . Highly recommended will be back!! It is artisan chic with modern amenities you need! Keurig, Bluetooth, plenty of charging options and outlets . Just lived It !! Amazing Host!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Crib in Easton is perfectly situated for exploring the Delmarva Peninsula — it's rich landscapes and deep history.
The design and furnishings manage to hit the right balance of good design and coziness. Kevan and Chris have thoughtfully placed what you will need right at hand where you'll need it. They are welcoming and congenial hosts whose communication is clear, concrete, and complete. They readily share their local knowledge both before your arrival and while you are in residence. Our experience was grand. I highly recommend it. And hope to return someday."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! Kevan met and welcomed us with the keys on arrival. There was tons of natural lighting, and the whole stay was relaxing. The garden was beautiful - we loved sitting outside drinking coffee and listening to the many birds!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevan was very welcoming upon our arrival. The description and photos of “Chill in the Crib” were very accurate. Albeit small, the space was very well thought out and we enjoyed the patio area in the lush backyard. Kevan went over and above with the amenities….a fridge filled with waters, sparkling waters, fancy yogurt, delicious blueberry muffins, chocolates and elegant bathroom amenities! I would highly recommend “Chill in the Crib”!!
Note to those who can’t live with out ….no tv. We never missed it!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! It contained everything we needed and wanted, organized into a perfect space for 2 people. We have stayed in much larger spaces that still didn't have the amenities that ""The Crib"" provided. Also, the garden surrounding the house was just so beautiful! Kevan was the perfect host, greeting us when we arrived and made us feel so welcome. It was also a great location to visit St. Michaels and other historic areas. We look forward to another visit here sometime in the future. This place is a treasure!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevan and Chris are welcoming and thoughtful hosts. The space is unique, comfortable and has everything you need for a long weekend. Minutes from downtown Easton, we were able to get to restaurants, bars and shopping very easily. If we return again soon, we will definitely stay at the Crib."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting friends or family, or have events to attend in Easton, or nearby, Kevan’s place is perfect. It’s clean, quiet, charming and has all that you need to rest and relax. The outdoor space is lovely. Kevan is friendly, available and respectful of your privacy. We will definitely return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place. Fantastic hosts. Highly recommend!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The home was beautiful, clean, and safe. Kevan has thought of every last detail to make it the perfect stay. If I could give this home and Kevan more than 5 stars I would."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed in a lot of airbnbs and this has been the best one yet with the most thoughtful touches. Kevan thought of everything from phone chargers to waters and muffins in the mini fridge. We would highly recommend his place to anyone looking for a getaway to the eastern shore.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great two-night stay at the corn crib! Kevan was a fantastic host, accommodated my allergies, and made sure we were happy. The property is beautiful, and the stay was comfortable and cozy!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy and adorable! I had a wonderful stay! Hosts were friendly, but gave me lots of privacy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Crib was one of the best places we’ve stayed yet! We stayed there the night of our wedding and even though we checked in pretty late, Kevan was there to greet us and make sure we were able to get in. The space was super clean and cozy! We were even left some treats and champagne in the fridge to celebrate our special occasion! The only consideration is that the parking is a bit tight if you have a larger vehicle, but we had a small car so no complaints from us! :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I could write a book on how much I loved this listing, the hosts, the location, all of it!! It was phenomenal from the moment I booked. Kevan greeted me when I arrived and met me outside when I was leaving to send me off - felt like family! I will be staying here any and every time I visit Easton! St. Michael's and Oxford were short drives, and the areas are so beautiful - all 3 towns are walkable communities with gorgeous historic buildings and homes to see. Kevan and Chris were AMAZING hosts - they provided tons of recommendations and things to see around town! I cannot say enough good things about my time here!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Corn Crib is gorgeous, extremely comfortable, and close to all Easton and the rest of Eastern Maryland has to offer. Kevan's guidebook was full of great ideas, from where to get the best coffee (and sweets!) to where to enjoy Maryland's beautiful natural world. We loved our stay at the Corn Crib and very much hope we get back there soon.💕"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevan was very kind and thoughtful. He had a great place that looked just like the pictures. The bathroom was great — super clean. The shower pressure was amazing and the sink with the faucet and handles were beautiful.
Place was very quiet and peaceful."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a quiet and relaxing spot in Easton. A great home base for exploring the Eastern Shore!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at the ""crib"". Kevan is a great host greeted us when we arrived and when we departed. Definitely a great value if you're visiting the St Michael's / Easton area. We were there for a wedding and we were a mile away from the church in Easton and 15 minutes away from the reception in St Michael's. Kevan and his wife have thought of everything and the crib is filled with all sorts of amenities and it's cleaner than any hotel I've been at recently. A nice touch that the fridge is stocked with water, seltzer cream, muffins and chocolate. There is also a Keurig along with tea and coffee. I highly recommend the crib if you're visiting the area, you wont be disappointed!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevan really put thought and details into this humble abode. The place is nicely designed and an efficient use of space. They put nice touches to make it extra special including: games in the closet, build in phone chargers by the nightstands, extra toiletries in the bathroom and a couple basics in the mini fridge! Great place for the night!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, thoughtful, comfortable- loved our stay in the crib!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice host who greeted us personally and perfect place to stay. We felt very comfortable and the tips for dinner were also great. We will be happy to come back. Thank you, Keavon."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Crib exceeded our expectations. While the description and pictures on the site are accurate- the “vibe” really allows you to relax and unwind. The cleanliness was so fantastic that it felt like home.
Kevan’s eye for design make this place feel very upscale yet unbelievably comfortable. I would stay there again and I would highly recommend this rental.
Additionally, Kevan is very helpful and accommodating. There are plusses and minuses to rentals adjacent to an owner’s property but in this case there were ZERO negatives.
Would love to cross paths in Easton again some time!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a delight it was to meet our host Kevan and stay in the beautifully renovated and adorably decorated ""crib"". (It used to be a ""corn crib"", thus the name.)The space is private and perfect for a single or couple. There was nothing that we found lacking and the pictures posted are 100% accurate. I must say that the water pressure and shower head was the best we've ever experienced so make sure you enjoy it!! Our under the counter refrigerator had bottles of water, flavored sparkling water, yogurt, delicious blueberry muffins and some chcolate. The location is just perfect, It is an easy drive to the downtown area of Easton as well as about a 15 minute drive to St. Michael's. Both of these towns have terrific restaurants and shopping as well as history. We hope to return again and again (although not when the temps were above 95 degrees!!)! We highly recommend Kevan and Christine's gem of a place!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time at the crib! Kevan and Chris were warm and welcoming. The crib is private and well maintained. We enjoyed the complimentary treats and special touches in the room that added to the hospitality. The towels are plush, mattress was comfortable, and there is a Keurig in the room! Kevan made sure to answer all of our questions and was informative about local fare. Cheers!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Corn Crib's design is brilliant & stylish, comforting & warm. Its hosts, Kevan & Chris, are the same! I felt at home within seconds of meeting my hosts. Upon entering the Crib, I was enveloped by its beauty & comfort. Tucked away in a peaceful neighborhood, it’s close to downtown Easton, St. Michael’s, a great brewery in Queenstown, & much more. The natural light from the Crib’s skylights enhances its charm, & its vaulted ceilings promote a feeling of expansiveness & joy -- as did the lovely birthday gift & card that my hosts had waiting for me on arrival. How sweet is that?! Very! And the Crib has no housework checkout demands for its guests, as most Airbnbs I’ve stayed at recently do. I didn’t have to strip the bed; no piling a heap of towels in a specific spot; did not have to wash plates, cups, and glasses — before leaving. What a relief! And a magical bonus was seeing the usually once-a-year, single-night, flower emerge from the night-blooming cereus there -- on my birthday!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Delightful Airbnb tucked away in a peaceful neighborhood and yet only minutes away from downtown Easton. Spotlessly clean and adorably curated decor.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay! Kevan was very friendly, and the accommodations were so comfortable and tastefully decorated. It all felt very cozy! The fridge had lots of cold water, which we really appreciated because it was very hot outside. They also had some exquisite muffins for us. What a nice touch! The A/C and fan kept the rooms at a great temperature. We loved how close to St. Michael's they were! What a great spot.
I would absolutely go back!!!"

Everything is perfect and we very much enjoy the stay. The Crib is clean and comfy, with many extras. Located on a quiet street, the location is private and welcoming. Kevan and Chris are friendly and happy to provide recommendations in the area. We look forward to my annual birthday stay in Easton at the Crib and definitely recommend. One of our favorites for sure."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at The Crib. Kevan and Chris went out of their way as hosts to make sure we had a comfortable stay and shared a great list of their local recommendations. They even stocked the fridge with a bunch of drinks and snacks which was completely unexpected but we were so appreciative. I was most impressed by the fact that the crib looked exactly as pictured, it is super cute and the perfect amount of space for one or two people. We loved sitting in the patio and listening to the birds in their beautiful garden. On top of that, the town of Easton could not be any cuter. The Main Street has some gems we got to try including Out of the Fire and The Wardroom. Breakfast at Rise Up is also a must. We stayed here for my boyfriend’s Ironman race in Cambridge which worked out really well. Just a 25 minute drive to Cambridge and away from the crowds and chaos of the race weekend. 10/10 recommend a stay at The Crib for any visitors to the area."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is exactly as beautiful as advertised! The pictures exactly reflect where you will be staying and it’s even better in person. We were lucky enough to stay there on a dreary weekend with plenty of rain and the sound of raindrops on the skylights will lull you off into the best sleep of your life. Bring a good book, a bottle of wine and a great playlist and prepare for the most relaxing weekend with great hosts. The town of Easton is straight out of a Hallmark movie and the restaurants and coffee shops are amazing. Enjoy!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevan's Crib is cozy, well-cared for, and delightfully prepared for your stay. We loved the walking proximity to Easton, the quiet neighborhood and all the place had to offer. Never before had I stayed in an AirBnB in which the hosts made so many intentional decisions to make the stay extra pleasant for me."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome gem. You won't b disappointed. Fab host. Great amenities and style. Definitely a winner!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A really lovely place to stay. Well-decorated, well-designed and not a detail spared. We stayed one night and wish we could’ve stayed more! Close to charming historic Easton and in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Kevan was very hospitable and we loved chatting with him about local to-do’s and more. Thank you, Kevan!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love The Corncrib. Everything was simply lovely. Kevan is a wonderful host. The location is quiet and yet close to the center of town. The Corncrib is cozy, comfortable, very clean and uncluttered. Beautifully designed and detailed for hospitality at its best."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Kevan and Chris have thought of everything.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All good. Great place for a single or couple. Perfect location. No frills but when you’re out and about it’s great to be centrally located. Kevan was great, went above and beyond to accommodate."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot. Hosts are friendly and welcoming. Space was exceptionally clean and well maintained. Muffins and yogurt for breakfast and a pod coffee maker. Great little patio to enjoy your morning cup of coffee. Better than I could have expected. They set the bar very high.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kevan's. The space itself is really nice: a ""corn crib"" converted into a very comfortable studio apartment, complete with en suite bathroom and a small kitchenette. It was very very clean with a comfortable bed and wonderful, high-pressure shower. Kevan was friendly, helpful, and very generous with his time, answering all our (many!) questions about Easton and the surrounding area. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if we come back to Easton."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in The Crib was wonderful--everything was so clean and comfortable and very well appointed. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, and the towels were amazingly plush! The mini-fridge was stocked with bottled water, muffins, yogurt, chocolates and creamer. I can't think of another thing we would have needed. It's located in a quiet neighborhood but within a few minutes' drive to Easton and only a few more minutes to St. Michaels. We will definitely be back!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a fantastic place to stay! The hosts understand how to care for guests and make it easy for you to relax and enjoy your time in Easton and the Eastern Shore. The coffee is excellent. The towels are divine. The room is stocked with everything you will need and the decor is incredible.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully designed space with great attention to detail and lovely hosts
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Kevan’s cottage! I’ve stayed in dozens of Airbnbs, but this felt like the original intent of Airbnb — it was a home away from home, with extra touches/amenities, and a truly unique experience. Kevan is a fantastic host that greeted us on arrival and made sure we had everything we needed for the weekend. This was our second time in Easton (both times for weddings), and if we make it back this way again I will definitely be staying here again. The styling of the cottage was gorgeous, the AC was cold, the bath products were great, it was impeccably clean, and he even stocked the fridge with La Croix and chocolates. Kevan thought of everything to make the weekend feel like a getaway. Highly recommend!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the Crib! Kevan is a very kind host, and he gave us some great suggestions at check in. The place itself is clean and has everything you might need and more. The location was also great, in a quiet neighborhood but a short drive to downtown Easton."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The crib was awesome! Everything was exactly as shown in the photos. Would definitely stay here again!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevan, thank you for a wonderful stay! Your corn crib was the perfectly unique place to stay while exploring the nearby towns of St. Michaels, Oxford and Easton. We had a wonderful getaway and would stay with you again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay at the corn crib and it was great! The little breakfast treat was a nice surprise and the muffin was yummy! The crib always continues to exceed my expectations and I won’t hesitate to stay there anytime I am in Easton.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had an awesome stay at ""the crib"". I arrived on a Friday evening and Kevan, the Owner, was there to greet me and tell me a little bit about the place. The crib is just as described and shown in pictures...but even cuter in person! The place was clean, the A/C was pumping, and there were little snacks and beverages that Chris and Kevan left in the fridge. It is located on a residential street and it is very quiet, which is perfect for relaxing. It is only about 10 - 15 minutes from downtown Saint Michaels and there are plenty of shops and stores if you forget something at home or need to pick anything up. I was in town for a race and I had originally planned to stay the entire weekend but had something come up on the other side of the bridge. I wish I could have stayed even longer - next time! The hospitality and accommodations were superb."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’m a “regular” at the Crib and it was perfect as always. Please refer to my past reviews, but in summary, it is always a pleasure to stay here. The Crib is extremely relaxing, clean and comfy. Everything is as described and in photos and Kevan and Chris go above and beyond. I look forward to another stay soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy and convenient guest house with really lovely amenities—convenient to all attractions in St. Michael’s and Easton too. Thank you for a wonderful stay Kevan!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kevan was a terrific host and the corn crib was perfect! The best cozy space to enjoy a quiet stay to the Eastern Shore.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice space, conveniently located to explore the Chesapeake. The crib is neat and stylishand makes for a comfortable stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place and hosts! Look forward to staying again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Kevan and Chris. We enjoyed your company and our privacy. We're envious of your beautiful home, from the outside, and everything about the ""Crib"" was great, just what we hoped for and expected."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and great stay at the corncrib! It’s even more beautiful in person and had everything we needed for a stay on the eastern shore. The added touches such as muffins, yogurt and water were also great. Next time we are in the area, we would love to stay at Kevan’s place!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevan and Chris's place is nothing short of amazing!! We drove up to their beautiful backyard. Wish we stayed long enough to enjoy the set up! Inside, the space is beautifully decorated, extremely clean and well kept! Kevan and Chris thought of so many details to make their space comfortable- dimmable reading lights above each side of the bed; muffins, yogurt, and water in the fridge; extra blankets and all the toiletries and safety products you might need. Their place is also SO close to Easton's shopping centers and the nearby towns Oxford and St. Michaels. I will definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the crib. It was a really unique place to stay! Kevan has made it a wonderful space, providing so many small touches such as labeling all switches, providing a phone charger, reading lamps, board games, muffins in the fridge, etc. It was quiet and relaxing. We didn’t get to spend much time in the garden but it looked like a lovely space. Kevan was communicative and there to greet us upon arrival. Extra toiletries were available if we needed anything. All in all we had a lovely stay at the crib and would recommend it to anyone for a nice getaway!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem — if you crave a unique place with style and panache that's cozy, mod, and romantic all at the same time, this one's for you.
We spent three nights here and found it comfortable and cool (hip). So much attention has been paid to crafting a space that's got a vibe all its own. Great decor that's both sophisticated and kitsch, and it works!
There's a super comfortable mattress, high quality bedding and pillows, and an effortlessly clean and bright sensibility overall. I loved it and will definitely choose The Corn Crib first if/when coming back to Easton and the Eastern Shore of Md.
In the hosting department Kevan and Chris are top notch — kind, smart, easy going, and as helpful as you want without in any way being intrusive. Meeting them was a highlight of my trip. Plus, Chris's card for her Retrology Finds Etsy shop is on the counter in the Crib — you'd be crazy not to look it up online and see just how quirkily charming is her eye for Americana, pop culture, and eclectic fun!
Five stars and then some!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice Airbnb. Was very clean and stylish. Has all the amenities that you would expect to find in a nice hotel (soaps, towels, blankets, etc). Very close to downtown Easton."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 4th stay at the Crib and it was perfect as usual. (See my past reviews). The Crib is exactly as described but better. Clean, comfy and lots of extras. Kevan and Chris are wonderful hosts - very attentive and responsive. The Crib is located in a quiet part of town and is very peaceful, yet still close to the town, restaurants and attractions. We both agree this is our favorite place to stay and we’ve been to many Airbnb’s. We’ll definitely be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The crib is such a fun and unique place to stay! Everything was as advertised and Kevan is such a welcoming host. He gave great suggestions for local spots. He went above and beyond for us. The crib is also super close to St. Michael’s as well. If it is available to book: don’t hesitate!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The crib is a hidden gem in Easton! The location is perfect for exploring the town and nearby St. Michael's.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely lovely stay with Kevan & Chris at the Crib. Our hosts were welcoming, communicative, and informative. Kevan gave us some great tips on things to do in the area. The location is wonderful. Walkable / bikeable to Historic Easton with excellent cafes / restaurants. It's a great location for daytrips to St. Michaels, Oxford, Cambridge, and even Ocean City. The Crib itself is cozy and well-stocked. The gardens are lovely, and I enjoyed sitting out on the patio with a glass of wine in the evening. We didn't want for anything while staying at the Crib."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay at The Crib! It was a beautiful, thoughtfully designed, clean, and well-appointed space. The bed was comfortable and the coffee and treats in the frig were much appreciated. The hosts were friendly and provided helpful suggestions when asked. The location was perfect for us, allowing for an easy walk or drive into town as well as a run on the nearby rail trail. We enjoyed our stay with Kevan and Chris very much and hope to return in the future."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fabulous ""Corn Crib"" in the quaint town of Easton. Place is super chic, comfortable, and relaxing. Kevan and Chris are excellent hosts with top notch communication skills. Loved all the goodies in fridge. Hope to be back......"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely, extremely clean,well appointed place. Comfortable bed. Quiet. Located very close to heart of Easton. Kevan is responsive to questions. Nice touches: extra soap, shampoos and conditioner, plenty of towels; refrigerator had several bottles of water, 2 containers of yogurt, 2 muffins, cream for coffee."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic stay! The hosts were wonderful and the space was very clean, spacious, and comfortable with excellent amenities. The location was great - very close to downtown but in a peaceful setting and a good jumping off point to other spots in the Eastern Shore. A++, highly recommended, and we would love to stay again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property is such a gem!! The Corn Crib is so stylish, clean, and comfortable. We enjoyed a perfect night’s sleep, with a gentle morning awakening from the natural light and the sound of the birds chirping outside. So many extra touches, from the coffee and muffins to the stash of toiletries just in case you forget anything. I mean, there was even a spare new tooth brush and a sewing kit. They have gone the extra mile to make your stay perfect.
Before we checked out, we grabbed breakfast from Rise Up and brought it back to eat on the patio while bird watching (red-bellied woodpeckers, downy woodpeckers, common yellowthroat, etc.)
Thank you for everything Kevan and Chris!!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's as beautiful and clean as it looks! Kevan and Chris are amazing hosts, providing just the right amount of communication without being intrusive, and they were incredibly kind and accommodating. The space itself was beautiful and spotless, the perfect spot for a quick stay after a wedding in the area. We both sleep super hot but had no issues with temperature, the bed was comfy, the water pressure was perfect, and we had everything we needed and then some! 10/10 experience, I would wholeheartedly recommend the space to anyone looking to stay in the area and would absolutely stay again. Thanks again, Kevan and Chris!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is beautiful and cozy! We loved our stay. The pillows, towels, bed, everything was very high quality. Right outside of the cute town of Easton. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An absolute gem! We could not have had a better stay. The accommodations were plush, sparkling clean, bright and beautiful. We felt both at home and pampered. Beautiful linens, comfortable bed, thoughtful touches like refreshments and games. Switches were labeled and instructions were clear for heat, A/C, coffee maker. We especially loved all the local information. It is evident that Kevan and Christine love where they live and delight in sharing that love with their guests.
The crib was such a respite after busy days exploring. Loved the shared patio space and landscaping.
Ideal location for our first trip to the Eastern Shore."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay in the Corn Crib. The place was immaculately clean and impeccably furnished and restored. Kevan was an accommodating and helpful host. We hope to visit again soon!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"You can’t go wrong with this place! As a professional cleaner I am super picky about cleanliness and Kevan’s place was spotless. Every little thing you could want is there— all the essentials plus more! Great selection of board and card games, large fluffy fresh towels, toiletries in case you forget anything, yogurts, muffins, chocolate, coffee, tea, water and sparking waters, umbrellas, iron and board, hair dryer, etc. We weren’t in need of anything they didn’t have. Water pressure and temperature was great, shower was large for a walk in shower. The communication was great and they generously offered a late check out since no guests were coming that evening. Conveniently located to lots of restaurants, 15-20 mins to St. Michael’s. Safe neighborhood and very easy to find. The space was stylish and we just loved every minute of our stay. Oh, and the mattress was soooooo comfortable. If I HAD to pick something that wasn’t 5 stars it was the toilet paper ;) But you know a place is amazing when that’s the only thing you can find “wrong”. We loved the lack of a TV so that we could connect and play games and just listen to the birds sing and the rain fall. Thank you Kevan and Chris for the most delightful stay! We’ve stayed in many Airbnbs and yours is certainly high on the lists of favorites for my husband and I."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The corn crib was absolutely delightful. Great place to stay for a weekend on the eastern shore! Kevan was communicative, accommodating, and very respectful of COVID protocols during our trip. We will recommending this place to friends and family looking for a getaway."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The Best !!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Kevan was so welcoming! He was there when we arrived and gave us a rundown of the place and town.

He also spoke with us before we left and ensured that we enjoyed our stay!

The coffee station, muffins, and yogurt were a special kindness that we truly appreciated.

Beautiful accommodations and lovely hosts helped to make this an unforgettable weekend in a special town!"

2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The crib is just as described. A nice place to get away. We arrived to meeting Kevan, who gave us a quick introduction to our guest suite and the town of Easton.
The bed is very comfortable and all the amenities are over the top. The Crib is not for light sleepers though. The host mentions you may want to bring an eye mask as there are no blinds on the sky lights. I would suggest some ear plugs, light sleepers may hear outside noises."

We especially liked the fact that it was an adult only hotel. Our room was clean and just lovely ! Our host, Ben, was so helpful , easy to communicate with and made sure our weekend was special. The outside grounds and porches were well maintained as well. Despite the poor weather we had, it rained, the weekend at the Sandaway was well worth it."

Read on the side porch during a rain shower, serene - only improvement would be more comfortable seating there. Would definitely come back for another peaceful escape…"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were grateful to stay in a beautiful historic home on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay on the Tred Avon River. From the amazing sunset when we checked-in to the moment we left we cherished our stay. We loved the cottage feel of the loft in the old carriage house. The couch and chair sitting area looks through bay windows over the green grassy lawn and across the water. The Host (Ben) made us feel like family and we enjoyed the welcome packet! The bed and pillows were comfy and the coffee maker/supplies started the day right. We appreciated the in-room refrigerator. The bathroom and shower were larger than we expected. Since we were visiting family, we didn’t explore Oxford, but in the future we will plan our vacation better for enjoying this picture-perfect location. I can’t think how you could find a better home in a more beautiful location. Thanks for sharing your home!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A delightful experience from start to finish. Ben reached out nearly straight away and was able to accommodate an early check in. Welcome bag is a nice touch, instructions are clear and easy, and even got to meet his mom! Felt very at home in a beautiful setting. Oxford was a quiet and walkable with access to neighboring towns. Look forward to my next visit."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location with a beautiful view and walkable to all we needed during our stay. Oxford is so charming and our accommodations were comfortable.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had been planning a trip to Saint Michaels, but things were really booked up and what was available was astronomically priced. We changed course and set our sights to Oxford, and are so pleased that it worked out this way. We had a beautiful water view a comfortable room with soft sheets. a little for refrigerator which was handy and a bag of treats. A huge bonus for us was the EV charging because we weren’t sure what we were going to do on that front and were pleasantly surprised to find that the destination charging in Oxford was a few steps from our parking space . The ferry to St Michael’s was super close and made for a nice way to shorten the drive over. I expect we will be back because the biking we planned to do was completely rained out but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay anyway."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed at Sandaway ten years ago and wanted to go back to the area for an end of summer getaway. The property was as special as remembered, and had the added upgrade of a covered charging area for e-bikes and EV charging area. Our room was spacious, clean, quiet & comfortable, with a screen porch and windows that offered fantastic views of the river and grounds - sunset/moonrise were beautiful! They have an extensive lawn area as well as small beach out front. Very easy to launch a kayak, SUP, or just enjoy a swim. Oxford is a charming town, easily walkable, with several restaurants, coffee shop, and park minutes from inn. Wide lanes throughout the area for cycling and numerous historical, nature sites, and shops will provide plenty to do. Ben, our host, was very prompt in all replies, thoroughly answered all of my questions, and accommodating with all requests. Highly recommend a stay at Sandaway!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pleased. Perfectly peaceful and Ben and Wendy’s crew were extremely helpful. Loved spending time on Sandaway’s property and walking and biking Oxford. We anticipate staying there next summer.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm so impressed with Sandaway Suites and Beach. It's obvious Ben takes pride not only in his immaculate, charming inn but in the community as well. Many little touches elevated my experience: Bayberry soap was a lovely contrast to the harsh soap often found in hotels; good binoculars to enhance the already fantastic view of the water from the large window; a tiny flashlight attached to the room key; the option of fresh flowers awaiting you in your room.
It's a perfect match of 19th century architecture, but 21st century amenities & communication. Our room was near the stunning weeping beech tree -- a must see if you stay here. The property is dotted with but not cluttered by places to sit and relax. Gorgeous sunset views, beautiful trees, peaceful atmosphere, private beach --- I wanted to extend my checkout to some time in September. Of 2024."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay. It was quiet and beautiful. The hosts were lovely. The small beach lets you get in the water right in front of you. We want to come back.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ben is a wonderful host, he answered all of my questions promptly prior to booking and he reached out to make sure that I didn’t have any issues or concerns upon arrival and during my stay. I never had any questions or concerns. His place was perfectly beautiful, immaculately clean, and so cozy. The grounds are beautiful as well and so welcoming. The only noise I ever heard was nature. So, so peaceful. I felt very safe in the area even when walking around after dark. I absolutely loved it there. The welcome bag upon arrival was so thoughtful and such a nice surprise. The proximity to places like St. Michaels, Easton, restaurants, the ferry, and shopping are extremely convenient. I highly recommend Ben’s place to anyone visiting the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful. Peaceful. Incredibly charming. Great attention to detail and incredibly thoughtful amenities like ice and bug spray.
Sandaway was a great base for exploring the area and the hosts provided awesome recommendations and resources.
I loved starting the day reading by the water with a cup of tea and ending the day watching the sunset over the water. Hope to be back next summer. My stay was amazing for a little R and R."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect. We may plan to come back in the future. I wish there was a paved path to the water front so I do not have to walk on the grass. Hard when you have balance and mobility issues,
Adam"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Inn had breathtaking landscaped views and a historic charm. The lawn was picturesque with comfortable chairs and kayaks for use. Coffee in the room was a plus and the bed was wonderful. Highly recommend for quiet get away! Just a 3 min walk to the oldest Tavern in America and a Full service ferry to Bellevue which is a 10 min drive to St. Micheal's downtown!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ben communicate well before, during & after our stay and was very accommodating. Very beautiful, quaint & quiet area . Thank you for a lovely stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sandaway has a distinct atmosphere of peace and serenity. The hosts are very gracious, and provided delightful amenities in addition to the standard coffee, such as a large packet of healthy snacks and a nice collection of teas from a local Maryland company. They also provided information on local attractions, shops and restaurants, as well as historical information regarding the estate and the general area. I was pleasantly surprised by the recyclable utensils and recycle bins were available in several locations. The ferry to St. Michaels is located near the entrance.
There was a power outage in the area near dusk one evening and they were quick to reach out to all guests to soothe any concerns they may have had.
The entire unit was very cozy, with a perfect view of the river and the bed was so comfortable that I had the best sleep I have had in years.
Truly a rare opportunity to relax, unwind, listen to the waves from the river and watch the fireflies at night."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place is really the primo spot in Oxford, at the top of the peninsula. Private grounds and beach, walkable shops and museums--a lovely day trip for those in the Baltimore-DC region. also advent to the ferry. A great find"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The property was lovely and the location was picture perfect. The view from the third floor loft was very nice although slightly obstructed. Ben is a great host and he checked in with us regularly. The town of Oxford is wonderful and in close proximity to Easton, St. Michael's, etc. Overall, a memorable vacation and a great place to stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely stay! Ben was super communicative with the whole check-in process and even after the stay when I messaged about a lost card, we got a response right away. The staff really does work 24/7 and responds to messages immediately.
Ben left a thorough description of how to check into our room and it was seamless even when we arrived after the sun had set. The staff also left a welcome bag on our door which I thought was a super nice touch and gesture!
Although the room is a little dated, it is so nice and spacious, the bed was comfy and it had all amenities a normal hotel would have. Aside from all that, the grounds are gorgeous. You get your own private beach and there are chairs to sit out on to sunbathe and enjoy the view. There are also bike and kayak rentals on the property. If you go near units 103 and 104, there are about 3 trees you can walk into the center of the group and one tree was planted in the 1800’s and was inducted into the tree hall of fame in 1991!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oh where to start! (This was a trip for my mom and her boyfriend) First, Ben is an amazing host. He is very responsive and gave excellent recommendations for activities to do in Oxford! Second, the place was beautiful!! Easy to check in and everyone around was so friendly! This is the perfect place to get away for a relaxing weekend☀️ 10/10 would recommend and now I may just have to go myself for a peaceful weekend🌷"

We are most grateful they provided the best weather ever to go along with a perfect view. We hope we have a reason to come back soon."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful property! Our room was very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed sitting out on the Adirondack chairs watching the sunsets and sailboats go by. The town of Oxford is tranquil and quaint. There are just enough restaurants within walking distance - cute coffee/pastry shop, waterfront pub-grub bar, great Italian. Host maintained excellent communication. We’ve stayed here before and will be back again. 10/10, ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location. Enjoyed my stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Serenity defined!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A splendid home, with amazing 19th century architecture. The water is so close, we sat on the Adirondack chairs and watched the stars over the water. It is a very quiet spot, and the perfect place to relax."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"the place was super nice! very clean, and the host was very responsive to any messages"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great quiet and safe location perfect for rest and relaxation. Ben was very responsive to questions and was a resource for things to do around the area. I visited earlier in the week so some places were closed or had limited hours prior to Wed/Thursday. There is a gift shop and a few restaurants within walking distance. St Michael’s is a neighboring town and was about a 30 minute drive or a short ferry ride to additional sight seeing, shops and restaurants. The inn was very quaint and clean. The quiet view on the water was a great way to start the morning or end the day with a sunset on the water. I really enjoyed the serenity of Sandaway and would recommend it to anyone seeking R& R."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Ben!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a retreat, close to DC. If you are looking for great views, some quiet, and a space to unplug this is the place! Ben is quick to respond any inquiries and will provide recommendations on things to do around. Bedroom was comfortable, as depicted in pictures and descriptions. Great spot from which to explore the region, look forward to going back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Small paradise, great views, privacy, decorated with great taste. Perfect place to relax. Only downside is that I had to work internet was too good :(.
Thanks Ben!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sandaway is a spectacular experience. You can't beat the views of sunsets over the Tred Avon, the lush lawns and landscaping, and the attention to detail in the inn. If you're going to Oxford, give the Sandaway a try, you'll not regret it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The grounds were very peaceful, with lots of Adirondacks to laze in and watch the water. My room was very comfortable and the host anticipated my needs well. This was a perfect place for a relaxing retreat."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay! Beautiful inn located right on the shore. Peaceful setting. Highly recommend staying here.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ben was the perfect host. Out time at the Sandaway provided everything we needed for a lovely respite. The beautiful views, serene setting, availability of good restaurants, wonderful areas for walking, and a great new museum - The Water's Edge on Mill Street - all contributed to the making of the perfect getaway."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place and host in a quant little town
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ben was great at communicating, giving local recommendations and just an all around great experience. Didnt meet him in person but felt like he truly cared about his guests and it was a very genuine. Highly recommend, beautiful, peaceful location not far from all you could want in terms of the charm of the Eastern shore"
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Ben was very communicative and accommodating. Many of the rooms have and entire room facing the water with furniture so that during rainy days you can still enjoy the room . Be sure to request this for your stay.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very lovely waterfront property in quaint town.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When you arrive you will be presented immediately with a waterfront view and the sound of gravel gently moving under your tires. The combination of the view and sound seems to melt away any stress you may have brought with you, especially when you see the stately home that you'll be staying in. Our room was in the main building, in the chandelier room. The room itself was spacious and included a separate room with an old-time clawfoot tub, and chandelier above. There was also a kitchenette with a Keurig machine, mini fridge and microwave. The main building is pretty much occupied with rooms and no interior common space, so it feels very private regardless of how many occupants are on site. We saw about six cars or so, but only exchanged greetings with a couple of guests. The building and grounds are immaculate and well-maintained. All of our needs were met with only introductory contact made through the booking. Five stars all around!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great. Really peaceful and incredible views from the window. Our host, Ben was very communicative. We loved our stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED this Inn! The location is perfect and our room was very clean and perfect for the two of us. The views are spectacular! All the seating available to enjoy the outside, the views and watch the locals sail boating on the bay was a real treat. We loved the quaintness of the town, super laid back and quiet & perfect for bike riding (next time we'll bring the bikes!). There was a restaurant right around the corner, Robert Morris and the food was spectacular. We also visited the town restaurant Pope's Tavern that offered homemade Italian food and that too was spectacular food and service. Saint Michael's is a short drive (about 25 mins) and was a real sweet town full of cute shops, eateries, brewery & some amazing wine that we brought home. This little town is full of history, very clean, well kept and the locals are very friendly. We highly recommend staying at this Inn on the Bay and visiting this cute little town."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"“Darling” is how I would describe Sandaway in Oxford and the surrounding areas. I love that you can relax on the premises with a beautiful view. Ben, our host, was very communicative, accommodating, and personable. I most certainly recommend this place to rest and unwind."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for a quiet getaway without kids.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place!

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Sandaway was a great stay as we visited Oxford and surrounding areas. We loved sitting out on the chairs and enjoyed the scenery, a great place for the sunsets. We were able to communicate with Ben without any issues and he was very quick to respond and answer any questions. We hope to visit again in the future."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Oxford is a wonderful place for a quiet, restful break. The Sandaway is a great old building in a beautiful setting overlooking the River and Bay. The spacious grounds are well kept and provide a great respite with relaxed seating and picnic tables readily available . Our room, the Waterview Loft, was thoroughly cleaned, well appointed and quite comfortable. The stairs between the 2nd and 3rd floor, that serve that room only, are a bit steep and may be challenging for anyone with mobility problems. My wife and I are in our mid-80s. Dragging the luggage up and down that flight was a bit of a challenge but the stairs were ok for us at other times. We certainly plan to return but we may spring for one of the other rooms that avoid those stairs and also have comfortable screened porches overlooking the water."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, clean place work beautiful private water views! Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay at Sandaway was amazing. The property is absolutely stunning Once you arrive on the property you are on vacation mode. The water views are to die for.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walkable to central historic district and sights. Beautiful apartment and great host, Enid was friendly and responsive. Would definitely stay again. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Enid’s apartment was perfect for us. We could walk to restaurants and live music. She also left us some provisions for our first morning knowing we were driving all day from Vermont. The WiFi was fast and there was lots of big comfortable spaces and furniture. We highly recommend staying at Enid’s when you come to Easton!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My recent stay at this Airbnb in historic Easton was amazing! From the moment I stepped in, I knew we were in a very special Airbnb. The apartment was immaculate, spacious and decorated beautifully. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the living room was the perfect place to relax after a day of sightseeing. The apartment was walkable to everything in downtown Easton and a short drive to St. Michaels, Cambridge and Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.
The kitchen had everything needed to make meals but we enjoyed the many restaurants within walking distance. Our favorites were Scossa, The Ward Room, Out of the Fire and Piazza Italian Market. We loved walking around town exploring the town’s history and local shops - don’t miss the Talbot Historical Society and its secluded garden.
Enid was a perfect host and was available for any questions we had. Check-in and out were easy. I look forward to returning to this lovely apartment in Easton someday soon!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was conveniently located in downtown Easton; particularly for Waterfowl Festival weekend, it was easily walkable to the venues. And, there was plenty of parking. The house itself was lovely, retaining many of its historic features (hopefully it stays that way). In terms of the amenities, the unit was spacious for two people; it had a living room, eat-in kitchen, bedroom, sitting room, and bathroom. It was also listed at reasonable price. Finally, Enid was friendly, communicative, and accommodating. We would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Carole is a wonderful hostess - thoughtful, generous, interested but not intrusive. Her home is comfortable and we enjoyed staying with her."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Carole was incredibly responsive and was there to greet me as promised. Her place was exactly as she described and the perfect place for me to stay overnight before I ran the St. Michaels half!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carol was a lovey host for our stay in Easton. She was friendly and immediately made us feel welcome in her home.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carole is a gracious and welcoming host. Her place is within a short walk of downtown restaurants and the Avalon theater.
If you are looking for an old school AirBNB where you meet your host and share a space, stay with Carole. If you are looking for a spa experience, this isn't the right place for you. I would stay with her again, and hope to do so next time I'm in town for a show."
2024-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable stay for bike ride in Cambridge."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Carole is a lovely host and we enjoyed chatting with her. The room was very cosy.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Once again we stayed at Phoebe and OC's place for The Bay Bridge 10k. We were welcomed in and everything was as described. OC waited for us at the door when we came back from dinner and he followed us upstairs where he checked the bedroom out. He insisted on being petted before he left. He came back several more times to be petted. It's okay since he was purring loudly. Phoebe kept to herself. Phoebe and OC's servent, Carol, was also very helpful. :-) She was very accommodating. We will be back again for next year's race.
Thanks again for the great stay. We were comfortable and got the sleep we needed."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carole is a great hostess. I have stayed with her before and have been throughly delighted. I love her two cats.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carole was a great host, very responsive, conversant and made room in her fridge for my food. Her place was perfect for my needs which was just a place to crash over night when I was in town for work. I'd highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carole made us feel very welcome in her comfortable home. It was extremely convenient because we attended wedding at Tidewater Inn. We would definitely stay there again if we’re in Easton area.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We needed a place in Easton for the night and this was just perfect. Not far from downtown area / Rt 50 both. Comfortable bed and very helpful host. I would book again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Carole was extremely nice and her place was perfect for what we needed. Within walking distance to downtown Easton. Perfect if you are going to a wedding in the area and do not want to pay the high prices for the Tidewater Inn. Cat's are super cute as well. :)
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a very homey room centrally located in Easton, MD. Carole (and her two cats) were so very friendly and hospitable. I was looking for a good night's sleep and easy proximity to an early start the next morning for the 'Tour de Talbot' bike ride and this provided both of these things in spades! A bonus of the quiet and comfortable night's sleep was waking up to birdsong!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Carol was a very accommodating host and her place was clean and comfortable.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Carole was great! She was very welcoming and hanging out with her was an absolute pleasure!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Carole was a terrific host and I enjoyed staying at her house.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carole was ready to let me into the home and show me to the bedroom and dedicated bathroom (in the hallway), which was exactly as described. I found the bed to be comfortable and the spaces to be clean. The bedroom is right across from the host's so there isn't a lot of privacy unless you are in the room, but this was as described and very adequate for a short stay. I needed to get sleep to wake up early for a race in St. Michaels, so we didn't have the opportunity to converse. Carole was very quiet but there was a little talking outside the townhouse as I was getting ready to sleep and the cats were a little active at night. I highly recommend for anyone coming in for a race."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Carole was a friendly and accommodating host and we enjoyed speaking with her. Her place is close to Easton downtown but in a residential area. Very comfortable bed and nicely decorated room. The bathroom is across the hall. She is fine with sharing the kitchen. Lovely AirBnB.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carole is one cool lady!
I enjoyed spending at her neat, tidy home, and we had great conversation. She was welcoming and helpful, and the location was very relaxing close to the trail for a walk."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carole's place was exactly what I was looking for: a quiet room to spend a night in Easton. The bed was comfortable and I appreciated having a private bathroom. The bedroom doesn't have much extra space, so it's not a place I'd recommend spending a lot of time in except for sleeping, but that's perfectly fine, because Easton is a lovely town to get out and about in; the quaint downtown is a relaxing 10 minute walk.
I was grateful for Carole's hospitality, and would recommend her place for anyone coming to the area."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Clean, convenient and comfortable"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This may have been the best host we've ever had. When our alarm went off at 5 AM he was outside our door meowing. We left him in and invited him on the bed. After a little petting he began purring and never stopped. Highly recommended.
Oh yeah, Carole was pretty awesome as well. :-)"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I stayed at Carole’s before the half marathon in the St. Michael’s running festival.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Carole's home is a lovely place to stay in Easton. She is very nice and accommodating, and the apartment is very clean and nicely decorated. My only complaints are pretty minor - the bedroom is a bit too small and there is no independent control of the heating/cooling system, but these are minor, especially because the price is very reasonable. I recommend Carol's place!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carole was a wonderful host! She met at us check in and gave us an informative tour of her home. She made us feel like friends coming to stay for the weekend. The location was better than we expected to the sea glass festival we went too. It was a very nice little town that was close to everything we needed. She was very helpful on the best restaurants to visit and gave excellent directions. The bed was comfortable and the private bathroom was perfect for our needs.

Would definitely stay again!

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,As billed a nice place to stay
2021-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I didn't stay, as the situation was not right for me; room too small, no place to sit, bed too high to get up/down comfortably (without a step), no drawer space provided in the chest (though I made some for myself), not enough light for reading, no TV, host's loud phone conversations carried upstairs easily. Location, though, is convenient, room and bathroom were spotless and host was cordial -- until afterwards, when she made a big deal of the fact I'd left without telling her what the issues were (I didn't want to insult her, so just said I had to return home) and I left the space as I'd found it. Subsequently she was quite critical of me, which I thought was rather odd and uncalled for. I did not ask for a refund, nor was I going to, but she provided one, anyway. There are many positive reviews, so it's obviously fine for others who perhaps don't plan to spend much time in the room."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is an excellent place to stay, with a gracious host, a comfortable bed, and a nice private bath. I would recommend it for anyone and certainly stay there again."

When you stay her, be sure to take advantage of RiseUp coffee just down the street!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carole is a relaxed and friendly hostess, laid back but efficient; she responded quickly and effectively to my questions and even kindly advised of certain conditions that might have affected my stay in the area (with Bay Bridge). The townhouse is charmingly and interestingly decorated with various artwork and crafts and the two cats added friendly liveliness. The bedroom, though small, had a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was well stocked with towels and toiletries, had a great shower and more fun artwork. The location is very convenient for exploration of the area."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carole is a great hostess plus I love cats so that was a plus.
15-20 minute walk to town center good for the stamina :-)"

Carole’s place is centrally located and not too far from St Michael’s."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carole was very accommodating and flexible. She had plenty of linens and essentials to make your stay close to being like home.
Her kitties were nice too and came to check out the new person in the house, but kept to themselves unless you wanted to give them attention. I love cats, but for the people who may not be cat people, I think you could enjoy your stay here just as well.
There are many things within a close driving distance, but her place is located in a quite road."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Carole was such a welcoming host and we were happy with our stay there. The bed was comfortable and her place was easy to find. All was as advertised.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Good place to stay for saving some money!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is as advertised. What you don't see is the woman behind the room. Carole is attentive and easy going. She kept in touch with me while I was en route. I went to Easton to fill a bucket list item and participate in Plein Air Easton. I had read about previous years and how the heat wore people down. We paint outside all day. I came, I painted and another item was checked off the list. The bed? Pretty darn comfortable at the end of a long day. Security? Parked my art supply car out front and no issues. Easton is hard to visualize when reading about it. Carole's place is just minutes from downtown. You also have an easy ride down to St. Michaels and/or Oxford. Planning a weekend, make it a long one. There is much to do from the charming home base. I would gladly stay here again."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carole was such a sweet and accommodating host, with lovely cats and located so perfectly 10-15 min walking into the center of Easton. Clean, simple, and very nice talking to Carole. Can only recommend!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely place to stay in the heart of Easton. You have your own private bedroom, everything is clean and quiet, and Carole is easy to communicate with. She does not have a wifi connection for you, so you'll have to use an internet hotspot if your cell phone won't suffice. I highly recommend Carole and her place!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carole's place was just as described. She provides a nicely decorated, clean room with a comfy bed and a private, clean bathroom. I don't know the area but it seems centrally located. Carole is warm and welcoming as are OC and Phoebe, her two cats. I'm sure she is a wealth of knowledge of the area but I was there for a wedding so had no need of taking advantage of that."
2021-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Carol's place is located just a few minutes walk from the charming homes, shops and eateries in enjoyable Easton. While I might not describe the Airbnb guest bedroom and overall townhome as spacious, there is an openness of heart and hearth that more than makes up for any spacial limitations. Carol allows full use of kitchen, utensils and even offers her own food...though it is her home, she makes you feel like family. In the evening we shared great conversation and the company of her two affectionate cats."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very thoughtfully done airBNB. Excellent location (we were there during the week & the boatyard was not noisy). Since it’s an older home the downstairs was chilly when the upstairs was warm. There is a somewhat windy staircase with a narrow upstairs hallway so if you have a bigger build, have mobility or serious balance issues we would not recommend but the home was welcoming, accurately described & functional."

We had a nice time there meeting many friendly people.
Irmina and Alain were very welcoming and they checked in to see how our vacation was going. She even asked if there was anything we needed to make our stay better.
We had most of our meals in and the kitchen was nicely equipped. There was plenty of room for meal preparation.
Saint Michaels is a lovely town and the surrounding area is equally beautiful. We would definitely stay at Irmina & Alain's home again.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was so lovely to stay here! The place was very clean, organized, and the notes were all very helpful. The place didn't get as warm as my wife would have liked, but that seems to most likely be due to the age of the house. The hosts provided space heaters to combat this problem.

House was as advertised, old and a little quirky but super clean and had an updated bathroom. Kitchen was well appointed. I slept in master bedroom and bed was comfortable. It was too cold to use the screened porch the weekend I went, but I could see why other reviewers enjoyed it. The only suggestion that I made to the owners was to add more seating in the living room, as there is just a single love seat."

We’ll definitely visit again."

Highly recommend!"

Beds are comfortable! Helpful nightlight placement. Overall a wonderful stay and we look forward to returning!!!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little Anchor cottage is an excellent place to stay while visiting St. Michael’s, MD. The location is excellent being close to all the shops and restaurants along Talbot Street and just a few short steps away from the marina and additional waterside restaurants.
Irmina and Alain are great hosts! Their communication made everything so easy. When I reached out to them to ask a couple of questions, they responded immediately. They reached out to us a couple of times during our 4 day, 3 night stay to make sure we had everything we needed and that there were no problems at all.
The cottage was immaculate when we checked in and stocked with essential items like soaps, paper products, cooking items and utensils. And as if that wasn’t enough, there were very nice beverages in the refrigerator and a wonderful basket containing a a bottle of wine and several snacks!
If you are thinking about staying in St. Michael’s, look no further than The Little Anchor. You will be very satisfied!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful place to relax and to work, if you so choose. Super-clean, with very fast WiFi.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Little Anchor cottage might be my favorite Airbnb spot. First, the location to the wonderful town could not be better. It’s right off the main street, close to the waterfront and on a quiet little side street pocket. Walking to bars and restaurants is simple and fun and oarking is easy on the side of the house.
The house itself has so many great touches including a snack basket, good coffee bar, filtered water in the kitchen and anything you need to cook. The main bedroom was spacious with great linens, towels and a super comfy bed. There were nice touches everywhere and the bathroom and shower were excellent.
I can’t recommend this house and this town strongly enough. Add in perfect support from Irmina and Alain and this stay was memorable and so very comfortable. Book it when you can and you will not be disappointed."

The location is fantastic and centrally located to everything in town. Thanks to the wonderful hosts for making everything great.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Irmina & Alain were exceptional hosts, response time was great and the small touches were appreciated. The homes in St. Michael’s are all “vintage” and this one is no exception. There are signs of its age but the house has been nicely renovated and the bathroom is especially lovely. All of the rooms are a great size although we spent most of our time on the porch or walking the town. The location is great and there are many restaurants to enjoy if you don’t want to cook. The kitchen was well stocked with new pots, pans and spices. We would definitely stay again."

We are already planning our trip for next year!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Courtney is amazing, and was alway responsive to our questions. She has gone above and behind to help us during our stay."

The home was recently updated, it was clean and uncluttered. We'd love to visit again in the future!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is lovely - spacious, calm, pristine. And the setting! The back of the house looks out on a gorgeous pond. Absolutely lovely. We were sorry we couldn't stay another day!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Courtney’s home was so beautiful! It was better than expected, and made this part of our trip that much better. The home was so comfortable, the game room was a lot of fun, and she provided extra items; welcome basket with chips and wine, waters and fruit. The outside was stunning, the property has a larger pond and it was so peaceful. It was a dream to go out in the morning and spend time outdoors. Courtney was super responsive, and just wonderful to deal with. So thankful for this experience and we can’t wait to come back. Absolutely would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Courtney was great! We were only there for two nights but I wish we stayed longer. St Michael’s is about 15 min away so there is a lot to do.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was absolutely fantastic! It was exactly what we were looking for. Courtney was very responsive and helpful and even had a welcome note with snacks available for us when we arrived. We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to the Eastern Shore!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Terrific stay! My parents, my daughters (5 & 1), and I stayed here while visiting family. The location was convenient, beautiful, and so peaceful and quiet.

There were so many thoughtful touches – from a pack'n'play for my little one (already set up when we got there!) to coffee and filters for the morning to snacks to enjoy. We truly enjoyed our stay. If we return, we'll definitely stay here again! Thank you, Courtney, for such a relaxing, wonderful stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay for a ladies weekend! Even though we all live fairly close, it felt like a nice peaceful getaway. The house is gorgeous, clean, and well put together, the view is beautiful, and Courtney was great to work with. She reached out prior to checkin with instructions, and the morning after we checked in to see if we needed anything. She had a basket of goodies waiting for us and we felt right at home the second we walked in. About a 20 minute drive to St. Michaels and 10 to downtown Easton, felt like the perfect distance to be able to explore and go out to dinner, but then go back to the place for some downtime and relaxation. Loved the area and would definitely recommend this place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Courtney’s home was absolutely beautiful, and we felt so at home there during our trip. And Courtney was an incredible host, so friendly, accommodating, and responsive. We had a wonderful time on our trip and having such comfortable accommodations made a huge impact. 10/10 recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Courtney’s place was great. It’s a spacious one level with a fresh remodel. It’s very private and peaceful. It feels remote, though it’s just a few minute drive to downtown Easton which was where we spent most of our time. We drove to St Michael’s twice and it’s a pleasant and quick trip, 10-15 minutes I believe.
There were lots of nice touches when we arrived at Courtney’s. Bottled waters by the bed. Welcome snacks and coffee in kitchen. Large smart TV’s in bedrooms and living room. Fast wifi. Towels and bedding was all new. Shower had good pressure. AC kept us cool.
Though I think our favorite feature was actually the pond out back. Just mesmerizing to watch in the mornings over coffee. Lots of squirrels, birds, ducks, and even turtles out there being cute living their best life. Very relaxing and a welcome respite after long traveling day from the west coast.
Great value, and so much better than a hotel imo.
It’s exactly as photos show. We enjoyed our stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Courtney was an amazing host. There were little touches everywhere that showed her consideration for us getting into town. A lovely welcome basket, extra necessities, such as laundry detergent, and bug spray, and amazing beverages to enjoy, greater us. The beds, linens and towels as well as the bath products were great. Thanks again for being an amazing host!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at this cozy home. The space is so comfortable and you can walk around the town of Trappe to see some beautiful restored homes.

2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Jefferson's was wonderfully responsive to a small issue that came up; we really appreciated how he came right over with a solution. Otherwise, a very pleasant, clean and comfortable house -- just seemed a little isolated from attractions but that was probably mostly due to our visiting in mid-January!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was just as described in the listing, roomy and clean. Perfect for our stay of a couple days. Thank you !!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Calway Inn was a great getaway, me and my girlfriend spent the holiday and it was a great place, quiet neighborhood, and had plenty of room with a big kitchen.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second stay here & it has been exactly what I needed both times. Very spacious & clean. I stayed here for work both times so unfortunately cannot speak about local attractions, etc. Jefferson is extremely helpful & easy to reach anytime there are any questions. I will stay again for sure! Only thing ""missing"" is a full-length mirror! Oh - and the parking is great if you have more than one vehicle! You will not be disappointed!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute and quaint home in Trappe that was perfect for a quiet weekend away. Walking distance to a local coffee shop and restaurant. The location made it easy for us to explore neighboring towns in both directions. Jefferson was very responsive and gave clear instructions.
While it didn't bother us or cause any issues, just noting that there is an upstairs tenant so something to keep in mind when booking."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jefferson was an extraordinary host. His place was just as pictured - comfortable, accommodating, spacious...a very sweet home. He was very responsive at all times, including when I woke up very sick on my last day and requested a later check-out. He kindly offered a generous late check-out. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend his place to anyone interested."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy place to find and enjoy. Jefferson was helpful before, during and after!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"A clean and comfortable rental. The host was responsive to our needs. When we noticed that no facecloths were provided, he dropped some off just a few hours later. We occasionally heard the upstairs tenant, mostly when they arrived or departed, which sometimes was early in the morning. Since Trappe is a very small town, it was wonderful that the rental is just a short walk to two very good restaurants: The Coffee Trappe for breakfast and lunch and Momma Maria's for happy hour and dinner. A third eatery is coming soon next to The Coffee Trappe."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Jefferson’s place, I highly recommend it. Felt very comfortable.! A very clean place and peaceful. Jefferson was also a great host."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a perfect place to stay with my family and our dogs while we were in town for a wedding.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jefferson was very responsive and flexible. He got right back to me regarding the internet ( which was just briefly down) . Trappe is very small and everyone was very friendly. Great to have an Airbnb like Calway!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house. It was very close to where we would do our activities, the area was safe and quiet. We would definitely stay there again"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"We were a bit surprised to find excessive stains on one couch, and a lot of noise late at night from the upstairs neighbor. Given the excellent reviews previously, hopefully our experience was a fluke. Our dog loved the big backyard and the host was incredibly responsive."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very comfortable and great stay; it was one of the most well-stocked and prepared Airbnb I have stayed in, the hosts thought of everything. The place was as pictured, great bedrooms, clean living spaces, awesome front porch. You are situated right in town, so there is a fair amount going on around you, but the house felt peaceful.
There was coffee waiting for you, and all amenities you could want. Thank you, would recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay all around. Definitely recommend
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just off the beaten path and spacious for family or small group of travelers. Convenient to Route 50 for exploring communities to both north and south. Walking to breakfast around the corner to the Coffee Trappe is a must. Really enjoyed sitting out on porch in the evening.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay for the most part. The house was a little strange smelling, but we got used to it. Very clean except for a bit of pet hair in one bed and a little on the living room furniture. But it was listed as pet friendly, so suppose some of that can be expected. No wash cloths in the bathroom, but plenty of towels. The house was clean and clutter free. Our children loved the bunk bed and hammocks. Had read in previous reviews about no window coverings. But thankfully there were curtains or shades at most of the windows, so we didnt feel like we were staying in a fishbowl. We felt like we had the necessary privacy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All good. Recommend to anyone who needs to be in Easton, Cambridge or Salisbury or anywhere Mid-shore."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice home with beautiful porch and backyard. I needed to be in the area for family and Jefferson’s place worked perfectly! I needed help an overhead fan and Jefferson was there in less than 5 minutes to help out and resolve for me. Nice guy!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jefferson's house was totally what we expected. The pictures in the site show exactly what you are renting. No matter when you tried to get in touch with Jefferson, he always got right back to you. He gave us suggestions about where to go for activities and restaurants. The house was spotless, and we felt totally safe there. I would rent this house again when we return to Maryland."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was very clean and comfortable!
2023-07-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Handy for our needs. Everything was fine, but no cleaning fluids or cloths so we had to buy some. No mirror other than in the bathroom. Nice and cool."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jefferson is a wonderful host and the house was absolutely lovely. Highly recommend for a peaceful getaway.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home is beautiful. Well appointed with most everything we needed. I saw another review that said the property looked bigger in person than in pictures and they could not have been more right. We would definitely rent this again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I am slow to give 5 stars….but this place….5 stars. My family wanted to get off the grid, be in a quiet place and spend some time together. The location is quiet, but 10 minute drive north or south can get you anything you might be looking for. The crabs by the bridge were the BEST crabs in MD we have had. The backyard is amazing for the kids. The porch is its own oasis that you would enjoy. Take a walk and enjoy the beauty of the scenery. In all of my stays, this is the top of my list. My family enjoyed this place and location. It was stocked with all of the coffee you would need. The “just leave everything we will take care of it” messages back every time I asked for something was amazing. Again, 5 stars."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jefferson and Jonathan were great to work with. They are very proactive with their communications and set the expectations perfectly. The day of checkout was a breeze - thank you for not putting a huge burden on your customers the day of checkout! It was a stress-free stay and we’ll be back again next year
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Loved the house and location! Perfect for a work trip!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at the Calway Inn definitely met our expectations! We wanted to explore different areas and we chose this listing because it was centrally located and not too far of a drive to visiting Cambridge, Easton, Kent Island and St. Michaels! Additionally, the house was extremely clean and it was enjoyable to be in! Jefferson was extremely informative and very responsive!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Location was great for what we were, the host answered our questions within minutes. I would return."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was very cozy and very spacious. The front porch was great and the big back yard was perfect for our dog. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What great luck to find this place- we needed to be in the area for a local church service we wanted to attend. Figured this would be just a place to crash - but it turned into a pop up vacation fun time! The front porch is like another room, we enjoyed everything here inside and out. Trappe is lovely, many other areas of interest but just enjoying the house was peaceful and a much needed retreat. Squeaky clean, comfortable relaxation in the midst of a small town- can’t wait to come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay in Trappe! Plenty of room, and nothing unexpected. We enjoyed having a house right in town, as there aren’t many vacation rentals in Trappe."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, spacious with wonderful yard for my dogs. The host was very responsive offered to stay longer our last day as there were no other guests after us."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a great spot. I work from home 24/7 in a city, so a change of scenery for me + a yard for my dog was needed! This was the perfect spot between Easton and Cambridge to escape for a few days! Highly recommend!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jefferson’s place was just as advertised! We enjoyed the cozy fireplace, kitchen amenities and easy check-in. Jefferson was a great host - very responsive, helpful and friendly!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our getaway to the Calway Inn. The hosts were very considerate with their communication and had equipped the house with everything needed to have a cozy weekend getaway!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really loved this place. The host was super accommodating. I have traveled to a lot of air bnbs through my photo work, and I was impressed with the overall communication and friendliness. The place was beautiful. My friends and had a fun time playing video games and cooking food for one another for a mini getaway"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A decently-restored older home that's clean and well-appointed. Everything was easy to find, operate, and worked as intended.
Only two issues keeping it from being 5 stars, but they're big ones.
First, it's described as a whole home. It is not. There is a renter living on the second floor. He enters from a separate entrance, so you won't interact with him, but he's there. My girlfriend is a professional brass musician, so we use AirBnB homes to avoid bothering others when warming up on travel to concerts, and we rely on accurate descriptions. Just be aware, in case this matters to you. For others, it wouldn't matter. He was quiet up there.
Second, there were no curtains anywhere in the home, not even the bathroom or bedroom. We hung some sheets over those windows for the duration of our stay, but this is basic stuff that needs to be in the home before being rented. I imagine this will be fixed in short order, though.
Otherwise, a nice home, and a good place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Close to the waterfowl festival and close to downtown. Clean and comfortable.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We love this place, Kyle does a fantastic job."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Kyle's place was wonderful for our group. A sprawling, spacious ranch-style home with four large bedrooms, very nice large kitchen and dining room, spotless bathrooms, and comfortable areas to hang out and gather (living room with lots of games and movies and a sun porch overlooking the backyard and picnic tables outside---perfect for a crab feast or barbecue.) The whole house was super clean. We highly recommend this home and we would stay there again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, roomy and clean."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the place. Huge - lots of room to spread out and not be under each other's feet. Hosts were extremely responsive to a problem with the air conditioner, which was great because we were in the middle of a nasty heat wave. An added bonus were the chickens. My husband was enthralled and I think the chickens kept calling his name to come out and play!!!
If we ever need a place in Easton again, you will be the only call we'll make!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place-had everything that was needed and then some.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kyle is a terrific host who stayed in touch and responded to our questions right away.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home in Easton was a great find! Host Kyle was communicative from the start and throughout our stay and he answered all of my questions promptly. I knew from the photos and property description that the house had nearly everything that we needed, but we were pleasantly surprised with all of the amenities. The house is spotless! The bedrooms are large and the kitchen is well-appointed and has everything you need. If any toiletries are forgotten, Kyle has you covered. He also left a comprehensive list of places for breakfast, lunch and dinner, places of worship, and locations for medical emergency care. We checked-out three of the locations (Legal Assets, t at the General Store, and Breakfast in Easton) and all were amazing! The location is just a couple of miles from Downtown Easton and less than a 30-minute drive to St. Michael's, Oxford and Cambridge. If you are staying in Easton, my wife and I highly recommend this home."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My three college roommates and I had an amazing stay at Kyle‘s place in Easton Maryland. We were celebrating 50 years of friendship, and the four bedrooms was a great layout for us. The kitchen was spacious and very well equipped. Kyle shared snacks, beverages, and kitchen essentials which made it very easy for meal prep.
It was fun to see the chickens, and the rooster never crude until after 8 o’clock. We walked around the back and found neighboring animals such as goats, sheep, peacocks and even donkeys!
The selection of DVDs and variety of shows through the Apple TV were a plus! We were only about 10 minute drive from downtown Easton and enjoy the shops and restaurants there. We had a great massage at Foremost Massage, and also enjoyed their salt cave. We did dinner out at Tidewater Inn. We also like the vicinity to nearby Cambridge, home of the Harriet Tubman national park.
Kyle was extremely responsive to any questions we had and helped us resolve any issues."

The house was as advertised: spacious, clean, and fully equipped. I'll rent again when I'm back that way and recommend others do the same. Thanks Kyle!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,House had plenty of room and was a great stay for all of my guest. I visit Easton every year and hope I will be able to stay here for now on. Highly recommend.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the best equipped Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Very throughout and incredibly clean. Would highly recommend this as a place to stay on the Eastern Shore!
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Great house. Ranch style, just a few steps to get in the house. Fit everyone very comfortably. Card games galore. Plenty of movies, we just didn’t have the time to explore that. Having 3 full bathrooms was amazing. Plenty of technology to keep all of your items charged!! Directions are so accurate- you just might miss it the first time by. Plenty of partying. Would stay again, definitely."
