I will be in Ada again in the future and if her place is available it will be my first choice!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lara is an absolute gem and her place was extremely relaxing! Even though it's part of the house you feel like you're in your own little bubble with your own entrance. Lara provided a mini fridge/freezer, microwave, and coffee pot and some fun food treats, ice (huge huge bonus!), and flavored coffee. I had a fun towel animal to greet me on my arrival and having my own bathroom was great. You get well worth your money here and Lara was great!

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,This place was amazing! We stayed there with six people and we still couldn’t believe how big this house really was. It was really a beautiful house and d neighborhood with plenty to do around town. The only con I saw in this was the master bedroom shower being a rain fall shower and not a traditional shower head but other than that all of the bathrooms were amazing. I would 100% recommend this to anyone just trying to get away for a while and relax.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a great time staying at this beautiful home...so interesting!
We had a party of 10, so privacy, particulary with the bathrooms, was a little challenging, however, we would visit again. The hosts were so gracious & provided a fire pit for us to enjoy our s'mores..very quick response!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was a very interesting find with more than enough space to accomodate our family of five.
Located in a nice neighborhood close enough to the city of Ada as well as the bypass allowed us to get everywhere we needed to go.
We very much enjoyed our stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,This place was a beautiful historic home - from the many secret rooms to the creaky floors. The whole family enjoyed looking at and reading all the museum-like decor and wall hangings. Like a transport through time to another era yet the kitchen and bathrooms were updated and current. A wonderful mixture of both old and new. Beds were great. Lots of pillows. Soft sheets. Great TV room with bar for the whole family to relax and watch a movie. We loved this place and would definitely like to stay again next Christmas. Thanks for sharing it with us!
2023-12-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Plenty of room and nice appliances. Would not stay again due to pipe bursting, leaking through electrical light fixtures, not a smooth check in, house rules threaten extra charges for “excessive” laundry while charging for house cleaning already. House was dusty. Folded blankets were dirty. Cats everywhere outside. Advertise piano that is broken."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, good location, and wonderful hosts. They were very responsive and friendly when we had questions, the home had everything we needed for the weekend, and plenty of space for the family. Would definitely stay here again next time we travel to town."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful historic mansion! Our daughter was getting married and this was the perfect place to get ready in the master suite.

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"This house was an amazing house to stay in! We brought my mom, whose on hospice, to spend her ""last wish"" trip to visit her sister one last time before she passes away and we had an amazing time spending time at the house with lots of family. We definitely made lasting memories there. Thank David and Oriana for everything!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"David & Oriana’s place was amazing. So spacious and clean. The bed was great. This is located in one of the best neighborhoods in Ada, Oklahoma.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Will stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stayed here with my partner and our two dogs for about a week. The house is beautiful and cozy, and we loved the large kitchen with lots of counter space.
It’s very close to lots of things: parks, grocery stores, coffee shops, etc. The neighborhood is quiet, and the courtyard is so peaceful.
The front yard is fenced, which we really appreciated for our dogs. Our smaller dog could get through the bars of the fence, so we kept her leashed when we went outside.
We really enjoyed our evenings in the comfortable TV room and found many convenient places throughout the house to set up the laptops and get work done.
There was so much space we didn’t use since it was just the two of us, but we’d love to return someday and bring more family next time! I definitely recommend this stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was delightful, our hosts could not have been more kind & considerate. We enjoyed every aspect of this beautiful home, especially morning coffee while nestled in the cozy solitude near the fountain. We especially enjoyed learning the history of the home & we look forward to another visit!
The recommendation to the Nutrition Mission shop was just what we needed for a boost of health & energy to get our days started!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you love history, you will love David & Oriana house. The trim work and doors were amazing. The beams and wooden floors were so special. I loved the speak easy story. I grew up in Ada and enjoyed seeing the inside of this lovely home."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place has ALL the space, and the home is super cool. Little nooks and crannies everywhere full of character, and each bedroom has an adjoining bathroom. There is a comfortable tv room, a nice fenced in yard, gorgeous back deck for porch sitting, and an incredible sitting room for unwinding. We would definitely stay here again. Hosts were rapidly responsive and helpful, and occasionally checked in to make sure we didn’t need anything. Wonderful visit!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great historic home with lots of character. Lots of space for the family to spread out when they wanted to, and the fact that our dog could stay also was a great bonus!"
2022-05-01,4,Group trip,"Nice historic home, very spacious and clean. We had everything we needed during our stay. David and Oriana were very communicative and helpful. Our only problem was that the mattresses were worn/lumpy so we didn’t sleep well. Other than that, our stay was great!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Will be back absoutley wonderful place to stay. Our family truly enjoyed every moment.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is such a cool house! Everything was clean, and just as described. Would highly recommend!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Hosts are fantastic, gracious with solid communication. I appreciate that since travel is, well travel.
They have an incredibly unique home. I was excited to see it as the trip was upcoming. It’s a mix of gorgeous century old tiles and arches along with newer remodeling. I am not even scratching the surface on all of the neat things about this place.
Reading reviews prior to coming I brought my professional camera and had fun on my down time taking pictures of the house, the stars and all the new ducklings at the nearby park.
My favorite place, is the upstairs tiled shower because you can sing so acoustically. The rain shower is great modern touch and wonderful.
I was primarily upstairs, here for work and wasn’t in all of the house but knew full well this is a great place to bring family and friends, big yard, back patio, grill etc!
Getting in late on an extended stay, it was very nice to have things available until I could get sorted.
Beautiful people, David and Oriana.
Recommend!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time staying at this place! Such a unique place and our kids loved exploring all throughout the house. Neat history and we loved that our dogs could come along with us. The yard is great and the fence made us feel extra safe with having our dogs with us. It was very comfortable and plenty of room with our family of 4 + 3 pups! We will definitely be back!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I really can go on and on how wonderfully unique this house was, it was like an adventure getting to explore it. I loved how the modern was juxtaposed with the original elements of the home. But it was also practical in its setup, making it livable rather than just pretty. The hosts have done an amazing job with the house. It’s an absolutely wonderful place to stay!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! We enjoyed our stay. Thank you David for being a great host. We are already planning our return trip.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were blown away by David’s beautiful home and his hospitality during our stay. We happened to be caught in a snowstorm in Ada and David thoughtfully reached out to make sure we had transportation and the supplies we needed. His home is spectacular, in a great location and is certainly a place we would recommend to family and friends. Two thumbs up!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hi David, I wanted to say thanks again. You have a really interesting house and we enjoyed the “personality” of both the house and all the decorative items that help us become familiar with our host, even if we don’t get to meet."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If there were places like this in every town, I’d never stay in a hotel again. I’m a realtor and I intentionally travel to unique places to share the experience and encourage others to as well. This one takes the cake! It’s bursting with history and mystery but cozy and charming and boasts every modern amenity. The hosts are wonderful people. Great communication. The property is in a perfect location. We Doordashed food and craft coffees from a number of wonderful options because we were so enjoying the space. We grilled out on the nice new deck. We enjoyed the fireplace each evening. The dogs had plenty of safe space to play. We did take them to the dog park and walked around the beautiful pond at Wintersmith. I’d encourage you to do so too or walk the neighborhood at least.
If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. If you’re thinking for one minute about booking a stay here, the thinking is over! Do it!
If you’re looking for stuff to do, check out nearby Sulphur, Davis or Pauls Valley, OK. Many Indian history experiences, 77’ waterfall at Turner Falls, zip lines, Arbuckle drive through wilderness a great state park lake, etc. So much to do and see!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,We had a great stay at this house. We have stayed over in over 50 Airbnb's and this was one of our favorites. This place had such awesome personality and amazing architecture. We loved the way it was decorated and it felt very homey. There was plenty of space and parking. The kitchen had great kitchenware too. David was an awesome host and was very responsive and easy to work with. I would highly recommend this place! We look forward to coming back to this really cool spot!
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Huge home with awesome architectural features!! My husband loves places that are unique and interesting and this was a birthday surprise for him. He loved exploring all the spaces and the interesting and diverse decor. My dogs also loved exploring with us!! So thankful for wonderful places such as this that also allow pets! Thanks again, David!"
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,"What a neat place! And David, the host, is an amazing guy."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Such a great place to stay. David was very quick with his responses and was very helpful during my time. I highly recommend choosing this place when your passing thru!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay during a family reunion in town! We needed a nearby place that allowed us to have separate rooms for family. While it is a historic home it was very clean which we greatly appreciated. That always makes a stay more comfortable. And the character to the home is unique. You can tell the owners are working on updates and renovations in areas and I can see it’s growing potential!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,As advertised! The house was perfect for our stay for Mothers Day weekend. We all felt comfortable and secure. We will definitely stay here again when in the area. Highly recommended by our family.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay with Craig. It is very well equipped and worked well for us. Craig is literally next door if there is an issue. But given that everything has been updated, don't expect any problems."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent

Craig was very pleasant and made check in and check out a breeze. We stayed during the week of 4th of July. Craig stopped by on the morning of the 4th and placed a beautiful American flag on the front porch, which was a nice touch of patriotism. This will be the only place I will be staying next time I visit Ada. Can’t wait to come back."

Comfy beds & couches, fully stocked kitchen, great yard. Looked just like the pictures. Even the potted plants on the front porch were thriving!
This house is a prime location in Ada. It backs up to the Country Club, and is just down the street from retail & restaurants. We also enjoyed the close proximity to Wintersmith Park and took advantage of the playgrounds, swings, community pool & water slides. My kids were attending a summer program at the university, and it was an easy drive there as well.
Great Airbnb experience with gracious, hospitable hosts. I’ll definitely book here the next time we are in Ada!"

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The place is amazing as well as the owners we were there for a funeral and needed lots of rooms for our family.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adam was a great host. Anytime we needed anything, he quickly responded. It is nice to have the host on site. He let us use the gator to go to the creek. The kids had a blast looking for fossils. There was no washer and dryer but when we needed clean towels, Adam brought them and took the dirty ones to wash. He was very attentive. The facility is beautiful. A lot of work has been put into the facility. The pool was great and clean. I would recommend this facility to others."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Adam and Linda are unfalteringly missional about hospitality. They did a very quick cleaning turnaround to accommodate our booking that began as a party of 11 plus one dog, and allowed us to add three more people and a second dog before check-in day. Adam’s communication was excellent throughout the booking and pre-arrival process, and both he and Linda were very gracious during our stay, making themselves available but never intrusive. We stayed over Independence Day, and they even set up a safe area for us to shoot off fireworks and checked in mid afternoon to make sure we had everything we needed to celebrate. We enjoyed one afternoon of heavy rain, during which Adam made the trek outside to let us know that one of our cars had an open window. They clearly value relationship, and they work hard to create an environment that affords families the opportunity to grow their own. Thank you both for a wonderful stay and your sweet gifts to our children."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were initially skeptical about staying at Ranch, as it was our first experience. However, our stay turned out to be truly memorable, thanks to Adam. Finding the property was easy, thanks to clear driving directions provided by Adam. Upon arrival, Adam warmly greeted us and gave us a thorough tour of the property, highlighting all the activities and amenities available. It was impressive to see how meticulously he had planned even the smallest details, like providing a lighter for the fire. Adam's genuine care for his customers stood out, making us feel valued. Our entire family had a fantastic time at the ranch, with the kids especially enjoying the property and its surroundings. We highly recommend experiencing Adam's wonderful hospitality. We are confident that you won't be disappointed."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So peaceful!! Our family met up over spring break and had such a relaxing time catching up. We hiked, played volleyball, hung out in the hot tub, played pool and many other games they had readily available. It was a wonderful break from our busy lives!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a mini-reunion over New Years with 10 adults, 2 infants, and a few dogs. The barn was a great place to host us, and it was easy to find! There was lots of space inside to spread out, and people really enjoyed having access to the ranch for hiking and outdoor activities. Adam was also a kind, responsive host who took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed. All in all, a great stay!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Chris&Kelly's place! It was a beautiful home with a large balcony that opened off the main space. We really enjoyed the openess and privacy of the home. The split level was great for a quiet night's sleep. The home was well stocked and was excatly what we need for the weekend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed here several times before because our boys have a dear/duck lease here in Ada. We are always here on Thanksgiving and cook a full meal for everyone at camp. The living and dining area is very large and there is a nice deck off the dining room which also provides extra space. It’s an older house but it works. Love that there are always plenty of dish towels and trash sacks. There is a washer and dryer to keep the kitchen towels clean and fresh. I also love that there are coffee pots…both ground coffee and a keurig type coffee pot. The brooms and vacuums are also available for use so you can keep the space clean. The door locks are great and self lock. Two bedrooms are upstairs and one is downstairs. The kitchen is good. There is one oven and an air fryer, dishwasher and plenty of storage. All the TV’s work great. There are a lot of people walking the street and a few through the back yard so we kept the doors on the vehicles locked at all times."

Highly recommend the Highland House!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I was worried since there wasn’t many airbnbs in the area. But that was put to rest since this home was awesome. 👏 👏 👏 I was visiting a loved one for the holidays and it felt very much like Christmas 🎄!!! It lightly snowed when I got there!

We’ll be back again soon!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The House on Highland ranks right up there with the best Airbnbs we've stayed at.

We cooked quite a bit - the kitchen is very well equipped. The location is perfect- close to the school in a lovely neighborhood, and still a bit secluded. The weather was warm during our visit and the covered porch was a great place to sit and read. Highly recommend and would definitely stay here again!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay here. Their attention to detail was amazing. Not only did it feel homey but they thought of everything to make sure you had the necessary items while on a vacay. The kids were so excited that they wanted to stay forever. My husband and I liked have our privacy with the downstairs all to ourselves. The beds were nice and comfortable. Every thing went smoothly which is important with kids and trying to have a good vacation.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,We enjoyed our stay!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Unique home with eclectic style. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was exactly what we needed. We visit Ada often to see family, but we’ve officially outgrown staying with them and need our own space.
This was a quick trip so we didn’t do anything at the house except sleep, but I can definitely see us using the common spaces on a future trip. Plenty of comfortable places to play games, cook/eat, sip a cup or coffee (or cocktail!), watch a movie, etc. We’re looking forward to our next trip!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chris and Kelly were attentive, communicative and so friendly. Their house was a wonderful place to stay - spaced out well, fun art and comfortable, attractive furniture. Ideally located by the university and a stone's throw from Wintersmith Park, it was easy to get anywhere. It comfortably housed 5 adults and 3 young kids (mom and kids shared the huge basement master and space). They provided plush towels, warm blankets, and met different needs including access to items in the kitchen and bathroom that were super helpful to have on hand. We will definitely be back next summer. Five+ stars!!"

She thought of all sorts of great touches that made our stay there seem like a swanky hotel: Plush towels, updated bathrooms, nice appliances in the kitchen, various degrees of softness on the different beds and pillows and much more. The house is on a hill and there is access for parking and entering on both levels. We were traveling with my elderly parents so that was wonderful for them. The house was spacious and super clean. Kelly’s responses and communication to us were quick and efficient. Great host! We highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There aren’t enough words to describe how lovely Carol’s property is and Carol. She’s a genuinely wonderful person who has made our stay unbelievable during difficult times. We came here to take care of a relative who has fallen ill and Carol went above and beyond to ensure our stay was more than a stop, she made it a home. I can’t thank her enough for the thoughtfulness and care she brings to these properties. She is a super host in every possible way."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family and myself absolutely loved this place. We almost wanted to ditch our plans of going out just to relax and spend more time there. We enjoyed the peacefulness that can be felt the moment you step in and being able to share that with our dog made us happy. This place has everything you could need for a relaxing getaway. We had fun using the kayaks and made use of the grill without issue. Carol is an awesome host and offered us the ability to check in early which helped us out a lot. Thank you. We we look forward to visiting Oklahoma again and we know the perfect spot to stay at.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Heron House was perfect. Carol has thought of everything. The view from the windows and porch of the lake are beautiful. During out stay, we had a power outage due to winter weather and Carol immediately contacted the electric company and stayed in constant contact with updates as to when the power would be restored. The beautiful gas fireplace kept the cabin warm the whole time. The home made goodies in the little gift shop are delicious, I highly recommend all the homemade breads. We are looking forward to going back in the spring/summer to enjoy more of the outdoor activities. You will not regret your stay with Carol at any of her Air BNBs."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place on a beautiful piece of property. Definitely a hidden gem in the middle of nowhere. We have family close to the area and came for a wedding but I wish we had more time to explore the property a bit more and enjoy what it had to offer. Extremely peaceful.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family of 4 and dog thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights here, Thanksgiving included!
Such a beautiful house and surroundings.
Many windows in the house overlooking the land and water. I loved all the birds, deer, and even fenced in horses behind the property. Carol was very responsive and kind and her baked goods in the shop were delicious!! We did not use the kayaks or hot tub but plan to when we come back:)
Highly recommend this piece of paradise!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I highly recommend you stay here. It's a beautiful place, very clean, and has anything you may need already there. The back porch area is so peaceful. I will be booking again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Spent the night at Carol’s place and we would definitely stay again. Directions were very good and the house was very clean and new furnishings.
Kitchen was well stocked as was the bathrooms. Back patio was so peaceful and the large lake was very beautiful. Carol was very attentive friendly. I have stayed at 20+ Airbnb locations and this was a very nice quiet place."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at the Heron House for our honeymoon! It was beautiful, peaceful, and private. Our lab, Bella, loved that she not only was able to come, but that she had the freedom to play outside and swim in the pond! Carol was extremely responsive and so enjoyable to visit with and watch as her group of ladies worked hard on their next project. We most definitely will be back, thank you Carol!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful location Carol made us feel at home very nice and peaceful will definitely be back
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I am a repeat customer. My two girlfriends and I had a getaway here in May 2022. I decided to come back and bring my hubby so he could experience the relaxation I did. He was just as impressed as I was. Carol did not disappoint, as usual. This will ALWAYS be my favorite quiet getaway to relax and recharge."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay at Carol’s beautiful property! Very relaxing.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Where do i start, AMAZING STAY!
Literally did not need anything!!!
Attention to detail was impeccable!!!!
Loved the design and most of all LOVED THAT ALL OUR FAMILY COULD ATTEND!! Its really hard to find nice places where they allow our dogs and its always so sad that we cant travel as a family because someone has to stay behind to watch them. We also appreciate being able to book one night and. Not be forced to book 2 nights! Sometimes we are not able to come for 2 nights due to all our work schedules clashing so that was most appreciated!!! Equipped with everything for kitchen needs! They have a little store which had so much !!! I was amazed! Everything was clean and so well designed! Kayaks where located on the lake and easily accessible. So we MOST DEFINITELY WILL
BE BOOKING THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our best Airbnb experience ever. Carol was so helpful and responded right away to any questions we had. The home was beautiful, spacious, clean, and well appointed. The furniture was really nice and something I’d buy for my own home. The patio and outside area was truly amazing. There’s hammocks, fire pits, tons of room to walk, and our dog was in heaven running around all weekend. We used the kayaks one morning on the pond which was so peaceful and relaxing. We also used the hot tub which was really high end and comfortable - again nothing was skimped on here. The shop just steps from your home has all kinds of snacks and souvenirs which we took advantage of. The horses in the field right next to the shop and hot tub are beautiful and add to the experience at this amazing place. Lastly, the on site EV charger was so convenient for us (J1772, all Tesla’s come with this adapter). Truly well done, we will be returning even though it’s a 6 hour trip for us."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at the Mallard! The home was spotless, and perfect for a mini retreat. We booked a night 48 hours in advance and Carol was gracious in allowing us not only to stay, but providing flexible check in and leave.
The store on the property was perfect. There’s plenty of drinks and snacks. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. A perfect touch by having the towels for guest to wipe their dog’s paws at the front door. The Mallard felt like home due to Carol’s attention to details, including having magazines, puzzles and extra linens in the hallway closet. Items are easy to find in the home. The bathrooms are large and accommodating for guests wanting space to get ready for the day.
The retreat is a hour from Reba’s and Blake Shelton’s restaurants. We visited both in one day, and it was made perfect by our stay at the Mallard. We watched the rain from the large patio, and it was very peaceful.
We’ve already recommended the stay to our friends and we’ll stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’re so thankful for our time at Heron House! It’s a beautiful getaway that is peaceful and clean! Carol is so helpful with getting there, checking in, and making sure we had everything for our stay. We’ll be visiting again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband & I had such a relaxing and fabulous time at Carol’s property over Labor Day weekend. The home was beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and very well equipped. The Little Wren gift shoppe had such wonderful snacks & gifts for purchase which we thoroughly enjoyed throughout our stay. My husband had a terrific time catching fish! Upon arrival we were given a tour of the property which was much appreciated & informative. Carol & Lacy were both really friendly and helpful. We most definitely cannot wait to return for another stay!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our team truly appreciated the facility and will use anytime possible when we are in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol is a fabulous host, and my husband and I loved our recent stay! The house was beautiful in design, spa-like, and pristine. The land and lake are gorgeous, and the hammock was a bonus. Carol thoughtfully stocked the little shop with treats, and we enjoyed the delicious cinnamon rolls for breakfast. Heron House is a hidden gem, and we highly recommend Carol and this peaceful retreat!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mrs. Carol was a great host. She responded to all my messages quickly, even ones I sent after we checked out. Her property is absolutely breathtaking, and the house was in pristine shape. I love how she checked in with us throughout our stay and even chatted with us for a little while. We will definitely be back for another stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Carol and this property are both amazing. I would highly recommend this property and look forward to returning. The images online are exactly what you get and then some... She was flexible with our check-in and greeted us with a quick tour as soon as we arrived. We stopped at the small fruit stand right before turning and picked up a few tasty fried pies and the most delicious cantaloupe ever. The ponds are filled with fish, the tour will explain which species and where. My son and I had the greatest time on both bodies of water on a variety of kayaks that she has waiting by the water! Bring something ready, and you will have something snagged before getting yelled at to finish unpacking. Beautiful and clean home, fast internet and plenty to watch on a large TV. Local small grocery had everything you didn't bring or need. Overall, ia great little escape with a fantastic host. oh, and the bread is amazing. Go ahead and order to have immed ately. This review should've started with that."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Host was great! She was helpful and very attentive. Location was great and very accurate to the description. Will definitely return!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol made us feel so welcomed and at home. She went the extra mile to show us around and made sure we knew everything the property had to offer. When I say Carol has thought of everything, we mean EVERYTHING! We had a blast fishing and kayaking. The properly was indescribably beautiful. The Little Wren shop had everything you might need or want for your stay. One of our favorite parts of our stay was stargazing in the hot tub. The house was gorgeous, comfortable, spotless, and incredibly well equipped. You should have no hesitation about booking at the Scissortail Retreat for a peaceful and absolutely top notch stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful and beautiful place for some rest and relaxation. We had a great time fishing. Carol is wonderful host. We look forward to returning with our extended family.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol went above and beyond to ensure we had an excellent stay! The Heron House was beautiful! The attention to detail to the house and property was absolutely amazing! Carol has definitely put a lot of thought and hard work into making this wonderful retreat a wonderful place to visit and come back to. We enjoyed fishing the two ponds on the property and caught numerous bass and crappie. The two-man bass boat was great to fish both of the ponds with and was a lot of fun. It worked out great! The Little Wren Shop on the property was such a sweet and cute addition to the stay. We enjoyed visiting it daily for snacks, souvenirs and gifts. We recommend the Heron House or either of the two other houses (Mallard House or Cardinal House) on the property. We absolutely had the best time and we look forward to our next trip!
Thank you, Carol, for making us feel so welcomed and for sharing your special place with us!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was brand new and super nice, the host was super helpful, and the property was awesome."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best cabins we have ever stayed in. Clean, beautiful, fun. Carol was an amazing host. She had everything you could ever need. We left feeling recharged and thing of the next time we can come!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is an easy one, top notch place to just get away! Relax in a beautiful setting, very peaceful. The house was so nice and comfortable, lovely trees, large pond, homemade sweets!!! Carol goes way above and beyond to make things just right! Can’t wait to return ! Beds we’re comfortable, bathrooms were spotless. We got to visit with Carol who is a lovely lady and terrific host. Just a wonderful place and a wonderful host."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carol was a great host, beautiful facility, and so fun"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This place is a place you will remember. I took my partner there for his birthday and he is already asking me to take him again next year. Cannot recommend enough!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a fantastic cabin in a beautiful area. I hated leaving.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect place for our getaway. Very well stocked with high-quality appliances and cooking utensils. Carol’s attention to detail was appreciated. Very comfortable furniture. She offered a “store” with reasonably-priced homemade baked goods, ice cream and beverages. My husband kept going for midnight snacks. The grounds were peaceful and perfect for evenings on the porch. We already discussed our next trip back."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"Absolutely beautiful house and peaceful property! Our family had a great time and really enjoyed everything! We used the kayaks, swings, and campfire areas! We also had a couple people go fishing. We had people from 4 months old to 89 and there was something for everyone. We rented both the Mallard and Herron House and got a tour of the Cardinal House. All three are well thought out and beautifully decorated! Carol was very kind and informative about her property, giving us the best areas to fish or walk. You can tell she takes a lot of pride in her houses! Both the Mallard and Herron Houses were stocked with anything we could think of needing. Perfect getaway for families and we have a few that want to go back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re looking for a peaceful, relaxing getaway then this is the place! Carol put so much thought and love into these homes. We will definitely be coming back in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"PRIVACY—if you’re looking for somewhere to getaway with the kids and the dog, this is it.
Where else can you have access to two private ponds with fishing gear and a small boat with trolling motor? On top of that, there is a side-by-side that Carol allows you to use to transport the boat or kayaks between the two ponds as you see fit. We caught 8 largemouth bass between the two of us and had a great time making s’mores under the stars. The accommodations were comparable to a 5-star resort. Modern decor with luxurious appliances and incredibly large bathrooms.
This property is a FIND!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A great place to get away and just relax. The place was beautiful. The fishing was great and Carol was a great host. I have no complaints. A great experience!!!!!!!!!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing weekend getaway with my husband and friends at Carol’s property! We wanted a peaceful and relaxing place to celebrate my birthday and Carol’s property exceeded our expectations. The cabin is super clean, modern and fully equipped. Beautiful views and nature surroundings. Carol went out of her way to make us feel at home at her property, she even lended me a winter coat as the weather was colder than expected. Our dog was the happiest of all, he was able to run freely and play in the water. We are looking forward to staying here again during the warmest months!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was beyond exceptional. The location was very peaceful and quiet, and the home was cozy and welcoming. Carol was available when we checked in to show us the adorable shop onsite and make us feel welcome."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Carol was an excellent host. She provided an extra mattress to accommodate our party, as well as responded right away when the keyless entry did not accept our code and allow us to enter the cabin. Carol’s home and the surrounding land was beautiful. The home was well stocked and the property was equipped with extras, like walking trails, outdoor benches and swings, fishing poles, and a small shop with items to purchase goodies and treats."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was amazing with an amazing host sooo nice. Very clean, quite, updated and has everything you need. Beautiful open space outside with trees and water. My family absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely stay there again. Thank you 🦅"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The heron house at Carol’s place was amazing. The house was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. The property and the pond was beautiful, peaceful and quiet. We wanted a quiet, peaceful getaway with no distractions and this was perfect. Also loved the dog friendliness, our pups enjoyed it too. I agree with some of the other reviews, Carol could teach a class on how to be a great host!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great host and a beautiful place. I would totally recommend people who wants to get away from the hustle and bustle for a few days. 10/10
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peaceful, comfortable. Great Host"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Highly recommended
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol was super pleasant, outgoing and always available. Carol made us fresh French Bread! It was AMAZING! The kitchen was stocked with every utensil needed to prepare meals. 2 types of coffee pots, daily meds like aspirin, sunscreen, bug spray, laundry detergent, robes, firewood, propane for grill. Doggy bowls and doggy towels for wet little paws. I believe Carol should give classes how to properly prepare an AIR BNB! EXTREMELY HAPPY with our stay and her hospitality."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful experience. Very clean and serene environment. Look forward to going back!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The. Best. Air BnB. Ive ever stayed at.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 would recommend.
Carol is such a welcoming host and her place is a gem. Looking for a dog friendly place to do a dog vacation? Perfect spot for the dogs to run around. There’s so much land for them to frolic and let loose. If there’s swimmers, water is just a short walk away. Lots of sniffing and snoffing to do. Wanting to just get away and unwind? Carol has such attention to detail. You’ll have everything you’ll need there. Lots of walking areas and kayaking. The interior design is one of the best we’ve seen (even counting airbnbs in big cities like Seattle or New York). It’s so cozy, modern, and clean inside. Absolutely impeccable. Quality of life features like hose outside to rinse the dogs, large deep kitchen sink, a quaint little shop just nearby if you’re craving sweets or s’more kits, washer/dryer, firewood, lots of charging ports.
We will definitely be back again. We had a wonderful time. Thank you Carol for your hospitality!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Carol was an amazing host. The house was clean, new and cute decorations. The outdoor space was really nice to hangout with swing, fire pit, pond to kayak. Will definitely recommend this airbnb."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My family had the nicest stay. This place is exactly as described. Carol, the owner is attentive to your wants or needs and you can tell that if anything is in disrepair or there is a problem, she will make it right! There is lots of outdoor space to roam. The homes are perfect for gathering with EVERYTHING you need and many things a person might forget, like q-tips, or marsmellow skewers. Everything is so well organized. Decorations and cleanliness are on par. I would highly recommend this place for a couple or a family who want to get away for a short stay. You will feel relaxed once there!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,AMAZING STAY I WILL BE BOOKING AGAIN SOON 😁💯
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a relaxing stay! We made the quick 2.5 hour drive from the DFW & it was 100% worth it.
Carol really knows how to be super accommodating & the shop she keeps open for the guests’ own use is such an awesome and unique addition.
The houses were clean, well-stocked, modern, yet homey & comforting. We hardly unpacked our kitchen items as there is everything you need including spices, oil, plates/pots/pans, and even the necessary utensils to cook on the outdoor grill that is safely piped to a propane tank.
Kayaking the pond was awesome & there were plenty comfy chairs & areas to lounge & enjoy the shade from the beautiful green trees. Will definitely recommend!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay in this amazing cabin! Everything we needed was provided, even some extra touches like firewood for a campfire at night and kayaks to use on the water. Carol has thought of everything and has transformed her property into a retreat oasis. There is even a little shop with homemade baked goods and drinks available 24/7. There is fishing gear available also and Carol took the time to show us around, bait our hooks, and make us feel welcome. The beds were comfortable and watching the deer and birds from the back patio was a delight. If you are looking for an escape from the fast-paced world, this is a great place to stay! I plan to book a cabin at Carol’s place again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best Airbnb’s we’ve ever stayed at. Carol’s land is a hidden gem. The first thing we did when we landed was extend our stay. Our dogs raced around the property and swam in the lakes while we fished and kayaked. Tons of wildlife to see and land to explore. The home was immaculate, Carol has excellent taste! We will absolutely return for another stay, looking forward to when we do!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a hidden gem. Carol has a great set up. Plenty of outdoor actvities, the Heron House was perfect, clean and the Little Wren Shop was a great added addition. Miss Carol was a perfect host."
2022-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay. Carol had canoes, kayaks, and fishing gear. We appreciated the on-site shop that is open 24 hours. The brownies were delicious. We made s’mores with the grill on the patio, as we didn’t want to walk all the way down to the fire pit, but it was an option. Carol showed us around the lot and recommended a restaurant to go to that we went to the next day. The food was DELICIOUS and made with soul.
There were just a couple things that prevented me from giving a 5 star review, but 4.5 for sure. Worth the money especially if you just want to get away from the city for a while. The stars were beautiful too.
Blankets were also provided, which was a pleasant surprise because we forgot to bring ours."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing. We loved the view and the beautiful cabin. Would come again
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Don't pass this one by! Truly one of the best airbnbs we've stayed at. Carol goes above and beyond to host a perfect getaway. The property is beautiful and the home is immaculate. Carol provides everything you need and more. This is just one of those airbnbs you'll cherish in your memory days and weeks after you leave.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Carol was so welcoming! Such a fun atmosphere
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,It was a great place for a quick getaway
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Heron House is an amazing place to relax and unwind. Carol is an exceptional host! She is just a phone call or text away should you need anything. The exceptionally clean modern house is stocked with everything you could need. The 17 acre lake is beautiful and surrounded by lots of trees! It was not unusual to see a heron or two in the lake. Kayaks, life jackets, and fishing poles are provided. The house is tucked away for a retreat type feel yet there is a grocery store and dollar store close should you need anything. Being pet friendly is the icing on the cake! There were bowls with water left out for our dogs when we arrived! We have found our new favorite getaway and look forward to coming back time and again!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We loved staying in this beautiful, cozy house. We sat outside during the evenings and kayaked during the day. We will definitely be back! Carol had everything you could think of and was very accommodating!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Super great retreat for families or friends. You have so many things to do there and the host is so thoughtful. I will come back for sure next time.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is definitely a hidden gem. Everything was absolutely perfect!!! Carol and Kim were so accommodating.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want an amazing get away from the city life this is the place for you. The house was spacious and extremely clean. The home looks just as described in the pictures. It is so quiet at night and if you love star gazing bring ypur telescope. The pond was peaceful and my family had a great time fishing and kayaking. Carol was an amazing host and her assistant Kim was so helpful I'm in letting us know where the kayaks, life jackets, and the other pond entrance were located. I felt like I entirely overpacked as she had lots of extras in the cabinets for her guests. Plenty of toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, and smaller items such as extra toothbrushes, bandaids, coffee pods and seasonings in the kitchen . Carol makes you feel at home. This has by far been the best vacation home we have stayed at thus far."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place! Host was right there and quick to respond. Secluded, clean, and peaceful. Great place for a getaway to relax."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Sprint to this place! A M A Z I N G! Carol is an outstanding hostess. She set the stage for a stress-free and fun getaway. The house has absolutely everything you can think of including little touches like brand new robes, dog treats, and complimentary bakery items from her shop. It's modern, clean, stylish, and comfy. The land is spectacular. Pics don't do it justice. The 2 rental houses are close to each other, but not so close you feel like you don't have privacy. This place is absolutely perfect if you want to rent both houses and have a SUPER private, tons-of-land, big, nature-driven get together. Kayak the lake. Have a game of Frisbee ending with a cold beer and hot BBQ. Only a 3-min drive to town. I can't say enough good things about this rental. I recommend it without hesitation."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Expect total relaxation.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a hidden gem this place was! Carol’s place is the perfect spot to come and relax for a few days either solo or with a group . Enjoyed some fishing and was able to utilize a kayak that was available onsite while I was there . Carol is an excellent host and has thought of every detail. The location is an easy about 30 -40 minutes drive north of Sulphur, OK with the Chickasaw National Recreational Area / Lake of the Arbuckles area available to do additional outdoors activities if looking for a little more to do. Just a little early to hit the farmers market stands in the area but there seemed to be a few close by to this location . Overall great experience!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Carol is a wonderful. Thoughtful, friendly, and a very accommodative host. The unit was perfect in every aspect. Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful spot for a family gathering, or just a laid back vacation. The house is immaculate and very modern. There are wonderFul touches to make you feel comfortable and at home. All new appliances."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"! This place was amazing in so many ways! The hospitality, the ambiance and the overall experience was like no other! The kids said thank you as they were able to relax and enjoy our time! This place is a 10 ⭐️.
Please if this review gives you the idea to stay here, give Carol more respect then she gives you! She deserves it!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to stay if you need just a room to sleep. A lot better than any motel or hotel. Neighborhood was peaceful and the place was very well maintained. Bed was a little soft for me but that is my preference. Plenty of towels, coffee filters, and toilet paper. I love the little court yard. Very affordable. Check in went smoothly. Key less entry and no hassle. I would recommend this place for anyone needing a place in Ada, Oklahoma for sure. Thank you!!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay and am thankful for a homey place to stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"In a very nice neighborhood and quiet Room was very neat, clean, and has all the necessities. Host is very nice and very helpful. Loved my stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to check in, loved the separate entrance. Beautiful small front yard with a bed to relax."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The room was perfect for our situation. We pretty much just slept there. It was clean and cozy. I did like having coffee available. ☺️
2023-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The room, bathroom and entrance were exactly as described. We always bring everything we need, but in case we hadn't, there were several new toothbrushes, nail clippers etc in the bathroom drawer that I hadn't even noticed til the last day. The room had a coffee maker and bag of coffee, TV, extra toilet paper, iron and ironing board, and much more. These were all nice touches in case we'd forgotten anything. I don't think we will stay here again though because the homeowner got up very early each morning (4 AM I think it was) and made quite a lot of noise right on the other side of the inside door. I actually thought someone had come into our room, so I got out of bed to check it out. One early morning we heard two quick car honks inside the garage (ugh!). The bed was like a trampoline. When one of us turned over, the other kind of bounced up and down before the bed settled back down. All in all, the price was good so it was a great value, but I don't think we will stay here again."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were incredibly pleased with the accommodation. We were dealing with some stress at the time, and thanks to everything being so quiet and peaceful, we were able to relax and just spend time together. Things were exactly as described, and we felt safe. Our privacy was respected the whole time. We were able to take our dog with us and that was particularly important for our sanity. He loved the little courtyard that was included. We were able to let him out and watch him through the doors until he was ready to come in. The bed is a bit firm, but it was comfortable and there were extra linens, pillows, and paper products in the closet so that we did not have to request anything. We always try to leave things in better condition, so we were happy to find cleaning supplies, broom, and Swiffer in the closet too. Thanks for a great stay, Carolyn. We may stay with you again someday, and we will certainly recommend you."

While I could have stayed at a hotel, I was happy to find Carolyn's place as a more comfortable option. Everything I needed was in the space such as a small fridge, microwave, basic kitchen utensils, and there is a nice area outside the door. It's in a quiet neighborhood that would likely be a great place to walk around. I was happy to have this place to come back to at night and when I had a large break in the afternoon.

2018-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Carolyn is an awesome host! She was quick to respond to any questions we had, and was very pleasant and helpful. My wife and I being very social people (sometimes a bit too social, lol!) noticed that she didn't interact much and was very professional. This would be a big plus for someone wanting to focus and take care of business. :) The room was very pleasant, comfortable and we felt right at home. Everything was sparkling clean and Carolyn seemed think of everything that we might have needed, but it was the extra touches where Carolyn went above and beyond. My wife and I stayed a full week and because she had extra towels and sheets and even cleaning supplies in the room we were able to thoroughly enjoy our stay without asking for anything! In fact, she even had bottled water and coffee in the room as well. We found the location was also a big plus as it was centrally located to everywhere we needed to go. If your travels ever take you to Ada Oklahoma, we highly recommend staying with Carolyn! :)"

I felt safe, comfortable and well cared for - and even had our own tiny little private yard for relaxing in the evening. A great experience. If I need to stay in Ada again, this is definitely where I'll go."
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! I love that there is s bathroom, microwave, and fridge and small table. You really can’t beat it for the price!!!"

2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Carolyn’s place is private and comfortable. I’m a travel nurse who sleeps during the day and works at night. It was peaceful and quiet in my room not to mention the little touches like tea bags and coffee. Will definitely be back whenever working in Ada.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, private space. Comfortable bed, good internet. Includes all amenities."
2017-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was pleasantly surprised to find such a great place and value in Ada. I promised my amazing hostess, that I'd certainly tell my FELLOW ECU ALUM about her & her IMPRESSIVE Bungalow & Hospitality!! First, she added a heater to the room, for fear the furnace would not supply enough heat during the single digit weather during my stay. Then, there was the little things. There was plenty of bottled water in my refrigerator, a coffee maker, microwave, tea bags, a very comfy queen bed, a small table & chairs, chest of drawers, closet, a full-sized & completely stocked bathroom, TV, internet, & a private code & lock for the private entrance to your bungalow! With all of this amazingness, I must say the thing I enjoyed the most was her homemade blueberry muffins! IN CLOSING, when you make a trip to Ada to visit an amazing town, college, and The Cradle of the Chickasaw Nation, be sure to make your reservations..EARLY with this outstanding hostess!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! What can I say. The place was beautiful, comfortable, and enjoyable. Driving in on the lane was so nice. Opening up the cattle gate to get in, waiting for the cows to mosey off the lane. My son, daughter n law, and grandsons when I had them out to visit and have a steak roast. Christina provided extra chairs, a folding table for me to use when I asked her if it would be acceptable. The gas grill was great. I don't get a chance to entertain my family often and she made it very special for me! I will definitely make this my go to place when I visit my family in Ada! Thank you Christina!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We came to town for a very special event. The space was peaceful and set on beautiful land. Unexpectedly, there was a massive tornado outbreak like we’ve never seen before.
Christina checked on us continuously and advised us about the tornado shelter behind the home and kept us advised into the late hours of the evening.
No one wants to experience what we did, but she made certain that we were safe and cared for. Despite it all, we had a very special time in a beautiful place. We were very grateful for her."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christina and her husband were amazing brought us fresh towels and coffee very nice people felt right at home. Would highly recommend, and if I was ever back in the area I would stay there again"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,Christina was super responsive and on top of things whenever there was an issue. Understand that it is farm life but you have everything you need to make it feel like home. Super grateful especially with limited Airbnb’s in the area.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,the location is great and peaceful. the fishing was fun and they bite quick so be ready or you will loose your worm. 😂 we really enjoyed the stay and the host is very responsive with the communication.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a relaxing getaway in the country, this is it. Start or end your day on the porch swing and listen to the sounds of nature. I also highly recommend checking out the stars! on a clear night you can see the band of the Milky Way and I even saw a few shooting stars. The cows will sometimes greet you in the morning or when you get home :)
Christina is an amazing host! she always responded very promptly when I had a question! I will definitely be staying here again! this place has everything you need!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place.
2020-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Rustic country stay with nice interaction with the livestock. Peaceful country setting. Close enough to town to make a quick supply run if needed. Overall a good experience. Will go back for a longer stay next time.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is perfect if you want to get away. The cabin was cute and spacious and clean. It was fully stocked and the check-in process was easy. I took my 3 year old son with me alone and felt completely comfortable and safe.
I agree with others that you will want to get to it in the daylight to see where it is but once you do it’s easy to find after that. Also, unlocking/locking the main gate in the dark is not for the easily scared (read: me) 😂.
The property is so perfect. I cannot say it enough. The sunset and sunrise were beautiful and the cows were so much to watch! We also got to sneak up to the horses and chickens, too.
Ada isn’t far from the ranch and is a cute town with plenty of restaurants and grocery stores, etc. The Main St area was really cute and easily walkable, too. I’m already making plans to stay again but for at least a few days this time."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome little get away! much more room and better equipped than a hotel. short 10 minutes to Ada too. Christina was great to work with and will rent again! We actually live local but wanted our guest to have more room.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you’re looking for a quiet getaway this is THE place. We felt so relaxed and at home, just a very home like feeling. We would definitely stay here again."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great getaway! We wanted to get out of the the city for a weekend and this was the perfect spot. We had everything we needed and more. The area was beautiful and quiet. Christina is a great host!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was nice. Not too far from town although it felt like you were miles and miles away! Lovely for a quiet getaway.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was amazing! Clean and spacious. We only stayed for one night, but hated to leave. We will definitely stay here again, not any less than two or three days! Bring fishing poles, bait, old shoes or boots and bug spray. You will not regret staying here."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a serene, rustic getaway, then this location is your answer. Very peaceful overlooking the cattle grazing as the sun rises. Thank you."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place and we caught numerous fish in the nearby pond. Had storms and the owner invited us to come their storm shelter.
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location and seeing the cows herding to come feed was a very neat experience in the evenings.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I absolutely loved Christina’s place!! I couldn’t get over how cute and homey it was! I highly recommend staying!!!!

2020-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Christina's place is a great stay if you're looking to get outside of ""city living"". Tucked away in country pastures, this property is a nice escape from the routine. Everything inside was clean and organized, though some of the photos were outdated as furniture had been changed up. Overall recommend, just make sure to arrive in daylight as the house is not the easiest to locate."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Looking for a quiet place in the country? This is it! A nice, clean cabin off the beaten path, yet easily accessible, amid a working cattle ranch - this is an amazing little place! You can literally watch the ""cows come home"" as you sit out front of the cabin in the evening with a cool breeze blowing through the trees. The internet was slower than we were used to, but we needed to slow down anyway, LOL! This is a great place for bird watchers (see Scissortail Flycatchers in their native environment)! Close proximity to Ada, where shopping and restaurants abound."
2020-08-01,4,Stayed one night,Really nice space for a getaway weekend
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Property is amazing, well priced with great views of the ranch"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peace and quite, awesome views a great place to relax"
2020-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,Christina's cabin is the ideal spot to get away from the craziness of this world!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing. The house was very clean and fully stocked with anything we could need. All the dishes and cookware you could want including a Keurig coffee maker which was great. The washer and dryer was great so we could wash our swim clothes from Turner Falls. A huge plus. The property was very beautiful. We would gladly stay again.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,The most beautiful piece of country you’ll ever get to experience. Don’t miss the chance to go enjoy something that most folks never get to be a part of. Great folks and a great place to spend a couple days relaxing.
2020-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Price was fair. The quiet was perfect for what we needed. No complaints!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful ranch, great accommodations. We would love to come again 🙂"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our first stay at an Air bnb. Christina was a wonderful host. Everything was sparkling clean. She was very welcoming. She brought down an extra blanket and took us on a tour of the property. The house had everything we could possibly need. The land was beautiful. If you’re looking for a nice relaxing place to stay this is it.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This a beautiful and quaint cabin on a huge piece of paradise. More space than you’d expect in the cabin. The cabin itself has everything you might need with extras too. We spent our days wondering through Oklahoma and our nights eating s’mores at the cabin. You’re close enough to everything really. We look forward to coming back to fish at the ponds. Christina is an amazing hostess. Even gave a long tour of their land! Highly recommend for a family vacation!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time! My kids loved the animals and we caught about 20 fish! Christina was a superb host. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay on the farm. We will definitely be back!
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,House was clean and nice spot to get away from the everyday stresses. The host was an excellent communicator and even brought us extra towels and blankets when she saw we had 6 of us. Plenty of room in the cabin. We had access to the whole ranch which was fun for the kids to explore and she even set up a basketball hoop for boys to use. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a place to get away.
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,A great get away!
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was exactly what my family and I were looking for, getting away from the city and immersing ourselves in nature. The property is gorgeous and we loved being outside, but inside was comfortable too. Our 3 year old absolutely loved it, plenty to see and do without ever having to go too far. Christina is an excellent host and extremely helpful and nice. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2020-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful!
I was expecting an enclosed area around the house for my dogs to go out to play and potty. There were holes in the fence and the gate had large spacing that the dogs found their way outside of the fencing which was stressful considering the cows they were close by."
2020-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Decent. Christina was nice. The house had mouse traps and bugs. Odd smell. Overgrown yard. Air mattress kept deflating in the middle of the night. But we wanted a place that was pet friendly, and so we would probably stay there again."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved it here! I wish we would’ve scheduled more days, but that’s ok because we’ll definitely be back! As a beginner fisher, I loved it! Oh, I caught my first ever fish at their pond."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had a great time. We went fishing in the pond and had a ton of fun. Definitely would like to visit again.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time exploring the property and meeting all of the animals! My toddler son loved the adventure!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing time with our family. Planned this trip to fish with our kids and just relax. The weather did not cooperate at all but our host was very accommodating and took care of us. I would highly recommend. We will be back!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed here driving through Oklahoma and hit the nail on the head. It turned out to be bigger, cuter, cleaner, and more peaceful than I expected! I’d say it was 500 x better than staying in any hotel. The experience of the ranch makes this unique. I definitely plan to return!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Incredible views
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,A perfect place to stay!! You can fish all you want! Enjoy all of their land! Great place for children! Very welcoming! We will be staying here anytime we are in Ada!
2020-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place. Christina is so nice! The land is incredible and you get to see all of the adorable cows.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,No complaints and went out her way to help with any issues
2019-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nestled back within the trees and outside the bustle of town life rests a little slice of country life. The cabin was quaint and cute in appearance, surrounded by the beautiful landscape of a peaceful retreat. Every morning I would grab my cup of coffee and go sit in the sitting area as I watched the cows and dreamed of what it would be like to live here forever. The house was small but felt roomy and very much inviting. The only reason I did not give this pretty little place another added star was some minor issues such as, tv remote didn’t work, front glass door broke, porch light out (but I put in a new bulb and it worked) and a few other minor details. Overall, we loved this place and those small details will not deter us from staying here again and it shouldn’t you. either. Unfortunately, due to me having an injury I was not able to explore the ranch but, plan of doing that next time. If your thinking about staying here....I highly recommend it!!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here over Thanksgiving.
Christina was a great host and was very responsive to our needs. The beds were comfortable and our children had an awesome time here. We will definitely consider staying here again if we are in the area. Thank you Christina!"
2019-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We didn’t get to spend much time at the house due to unfortunate circumstances.. But I highly recommend, tucked away from town and high traffic areas.. My family enjoyed how peaceful and beautiful this property was to stay at! We will hopefully be back to spend more time in the future! I just want to say thank you to our host for letting us check in later than originally planned! Clean place to rest or a peaceful getaway!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very beautiful and perfectly clean cabin in the country setting! Enjoyed my morning coffee, while sitting on the porch watching the cows. Excellent host experience, and look forward to visiting again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin is wonderful. Interior was better than expected. William has clearly put a lot of work in creating a charming, cozy and modern experience. WiFi worked great. Laundry room, bathroom, bedrooms and kitchen loaded with equipment/supplies and appliances. Shower had great water pressure and temperature. I don't typically sleep well outside of my home but had no problem here, bedding was comfortable and was able to keep the room temps nice and cool with the A/C units and fans. Nice sitting area on front porch and grilling setup on back patio. I had business in Norman/OKC and family in Ada so the location was perfect. Definitely my future go-to AirBnB when visiting central Oklahoma."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"very quiet, host was very responsive. house was very clean and the decor was very nice and country"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"the home is beautiful, however we did run into a few minor issues. 6 of the outlets in the kitchen were not working and majority of the streaming platforms on the tv just showed up a black screen. but the stay was very peaceful and relaxing."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were just passing through for a night, but we thoroughly our stay! William is an excellent host who is quick to respond with any questions and is very friendly!
The cabin was very clean and we loved the little individual attributes of it and how the cabin was set up. It was quiet and I enjoyed sitting out on the front porch late into the evening while enjoying the night air. We would love to come back and stay longer sometime!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I had a wonderful time here! We loved relaxing on the back patio, having a few drinks, enjoying the fire and star gazing. William was extremely helpful, and promptly responded to messages when we needed help. I’d definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful stay and very welcoming host
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was great to sit and relax on the porch. The host was quick to respond to any questions. Excellent stay.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for a really nice and unique AirBnB in an off the beaten path location, this place is for you. I had a small issue finding the place due to GPS failure when I arrived in the small town, but drove around until I recognized the house. Really clean inside and has all the amenities you need. The interior has been uniquely designed and decorated and is comfortable and homey as a result. Didn’t seem to be any options for food locally, but there are a few larger towns within a short drive."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great little bungalow to get out of the city & disconnect
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here. The place was clean, cute, and comfortable. Having a washing machine and dryer to use is very nice. My kids really enjoyed sleeping in the loft area. The bathroom was clean and I liked the dim lights. This was a great stop on our road trip to stop and reset."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We found this to be an adorable place in a small quiet town, William has it well furnished and super clean. When we had an issue, William was very responsive and we were able to work it out satisfactorily. It was a perfect getaway and within easy driving distance of area attractions."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice place with a home feeling
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay was great just to get away and lay back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay! Town of Wanette was slightly smaller than anticipated, but the Airbnb was perfect for our one night stay. comfortable beds. nice kitchen. unique layout."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean and welcoming home, will be returning!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was hard to find. It's on Clarady road and not Elmer. But we did find it and it was amazing. Such a cute little cabin with everything provided. You really only need to bring a change of clothes. We enjoyed a much needed peaceful getaway
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location was difficult to find due to no cell service and the road shows a different name on internet maps. It’s on the main road of this tiny town so once you know where it is it’s easy access. The queen bed was comfortable but it’s up against the vaulted ceiling so watch your head. Hard to sit up and do anything. The kitchen is well stocked and the place is nicely appointed especially for the price. This is a place you stay because you need to be in the area not for its beautiful surroundings. The neighborhood is run down and dogs were howling and barking every night. William was a great host, we forgot our key one night and he was there in minutes. We really appreciated the extra service. All in all it was better than many other places we’ve stayed."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely stunning. I loved the barn feel. The loft bed and fireplace made me dream like a little kid. The shower! Omg i loveeed the shower it was beautiful. If i ever come back this way I will stay again. A true gem
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I drove up. But once I got inside, it smelled great, looked great and was over the top comfortable. For the money, it's the best valued Air B&B I've ever stayed at. I would highly recommend this place. In addition, I was traveling and hand an appointment change, last minute, the day of check out, William accommodated me w/ out hesitation. Yes, I could have killed some time elsewhere, but it sure made things easier on me to simply get a late checkout! Thank you sir! I'll be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Nicely put together modern accommodations. Excellent beds. Host responded promptly to our questions. Would stay again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,all good

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay in this cozy, happy, adorable log cabin! It was perfect for our family of 4 and our dog. The interior design is wonderful, country and industrial chic, we loved the textured floors and counters in the kitchen, and the bright bursts of turquoise, and the lovely barn doors. Cabin feels cheerful and open, and very warm and inviting. Loved the bold bathroom with the walk in shower and sink on a barrel. Very well stocked and the electric fireplace was beautiful and calming. Fun board games in the living room and lots of thoughtful touches. Wanette is a very cute country town that we loved, and such a peaceful place to stay. William is a wonderful, responsive, thoughtful host. This is a fantastic Airbnb!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The home had a nice and modern interior, the perfect place to relax after a long day on the road. Also, the host was very responsive and accommodating. I highly recommend this BNB if you're looking to stay in the area."

The house was great, very cute loft, bed were comfortable as well as the couch, the shower was awesome and the kitchen had everything you would need. They also had a fire pit outback with wood. Very comfortable place to kick back and relax for awhile. We will be back for sure!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed in AirBNBs all over the world And this unit is one of the nicest. Super clean well equipped and very nice design touches. It is in a very remote small town. We knew that and wanted to be in the area so not a problem for us. A great stay in this part of Oklahoma. Thanks to the host for doing such a great job.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Really impressed by this place. Loved the whole layout of the cabin. Thinking we are gonna build us a place identical to it.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Walking into Williams place was so comforting & home-like. Very accommodating as I noticed baby-gates for families, dog bowls outside for people who have furry friends, and not only was coffee provided but so was Cream and Sugar which has not been entirely common at my previous AirBNB stays, however it was much appreciated- same with Shampoo, Conditioner & Body Wash. Needless to say, definitely enjoyed our stay here. Thanks ☺️"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Once again we loved staying here!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay here!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect pit stop for our road trip! We loved the cozy size and the loft bedroom. Everything was extremely neat and clean and the decor was beautiful. We’ll definitely be back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We booked it for a small weekend trip for a birthday. It was beautiful, clean, and perfect for our needs! Definitely would book again if ever in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I only gave the location a 4 star because I truly wasn’t a fan of how far away we were and I didn’t realize it until we were there. Everything else was absolutely fine and we had a lot of fun otherwise. We enjoyed the quiet and the peace. Even saw some lightning bugs while we were there.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a very cute place, It’s not too far from a nice little store that had good pizza. William was a great host and made sure he communicated with us. He mentioned they renovated this cabin and you can tell it by how modern, clean and sleek it all is! It really gives a cozy, home feeling. The air conditioners kept it cool all night long on this hot summer day/night! They also have fireplaces for winter. I highly recommend this small cottage!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The best place to experience country side in an affordable cost, the place is compact and cozy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great little getaway close to where we needed to be the next day! Thank you for the stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was our first time using airbnb and William had every well instructions. The place was beautiful very peaceful my family loved it. We will be back again soon!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Pleased to stay at William's place again. Lots of flies but that's summer for you in Oklahoma. He got me a fly swatter which was helpful. Asides from the neighbor's dogs going crazy and barking at odd hours for a while, it was quiet. Overall good value. Don't hesitate to book."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, awesome location! It is very peaceful and private really enjoyed this place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place!! We had a great time!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved everything about this place! So beautiful, right next to Soggy Bottom trails, and the night sky is stunning, especially with the fire pit on the patio! My only downside was figuring out how to get the door code once we were there (no reception). But our host was so prompt, that we got the code right away once I found service. Definitely worth the price!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Exactly as described! Very comfy and I loved the table games and coloring books with crayons that were provided. the only thing Ihave to say is the ac window unit from upstairs had a bad smell coming from it... we had ro put an air freshener which fixed the problem but other than that everything was 100% great. I recommend it! 👌
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little cottage was perfect. When we walked in, we were immediately met with such a nice smell. Everything was super clean. Our 3 year old ran around barefoot the whole time and his little feet stayed clean. I was very impressed with how clean it was. There was a queen bed upstairs in the loft and a full size bed downstairs. Both beds were extremely comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, hot chocolate, and spices. The dishes were clean. There was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and more than enough towels.
The home had such a sweet country feel. The window units kept the cottage cool in 100 degree weather. We woke up cold & the fireplace heater warmed the entire home. Our stay was quiet and comfortable. William was very responsive and went above and beyond. I can’t tell you enough how much we appreciated the cleanliness of the home. We will definitely stay again the next time we’re in the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"For my brother, 100lb dog and I. It was perfect. great price for 4 nights there."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay in a peaceful neighborhood. There are 2 window ACs that work very well! It's nice to be able to spend time in the front or the back of the house depending on if you're hunting sun or shade. Nice, soft grass and large yards - next time I would bring some lawn games!
We spent our adventure day about an hour away in Sulphur and the Arbuckle Mountains, and on our first night in we got Simple Simon's pizza about 10 minutes away (tip: the franchise is inside of the mini mart/feed store)."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"William is a great host and was very responsive leading up to our stay. His detailed messages made check in/out a very smooth process.
The house is very tranquil and is perfect for small families or groups of friends looking for a nice get away. The kitchen is very nice and was stocked with everything we needed to make fantastic meals. A perk we enjoyed is that the front porch faces east, which is where my friends and I found ourselves every morning. I would recommend William's place to friends/family and hope I have the opportunity to visit again in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay, close enough to decent stores, far enough away to see the stars! Really beautiful location. Would recommend"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying at William's place, quiet little cabin with everything needed to have a great place to sleep and a quiet peaceful getaway.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a lovely stay at the cottage! It was as cozy as the pictures show and a great value stay. Loved the decor, especially the saloon- and barn-style doors. William was a very kind communicator and I would happily stop here again!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The inside of the cabin is very cute! The ""fireplace"" heater on the wall is a nice added touch. The kitchen has all appliances and extras. It's a great hidden gem off the main highway."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The perfect place for a peaceful stay!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A good place overall. Liked the barrel sink, the fireplaces, the country style of the house overall."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"The beds are very small which could be a little big both length & width wise.
Crockery can be clean as we are paying quite a good amount for cleaning.
We also couldn’t find the thermostat to regulate the temperature as it became too cold by the night.
Other than that the whole place is so cute & perfect location to stay away from the daily chaos.
The whole ambiance is perfect for a small weekend trip to stay alone or with friends and family.
Worth the price.
I totally recommend people to have a stay here."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice and remarkably decorated. will stay again when visiting
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I had a great stay! Thank you!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, would definitely recommend. I was surprised by how many people it could easily accommodate and was almost disappointed I was there with just my pets because there is essentially a whole loft bedroom upstairs. I just got it as a last minute booking running away from ⛈️🌪️, so it’s more than I would normally want to pay if I’m just by myself and it’s not a vacation type of thing. I could see this being a great option for young/smaller families with limited budgets. I would definitely consider booking again if I find my way that direction when I’m not traveling solo in the future."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!!!!Plenty of blankets and cooking supplies. Will definitely be staying here again when in town visiting. Host was very helpful and communicated well with the instructions on getting in the place.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The town is dying. But the place can best be described as a diamond in the rough
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cabin is much nicer in person than the pictures. It's in a very small town. Expect to drive 20-30 min for food, or make a stop at the grocery store on your way. It's very well kept and has everything you'll need for a quiet time away."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommended and cozy house. There was no shortage of details!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay!
William’s place was well stocked, from extra blankets and towels to kitchen accoutrements to cleaning supplies, a desk fan, plenty of extra soap and the place was immaculately clean.
The electric fireplace was a perfect addition and made our stay of relaxing and cooking snacks all day an absolute joy."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time staying at William’s place. It was comfortable and had all of the amenities we needed. Looking forward to staying again

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t not say enough good things about Williams place!
For starters it’s even better than the pictures. It was beautiful and felt so homey. We enjoyed the coffee, the roku,(we had a Disney movie night) and all of the amenities. He had fresh linens, bath supplies, all the cooking supplies you could ask for, laundry detergent. The way it is set up is amazing. My fiancé and I LOVED it! Just close enough to the city that we could go to the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum while we were in town too. (About an hour outside of OKC) Their are neighbors but it’s a quiet neighborhood off the beaten path. William was responsive and answered any questions we had!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is wonderful for a weekend away. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need. The sectional is comfortable and cozy. The TV is awesome. The beds in the cottage are extremely comfortable. My girlfriend and I had such a great time together. We are definitely going to stay here again. Great deal. Comfortable. 10/10. William was a great host and accommodated all of our requests. Again, awesome place."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, very cozy. William was very responsive whenever we had any questions"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It is a beautiful and comforting house. Although my wife couldn't sleep good on the bed, I slept like a baby, because the mattresses are firm. So that's just a preference thing. The way the kitchen and restroom are setup, it makes you feel right at home. The living room is very warm and cozy. Best part of all, they allowed us to bring our 3 dogs. They are very small dogs, but we still couldn't stay at any hotel. If given the chance, we will most definitely be back."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great bargain cabin! Will be returning
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I got this for a couple of friends to spend some quality alone time at and they loved it

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This custom cabin was a wonderful place to spend a special anniversary together. It is truly a unique space. My wife and I really enjoyed the stay. William is a great host. We felt right at home. We would definitely come back for another stay in the future.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I came here for a retreat and it was nice and quiet mostly. It's by a road so you may be startled by a loud truck going by occasionally. I was quite surprised by how nice the interiors were and creatively designed. It's a wonderful space and I recommend it to others. I appreciate William's prompt response as well.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this home is great place for a little get away, it was clean and peaceful. william was so friendly and responsive! this home is a great place to stay at if you like nature and a cabin-homey feel!"

I will definitely stay here again if given the opportunity!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I stayed at this lovely cabin for our 2 year anniversary and it ended up surpassing our expectations. The cozy touches, cleanliness and warm environment made us fall in love the with it the moment we walked in. We’d definitely recommend this Air BnB to anyone looking for a great stay away from home!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The cabin is very nice and has a lot of charm - great for a quick getaway from the city and much nicer than a hotel for a comparable price.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a find! I was driving from LA and was getting super tired so I started searching for a place to call it night.
Luckily I found William’s and booked it immediately and I’m glad I did. The place could not have been more perfect. I was traveling with my motorcycle and a truck load full of my things so being able to park right next to the house made me a lot more comfortable.
The place itself was incredible. Super clean, spacious, well stocked and quiet. I wish I could’ve stayed longer but I had to get back on the road the very next morning. Luckily I slept like a rock. It was the perfect rest stop!
If you’re ever passing through the OKC area or looking for a place to relax for a weekend definitely book this place. It has literally everything you’d need for any length of time.
If I’m ever back in the area I would absolutely book this place again!
Thank you!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for our stay. It was very clean and private. There was also several board games and lots of stuff in case you forgot it. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a nice, quiet house perfect for a single traveler or small group. William was very responsive and even contacted me after to return an item that was left behind. I would absolutely stay here again."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing!! Any questions I asked were answered and the owner is very kind. Place was beautiful and the shower is amazing!!! Would stay again
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cottage was absolutely perfect !!!!!! Tastefully decorated, charming and invited us in and welcomed us from the moment we pulled in the driveway. Peaceful front porch, clean and so warm and quaint inside. Pet friendly, (no odors present either and that is so important for those of us with sensitive with noses). Very well maintained. There’s nothing negative we can say about this little gem! They didn’t miss a beat on exceeding our expectations based on what we were looking for in a get away weekend for some R &R."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Cutiest little place! Very clean and fun! I would recommend it any time.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private, beautiful, easy to find."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,William’s cottage is delightful with a novel and interesting design that I did not expect in a town as small as Wanette. Everything you will need is there and spotlessly clean!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute little gem off the beaten path; it has all the essentials and the decor is adorable. I especially liked the use of gavanized tin and the barrel vanity. William responds quickly to all questions and concerns. There is no retail options in Wanette for food/drink, so stock up on anything you might need during your stay."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,William was very polite. My friends may end up staying at once again in the he was also very keen with his communication back and forth with any questions I had. I ended up checking out late and he had no problem with it
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Day 3 of a 5-day drive across the country and once again, I couldn't have found a better place... William is an incredibly great host and the place was immaculate and already cooled and perfect for checking in. I had a fully loaded car and two dogs and I felt safe and at home.
I highly recommend it to anyone looking for peace and quiet."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was just as charming and welcoming as I expected it to be from the photos and the excellent communication from William.
William is a great host and accommodates his guests well! There were all the necessities needed to make it through the trip (even coffee!!), as well as board games and a beautiful view I could not get enough of!Thank you, William!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute and clean place. We were able to relaxed and had everything we needed. It has neighbors but they are not super close, it has a big yard and felt private. I will be back and recommending Williams place to family that travels through."

baths and a full kitchen. Very clean and
nicely decorated. There are very few AirBnB’s in Ada so this one was very nice. Kind of pricey though."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,Host has been very accommodating and I will always check the availability of this location when I visit Ada (or surrounding areas) in the future.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"First of all, Michael had an incredible response time and made things very easy for us.
The place was easy to find and was aesthetically great - very clean and comfortable, lots of space. I always appreciate while traveling for work to have individual rooms for my coworkers, a kitchen, a common area, a shared eating space, multiple bathrooms, and laundry. This place had it all for less than hotel room price per person."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2023-02-01,4,Group trip,Not a bad stay. Trouble with the lock to get inside the house. Sound proofing between the units was not very good. We could hear the other houses TV in the living room.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was nicely furnished and very comfortable. I had problems with the door lock but Michael came right over and helped me out. It’s conveniently located near grocery stores and gas stations. We will be staying here the next time we are in town.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is just as described, an apartment in a barn. It almost felt like you were home with the cattle right outside. It was clean, had all you needed. We were in town to visit family and mothers day, so we werent there through the day. although i never got to actually meet karen, i did get a message asking if we needed anything. The only cons i have are the beds could be queen, and the shower is small, it worked for me but a bigger person may have a hard time. There is a dish outside but the tv just has an antenna, which is not a deal breaker. There is a dvd player and a few movies to choose from. All in all it was a nice stay and i would stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,If you're looking to escape the noise and lights of the city. Karen's place is the great place to escape the hustle and bussle. I will stay at Karen's again it was peaceful and quiet!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice and peaceful
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
A city boy trying to make friends with the cattle. Turns out, Honey Buns is the trick."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very cozy place with a nice outdoor environment.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and cozy! The cows made for a nice view at sun set.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a very nice get away and a beautiful piece of country. The river access was very nice and it’s just the right distance from town.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Odell farm is a beautiful and private place to stay. They have all the accommodations and more to offer guests. Mr. And Mrs. Odell are very kind and were an absolute joy to meet, they were flexible with us on check in and check out hours which I very much appreciate. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"She’s an excellent host, she went above and beyond to help us be comfortable. It is quiet and breathtaking there. Thank goodness it was a farm they had what I needed to resuscitate our car."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had one of the best short vacations we have ever had, the children were so happy they wanted to stay much longer. I cant say enough about Karen and this air bnb"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are building a house 10 miles away and this was so perfect for our family of 5! We have a camper but it was really nice to find a place that would fit us more comfortably. We had everything we needed, it was very private, and very clean! My kids also loved walking outside and being surrounded by cows!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a cute place. Comfortable too. We enjoyed our stay here.

Thank you for sharing your beautiful place with us!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was just as the description described it would be. The host was very polite and thoughtfulness went a long way with this property, anything we maybe had forgot was available in the unit thank you very much Kare! 👍👏"
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,Karen was a really good host the place was really nice and clean as described
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very cute apartment with a well equipped kitchen in a beautiful area!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great value! This quaint farm stay was perfect for me and my wife on our anniversary. The host had everything we could possibly need ready for us.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joanna was an amazing host for our weekend in Ada! The house is the perfect cozy home, great place to stay for the price! I would recommend any and all to stay here when traveling to or through Ada. The check in process is easy, house was very clean, and Joanna was very responsive when we had questions."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,thank you for letting us stay @ your house very homie
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,The house was clean and quaint. The surrounding area was a little run down but there were no issues. Joanna was very pleasant to work with and provided a great stay!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had everything I needed. Really clean. Pretty good deal and not far at all from all the restaurants
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"needed to find a place quick to stay, we were in the house within half an hour of requesting"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Joanna was a great host and communicator! We loved the cozy home. The whole place appears nice and remodeled. The kitchen had everything we needed. TV trays (no table) were no problem for our family of 4. Easy to log into our netflix and watch our favorite shows and movies. Comfy beds and evencomfy pull out beds! The kiddos did wake up with the train, but we should have brought our own NOISE MACHINES. Getting into the home was easy, and we felt safe. There was some interesting activity happening with the neighbors, but we just ignored it and kept the doors locked. There is a motion-sensor spotlight at the neighbor's house across the street that came on throughout the night, and the home had no curtains. So bring your own EYE MASKS for sleeping or extra blankets for makeshift curtains. Previous review mentioned host providing snacks or coffee, but that is not the case, so bring your own drip coffee grounds. Joanna was great and very kind!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and had no issues at all. Great place to stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean private place to stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent accommodation
2024-03-01,3,Stayed with kids,Joanna has a cute little home and she is a kind host. That being said Ada is a different community and I just want others to be aware that the train is in the backyard and came by 5 times on our first night and the surrounding houses are in poor repair. The bathroom door doesn’t close which made the small home uncomfortable for our family of 4. It was nice having laundry on site.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,thank you for the stay i thought it was really good!!!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Had to stay over for work close to work. Great place for last minute booking. Thank you
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house looked great, and was nicely decorated. We really enjoyed using the kitchen, there were many great tools provided in the, and we had lots of fun cooking. We enjoyed our stay and were able to find lots of fun stuff around as well. The one complaint that I have is about the bed in the main bedroom. Just a little bit too hard, but it definitely did not ruin everything for me. It’s a nice little place to stay while traveling."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Joanna is very kind and responsive; and the home was very clean and comfortable.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Joanna was a great host! We had a little difficulty getting in but she was super responsive and super helpful when it came to. 10/10 would recommend this place!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable and clean.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect size for our family of four. Host was beyond accommodating and we’ll definitely stay here again when back in town!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great host and very nice place. Cozy house with an awesome kitchen, would definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,3,Stayed with kids,The neighbors were loud and we were nervous staying there it was just 4 girls and the other house next door is abandoned rough looking neighbor hood we had no problems with the neighbors except for the first night driving there loud car up and down the street and there was about 8 people there pretty sure it’s a drug house cars coming and going ! The house was smaller than I thought it would be not much sitting room no dinning room table but had table trays the pull out sofa’s were single beds the one in the living room Wes very uncomfortable the bed in the bedroom was nice good size bathroom kitchen was great !
2024-01-01,3,Stayed a few nights,.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Thank you for the stay. The house was clean and very cozy. My family enjoyed our stay in this Air BNB! The house was very well stocked for us.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed this time last year and it was clean and tidy once again. Easy to babyproof/toddlerproof the second bedroom-- bring a pack n play or toddler cot and move the wooden furniture into the laundry room next door. Bring doorknob covers; outlet covers already on most or all outlets. Nice playset in the backyard our toddler enjoyed!
We stayed Saturday night through Wednesday night and we only encountered an overnight train after 10:45 PM on Wednesday night. Earliest train was after 6:00 AM. We all slept great; kid slept through the one overnight train and I just woke briefly. Neighborhood looks a little rough, but we never had an issue with crime this year or last.
The heat works fantastically as does the water heater. Plentiful spare linens/blankets, towels/washcloths. Dish soap, two dishwasher packets (save one for checkout), roll of paper towels included. Large refrigerator. Just a perfect little rental and we look forward to a third stay here! Thanks, Joanna!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great stay! As other reviews have mentioned the neighborhood was disadvantaged but was peaceful and quiet. Trains come through regularly (tracks right behind the house) but I didn’t find the noise to be a problem. Place is super cute and clean and pictures are accurate. Close to the downtown area and about 10 minutes from Mercy Ada hospital where I was working.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved this little house. It’s cute and clean and the couch beds were actually comfortable. I would stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place! Very nice, clean, and host was more than helpful. Recommend 10/10"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host and wonderful stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home would love
To stay again if I’m ever in the area"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Joanna’s place was a great option for us. We had everything we needed for a weekend visit for the ECU game. The train is close to the property but we were expecting to hear it based on other reviews. There were noisy neighbors but that could have been an exception. Nothing that would keep us from staying again. Joanna charges a reasonable cleaning fee which puts the price point more comparable to one night at a hotel but with much more room and privacy. The pull out bed in the 2nd bedroom was very comfortable with the memory foam topper. We had everything we needed for a great stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a beautiful home with everything we needed. Accessible to everything in town and easy to find. Host was super easy to work with. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we will definitely stay here again
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Joanna’s place is very cute, clean and accommodating. Sleeps 4 very comfortably. Our only problem was with the train that passes at very random times throughout day and night that uses an air horn multiple times as it passes by the backyard."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable space, great value. Absolutely recommend"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Joanna was a great host! She was a proactive communicator and made sure we had all the necessary linens and check in instructions. We will definitely check availability for this rental in the future when we are in town!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joanna place was the perfect place for our family to stay while visiting from out of state. It was clean and had everything we needed! It also had a large backyard that my kids were able to enjoy running around and playing in!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Joanna's place is cute and well-done. It's cozy and has everything you need for a stay in Ada. Do plan to drive to get to where you need to go.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Had a great stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay. We really felt at home and very safe. House is great and is on a street with very little traffic. The train comes near the house around 8 or so in the morning and my grandson loved it! He got to watch the guys switch tracks and thought it was the coolest thing ever. We did not hear anything at night, so there were no issues with sleep. Joanna was great and even let us extend our stay when something unexpected came up in our trip. Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The inside of the house was very clean, updated and well maintained. All essentials were provided and it very cozy."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to stay on the rougher side of town but neighborhood was safe didn’t have anything stolen overall I recommend

2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place to stay for the price. Joanna gave good instructions and place was easy to find. Exactly what we expected.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great deal for the area and the renovation was very well done. It was also very clean which was great. Only downside is it's next to a train track and a not so great house. But a very well done Airbnb!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet place to rest and relax. We felt save. We stayed only two nights and had no issues.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute little house in a quiet location. Close to ECU. Hostess is great! Definitely recommend .
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Even tho Ada looks like a small town, there are many thing todo, there is national park trails are less than 30 mins away. Great restaurants near by. Everyone in town made you feel welcome! House is in a little neighborhood, cozy and easy to get to!!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome hidden gem in a small town!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was close to the most places. Quiet neighborhood.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed the stay here. Can be a little noisy with the very active train tracks a couple feet from the property line and 7 am steam whistle at the concrete plant. Other than that, its a nice and clean place to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very cute updated house.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully renovated home. Just the right size for 2 - 3 people.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean and updated. It was easy to communicate with Joanna. We had a great stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place! There is a train nearby, but the quality of the house makes up for it. I had a great stay and felt right at home."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place. Very cute little house. I was very comfortable staying there and was able to get well rested.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent! We will stay again!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place highly recommend staying here!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Good place clean and cozy
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Joanna helped me out on short notice and the house was accessible and clean!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was fine, other than the train noise at nights."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for our family!
2022-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"First off let me say that Joanna is a wonderful host! She was accommodating for our check in times due to traveling!. The house it self was cute, clean, and stocked for what we needed it for. However, when we pulled into the neighborhood it wasn't what I had pictured or suspected. It was a little run down. That did not effect our over all stay. It was a nice place to stay and would stay again if we come back to Ada!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ron was extremely friendly. Blessed with an amazing property, that he is willing to share with others. He took time out of his day to show us around and give us some info on the property. We will be returning! We got a little bit of fishing in during the weekend. The storm definitely put a dent in our plans but hopefully next time we will get to enjoy more of the property! Thanks for having us Ron."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a place we would come back for a peaceful and fun trip! My fiancé & I had a very great time fishing and cooking out with our fur babies. Definitely coming back in the near future!
Thank you Ron, for this wonderful place and for showing us around."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Ron’s place was fantastic. I highly recommend bringing/renting a four wheeler. There is a great fishing doc, a swimming hole with a small waterfall. Ron has done and is continue to do great things to the property. My dog had a blast too! We are planning another trip with friends so we can get in the water and do some fishing. Thank you for your hospitality Ron!!
Todd & Michele"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great looking ranch
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Felt right at home. Really enjoyed the cozy cabin with my family and going out for walks on the property!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome stay. Host was responsive and helpful. Would gladly stay again!!! Property and lake were wonderful. Very peaceful.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful place totally off the grid. Loved the view of the water from three sides of the house. Totally isolated from the noise of the modern world. Ron and Fee graciously welcomed us the day after our arrival (because we arrived after dark), and gave us a tour of their beautiful property. They are a very friendly couple yet allowed us our privacy during the rest of our stay. My only complaint would be that the mattresses were too hard leaving me with a back ache until I started sleeping on the couch. If they replace the mattresses I will definitely be back."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very secluded and quiet
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Ron and his wife are amazing, gracious hosts! We did have a difficult time finding the place due to our phone service being in and out. Ron was very easy to contact and made sure we made it to our destination. The lake at the cabin was perfect for fishing and we loved jumping off the dock to swim! The cabin had everything we needed for our stay. This was one of our favorite places we have stayed and we plan to return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect peaceful getaway. The cabins are private. The property is beautiful.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay in a beautiful and relaxing place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love the cabin ! Remote and beautiful
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a very relaxing return to the lake cabin. The cabin is very private and well equipped. Ron and family were very helpful and friendly. The sunsets by the fire pit were amazing. We will come back again.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lake cabin was just what we were looking for. Ron was a great host.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love staying in the lake cabin at Dos Equis Ranch! The cabin is very cozy but big enough for our family of 6. Ron is a great host…we can’t wait to go back when it’s warm!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ron was a fabulous host. He was waiting at the cabin and took us on a tour of the ranch. The cabin was spacious and cozy and very private. The lake and surroundings were amazing, plenty of wood for indoor and outdoor fires. The kitchen was well equipped. We were impressed with the cabin details including comfortable furniture and beds. It was a great and relaxing stay and we plan to return. Thanks Ron!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ron's place was very nice and secluded. we will certainly return! Thanks for sharing yourplace with others.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great secluded getaway and fishing paradise!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We LOVED this cabin and the surrounding property! So peaceful and comfortable! We will be back soon!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, serene, private and perfectly comfortable! We couldn’t pry our dogs away from the pond and we couldn’t get enough of the calm, peaceful atmosphere. Ron was very welcoming & made sure we had everything we needed. 10/10"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very private. Stunning natural beauty, lots of room for hiking, fishing and relaxing. We saw deer and rabbits, heard coyotes and found a Canadian goose sitting on a nest with eggs! Ron and Fi went above and beyond to make sure we had a great weekend!!!
We’ll be back soon."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A true gem ! Tranquil and beautiful surroundings quickly strip the stresses away and afford you a place unwind. Ron, the host, went above and beyond with quick responses to our questions prior to our booking, directions, tips and a wealth of information about the property and amenities.
The home was spotless, instantly giving you a sense that pride is taken in the upkeep, cleaning and safety of the property.
From a well-equiped kitchen to comfortable beds to a fire pit / grill on the back terrace overlooking the pond, you are left wondering how quickly you can book another stay to return.
We all left recharged and rejuvenated."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was just what my wife and I needed. Can’t wait to go back when it warms up to do more exploring and fishing!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! It was a nice and quiet place where we could totally relax. Our 2 dogs loved going on walks around the property and we especially enjoyed the fire place since it was a chilly weekend. Perfect weekend getaway!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed ringing in the new year at Dos Equis Ranch. It was a secluded escape, and our dogs loved exploring around the cabin. We had plenty of firewood to keep us cozy with the cold rain. The kitchen had all of your basic pots, pans, plates, and salt and pepper. You may want to bring your own cooking spray/oil, more seasonings, and foil though. We would love to come back and explore more in nicer weather!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for a special spot that will help you unplug from the hustle of everyday life, be sure to check this place out.
The property is gorgeous, the cabin is cozy and has everything you need, and Ron was so great! We even got a special tour of the land as soon as we arrived on site. Loved that we could bring the pup as well!
Side note, if planning to use the kitchen and cook all your meals, I would plan ahead & bring all ingredients with you. The closest grocery store was about 40 minutes away.
Would definitely go back!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very peaceful, beautiful place. Looking forward to coming back!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You won't be disappointed. It is the perfect spot to get away from everything, and fully enjoy nature. Well worth it"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Privacy and a sky full of stars.
2020-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great and secluded place for us and our dogs. We enjoyed fishing the ponds.. Just had to be careful of the unknown neighbor dogs hanging around sometimes. Did not know how they would act around us or our dogs. Also maybe some issues with the hot water heater as we had cold water.
2020-08-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin but can not swim and fish there unless you like cattails and snakes and moss and algae. To far to get medical attention if get hurt there. Not for seniors. Very hazardous. Unlevel and rocks in floor and patio stick up and you trip or stub toes. Very nice for just to sleep and enjoy quiet.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was awesome and Ron was more than helpful and took great care of us!
This place is a must if you love wildlife and just the good ol country life."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place on a very secluded ranch. We are a 50 yo couple just looking for a quite place to escape and cool off by some water. Ron's place hit the spot! The pier and water side patio was a great place to relax and the pond was a wonderful place to float. We joked that our dog took us with her on vacation. We all loved walks around the ranch and a swim to cool off. No TV or wifi so it is a good place to unplug, but it does have a good stereo/radio w speakers inside and outside so dust off and bring your favorite CD's"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Spacious cabin with privacy. The pond was perfect for relaxing on floats. Beautiful land with no worries about being around other people. We were able to fish and hike around the many ponds. The cabin had everything we needed and had great views. Would definitely recommend and plan on staying again in the future!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Last minute trip turned into an easy and amazing get away for Mother’s Day. Felt right at home. Lots of ponds to go fishing. We used the fire pit every day. You can use it to grill too.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I simply cannot say enough good about this place!
If you’re looking for a break from the daily grind, this is definitely it! You will more than likely have cell service, but if you’re on your phone for unnecessary reasons, you’re missing out on the fun! There are more ponds than you can fish in a week, endless opportunities to see wildlife, and no reason to not explore the great outdoors.
It rained every day of our four day stay, but regardless of that, we all had the best vacation ever! I’ve never seen our three boys so happy!
We took our four wheeler and trail bikes and rode different trails everyday, but still didn’t see all of the property. I spent mornings on the front or back porch, enjoying the peace and quiet.
There’s honestly just too much to list!
Ron is an absolutely fantastic host! Such a great spirit, amazingly helpful and thoughtful, and so easy to work with!
We can’t wait for the many future trips we plan on making back to this amazing property!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect getaway, close enough to the city but far enough that you can’t hear the traffic. Dos Equis Ranch was exactly as we had hoped. Thankfully we had access to an ATV so exploring the vast acreage was part of the adventure. At night, the only thing louder than our crackling fire was the sound of the frogs.
The cabin is equipped with everything you will need, including a full kitchen, washer and dryer, and hot shower. For those that need to stay connected, your phones will likely get full service out here like ours did. But if you’re on your phone, you’re missing the point. Cabin life is the good life.
Ron and his family are welcoming and there to help if you need them. If you get a chance, as him about the work he did on the land. The man has lived two lifetimes and he’s not close to done. Can’t wait to get back out there and continue our conversation."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,BOOK RON❤️
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin in a relaxing setting with wonderful hosts! We’ll be back!

2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family had a great time, the property is beautiful. Ron's place is an amazing place to get away from the daily race, we spent most of our time relaxing on the patio, watching our son fish, barbecuing and at night looking at the stars."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Ron and his wife were incredibly welcoming and showed us around the cabin. Everything was clean and there was plenty of room for our pups to run wild. We loved the pond & deck outside. Water was clear and refreshing with the heat. We will definitely be back when it’s cooler and walk around the property more. It’s HUGE!

2018-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family had an amazing time this weekend! We were welcomed by Ron and he gave us a tour. The cabin was beautiful and just what we needed. The kids had a great time fishing and exploring! The fire pit and music made for fun memories! Thank you for everything!

Can't beat it for the price, and I would stay again."
