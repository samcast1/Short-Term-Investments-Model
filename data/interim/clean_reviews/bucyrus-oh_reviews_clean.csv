2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space is absolutely incredible! The perfect place to relax and reconnect! The creativity and thoughtfulness Bob and Traci put into everything is really felt when you stay here! Amazingly kind and generous couple to communicate with, and they will help you with anything you need! I arrived pretty late the night of my stay, I really appreciated the flexibility, and they were kind enough to extend my check out time a little bit so I could sleep in. The entire place is so cozy and peaceful, so good in fact I overslept! A huge thank you to Bob and Traci for everything! I have nothing but great things to say, I had a wonderful visit!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at the schoolhouse for our wedding anniversary. Such a cool unique spot! Very clean and wonderfully decorated with vintage items. The details were amazing. Peaceful surroundings to relax and experience nature. The house was cozy with welcoming energy. We loved stepping back into history. Highly recommended!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous little place - defied expectations. One of the few stay experiences where I felt like the hosts wanted me to enjoy the stay, rather than a quickly refurbished place to sleep. Full of cute touches, tiny details, and comforting additions."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Schoolhouse is one of the most unique stays I have ever had. Quiet Country setting, great view of the Sunset, and plenty of outdoor areas to relax. Inside the Schoolhouse was truly amazing, everything felt period correct, and was immaculate.
My wife wont stop talking about it, we couldnt have asked for a better place to spend our 1 year anniversary.
Great Job Bob and Traci"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful hidden gem! We had a great time, it was such a relaxing, fun, unique, and peaceful stay. It has so many wonderful modern things, but I loved that they kept the schoolhouse in its original condition. The bar is beautiful, the massage room is amazing, and I loved looking at all the small details and decorations. We had such a nice, comfortable time, and it is very quiet there. Traci was so friendly and accommodating to us! We can't wait to come back, and I highly recommended! Just one tiny thing was I wish their was a duvet for the bedspread."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Thank you for a unique stay experience. Everything from the antiques that were used as decor to the modern accents made this stay the best of both. It was charming and historical but also provided modern features for ease and accommodation. Our hosts were friendly and helpful throughout. This is a great place for fun pictures and beautiful scenery. It was also not far from Prohibition at the Caverns where we had dinner. I would recommend and would love to stay again.

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very comfortable and would stay again. Thanks.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed at many AirBnbs, but Anne's house is the best that I've booked. Plenty of extras, topped with a very clean and well decorated home. The view out in the country is amazing. I highly recommend Anne!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Another perfect stay for a weekend at Mid-Ohio. A wonderful place to unwind in a peaceful setting after a day at the track.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 5th or 6th time to stay here. Anytime we are in the area we will do our best to stay here.
Couldn't ask for more friendly, helpful, and nice people.
Helped make our trip more enjoyable.
Thanks."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Came to view the eclipse! I appreciated Anne's flexibility in letting me arrive an hour early. The location was perfect, a wide-open field. I loved the private courtyard with comfortable chairs and beautiful view of the countryside. FYI, tho, the hot tub is more towards the house. Inside Anne has provided tons of thoughtful little details, like snacks! Everything is newly renovated and clean but cozy, and the rooms are spacious. The bed is amazing and I slept great. If you're looking for a getaway or need somewhere to stay for some reason, recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was out of the way, but close to everything. Super clean and the hosts were very friendly. I’ve never slept on a comfier bed at an Airbnb. The landscaping and view was gorgeous."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute little room.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,My friend and I just stayed one night but it was comfy and cozy and just what we needed for our short stay.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"GPS tried to stop us short of the actual location but Anne had noted this possibility in her communications.
Apartment was very clean, good hot water for showering.
Didnt see a thermostat and appeared heating was by space heater and electric fireplace. Place was plenty warm.
Appears to still need a little finishing sheetrock work to encase HVAC and plumping pipes in ceiling and I'm sure that will be finished in time. I suspect price will rise once that occurs.
For the price this place was great. I would definitely stay here again.
No issues at all definitely 5 star stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We were just passing through and were super excited about the hot tub after a day of shopping. We arrived slightly later than we thought we would but Anne was very accommodating and we grealty appreciated it! They have definitely thought of it all. Would for sure stay again. Great place.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to enjoy complete privacy with beautiful surroundings. Everything we needed was supplied with plenty extra food snacks. Very unique creative decor. Great idea that they provided an air purifier as well in this day of germs. Lots of space too and spotless clean. Everything as described and some. We would definitely like to stay again if we are in the area. Both Anne and her husband very friendly with immediate response to our questions. They both made our stay go smooth and made us feel like we were in our own home. Thanks again for letting us enjoy your Oasis !!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay at this Oasis. It was a very relaxing and peaceful weekend. The location of this Airbnb was perfect. It’s closed to plenty of restaurants, but also far enough away from the main streets and action in town."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very cute!!! Loved the property
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I just needed a little time away. This Oasis was perfect in every way. Loved all the Coca-Cola memorabilia.. Bed was most comfortable the snacks were an added touch and the Keurig machine is our favorite coffee. We were especially pleased with the fact that we could stay one evening and not have to book 2 nights. The hot tub was amazing and just what we needed. Looking forward to returning in future.... woodpecker escorted us out as we were very excited to see all the nature . The home was just beautifully landscaped and well taken care of. You wouldn't even know that you were sharing a home with someone else. Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality your Airbnb is a treasure...

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We arrived after dark in the cold and rain. From the moment, I opened the door, I felt like we were in an oasis. I’ve rarely ever experienced anything so peaceful, cozy, beautifully decorated and beyond clean. We were convinced the floor had been buffed 5-minutes before we walked in the door! You could not find a speck of dust anywhere even if you looked for 5-hours. The theme of Coco Cola was beyond adorable - from the living area to the awesome bathroom. Everything was well marked and efficient. The available snacks and waters were just the cherry on top! Anne constantly communicated with me and there was not a single surprise. Well, just one - the location was even better than the pictures!!!! If you’re staying in the area, please stay at Anne’s Airbnb; there’s nothing like it in the area! Thank you, Anne!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Clever Oasis was exactly what I'd hoped. Anne was a proactive and responsive host, and provided clear direction and instructions on how to find the place (I was arriving after dark and it's on a country road). It was cute and cozy (there were space heaters just in case), and had everything one would need: extra sheets, blankets, and towels, a mini-fridge and microwave, and my favorite features: a Keurig coffee-maker and water cooler! The best. I'd definitely recommend this place and would try to stay again when I'm in the area. Thanks so much, Anne!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Anne’s place matched the description perfectly and we appreciated the ability to book super last minute.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Traveling in the area for a business transaction and unexpectedly needed a place to spend the night.

I was most impressed with the thought and care put into accommodations and all the amenities.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love a Clever Oasis. It's so quiet and peaceful here. I really like that Anne has everything labeled which took the guesswork out of where things were located and which light switch to use. I used the fireplace to take the morning chill out of the air. It is such a comfy place that I hated to leave and return to the chaos of normal life. I look forward to returning in the Spring.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Anne provided everything needed for a great stay! It didn’t even feel like I was sharing the property with her family. They were very respectful and quite and very responsive when necessary. I loved waking up and sitting in the hot tube that over looked an amazing view of their back yard! It was so relaxing and an awesome getaway! They had some good local places to eat also.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall: We loved our stay here. It’s a very quiet place to retreat in a beautiful country setting.
Host: Anne was an excellent host who obviously has good experience with the process. Responsive, welcoming, and kind.
Unit: Comfortable and well thought out. The decor and furnishings are well beyond the basics, making the place feel warm and inviting. Comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, and even a nice little outdoor seating area. Loved it!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at this great place for 19 days. We loved it. The accommodation is clean, but equipped, in a beautiful location, excellent bed, nice shower and fine internet.
Everything has been thought of: the TV has an HDMI cable so that you can stream to the TV via a laptop.
We immediately felt at home, not least because of the friendly help of Anne & Joel. Coffee, snacks are provided and are replenished. The dishes were even done for us.
Anne responds directly to questions during the time of booking. During our stay, they were always available.
Clever Oasis is recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very nice Airbnb, and close to the Kokosing Gap bike trail. We enjoyed the hot tub, snacks, great shower, and a good night’s sleep. Every little detail is thought out, from the charcoal for the grill to a wide assortment of coffee pods on the morning. We highly recommend this Airbnb."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was beautiful place and Anne responded quickly
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I truly cannot say ENOUGH about this stay! We use Airbnb whenever we travel, so we have had quite a bit of experience with hosts and lodging. The attention to detail, was Incredible!! Their house was beautiful, the hosts were incredibly welcoming and helpful, and there wasn't a thing that we were needing, that wasn't provided. My wife would mention something that we forgot, and lo-and-behold, there was one on the table.
Check-in was super easy, and we were only a short jaunt to our destination of Mid-Ohio Raceway. Area photos on the wall, and a book describing local places to eat and visit was a great touch! Plenty of room for my truck and enclosed trailer to park was also a great plus.
We will definitely be booking again next year! Incredible value, and a fantastic stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place! We only stayed one night on our way to a concert, but I regret not booking two nights and driving back after our concert! Super clean, responded quickly to messages, and in a nice secluded area. We didn't get to try out the hot tub, but next time we are in the area we definitely will!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to stay!! Very clean and the host was very welcoming. Would stay here again happily. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed with my son for nationals of sporting clays, trap, and skeet at the Cardinal Center. Long days. It was great to get back to a quiet restful place. Took advantage of the hot tub one of the nights. Very nice garden surrounding the hot tub. We have a hot tub at home so we look for one when we travel."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-07-01,4,Stayed one night,"Unfortunately we never made it to Anne's place due to having car troubles on our way there. But we were able to call her and she answered right away and we told her our situation. We were able to get a partial refund which was given quickly which we greatly appreciated. Bummed we never made it there but I can tell even before meeting her, Anne would make a great host!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was perfect for us and included all kinds of nice touches.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"So beautiful! I only stayed one night on my way somewhere, but I wish I’d had more time. Anne has provided absolutely everything a person could need. And the location is so beautiful and peaceful. I got in late so I decided to not to use the hot tub (although I hope to next time!) and instead I sat out and listened to the crickets and the frogs and watched the fireflies dance over the field. Absolutely gorgeous. And slept GREAT—for 10 hours! I will definitely make this a regular halfway-point stop on my trip in the future."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! Very clean! Anne+Joel are very thoughtful indeed. They go out of their way to ensure comfortable stay for the guests. Lots of snacks are provided.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a quiet place to work and hang out for a week while my kids were at a camp in the area. I could not have been happier. Anne is a gracious host, the surrounding countryside is incredibly peaceful and there were fireflies! Anne recommended a bike path nearby that is one of the prettiest I have ever been on. Bike rental from YNot Cycle was easy. So many great state parks in the area. Highly recommend all-around."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay and would recommend!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and totally at the last minute. Thank you for helping and responding so quickly.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I only stayed here one night on my way to another destination, but I could have easily stayed for a number of nights more. This location is a was peaceful and views of the surrounding countryside and woods was lovely. This basement apartment has a private entrance and check in was super easy. I love that a good number of things (drawers, canisters, light switches) are labeled. I was a wonderful touch that took the guess work out of the usual game of - What does this light switch turn on? Where are the extra blankets? What is in this canister? Wonderful bonus - for being out in the country the wifi worked great! Wonderful stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We are truly blessed to have found this “Clever Oasis”. From the moment we arrived we felt at home. We have spent 10 wonderful nights here and are very sad to be leaving. We can’t thank Anne & Joel enough for their friendly help and support throughout our stay. We were strongly recommended to use the hot tub, it was absolutely amazing. So many wonderful personal touches including delicious home made jam and a variety of very tasty snacks. We would highly recommend staying here. Five star plus. Fabulous. The absolute best hosts."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,We really enjoyed our stay over the Christmas holiday at the Clever Oasis. It was well stocked with snacks (including some yummy homemade goodies) and options for hot drinks. We were snowed in one day and were able to stay warm by the fireplace and use the wifi without any problems. There honestly wasn't anything we were missing while we were there. Anne always quickly responded to our questions and graciously allowed us to bring our nieces over for an overnight stay. We live far away so they never get to experience spending the night at our house. I really appreciated that!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! The hot tub was amazing. They even cleaned the snow off my car the next morning :)

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBNB we have ever stayed in. The Hosts have thought of everything! They had everything we needed and more, even down to providing guides and recommendations for things to do in the area to earplugs in case any sounds bother you while sleeping. Listing is accurate, but doesn't give a clear enough idea of the peacefulness of the location. Just book this location, don't hesitate. Also, the hosts are extremely quick to respond."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect place for a getaway. The AirBnB was immaculate and the views were amazing. Anne thought of everything.

Great communication with the hosts. This place is a hidden gem!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved this place. I’d give it 6 stars if I could. From the price to the extra thoughtful little things (an actually good mix of snacks, ranch dressing- something no one ever has, glasses and bowls, just everything you wish you had brought or your host had, but didn’t expect) It really was perfect. Great hot tub and the comfiest bed. Outdoor bbq & fire pit, beautiful and spacious, inside and out. This was the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had."

We would love to stay for a longer time period to enjoy the accomodations that you have put so much thought into providing! Perfect place to watch a beautiful sunset and appreciate the flowerbeds with a hot cup of tea!"

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough positive things about my stay. I came into town for the weekend to attend Vintage Days, and I’ll never want to stay anywhere other than here. Convenient location to the weekend’s activities, clean, quiet, and with literally everything I needed to have a great stay. Their instructions provided beforehand were easy to follow and helpful. The space was perfectly spotless and outfitted with so many thoughtful touches. Snacks, kitchen accessories and appliances, tv, plenty of spots to lounge and relax, comfortable bed (for those who need white noise the hum of the dehumidifier lulled me to sleep), and a fully stocked bathroom with plenty of towels, extra toiletries in case I forgot anything, literally everything I needed. Communication with my hosts was excellent and they always responded quickly. The house is easy to find and is about 10 mins from gas stations and some quick food stops. I have absolutely nothing to suggest to my hosts, nothing was missing, everything was great. This is a 10/10 Airbnb and I can’t wait to stay again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"B and his wife are great! They are very hospitable and happy to make your stay comfortable. If you forgot something, they likely have it or would help get it. The house is very clean. One would not realize it’s someone’s home if they didn’t know.
I highly recommend them as a host and great place to stay for that location. I plan to use their services again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice place! B was very considerate and helpful when needed. Will likely book again when in town to see family.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,fenced yard was great for my dog. we stayed her just for a night to get some rest and it was great. close enough to door dash food options also.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My wife and I enjoyed staying at this Airbnb very much. It was a great location for visiting family in Bucyrus. And the fenced in back yard was great for our dog. We are looking forward to our next stay here.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,excellent host
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, I and our 2 dogs needed a ""spur of the moment"" place to stay while traveling through Ohio. We found Parmjits place and reached out to her the night before. She was very quick to respond and hospitable on such short notice. She made sure to meet any need we might have. The outside of the home is quaint and well kept with a nice backyard that is private. We loved that. It was clean and toasty warm. Parmjits set up a make shift gate so we could let our dogs off leash in the yard. We are older, so sleeping is important to us. We found the beds quite uncomfortable but for a younger person they probably wouldn't mind at all. =] She had lots of soaps, shampoo, extra bathroom supplies if needed and more than enough towels. The couches were super comfy and the tv was huge. It was a very nice quick stay for us."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was the first time the home was booked and being new to the process, it was adequate. They are very responsive and willing to correct any issues which arose. I am sure as they grow in the experience, it will be a good value and comfortable place to stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly what we were looking for, thank you."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Missy and Kip were awesome!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Missy was so friendly i cant wait to stay again when im in the area!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Had to stay in this town for a funeral. We traveled with a small dog and knew we would be limited on places to stay. The host was very friendly, responsive and extremely pleasant to deal with. The home is extremely rustic and well worn. If you are looking for a place that is homey and in a quiet private area this is that. I will say that it was not the cleanest (dirty spots in bathroom, dirty dishes in the cupboard, large spots and stains on the large red couch, clothing left in the bedroom under the beds from previous stays) Outside of the cleanliness issues, we had a comfortable stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,love the homeyness of this little apartment☺️ it was cutely decorated and had the comfiest couch for sure. was upset about the pool being closed but i’m sure it’s great in the summer :)
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Missy’s place was clean and as pictured. Our stay was wonderful. Missy was very sweet and welcoming.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Missy and her husband were wonderful. Very friendly, really enjoyed sitting and just talking with them our first night, and gave great recommendations. my two young sons really enjoyed sitting with them and playing basketball with their son. very peaceful, quiet, and relaxing place/stay. If we are ever needing a place in Ohio again we will definitely come back! 10/10 recommend!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Missy was a great host and we had a great stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Missy and Kip were fantastic hosts! We played basketball, drove a golf cart, and played corn hole! We stayed for the eclipse of 2024 and she made special shirts for our family!! We had a wonderful time, Internet was plenty fast, and we were made to feel right at home!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,No complaints at all. Everything was as described. We arrived kind of late - 10:30 pm - but host was right there to show us in. Very friendly.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay in very safe area. Apartment is fully decked out for your getaway needs. Comfortable beds, gorgeous bathroom and kitchen, comfortable sitting areas both inside and on the deck. Highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Even more wonderful than anticipated. This is my fourth AirB&B in the area and the best. This will be my go to lodging from whenever I visit the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Laura was a wonderful host. We felt welcome and at home as soon as we arrived. Light from the wall of windows filled the spacious apartment. The comfortable beds and large, very clean bathroom with a makeup table, and fully stocked kitchen make this listing the perfect place for a long, relaxing getaway for 4 people.
I hope to stay again in the near future!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Treehouse was an amazing place to stay. Everything was spotless, comfortable, and really nice. Laura was a fantastic host and everything was very smooth. We would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect place to stay for a local wedding (ended up being 5 min from the reception). Excellent value for what we aid and everything was very clean! Would stay again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Laura's place was even better than expected! It was a huge space that pictures certainly did not do it justice. It was also very close to the main strip of restaurants and bars. If we are ever back in town, we will certainly stay again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Incredible experience. Beautiful location with a balcony view overlooking the river. Expansive quarters, well stocked and well kept. Walking distance to downtown. Very private and a great place to just sit and reflect. The hosts were very hospitable. Upper Sandusky is a quaint rural community with friendly and welcoming people.
I highly recommend the Treehouse."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! This is a beautiful space! Very spacious, well equipped, comfortable and very clean. The view was beautiful as well! Parking was near door. I stay at a lot of Airbnb's and this one is top notch. The hosts are wonderful. Highly recommend and look forward to returning!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The most beautiful Airbnb we’ve stayed at with a wonderful view. Definitely stay

Thank you so much!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will be using Jerri’s place throughout the summer. One best hosts we’ve ever had!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the 2nd time i stayed here and once again it was wonderful! They are always helpful and responsive. The place was clean and clutter free
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This listing is very clean and comfortable. Jerri has been great with communication. Was perfect for a week stay. Will always use when in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A comfortable place for rest and relaxation.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jerri was very responsive and so kind! We were in the area for a quick one night due to a funeral.
The apt is right by the railroad tracks but the trains were only occasional and wasn’t a bother. The apt looks just like the pictures and very clean.
The town is adorable and the locals are very nice! Whistle Stop Cafe has a good breakfast!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Let's just get this out of the way: as the listing clearly states, the property is right beside an active train track. Yes, trains go by, and yes, they blow their whistles. Even at night. So know that going in. Much to my surprise, this wasn't an issue for myself nor my parents. (There was a package of earplugs on the bedside, though none of us ended up using them.)
With that said, the place itself is huge, clean, and full of charm. The kitchen is particularly cute, and I loved the patterned sink! There were board games and activities, all of the amenities we needed, and a hearty supply of welcome snacks. About two miles away, there is a legitimately delicious Mexican restaurant (Mi Cerrito) where we had a wonderful dinner. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jerri was very kind, attentive, and friendly. She allowed us to check in early after a very long, tiring road trip with two toddlers. The space was clean and much bigger than we expected. It was perfect to be able to put the kids to bed and be able to have a separate space for adults to stay up later. There were spare toiletries and a hair dryer, games, puzzles, toys, two TVs, air mattress with built-in pump available for use, extra blankets and linens, coffee maker and snacks all available for guests which was really nice to have. Our kids enjoyed playing hide and seek since the space wraps around in a big circle!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very cute little spot! Bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. Host had everything we needed and more! Overall the experience was wonderful. Jerri was very helpful and easy to communicate with. Answered my questions and was kind! The trains were loud to me as a light sleeper, ear plugs were provided. The person staying with me didn’t notice the trains at all."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Not the first time we stayed here and won’t be the last!! This is our go-to spot when in Galion!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"If and when I get back there, I’ll be lookingbtonstaybhere again. Loved it"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is quite the gem! Wonderful experience from making a reservation all the way through our stay. Jerri was very helpful & prompt with answering questions. I loved the place & felt at home. We will definitely be staying again when in town & also recommending this place to everyone.
Thank you Jerri for allowing us to stay at your place! Merry Christmas"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The apartment was perfect, it was much larger than expected. There was a television that was connected, then a television for gaming.
Jeri had a gingerbread train for us to do for the Christmas holiday. There were a lot of snacks provided. Loved the trains. We could not have ask for a better stay in Galion."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Always love staying here! Thank you for being so hospitable, Jerri!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bed at Jerri’s place was incredibly comfy! Linens and the rest of the bedding was very soft and cozy. Location was great for being in Galion. Jerri respected our space but was super responsive when we messaged back and forth (just friendly chatting, we didn’t have any issues). There were friendly kitties outside to visit with as we came and went. We really enjoyed watching the trains."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jerri was a responsive host and had a beautiful home. I enjoyed walking my dog down the street and checking out the interesting little shops. The bedroom was huge and I tended to use it the most. There were several seating areas and a reasonably sized television. The kitchen was clean and sweetly decorated.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved it. Grandbabies loved it. Spacious, everything there you need. L9ved the trains going by. Would stay again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Jerri's very responsive and the place was spotless!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this space! Jerri provided detailed instructions and frequent communication if I had questions. She even offered thoughtful little extras like fruits and veggies from her garden. I had the pleasure of meeting her cat, Duncan, who made my stay warm and memorable. What a little love! Trains come through with regularity but, this wasn't a surprise since all of this was detailed in the reviews and description. I rather enjoy hearing a powerful locomotive roll through. It's an adrenaline rush! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and won't hesitate to book again. Can't wait!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was amazing and next time i go to visit i will be booking!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was beautiful and loved the vintage theme! Kids loved seeing the trains go by and the place was very kid friendly with toys and board games! The host is so kind and very responsive and helpful! We will definitely be coming back here next visit! 🥰
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As made clear by other reviewers and the host, it’s by a railroad track, so if you need a really quiet place to sleep this isn’t it. However it’s clean, convenient, and priced very fairly. Building is a little old and not a lot to look at outside, but inside the space it’s clean and roomy.
We stayed 4 nights and have no complaints! Also, breakfast at the Whistle Stop Cafe is spot on and it’s only a block away!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Place was very neat, comfortable and easy to find. I came in just after midnight and still didn't have an issue finding the place. The instructions were clear and detailed enough that I had no questions. Great host, highly recommend and would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were very satisfied. Jerry and Sheri went above and beyond to accommodate my family. My son and daughter-in-law and our new grandbaby needed a place quite quickly so we weren’t waiting outside with the new baby normal check-in is 3 o’clock they had the place ready within 30 minutes after the previous people stayed, she also at 10 o’clock at night gave me extra sheets asked if I needed anything else they were so friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this Airbnb. I’m already going to be looking to book it for next year‘s events. It was clean and quiet. My grandbaby slept comfortably and felt right at home, I didn’t realize it was right by the tracks, even though it clearly states it is but I never even heard the trains. It didn’t wake the kids up or to the baby it was very peaceful. I’m very grateful that we stumbled upon this place they even let us check out later the next day if needed. Looking forward to staying there again, thank you for your wonderful hospitality."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I love staying here! I accidentally locked myself out, and Jerri came to the rescue! Thank you for providing such a wonderful place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,jerri was very helpful and accommodating
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,On the first night of our 2-night stay an issue arose but Jerri responded quickly and professionally to remedy the problem. She demonstrated great customer service and dedication to rectify the situation.
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had originally booked a full apartment. some issues arose and she was unable to rent us that space, a week before we were due to check in she told me there were some problems but she had another space. This space was nice and newly remodeled, but a studio vs large multi room apartment. Jerri was great during the whole process though. Very responsive and kind. She even left us a bottle of wine for the minor inconveniences that arose.
The outdoor space was amazing & location great. We walked to Fox Winery & then down to Planet 14 for arcade games, food & drinks."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jerri was AWESOME! The apartment was HUGE and she provided so many extra amenities that were not required. She was VERY responsive when we had a question. We would definitely stay there again!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The stay was amazing the place was clean warm there were snacks upon arrival menus for local food. I was checked on a lot I loved it.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerri is one of the hosts that makes AirBnB what it is. She is local, incredibly responsive, and helpful. She is the type of person you want to support with your business if you want to support local businesses/people. You couldn't ask for a better host honestly.
The space is super unique and she takes great care of it and it is super clean. It is very spacious and has everything you will probably need. Definitely quite close to the train, but don't let that scare you off it's fun to watch them go by and experience that part of the history of the town.
If you're staying in Galion or nearby, her place should be your number one choice."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"was a beautiful space, felt right at home"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved staying here! A home away from home. The place was extremely clean and well worth the money paid. Thank you, Jerri, for sharing your wonderful place with us!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Members from our club stay here as well as myself ,definitely worth the stay and will always come back here ."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great. I feel it was cleaner than any hotel I’ve ever been to. I was smack in the middle of all my family which made it very convenient hopping from place to place. Ear plugs were there to help with the horns of the trains that are in spitting distance. With those in I couldn’t hear a thing. There wasn’t anything more I could of needed that she hasn’t already provided. Will reach out again when we’re in the area to visit.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is so cute!! Jerri is so attentive to the needs of her guests, and the apartment is cared for beautifully. I’ll definitely be staying here again in the future!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay and last minute! Jerry’s place was very quirky but had all the essentials. Very quick to answer questions and a flawless check in. Would be really good place if you like watching trains too!!! Would definitely stay again!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. The trains were definitely loud but neat to watch during awake hours. The apartment is spacious and the bedroom is amazing! Jerri was very accommodating.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place & cute town
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We very happy with our stay. The train did not bother us at all. I would like to say that when we first pulled up we were a little concerned. The outside area and check in room both need a little work, but once inside we were extremely happy! Extremely clean, so much room and wonderful little touches throughout, such as earplugs, plenty of towels, wash cloths, snacks, coffee, tea, basically anything you could possibly need. We also enjoyed that it was within walking distance to several bars and restaurants. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A+
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This quaint condo was perfect for my husband and I. It was very clean and there were many extra amenities. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very spacious, and clean! Communication was great as well."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you so very much for having us. The town of Galion had amazing hospitality for us on Saturday night. We met so many new friends and had a great time. Thank you for having us. The apartment was very nice, accessible and comfortable. I felt like I was able to relax and not worry about a thing. The bed is comfortable and the apartment was very spacious. Thank you again for having us."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful apartment! Everything was well organized and clean. Jerri was a great host!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay and very spacious!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was great staying, we appreciate you turning the light on And letting us in late after a long day traveling, the house was cool from the ac, comfortable and clean!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not going to say anything substantial not already said. You probably noticed from the map that you don't have a lot of choices for (at least) 50 miles in any direction. Jeri could use this fact to gouge and/or be lazy. She doesn't.
If you grew up near the tracks (like I did, on these same tracks the next town up), or in Manhattan, or on a freeway, you'll sleep great. If you didn't - like my wife - you won't. The bed was great but it doesn't matter. Earplugs won't matter. Getting drunk won't matter. Jamming icepicks in your eardrum won't matter. The trains are coming often and all night and they want you to know it.
The ""location"" and ""value"" ratings are completely subjective so I gave them 5 stars because it's not fair to Jeri. What is ""location"" in north central Ohio? What is ""value""? Those (and all the others for that matter) should have the option to bypass.
However, the other categories are not subjective. Jeri is awesome. The room is awesome. Period. Do it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and very clean! Jerri was super responsive and helpful.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jerri was communicative and the apartment was comfortable. Loved the area it was placed, nice little location downtown and the stay was seamless. Will keep this place in mind for our next festival!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean, the host was very nice. The only negative for us was the train noise at very late and very early hours of the day. My son was there for a race and he got very little rest those days. Jerri is extremely nice and she wanted to accommodate my son as much as possible but it was not possible to block the train noise which tracks were literally no more than 20 feet away from the house. The town was nice, it felt like going back in time, very good neighborhood. We appreciate that the house was very clean, this is always a plus for us."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was beautifully clean and comfortable. It was well appointed and very convenient to our activities at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Track. Jerri, our host was very helpful."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic place to stay. It was far more spacious than I anticipated. I felt like I could really ""stretch out."" The bedroom was huge and the bed was so comfortable I wanted to take it home with me.
The whole thing was immaculately clean. The kitchen was very well equipped for temporary lodgings.
The trains seemed like a bit of a nuisance at first, but I soon grew to enjoy hearing them and watching them rumbling past. If you have young children, they would probably get a kick out of it!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were very kind and thoughtful. The place was cute and clean and we had everything we needed. Easy drive to Mid Ohio.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jerri was fantastic host, all of our needs were met. The condo featured some special decore for kids. The pictues do not do enough justice for how huge this place is! Wish i had gotten around to using the whirlpool tub! Next time for sure!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jerri was a great host! From thoughtful touches to great communication, she delivered everything you could want from a host. Her space was beautiful and very clean as well. I highly recommend for your stay in the Bucyrus/Galion region!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jerri's house was perfect for my needs. The train theme took me back to my childhood and yes there are trains! I highly recommend Jerri's house and hope to be back soon.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,beautiful large space with awesome views of passing trains.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our sisters stay was everything we hoped for! Relaxing and rejuvenating! The space is just a described and very welcoming! The extra touches were around every turn!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Good price, private, peacefully and relaxing."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and peaceful describes the accommodations. We were in town for a funeral service and were not able to take advantage of all the outside games and fireplace that were available, but there were many. I did have time to sit and read in the sunroom and what a great place to relax. The cabin had everything we needed and more. Our stay was very nice, and we were there for 3 nights. Janel must have planned the four deer we saw walk across the open area in front of the cabin. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was a quiet cabin in the woods. Easy to get to. The fenced in area was a plus.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This cabin is so charming and has so much character! It had everything we needed. Janel was very accommodating and kind.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As we were visiting family, we knew the surroundings. The best part, fenced in yard for furbabies!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"As advertised, very private, surrounded by trees and singing birds attracted to the feeding boxes. Check-in and entry were a breeze. Good communication. Kitchen well organized and stocked with some Keurig coffee, snacks and beverages. Janel had an extensive notebook of points of interest and places to dine in the area. We were there to observe the total eclipse, and mainly ate in the cabin, but I did make a stop at 8 Sisters Bakery on way home. The location of the cabin was only a couple of miles from Mount Gilead, and maybe 15 miles from Marion. Several parks in area.
Great porch to relax on, as well as a fire ring out amongst the trees with chairs. Living room is large, two couches and a chair. Huge non-functioning but very interesting stone fireplace on end.
The bedrooms are small, but that comes with the rustic nature of the place. Clean bed linens and towels. Plenty of blankets and pillows.
A great escape and place of solitude from the hectic pace of modern life"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful quaint cottage. Definitely worth the stay, my fiancé and I will be returning this summer to enjoy the outdoors in warmer weather! Thank you so much."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Whetstone cabin is truly a gem. It is set in a quiet and tranquil area that has a great view of the woods. We were able to see deer, watch squirrels climb the trees and hear the birds sing. Janel does a wonderful job of having those often forgotten items on hand and made sure there was adequate supplies of everyday household items. The cabin was clean and homey. We enjoy our visit greatly!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very quiet and peaceful spot. Woke up to some baby deers outside which the kids loved to see. Would definitely recommend or return if in the area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The host was always available for our questions. She sent out a very long list of this to do in the area from food to different places to spend time at throughout the day. I would definitely recommend it 👌
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this location for a weekend getaway. It was very clean, comfortable, and Janel has thought of everything! I brought my dog, who thoroughly enjoyed the walking path beside the house down into the woods with me. The surroundings were just what I needed. I nestled up on the couch and viewed the outdoors while sipping coffee and journaling. Janel is super responsive and loves to make you feel welcome. Thank you!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is whimsical, we loved every second of our stay. It’s something out of a story book. We could’ve stayed forever! So accommodating, our teens had plenty to do while we were there. Will definitely stay again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The sunroom is the best part! Very relaxing and great for reading. Janel was very responsive and gave lots of recommendations for things to in the area!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Janel thought of everything! This was a last minute trip for us, so things were forgotten. However, Janel had it!
Awesome selection of games to choose from. She even has noise makers in the bedrooms, and fans! (I love a good white noise when I sleep).
The peaceful surroundings with some bird seed and feeder off back was the best! We spent an hour each morning just watching the silly birds. We even got to see deer and chipmunks!!!
Home was impeccable and decorated wonderfully!
Marion is our home town (live in FL now) so we make the trip often. We have now found our home away from home. Thank you Janel for opening up your space for us. I’m glad you went with your vision and created this experience for all to enjoy on Airbnb!
One of the best I’ve stayed in…and I’ve stayed in a lot. ♥️"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Host is very helpful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful and clean oasis. The perfect getaway.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an awesome time staying at Janel’s cabin. It was our first time away from our one year old so it was nice to have a place to feel comfortable and at home in. Janel was very responsive and accommodating!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was my 2nd stay at this location and won’t be my last. Janel is very responsive and accommodating. My family and I love staying at this cozy cabin.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little cabin with a beautiful view of the woods out back. It was a very comfortable stay, was very clean, and had everything we needed. The host provided plenty of information about our stay, the surrounding area, and even left for snack for us, which was lovely."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Janel’s place was FABULOUS. We hosted our family for Christmas here, and the place came fully decorated. It was so cozy and festive. The cottage feels very secluded and private but also just a couple minutes from amenities and local shops and restaurants in town. We hosted a big family dinner and the kitchen was surprisingly well equipped for an Airbnb. The place reminded us of Airbnb’s from years ago when hosts cared about their guest’s experience. We’re coming back next year."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Omggg amazing place ❤️
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a nice cabin for spending time with family. Thank you for being super responsive.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,10/10 recommend if you need a comfy getaway from the hustle bustle of the city this is the perfect place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the cabin. It was very homey and decorated beautifully. Janel was a pleasure to work with; very responsive to any questions and so helpful. I look forward to my next stay there."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a nice time. It is a really nice cottage. We love the Christmas parade and downtown. Very cozy my boyfriend grew up in the country and felt right at home. Totally misses it💜.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Cabin had everything we needed. Beautiful countryside. Would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Janel’s cottage is beautiful. Just what we wanted for the weekend. It’s easily accessible and has a bit of trails in the back to explore. We could not use the bon fire as it was raining but did enjoy the sun room. Cottage is exactly as described and has everything you might need to disconnect from noise!
Janel was extremely responsive and answered all our queries quickly. We plan to stay here again in summer 2024 :)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and i wanted to get away for our 51st wedding anniversary and felt we were very lucky to find this place, It was a wonderful place to get away from it all, and just relax in the beautiful peaceful setting in this very clean , comfortable lovely cottage. We enjoyed visiting nearby, Mount Gilead, and also Marion, Ohio. It was wonderful that at this place they had a large fenced in area for our dogs to play. Also, the cottage was very well equipped, and we found nothing lacking. We have been staying in Airbnb‘s for almost 15 years and this is one of the nicest I think we have ever stayed in. We would love to come back and highly recommend it!
Only one problem with our visit.. we didn’t stay long enough!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is the perfect place for a getaway!!
It’s close enough to town to have some activities to do.
But far enough away to feel like you’re alone!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay and we all just love it here. Janel always goes above and beyond and responds so quickly. We had a small issue last year and she responded quickly, kindly and generously. She creates a comfortable space where you feel at home and is generously accommodating. The fire pit area is wonderful with comfortable seats and wood provided (so nice !!). The details are everywhere - drink holder stands at the fire, an active bird feeder at the patio door, the encouraging decor, and local honey for sale in the kitchen. Close to the state park- always worth the visit. The cabin is Quiet, peaceful and comfy. We just know our stay will be just great. Highly recommend Janel and Whetstone woods."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,couldn't have asked for a better. Loved the place hopeful will be able to come back.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful cabin! We felt right at home and everything was so clean and comfortable. We loved being able to bring our dogs and look forward to another stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is very rustic! It’s sits off in the woods and made us GA folks feel right at home. It isn’t a space for a large family, but it is, however, perfect for a little family of maybe 3-4 people. The owner is in the process of installing new antique doors on the conjoining bedrooms. I have no doubt they will go perfectly with her rustic style."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We had an unusual circumstance where the number of people staying changed slightly due to a bad storm that swept through the area. Heather responded to my message immediately, was kind, considerate and courteous. Her house was adorable and comfortable. We felt like we were at home and checkout was explained clearly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our daughter’s college graduation and Heather went above and beyond adding touches from the university, including a flag out front and a dozen cookies of the schools logo. It was the icing on the cake to an amazing weekend. The house was perfect and gave us a spot to rest and recharge. If you are in Tiffin I would highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This was a perfect location for our stay during our daughter’s graduation. Lots of space and a perfect location.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Quiet neighborhood and a house with plenty of space puts this spot high on our list of places to stay in Tiffin. Clean with comfy beds and couches, it was perfect for a weekend visiting our daughter at Heidelberg. Host was great and super responsive. Would highly recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Location is in quiet and very safe neighborhood. Easy to find. We loved our stay. ❤️
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It's a great house with a nice location, close to Hedges Boyer park and downtown Tiffin. Everything was very clean and comfortable!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"The place was wonderful. We had six people from around Ohio gather at Heather’s Airbnb. It was a working retreat and worked out great. So nice and clean, plenty of room and a very nice neighborhood.
Heather was willing to work with us and also responded quickly.
Highly recommend this beautiful place."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful little cottage with plenty of space for our family. The beds and furniture were comfortable and the neighborhood is very peaceful. We hope to return again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely house! Great, very responsive host. Would stay again!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,This house was perfect for our needs. Convenient location and super cozy!
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Nice, clean cozy house."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a great place for our family.
Although it snowed and the weather was cold when we visited they back yard would be a great space to hang out with the family otherwise. The house was really great we enjoyed our stay! We will use this place again on future trips if it’s available."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heathers cottage is adorable. Well situated and close to everything in town on a beautiful street. We were able to enjoy jogs through the beautiful park near by and Heidelberg’s campus. Comfortable beds and lots of space. We will be returning when we come back to town.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booked for comedians that performed at Tiffin Amvets. Great location. Clean place, communication was great, no problems!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a weekend getaway with friends! Comfortable beds and great amenities with nice touches throughout the home. It was super clean! We will be back for another Heidelberg event.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house. Would definitely recommend and use again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town for Parent’s Weekend and wanted to try something other than the local hotel options. Heather’s home was perfect! Enough room for everyone to spread out, clean kitchen for us to make meals in and a convenient location for the University and downtown attractions. We’ll definitely come back next time we’re in town!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home! Great communicator! If you’re going to Tiffin, check her AirBnB place first before you book elsewhere!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean home. Thank you.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our 7 nights at Heather's home. It was clean, quiet and had plenty of space. The neighborhood and nearby park provided outdoor exercise options that were much appreciated. The kitchen was very large, Wifi was fast and we had everything we needed. Heather was very accessible and responded right away to all requests. Our only area for improvement is the outside lighting. We arrived late and the area was very dark and the home address number was not visible from the street, making it hard to find. Once we arrived at the right house, the entry code worked perfectly."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful place to stay. Heather is the BEST! Always there if you need or want anything. So glad I found this house, it had everything we needed and then some. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really cute house. Super clean and great location. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heather’s home is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. We could walk to the city’s main park in one direction and downtown in the other direction. It is thoughtfully appointed with clean and comfortable furniture, sheets and towels. The kitchen is well-equipped with everything we needed to make some simple dishes. It felt like home. We also liked the cottage details of the home with its hardwood floors and glass doorknobs. Heather was friendly and very responsive to our few questions. We stayed for two consecutive long weekends. We have Heather’s home at the top of our list for the next time we visit the area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a nice homey house. Heather is a great host. Very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. The bedrooms are upstairs so if climbing stairs is hard for you it may be difficult to stay there. But we had plenty of room for 6 of us. The air conditioning doesn’t work as well upstairs but it was a very hot weekend but there are ceiling fans in every room. I would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again if needed when in the area.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,I reserved this Airbnb for some of the out of town bridesmaids I had coming in for the wedding! This was absolutely perfect and I could not have found a better place! Heather was awesome and super helpful and on top of everything.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"I can't really describe how welcoming and friendly Heather was to myself and my guests. Sharing with us an atmosphere of warmth. Heather even went as far as acquiring accessories and decorations that fit the theme of our visit! Unexpected, but appreciated. Many thanks!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Will consider for next family getaway
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,"This is a vintage home with the charm of all that goes with an old home - old wiring, extremely creaky floors in the whole house (you can't take a step without everyone in the house hearing you.) only 2 electrical plugs in each bedroom, and dark rooms. Bring extension cords if you have multiple items to plug in. The two rooms off the kitchen and living room have a slightly lower floor that is easy to trip on, and would benefit from having colored tape or paint marking the difference in floor height. The kitchen has reasonable space and amenities, but be aware that the dishwasher has rusted racks that will leave rust on dishes. Heather was responsive on a couple matters that i needed to contact her about and the house is located in an older but safe and nicely cared for neighborhood."

There was plenty of room for our party of 5 (6 for one night).

Everything that was said in the description and in the photos is exactly what we seen! It was beautiful In the photos that I thought to myself? This has got to be fake! But once we arrived we knew we were in for a real treat! My families face lit up when we seen everything and explored around. We got to fish, play games, grill, light the fire pit up and make smores! Not to mention the free freshest eggs you’ll ever eat! Definitely worth the price! The owners were immaculate, very responsive, so kind! and the nicest people I’ve ever met! We also met Amish families! So kind and friendly! It definitely felt like home for sure! We didn’t want to leave, but we had to. We’ll definitely be back! Thanks again Jeff and Deb"

The weather wasn’t the best for us but there is a nice fire ring right outside if you get the chance to use it.
Food options within 20-45 minutes away depending on what you want.
This next comment is NOT a negative note but I want to make sure to point it out because I missed it in the (very accurate) photos. There isn’t a kitchen sink or stove.

There was an issue with the heating going out right before we arrived, but Lindsay and her husband were great about communicating with us and provided an alternate heating source for our stay, which worked relatively well considering how cold it was outside.

The hardest part about this place was picking a spot to picnic, we would love to stay again and 100% recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The barn itself, the surrounding land, and hosts were all amazing. Easy to find, easy check in. The property/land is extremely well maintained—hosts are putting in a lot of effort in and outside the living space. Fire pit and hammocks are a great perk. It’s a very serene place.
Bathroom, floors, surfaces, etc—spotless. One of the cleaner Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. Powerful AC unit, everything functioned well. Comfy bed, furniture. The space is used efficiently without clutter. Seemingly safe and very quiet area.
Hosts quick to respond—I had messed something up with my booking and they were super helpful and cool about it. Overall a great value."

Would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a nice place to stay, and we’re planning stay here again in the future when we visit our friends."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,I would definitely recommend this place. It was perfect all the way around from the inside and out. I loved that we could have s’mores by the very nice fire place out back. Over all it was perfect. 100 out of 10💯

We also loved that there was not one pull couch but two so she had more then one option of where to sleep. This was our first time to the area but we will be back next year and would definitely stay here again !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Quiet and private and had everything we needed.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"100% recommend staying here. We drove from Columbus for a quiet weekend in the country and Erinwood was just that! The barn is beautiful and cozy, it’s the perfect place to get away from busy city life.
We loved sitting out by the fire in the hammocks while listening to the sounds of nature, and we even saw some deer! We will definitely be returning again!
Thank you for the amazing weekend, Lindsay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful property, very cozy home with lovely views of nature and wildlife!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The building they've built is great! I was blown away by how affordable and enjoyable the little loft barn was. Everything you need for an Airbnb with a cool private hammock/firepit area. Even had coffee you can make yourself.
The hosts were extremely friendly and helped with anything we could need. We had a crazy weekend and they were very flexible about check-in. You have a private driveway entrance so it's very easy to come and go as you need without feeling like you're being a bother to the main property.
Beautiful building and property with a view of some horses. Great place to find some quite and relax."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. There are 24 steps to get up to the loft so be aware. A king bed would have been nice but mattress was comfortable. I would stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Arthur’s place was very clean, good internet connection and close to a nice little ice cream/sandwich shop. Arthur was very responsive to questions/concerns and friendly."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Cute home that’s a short walk to downtown. Bathroom towels were thick and soft. Beds were very comfortable and bedding felt high quality. I wrote down the brand of sheets so I can purchase a set for my house :) Kitchen equipped with the basics to make just about any meal work. Was easy to feel right at home.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient location with easy access in and out

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Missy's was excellent. Right on the edge of town, her place is a great place to stay if you find yourself in Bucyrus. I highly recommend staying at Missy's."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Missy was very nice to take us in through her home rather than around to the back entrance because of the cold weather and lateness of our arrival time.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable bed and spacious living room. Missy was very responsive and friendly.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Missy is an outstanding host who instantly makes you feel like part of her family. Her home in Bucyrus is the perfect place for a genuine home-away-from-home experience. The warm welcome and friendly atmosphere, complemented by her two delightful dogs, make every return to the house a joy. For a personalized and cozy stay, Missy's place is the top choice in Bucyrus, OH"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Missy’s place was clean, spacious, and comfortable! She was very helpful and accommodating with our two little ones.
The kitchen was fully stocked and convenient!
The only thing I would add is to be wary if you are sensitive to smell as she has used a lot of air fresheners in this space."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town on business and this was a great alternative to a Hotel. it was nicer, cleaner, and less expensive. There is a great pool at the location that we were not able to take advantage of due to our business. We would recommend this place and will definitely stay here again if we come back to Bucyrus."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, great hosts, highly recommend staying there!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay in Bucyrus! Missy was great to communicate with and very nice!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay at the Blue Bird Inn and it was as wonderful as our last stay. We were in town for a graduation. Had dinner at the Mexican restaurant across the alley and daily coffee at the trailer next door. Best cold brew ever! The BB inn was spacious and tidy. We will stay when we are in town for the next graduation.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is great in Crestline, and the place is very cute."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Adorable place for a getaway if you are seeking to stay in the area. Lots of room for a comfortable stay. Walking distance to fun food/drink places. There was a Crestline city sign that said “all tracks lead here!” And they aren’t kidding, so just be aware that many loud trains do pass through the area. Would continue to recommend the Blue Bird Inn."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Worked out great while visiting family in town. Location was great!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"thanks for the well prepared bathrooms bedrooms and the handy items stocked in the kitchen.
sure fit the bill for a quick stop overnite and was a good value. one happy family ! the weavers"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Our family loved our stay! It was great to hang out together in this beautiful house.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This was a beautiful house, with so much space. We stayed here with 6 people and we were extremely comfortable. There were lots of cute snacks and bathroom essentials left for us. The living room is comfortable and beautiful, and if you have kids there is a separate living room/hang out area they can play or hang out in! The parking lot in back made it easy to unload and load our bags, and there is a coffee shop right next door. Noise did not travel throughout the house, so even with one couple waking up very early to cook breakfast, the rest of us were able to sleep peacefully. This home looked exactly like the photos, was extremely clean, and decorated beautifully. I would absolutely stay again if I was passing through the area. 10/10"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice house and good communication. We would stay here again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at Olivia's place was fantastic. The cleanliness and comfort of the accommodation exceeded my expectations. Being conveniently located near an adorable coffee shop and amazing Mexican restaurant made dining out a breeze. What truly made the experience memorable was Olivia’s prompt response and attention to detail. Every aspect of the stay was thoughtfully considered, making it feel like a home away from home. I highly recommend staying here for an enjoyable and hassle-free experience."""
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,I recommend this place! Clean and nice comfortable house.
2024-02-01,4,Group trip,"Great space. Very cozy, plenty of space, comfortable beds. Loved having the coffee shop next door and being able to walk to local restaurants. The train station being so close was both charming yet also a bit loud during the night. We had a bit of a snafu with accessing pots and pans, but Olivia was very helpful and accommodating in assuring we had a positive experience. This was a great space for our team retreat and we would absolutely recommend the space if you are needing a spacious place to spend a couple days in for rest or relaxation."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Bluebird Inn! It was very spacious, clean and in a great location! We will definitely be going back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Olivia helped to make our Christmas dreams come true while visiting family out of state. Her attention to detail is in matched.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay, very cozy."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and responsive host. The home was very comfortable and clean. The only concern was the constant train coming through the town several times a day and night.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,My daughters and I enjoyed a little getaway at this lovely place. Having several places to eat and a coffee shop all within a short walk was so nice! We would very much recommend this unique place for a relaxing time away. 😊
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,The house was ideal for our connecting with another couple - plenty of space to hang out and converse and play games.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay, right next to a wonderful coffee shop. Couple of restaurants right around the corner."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Blue Bird in is the BEST air bnb I have ever stayed in. It was a absolutely adorable, matched the description perfectly and was so comfortable.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Super Host!

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,it was a great place to stay as I visited family in my home town
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really nice place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Olivia is the hostess with the mostest. If you forgot I bet she remembered for you. Quick to respond kind and very helpful. The coffee shop beside the inn is delicious. We had our son’s wedding at The Hub and the location of the inn is convenient not only for events at The Hub but walking distance to anywhere in Crestline. Such a cute little town.
If I find myself in this area you bet The Bluebird Inn is where I’ll stay!!!
Thank you Olivia and Friend"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay when at Mid Ohio Raceway. Close by and great little town with food/drink in walking distance.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,It was a beautiful place. Neighborhood very quaint.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We loved the Blue Bird Inn. Great location and we explored all the little food places around town. Blue Bird Inn was clean…lots of details that make life easier. We sure appreciated everything. Beds were comfy and tons of space for all 5 of us. We will be back!! Olivia was such a wonderful communicator no matter what time or day it was!! She was terrific.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved staying at Olivia’s place! It was so cute and very accommodating for me and my family as we were there for a wedding.
The area is super cute and friendly also! Loved getting coffee at the coffee shop next door that was out of a trailer!
Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your home Olivia! It was perfect!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a graduation and couldn’t have been happier with our accommodations. Everything was as described. Not a huge list of items to be done at check out. Next door to the cutest coffee shop ever with amazing coffee. Had dinner at the mexican restaurant just a very short walk though the courtyard.
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with kids,"The host was very responsive. The location is great and the house itself is well decorated and comfortable. I gave this a lower rating overall because the wifi only worked intermittently and created problems for us with our baby monitors and business calls. Additionally, doors in the bedrooms and bathrooms use old doorknobs and often didn’t close and none of them had locks. This created some interesting situations to say the least. Additionally, the home doesn’t have a central air system. Some rooms had their own A/C system but some didn’t. The room our daughter was in ran 60 degrees and our sons room was 75 degrees. These didn’t diminish the responsiveness of the host and the overall location. The rest was great."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A perfect stay!! I have been traveling back to this area for the last 10 years and I have always stayed with family, but after this weekend, I’m happy to say I will be staying here! It had so much space, and it was so cozy. The host was so responsive and extremely friendly. The walking distance was awesome for the entire weekend! Can’t wait to come back."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"This cute old house was a perfect spot for us to stay while close by for a wedding. We had 4 couples and the home accommodated us great for lunch and getting ready before the wedding, sleep was super comfy, and then we all had breakfast together. beautiful house, coffee shop next door and the whole tiny town is walkable."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Really enjoyed our stay!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Terrific place close to a nice small town atmosphere
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a beautiful house! We did not want to leave. Felt right at home and Olivia was kind and responsive.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place! Great location even had snacks for us at the house!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue Bird was immaculate and beautifully decorated. The perfect place to entertain family while
visiting the area. I've stayed in a lot of Air bnb's, VRBO's, BnB's, you name it and this was one of the best!
Will definitely stay there again!!
Thank you Olivia
Cathy Meals"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"The blue bird inn was an exceptional respite for a lovely evening with friends. Her place was warm and inviting, flawlessly decorated, and had some added nice-ities like snacks, water, and toiletries. The coffee shop next door was conveniently located and quiet as well. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a stay in mid-ohio!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"This place was very clean, peaceful and comfortable. Just within 10 minutes there’s a mall and restaurants near by. In the future I will rebook a stay here 🙏🏽"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"the building was recently updated with a warm decor similar to a classic bed and breakfast.
the place was spotless and the host had left local activities, small snacks, and clear
instructions for the house
very spacious and each groupwas able to sleep comfortably
if I ever returned to Crestline I would stay again"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"What a gem in the heart of Crestline! The inside in gorgeous and larger than you think. We loved the open kitchen/ living area.
Great location within walking distance to a great Mexican restaurant, local shopping, coffee shop and an event center.
We are already planning our next weekend stay!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was great! The instructions to park and get in were very clear. The house itself was WONDERFUL. The first thing I noticed was how clean the entire house was. Every bedroom, bathroom, and room in between was filled with small touches to make you feel at home and cozy. So many blankets in every room, just in time for the beautiful snowfall we got. We had two families, 4 kids, 4 adults. The kids had their own hang out area, and the adults were able to hang in the other living room without hearing too much from them! It was the perfect balance. Olivia did a wonderful job ensuring there were board games for everyone to play. I wish we could have stayed longer. BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE AMAZING COFFEE SHOP NEXT DOOR! This place was one of the best surprises!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife, son, and I stayed at this lovely family farm home last year and loved it! So of course, when we came back this year, this is where we wanted to stay again.
We had the pleasure of meeting Sue and Sharon as they welcomed us when we arrived. It was wonderful getting to meet them and learning more about the home!
They added a full bath downstairs, which is modern, trendy, and beautifully done! It was great to have a 2nd full bath in the home!
My wife and I love how homey and welcoming the house feels with all of the family photos and comfy furniture!
When we come back to Shelby to visit family, we plan to stay here again!
Thanks again for another wonderful stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This farmhouse was everything described and more! Old farmhouse with beautiful woodwork and floors. Corn and soybean fields surrounding the house with great breezes blowing across the 2 porches...side and front. Side porch was great for morning coffee or evening drink. The linens were gorgeous and there's a brand new bathroom making the downstairs bedroom an en suite! The double garage is set up as a large party room and there is a picnic table and fire ring outside. Plus at this time of year, there is sweet corn!!!! The hosts were just as amazing...did not meet Sue but Sharon and Kevin, Tom, and Chuck were incredibly welcoming and accomodating...although we lacked nothing. I am so glad I was able to book this house for my high school reunion! It was a peaceful resting place in between events and it added to the pleasant nostalgia of coming home. Thanks to the Alt family for sharing their home!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely home in the country but close to town. Very peaceful and a great place to visit with family. Many bedrooms, large kitchen, great yard, and fire pit"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place is amazing, definitely coming back. My family and I stayed during the Inkcarceration festival in Mansfield, and the weather was so hot. so it was really nice to go home to a cool, peaceful farmhouse. the beds were so comfy, definitely good for resting after standing all day. the location was perfect, with the beautiful sunset and quietness, and the porches were great to sit outside at night. we really enjoyed our stay, definitely a cozy farmhouse and definitely enough room for the family."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for sharing your lovely family home! It in itself was interesting. Loved the quiet. The garage is nicely set up for eating outside. We enjoyed an evening around the fire pit. Bed was comfy. Kitchen was well equipped. It was perfect for us.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Just as described. Beautiful old family farm home, set in the country amidst the cornfields. Peaceful and relaxing."

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Sue's family farmhouse was a great place for us to stay in Shelby. Close to our project site and plenty of room for our team of carpenters. We recommend to families and groups. We look forward to staying again next week! Thanks for a relaxing place to stay after long days working off-site. Diana
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home is filled with so much love! We came back to Shelby to introduce our son to my side of the family and this home was the perfect place for my 10-month old son to meet his Great Grandparents, Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for our needs and had every detail covered! We had a family reunion nearby and there were 5 adults and one toddler and had more than enough room. The hosts are wonderful and gave us a tour of the home and showed us where everything was and we enjoyed the peace and quiet and sitting by the fire. We will definitely be back!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home for the age. The views are out of this world. The beds were comfy, the garage set up was great, and the space was huge! You need to appreciate a very old farm house with such character. We loved it. 7 adults, 1 teenager, and a waddler had plenty of room."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Very cozy nice place. Definitely recommend.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful family and house. Very clean and well maintained. We truly enjoyed our weekend get-a-way and highly recommend to those that would like to visit the area.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay, the property has a great yard that's a cute little swing that the kids were able to enjoy. It's in a quiet area. It's an older farmhouse with lots of character and plenty of room to move around. We really enjoyed our stay!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family was traveling to Ohio for a wedding. We had four adults and one toddler in our party, we knew a hotel room for all of us wouldn’t be ideal. We were so thankful to find Sue’s family farm house! It was the perfect fit for us. We were happy to within a 20 minute drive to the town where the wedding was. The farmhouse had a lot of unique characteristics including a small nursery off of the one bedroom that was perfect for us. We enjoyed our evenings on the front porch watching people with motorized gliders fly from a near by airport. We enjoyed breakfast at a near by diner in the town of Shelby called Ted & Ali’s Corner Cafe. There was also a small marker near by, Gwirtz, that had all our other needs. We loved the fact the family is preserving the house that clearly holds many memories for them! Bottom line, we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,awesome farm house with tons of room great host always in communication with us to make are stay wonderful

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This country farm house was perfect for our visit to Shelby. Seven in our party with plenty of room to spare. The house was clean and attractive inside (fresh flowers from the garden to geet us, no less!), the outside was just beautiful! In my opinion, the hosts went above and beyond any I have encountered before. I highly recommend the farm house to other travelers and hope we ourselves get to go back another time."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The farmhouse was beautiful! Full of pictures of the family that owns it. The beds were so comfortable, it’s so peaceful. My family had an amazing time. Sue greeted me earlier than the normal check in time and it was greatly appreciated. She is a wonderful host. Couldn’t see myself coming back and not staying there again."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This farm house is not only in the midst of an active farm, providing scenic vistas wherever you look, it is also like stepping back in time. The house is filled with family photos, art, and other decor. The front and side porches are a great place to enjoy your morning coffee."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a really nice stay here with family. The house is very comfortable and has so much character! My parents arrived before me and met Sue (and her sister?) upon check-in and said they were very nice. I messaged Sue a couple of times while we were there and she was very responsive.

2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sue and her family have a nice old home to stay, you will relax and enjoy being in the country! We did!! We came to Mid Ohio for the Indy race and wanted someplace to relax and enjoy down time away from the track, this fit the bill perfectly. Sue met us at the house and showed us around the house and even offered us some of their sweet corn which was growing behind the house. That should tell you what kind and considerate people Sue and her family are. The house is loaded with old photos of the family and it was enjoyable to see them and how this house has so many memories for them. The track is about 25 min. away and is an easy drive. I would definitely stay here again!
Thank you Sue, and family!"
2018-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The house had everything we needed. We were a group of 8 and were very comfortable there. A baby pool and sprinkler was provided for the kids to cool off since it was so hot and that became their favorite thing to do while we were there. Sue was super responsive to our questions and was more than helpful. We would definitely stay there again when in town.

If you want a relaxing stay in the country with lots of rooms and great place to sit on the porches (yes, plural) to sit enjoy morning coffee or late night drink, it was perfect. would highly recommend it if you're in the area and are looking for a place to stay. like being at home but while you're away; forget the hotel and come here instead!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Inn a Schoolhouse is a beautiful place to stay. The amenities are better than a hotel. Plenty of coffee, good shampoo, conditioner, and lotion, soft toilet paper, plentiful blankets and pillows, sound machines, and towel warmer. The attention to detail is remarkable. The best part is you don’t have to clean at all! A truly rare AirBnb that is worth the price."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a local music festival at the Ohio state reformatory and this location was perfect, just 15 minutes from the event.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very unique building. We appreciate restored historical sites since we renovated a 1900 home several years ago. The decorations and details were inviting and comfortable. Our stay was short but we enjoyed the entire experience, from the outside seating watching for deer, the game area, the comfortable bed and couch. We were looking for a brief getaway from life and this was perfect. The place was super clean. My husband kept saying, ""this place blows me away."" Thank you so much, Bob and Traci!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We needed a private, peaceful place for a quick getaway overnight and this place was perfect for us. Right at an hour drive from our home in Columbus, it was easy to get to and felt like we were world’s away from the city. We didn’t use everything available to us, but we didn’t need to. Being able to sit overlooking the scenery for an extended period of time was just what we needed. Will come back again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this stay!
Bob and Traci are great hosts. It is clear that they have put time, effort and energy into making their school house something to remember. My wife and I are teachers and I just finished the year last week. This was a great place to celebrate our anniversary and school being out for the summer!
Very clear instructions and communication throughout the whole experience. Thoughtfulness throughout the whole place: motion sensor lights around the steps, labels on light switches, a concierge binder filled with local info and recommendations, a towel warmer! I could go on….
The pictures are accurate, but don’t give the space justice. It’s awesome!
10/10 would recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bob and Traci know how to host guests! I was shook when we did not have to clean dishes, take out the trash, or gather towels prior to check-out - thank you for this! The space is exactly as depicted and described. The bed was large, clean, and comfy. The massage space was greatly appreciated! It is set-up very well w/ ambient sounds, pretty lights, and a towel warmer. The bathrooms were spotless and updated - big bathtub upstairs. The outdoor space was so magical - all the lights at night, water fountains, little fish pond, and farmy nature to take in. The house kitty joined us outside for morning coffee and snuggles - probably the highlight of the stay :) I have already recommended this schoolhouse to all my friends! Please stay here - you will not regret it! Thanks for the most relaxing stay, Bob and Traci!"

The location was peaceful and the space had everything we needed. The massage room was so spa-like with lotion, fountain, robes, and a towel warmer. The shower had great pressure and the baseboard heaters were very responsive. The little electric fireplace was a nice touch. The place had everything needed for an easy stay- coat rack, luggage rack, great notes throughout the house. The kitchen is small, but has everything needed. Would definitely return. It would be perfect as a location for 2 couples to hang out- one in the Teachers lounge and one in the Inn at the schoolhouse, so you could really utilize the poker table! Thanks for a great, unique stay!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"From the location to the actual school house itself was phenomenal!! Highly recommend this place to anyone for a one of a kind experience.
