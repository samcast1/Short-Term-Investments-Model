2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb was clean and stocked with just about everything we could possibly need or ask for.
Our host Jade was very friendly, accommodating and hospitable and at the same time left us to enjoy our privacy.
The location was easy to find, very peaceful and beautiful with scenic lake views and beautiful sunrises and sunsets and active lake nature surroundings. Great quiet space to work or relax . Plenty available to do inside or out . The space is a small studio type but large and roomy enough that you don‚Äôt feel cramped or lacking.

Jade's place was cozy, clean, and had everything we needed for our family of 4. We had just enough room with 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The bed is very comfortable and plenty of warm bedding. We used the couch to sleep on because it was so comfortable with out pulling out the sofa bed and then used a air mattress for another bed option. It was a little snug at bedtime, but worked great! We only had a 20ish minute drive to Notre Dame football game, which was very convenient. Highly recommend a stay any time of the year at Jades!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tonya was such an awesome host and I must say, her place is a complete steal. I think she is being modest with her listing because it doesn't include all the details of her airbnb, from Epsom salt stocked for baths, to high end kitchen equipment like kitchen aid mixers to use to snacks ready to go, to fans to use for bedtime (i am a fan person and no airbnb just stocks them for convenience). Everything about the stay was awesome and cozy. The most comfortable bed, ah we did not want to leave it!
I was kinda apprehensive booking it due to the low price but I'm glad I read the great reviews and booked it. She's friendly, the house was cute, cozy, clean and the location was awesome if your in town to catch a ND game! If your reading the review, book the stay, you won't be sorry, we will be booking when we come back to town!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Tonya‚Äôs place is the epitome of ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù! Her hospitality is off the charts and her communication is the best I‚Äôve encountered on AirBnb.

Nice place to stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tonya was always responsive, and such a fun person to meet! She lives next door and was waiting on her porch to be sure we got in okay at night.
Her home is so beautiful, with a fully outfitted kitchen, dining room, living room, two bedrooms upstairs (one full bed, one queen) and a sitting room. The bathroom was my favorite room--all pink and lots of nice touches.
The neighborhood is quiet and pretty. There is parking in back of the house, so we felt safe parking an SUV full of our daughter's college dorm things overnight.
Tonya's ""happy place"" was our happy place too! Can't wait to stay again when we drive to Chicago."

There are a lot of spaces in the home to relax--a breakfast nook and a dining room, two living spaces, and even another area upstairs to hang out besides the two bedrooms.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful decor and lots of lovely touches.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Location was great for an ND game
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"Be sure to READ FULL DESCRIPTION! ONLY 2 guests allowed, we had to pay $50 extra for each additional person although there were plenty of beds for everyone. And it was not super clear in description.
The house was clean. The location was not great but not terrible.
We were there less than 12 hours, the value for what we paid was definitely not there.
Overall, it was okay."
2022-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"I am not sure what is going on. I have stayed here twice. The first time someone was obviously in my vehicle but did not take anything. There were things moved around inside, but nothing was taken (dash cam, shotgun shells, etc.), but the shells were sitting on my seat and my tailgate was open.
This last stay we ordered pizza at 9 PM and opened the front door at 9:30 to get it. At 10:30 after we had gone to bed, Tonya and AirBnb support called my phone a total of 4 times stating that the alarm box had been disconnected. I contacted Tonya in the morning and she stated that the front door being opened had disconnected the alarm???
The place is nice, it is quiet, it is very clean and comfortable, but there just seems to be odd issues."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place large enough comfortable parking in back of house. Had a great stay there and looking to book it again.
Tonya was very helpful and pleasant."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tonya‚Äôs place was clean, spacious, beautifully furnished and decorated with lots of special touches."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and spacious. Quiet neighborhood. Tonya was easy to communicate with.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean welcoming. Tonya's communication was excellent!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Better than advertised. Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Lots of room.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We found the accommodations to be as advertised as well as comfortable. Being an older home in Elkhart it has its creeks and moans which are related more to the charm of older homes rather than too much age. The house is located in a good neighborhood. We stayed in Elkhart even though we attended a Notre Dame game. The commute to ND was about 25 minutes and very easy. The only knock we be for Tonya to stay on top of maintenance ( dishwasher broken) and ensuring adequate towels and amenities we available. All this said. We would recommend a stay there.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very charming place to stay. Great care has been taken to make it feel like a home and it was extremely comfortable.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tonya is so nice and friendly - we were lucky to be able to meet her in person, which I always appreciate when staying in someone's home. Her house is cozy and quiet and very private. We made breakfast two times in her kitchen that has everything you need. This house is located close to downtown, so it's easy to go find a bite to eat. Thanks Tonya. it was so nice to meet you."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The happy place air bnb is just that. Each room giving off a different vibe, the entire place was spotless and would recommend this air bnb. Easy access, location and just about a hour from Lake Michigan. Tonya communicated perfectly and had no concerns ! 5 star!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a beautiful, large, two bedroom two level apartment. It was immaculately clean, and the kitchen was beautiful, with a great set of cookware. All the systems worked well. Tonya was very gracious. This apartment is an excellent value."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very charming and clean! Nicely decorated and fully stocked kitchen. We were in town for a swim meet and the location was perfect, very centrally located. Tonya was a great host and this is a nice neighborhood. Would definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time staying at this place .. it‚Äôs was very clean and had everything we needed..
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a last minute meeting in the area and Tonya was gracious enough to open up her home. Loved my stay and enjoyed the quietness to prepare for my meeting. I also appreciated Tonya's open communication should I have needed anything, but her space had all I needed. Would definitely again."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Tonya's home. It was clean, cute and cosy. Tonya was always a call or text away and was very prompt."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Tonya's house is very clean, comfortable and cute!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,The pictures don't do it justice! Every little touch to Tonya's house is well-thought out and beautiful! The bed was comfortable and there was a fan (which I loved). She has plenty of space for you to park and it's conveniently located to many things. Tonya was an excellent communicator as well and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with at her home.
2022-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Tonya is a very responsive and delightful host. Her home is very clean and cute and the kitchen is well stocked! The neighborhood was not quiet exactly but not really noisy either. All Elkhart attrations were within a 5-10 minute drive. Any issues that came up, Tonya addressed immediately to my satisfaction."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Charming, conveniently located property provided a comfortable place to stay."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very charming home, great architecture and taseful decor in a nice neighborhood! Fully equipped kitchen! Host is very resposive! Will stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Tonya‚Äôs place is beautiful! So clean and decorated so well. We absolutely loved it! Easy to get to. Very good communication and easy check in! The beds are insanely comfortable. Loved it!!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Tonya‚Äôs place was very nice and homey. I loved the set up. Very beautiful 2 bedrooms. Tonya was a very great host.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Tonya was very friendly and her place is spotless. Good location too!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Tonya's house was the perfect home away from home for a week. She was friendly and communicated well!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Tonya was a wonderful hostess. Her place is clean, convenient and affordable. she was very attentive to needs and I would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roger was a very friendly host, and his home was super nice. He was very quick to respond to any questions I had."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,This was a place it was exactly what i expected. It was a older place that kind of reminded me of my childhood grandmas house. I was able to relax and get a nice break when not working. Had all the necessities that I needed. I would definitely stay here again if I was on another work assignment in Elkhart.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, Rogers place is great and was just what we were expecting. It is an older home (we live in one too) so no issues there, we were expecting things that come along with old houses (wear and tear, older kitchen, etc.). The kitchen was well stocked and well organized and we ate nearly all our meals in, so that was a huge benefit. My only issue was with the twin beds in the back bedroom. They just aren't good mattresses and the one was so bouncy it was hard to sleep because it felt so unstable. Might be ok for kids, but as an adult, I found the twin bed uncomfortable. My son said the mattress in the front bedroom was nice. Otherwise, the location was great for us and it was a comfortable place to relax between swim meet sessions."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Simple and homey.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Simple check in. Wifi was really good, much appreciated. It felt like visiting grandma's house. Beds were clean but because the house is old, some things have the typical aged attributes. The air can feel heavy as is typical of an old home when first entering, but you quickly adjust. Just about anything you need for cooking is supplied. It was a good layover stop, would recommend."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for the weekend! Responsive host and clean home. Would stay again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything went well. A little further from the Notre Dame campus than I wanted, but the value made up for it."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we had a great experience at this home. very clean, comfy and nice. would stay again"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay Roger's place. I would definitely recommend and would stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay. The house was perfect for 3 people, well equipped, comfortable and close enough to Elkhart to make getting around simple, but far enough off the main roads to be quiet. The beds were comfortable and cozy. Would rent this house again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful neighborhood. Nice and roomy house
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,good location
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Reminded me of walking into my grandmas! And I mean that in the best way possible!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very easy. No surprises.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This house was truly a home away from home! Absolutely loved the porch, perfect for enjoying the lovely weather and sipping my coffee! The street is lovely as well. The house has character and was comfortable, clean, and well decorated. Whether you are visiting Elkhart, Goshen, Bristol, Middlebury, or activities in South Bend or LaPorte, this house is a perfect place to stay during a vacation or for a weekend. Highly recommended for this area!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place in a a great location.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, right near the river, and plenty of good food. Super safe and friendly area. We will definitely look for it next time we are in town"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Twice at this location and always a good stay. Well thought out needs that are provided for, comfortable mattresses, plenty of space to put clothes/gear, just enough space to enjoy leisure time and easy to get back to downtown Elkhart."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We needed a place to stay because my granddaughter was taking part in a rugby tournament in Elkhart. I found this house with a great location (10 minutes from the field). It worked out great it gave my daughter and I a great place to stay for a few days. Everything is as advertised and made our weekend very enjoyable. I would highly recommend. Thanks Roger!!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice old house, on a beautiful street. Very quiet. The host was great with communication. With what you get I think it‚Äôs a great value. I recommend this place very much. I came on a bucket list trip and I probably won‚Äôt come this way again but if I did I would definitely stay here again."
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to rest and relax on a Notre Dame football weekend. Everything as advertised and very clean.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at this property when we were in town for a wedding. It was convenient to most things in Elkhart and surrounding towns, and the area seemed safe and quiet. The house is an older home, so the bedrooms and bathroom weren't huge, but the home was clean and comfortable. The living room and dining room both had plenty of space, and there was lots of extra room in the basement as well. The beds, linens, and pillows were adequately comfortable, bath towels were plentiful, and the kitchen was outfitted with plenty of dishes and cooking pans, utensils, etc. We didn't have time use the back yard/patio area, but it looked like a nice place to relax. We cooked some meals in the kitchen, and all the appliances worked great. The washer and dryer also worked well. The TV had over the air programming and seemed to lose the signal at times...this wasn't really an issue for us since we rarely watch TV. Roger was great with communication. When a minor maintenance situation occurred just prior to our check-in, Roger contacted us even before we arrived to let us know about the situation, and updated us once we arrived. At no point did the situation present an impact for our stay, but Roger was great to let us know what was going on so there were no surprises. Otherwise we had the entire property to ourselves and did not see the hosts (but they were always quick to respond if we messaged them). This home was a better price than some area hotels, and we got so much more than a hotel would have offered! We would have no hesitation staying here again if our travels ever take us back to Elkhart."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved everything about our stay!! Plenty of amenities, nice quiet neighborhood and easy check in and check out! Roger was extremely friendly and communicated with me every step of the way! Super welcoming and clean house and we will def be staying here again in the future if we visit Indiana!!"

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"There are no ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù here‚Ä¶.just a basic small bungalow feel. But, we enjoyed the view from the front porch, and Elkhart was a nice location for visiting Middlebury and Shipshewana."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice and cozy home well recommended.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We definitely would rebook this great location; very easy to get downtown and anywhere you need to go. For older travelers who are not comfortable in the prone position, there an a very adjustable and comfortable sleeping chair in the living room. There is a large yard and off street parking. Don‚Äôt miss Wellfield Botanical Gardens which is spacious, beautiful and uncrowded. Loved our stay."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house has a lot to feature, mostly fenced back yard, grill and front porch with outside seating."

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Exactly as described. Love the charm of the neighborhood .
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the house. Both kitchen and bathroom are very well equipped. We didn't use the second bedroom but the the master bedroom has a very comfortable mattress. The location is great, easy access to the highway. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and watching the black squirrels. If you plan on attending a football game at Notre Dame, we found that taking Highway 20 to downtown South Bend, parking at the Century Center (for free) was the best bet. There is a free shuttle to the stadium, from the parking lot, every 15 minutes. We recommend eating at Rico's at the Bulldog restaurant right on Jackson Blvd, food was great! Another place we recommend is Flippin Cow on State Route 19. We would definitely stay at Roger's place again if we go back to that area."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely perfect! Will definitely recommend to friends!! Comfortable stay and well equipped home. If ever we find the need to stay in the area again, Roger‚Äôs place would be our FIRST choice!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy, straightforward check-in and check out. Everything was as described and the home is lovely!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rogers place was a breath of fresh air especially coming all the way out from California. This trip was a surprise to my 78 year old step dad who‚Äôs a life long Notre Dame fan. The house is beautiful and Roger made sure we had everything we needed from shampoo to coffee. We were in aw of how beautiful the neighborhood is. Spent the early mornings and evenings relaxing on the front porch but unfortunately it never got cold enough to use the hot tub. Roger gave us helpful tips for attending our first Notre Dame game which is a short 30 min scenic drive from the house. I would love to come back in the winter to enjoy this beautiful place again. Thanks again for everything!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place - I'd definitely stay there again!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location great house

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, quiet, relaxing home!
I drove my parents down for a family funeral and it was wonderful to have a quiet haven after the emotional turmoil of such a gathering.
Everything you would need to be comfortable has been provided for.
The street could be busy during the commute times (there was a lot of construction going on), but you barely noticed it while inside the house.
Roger is willing to be in touch as much as you want him to be, and is very prompt in his reply.
Our stay was amazing!
My son even asked me if we could buy the house and stay forever! üòç"

Roger offered dining suggestions ... and we enjoyed dinner at The Vine...very nice. All in all, a very comfortable stay. I thought we might have to load up one of the 2 recliners, as my travel buddy LOVED THEM, AND I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT WANT TO LOAD ONE UP IN OUR VAN and carry it with us the remainder of our trip. Ideal place to stay in Elkhart...all the amenities you could wish for and neat as a pin. Very accommodating host"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Charming older home with everything you'd need for an extended stay. The living room and dining room are bright and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped and has good working surfaces and counters. Both the covered front porch and the back courtyard are a plus.

Will definitely consider renting again if needed in the future!

2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Whether you are going up to South Bend to cheer on the Fighting Irish or simply exploring Indiana, this house is a great little find. It is a little further from South Bend than expected, but it offers so much to its guests that would be hard to beat because it makes you feel like you are right at home. It is well-kept and big enough for two couples. We shared a bathroom, which was no big deal. The owners even had extra amenities in case we did not bring shower products. The living room was a nice place to gather and talk, and the house has a quaint front porch area for sitting around. It was perfect for our long weekend getaway!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Roger was very easy to communicate with and very friendly. His house was within minutes of where we needed to be and he was quick to respond if I had any questions. His house was clean and very well stocked (with coffee as well which was a huge plus with our early mornings) I will definitely be looking to stay again next year when we're in Elkhart for the gokart races
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I enjoyed this charming home. It was very clean and had everything we needed. We enjoyed coffee on the front porch and cooking out on the back patio. It is on a busy street but still an enjoyable area. Roger responded quickly to any questions we had before and during our stay. We would definitely stay there again.
2018-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great place
Great location
Much better than a hotel when traveling for work and was in town for 9 days."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything is Good.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience with a warm and friendly host!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,This AIRBNB is a great spot to be!! Close to everything with a beautiful view from every direction. They're steps in the front and the back so this is not a home for you if you have problems using steps as they are a bit steep for the elderly . Rogers home is an older home so it is not ADA. That being said I so loved everything else about it.Comfortable bed and clean linen made for a great night sleep. One week wasn't enough!! Thank you to Great hosts!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roger's place was more than what we expected. Because I didn't get in until late evening, I didn't get a chance to meet with Roger, but having the living room light on timer was a very welcoming touch. Everything was clean, comfortable, and the front porch was a marvelous place to relax and read. This house was the perfect size for us to visit with our family -- they all fit on the front porch : - ) Everything was exactly as advertised. Check in and check out were super easy. We're hoping the next time we go back for a visit this house will be available."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roger was great at responding quickly, check in was easy, and the place itself was great! We enjoyed our stay!"
2018-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This a beautiful home, a great place to relax, sit on the front porch with the river across the street. In the spring the smell of fresh lilacs is heaven. Roger is every pleasant and great to communicate with. This is our second stay here. Can‚Äôt wait to come back."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Same great experience as two weeks ago.
Roger gave us a fantastic recommendation for a restaurant."
2017-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A very lovely place to stay while in the South Bend area for a Notre Dame football game. The accommodations were exactly as stated and suited our party of three well.

2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommend Roger's Place.
2017-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time......Roger was a great host.....we had a question and Roger got back to us immediately. Check in and check out were super easy. Everything was as advertised....hopefully we will be going back next year.
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful and lovely home. We couldn't have found a more perfectly sized and affordable home for our short weekend stay. Everything was exactly as advertised. We especially enjoyed having our breakfast coffee on the big front porch each morning, as the sun was just coming up and the cool morning breeze was gently whisking across the front of the house. It was very nice of Roger to have mentioned to us about the Elkhart Jazz Festival that was going on the same weekend as our stay. Unfortunately, we weren't able to find time to attend due to family matters. Possibly next year, if we are in the area, as we will be sure to book Roger's place again if available."
2017-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roger's place was exactly what we expected. Great communication and everything you need in a place to stay. Everything was clean, comfortable, and it was a short drive to restaurants and a grocery store. The front porch was our personal favorite."
2017-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"For our first time thru Airbnb, this was a VERY nice experience. The location, neighborhood and house were better than expected. Roger was great- got back to us immediately plus the check in/out was perfect. The house was very comfortable, although the bedrooms and bathroom were a little tight- but just fine for the 3 of us.
We'll definitely look to book again when back in the South Bend/Elkhart area."
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice, quite comfortable home. Great location along the river, downtown Elkhart & close to most of the RV dealers. Roger was fantastic. Meant us with key, showed us around. This was a very last minute trip. He got back with us quickly. The back yard smelled of fresh lilac from the bushes. We even sat on the big front porch with it being so cold. Can't wait to go back."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our hosts were very friendly and responsive, was a wonderful stay, would recommend and come back if we‚Äôre ever in the area again. Nice room and beautiful, peaceful property."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cindy is very kind and considerate. After I told her I'll arrive late at night, she asked me to travel safely, and left the patio light on for me. The house is a little hard to find, since the private drive is not on Google map's record. But Cindy sent me detailed information which turned out to be very useful and helped me find the house. The house is great, and the very affordable price makes it even better. What I suggest to improve is replacing the curtain so the guest can have better privacy during the evening."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,The perfect nights rest while working long hours away from home. Great communication and description. Warm and welcoming. Coffee was preset for the morning and was delicious!

There were quite a few people in and out of the home due to other guests extenuating circumstances, which I was understanding of. The frustration was the shared bathroom being so frequently unavailable with that many guests at one time. That being said Cindy and her husband were so friendly, the bed was comfortable, once the commotion quieted, the house is absolutely spotless and smelled amazing."

2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such an amazingly pleasant stay with Cindy and her family. Spotless home and very comfy beds, and always coffee available. Hopefully we'll be back soon!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Cindy and her husband was a great host. Open for small talk and even more. Their house is beautiful located on the river. I can absolutely recommend it.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Cindy provides a beautiful place to stay with nice breakfast options and a clean environment for a great value. She was kind and friendly.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Adorable and spacious MCM apartment. Lovely furnishings & decor, plus the coffee setup is off the hook! Wonderful hosts, thank you for all the snacks and hospitality!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"private, quiet, clean, we would definitely stay again when in town."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Listing is exactly as pictured, very 70s chic. I loved the vibe! Great location, quiet area, easy access to dining and shopping areas. This space had everything we needed and more, and the amenities were great... even down to the unique scents of the products provided (we'll be shopping for the body wash and dish soap when we get home!) Great hospitality, thanks again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautifully curated space. Worked out perfectly for our quick overnight stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The property feels like home. Lightly decorated with interesting items. Outstanding tv and comfortable bed. Expresso machine is great, probably lost some sleep by drinking it at 8pm. Would stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Heidi's guest suite was a cozy little place to bunker from the cold. Don't sleep on their extensive coffee preparation station!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,super clean and cozy. booked mostly for the couch and it was worth it! very cute and comfortable spot and Heidi is a great host. definitely will be back again ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was as advertised. Excellent coffee bar, but probably a little too complicated for a guy like me who is happy with drip coffee every day. A K-cup would have been good for me. I used the pour-over method to make a cup, which was still a solid cup of coffee. Even though directions were provided, I was a little intimidated by the espresso machine (I was afraid to break it!). It was very quiet at night, and getting in and out was a breeze. We grabbed a bite at ""Rico's at the Bulldog"" restaurant. Food was good, and the people were friendly. Only a half mile away. I'd stay here again if staying overnight for a Fighting Irish game."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Gemini was an amazing stay! The inside of the house was extremely beautiful and tasteful and felt very secluded, along with the expresso machine made a great time. The hosts were extremely respectful of our privacy but we‚Äôre there to assist us with any that we needed. The house is in a great area of Elkhart as well. I would definitely go back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Would HIGHLY recommend staying here !
Heidi and Jaymie were considerate of our privacy but always available and quickly responsive.
Although, because everything we could need was already provided, we didn't need much.
Our favorite was the bed & linens, both made for a very comfortable nights sleep.
Accommodations are attached to the main house but you wouldn't know it. Peace & quiet was our experience.
Unit is exactly as described, clean, pretty, and quiet. The location is in a quiet, safe, and walkable neighborhood.
All of the areas attractions are within close driving proximity, and there is a lot to do.
One of the better Airbnb places that we've had the pleasure to stay at.
We're expecting that Heidi and Jaymie will be SUPER Hosts in no time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very welcoming place to stay! The espresso machine and pour over coffee were a great touch. Quick walk from the st joe river
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice clean spacious place. Will stay again if possible!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi really curated this space with beautiful items. I loved her simple yet fun design taste. There was a great selection of coffee options and a cute snack basket. Linens were clean, bed was cozy and the linens were soft. The space is very big and well laid out with a super easy private entrance. The unit is attached to the owners home with its own private entrance but I heard no noise from inside their home. A great host!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a nice spot. Loved the decor and the roominess of the place. Bed was comfy. The coffee maker and small snacks were a nice touch. Host was very communicative and friendly. Went for a football game and it was a pretty short drive to Notre Dames campus.
Did have an issue with the lock (not initial check in but entering the Airbnb afterwards.). Host was gracious regarding this and was going to get it looked at after checkout.
Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely stay. Clean, neat and functional. Good style and easy to access. Would stay again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Heidi was a great host, responded quickly and made sure our stay was very comfortable."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, amenities and space. With a 3 and 5 year old travel isn‚Äôt always smooth and the house was wonderful! The downstairs play area is a great idea, snacks and breakfast provided made our lives so much easier! We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to visit family."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I wish I could give this place six stars. it was very clean, very cozy, with a great location just off the main thoroughfare with access the restaurants and everything, yet just far enough away that it wasn't too loud or busy. Every little detail was attended to. The proprietor obviously takes the concept of hospitality very seriously, and excels at it. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Came in late and left early, but everything was so clean and nice! One of the best Airbnb stays I have experienced! My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt have more time to spend there and enjoy the comfortable and homey atmosphere."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This very comfy bungalow is even cuter than the pictures. We were so pleased with how easy it was to find, park, unload, and load. Vickie is very responsive and helpful. We will choose this again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute, clean, well-equipped historic home near the center town. It has everything you need and nothing you don‚Äôt. Great value and prompt, friendly communication from the owner. I would definitely stay here again."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect location while my RV was getting serviced. The dogs also loved it.
Vickie has thought of many welcoming details for guests.
Elkhart is very easy to get around. Visited the RV/MH Hall of Fame , which was fascinating.
I would recommend it to anyone visiting Elkhart or passing through."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Felt right at home at this adorable house! We came in for a swim meet, and it was a comfortable place to stay. Vicki did a great job decorating and providing everything we could possibly need for a comfortable stay. Really appreciated all the coffee, towels, toiletries, and comfortable furniture. If we find ourselves back in Elkhart, we will definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cute bungalow! Snacks and breakfast was great!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were pleasantly surprised by how clean and cozy this home was. It had everything we could have needed and more, and there were so many carefully thought out details that we appreciated. We thought the place looked even cuter in person than in the photos! Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was updated, clean, and included high quality towels! We drive through the area a few times a year and hope Vickie‚Äôs home is available every time we need to stop. Wonderful stay, highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very homey. She even had MANY breakfast options, which was not expected. The house is on a busy street, so if you are a little sleeper you might want to sleep in the back bedroom. Our dogs ü©∑ the large backyard. It is unfenced, so if you have a ‚Äúrunner‚Äù you might need to keep on a leash when outside."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a wonderful experience! The decor was so warm and inviting, and it was a very cozy home away from home! Had everything we needed and more. Vickie is a wonderful host and we hope to stay again soon!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As always, Vicki is accommodating and provides everything we need to feel at home!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We needed a quick place to stay to attend the High School boys basketball tourney so we could bring our dog too. Vickie‚Äôs cottage was perfect. Clean. Super pet friendly. Comfy and full of great snacks and breakfast. Truly a great find!!
Thank you for being a great host and thinking of the little details to make this memorable!
And oh yes‚Ä¶our son and his teammates are heading to the State BB championships!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Boho Bungalow was exactly as described. Vicki is an excellent host. The house was very clean, cozy and comfortable. The available amenities far exceeded other homes we‚Äôve visited. The location was ideal for our trip. We would love to return in the future. We highly recommend this home."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great host, cozy accommodation walking distance from beautiful riverfront and park.
Will save location for future bookings."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This air bnb was amazing, to put it simply. We travel frequently with our dogs and this was the first place we‚Äôve stayed that was SO WELCOMING to dogs. Blankets to allow them on the couch, treats, you name it, Vickie had it covered! One of our dogs gets very anxious in new homes and will need coaxing to eat/drink but even she was so comfortable that she ate and drank like normal. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again and I HIGHLY Recommend!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Vickie‚Äôs home was perfect. We were visiting family in town, and Vickie‚Äôs home was centrally located in town. It felt like home when you walked in, and really allowed us to relax and enjoy our time in Elkhart. My family of four was very comfortable staying here, and we will definitely try to book this home again on our next visit."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay at ‚ÄúThe Blue House‚Äù as my kids call it- they love it so much! Vickie is a wonderful host, her space is impressively clean, and she has thought about through just about anything that you might need! The playroom downstairs is awesome for my toddlers!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A perfect stay for a family with dogs! There were blankets to cover furniture, dog toys, dog waste bags, and dog treats! We would be very happy to stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time my husband, our dog and have stayed at Vickie‚Äôs for a quick getaway. It‚Äôs very cozy and clean. Feels like home!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay. It was like coming home. Vickie leaves great breakfast food and the kitchen is like Grandma's kitchen - everything you need!! It's our favorite stop when going to Wisconsin from the Adirondacks.. We'll be back!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Ms Vickie's bungalow is friendly: Pet friendly, child friendly, adult friendly. Even though I don't travel with children I noticed This bungalow was extremely child safety conscientious. Safety latches on doors and cupboards and child protective outlets. The thing that I appreciated the most was the extremely well stocked kitchen. Ms Vickie Isn't kidding when she says have breakfast on us. This is my first AirBnB that the kitchen, and the refrigerator in particular, is so well stocked.... And I have stayed at many AirBnB's. I travel for work and I'm in the Elkhart area every 2 to 3 months. And I hope I get to stay at this bungalow again when I am back in town. I know consider this bungalow my home away from home."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,My first time booking an Airbnb I still have to learn to go through the whole profile and know the rules but my stay at Vicki‚Äôs was amazing! It was so cozy and everything was spotless. I‚Äôm so thankful for the accommodations and how beautiful the house was. Anyone who is thinking about staying definitely won‚Äôt regret it!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I‚Äôve stayed in quite a few Airbnb‚Äôs and this was by far THE most accommodating for my husband, two toddler, and newborn. Vickie had everything you could think of, not to mention how clean everything was! TVs and fans were in both bedrooms which gets an automatic thumbs up from my husband and kids! The downstairs was adorable and my kids LOVED IT and we loved that they could take their noise downstairs and have fun!The rooms weren‚Äôt huge which is typical of a quaint older home, but they still offered plenty of space for my newborn‚Äôs bassinet and toddler‚Äôs pack and play (Vicki set this up for us!). My husband grew up in Elkhart, in fact, he went to the elementary school that the house backs up to, so we are in town several times a year and are looking forward to staying here (hopefully) for years to come. In fact, we booked again during this stay for his family‚Äôs Christmas next month!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time! Very welcoming. Everything was as pictured and described. Street is a little noisy but the house is cozy. The coffee and breakfast was so convenient and very much appreciated. The restaurants suggestions and things to do and board games were also very helpful!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect Stay at Vicki's. Very comfortable house. She was a great hostess. We'll be glad to stay there again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love this Bungalow! The place was immaculate. The decor was so warm and homey. Loved the extra special touches like breakfast foods, snacks, coffee choices, toiletries‚Ä¶ all of it. Sweet, cute, quaint and dog friendly. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay at Vickie‚Äôs for our quilting weekend. Easy check in and really appreciate everything Vickie provides. The place was very clean, comfortable and we enjoyed a great Thai restaurant and a beautiful nature preserve- Boot Lake during our stay. If I was in the area, I would definitely stay again! This place would be great for kids too!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were moving with our kids and dogs and this location was a perfect stop along the way. There was plenty of space for 4 adults and 2 kids and the spacious yard was ideal for taking our dogs out. The basement play area was a huge hit with our daughter and the pack‚Äôn‚Äôplay was perfect for our infant. The supplied breakfast was an added bonus and the proximity to Walgreens was convenient for some last minute needs. I‚Äôd highly recommend this stay as it has everything you could need and much, much more. The host was very kind and we‚Äôd gladly come back to stay another time."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Was in town for the Notre Dame game. Great place. Clean and close to everything. Great host!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Vickie's place was perfect for our short stay in Elkhart. The house is very cute and cozy. Everything thing was very clean and well kept. We loved having a great selection of coffee pods for the morning! Vickie is an excellent communicator. She answered questions just about immediately and gave clear instructions for check in. I feel bad because we apparently missed a couple of the house rules on check out. I'll take the blame on that for not informing the other members of our party (sorry Vickie). It was our first time in Elkhart and we discovered two fantastic restaurants while there (Bruno's Per Bacca for an excellent Italian dinner and Cock-A-Doodle Cafe for breakfast). I'd recommend Vickie's place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Elkhart!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Incredibly comfortable home! The kitchen is so well appointed - you can cook whatever you want in that kitchen. The house felt so warm and inviting.....
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,I only wish our stay was longer! The Boho cottage was everything you want in a home-away-from-home.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The many thoughtful details and charm made Vickie‚Äôs place a restful gem for us. After a long travel day, we appreciated the ability to settle in, feel welcomed, at ease and right at home. Thank you Vickie!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Vickie's rental was one of the most thoughtful and well-stocked Airbnbs at which I've stayed. Comfortable, great lighting, excellent climate control, spotless, nicely decorated, and lots of thoughtful touches for people traveling with a pet (dog biscuits, blankets to cover furniture, etc.) The thing that blew me away was the offer of breakfast food in the fridge; Vickie provided enough food for a full hot breakfast, which was so helpful and greatly appreciated. I would stay again in a heartbeat and am thankful for Vickie's clear, prompt, and friendly communication."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at Vickie‚Äôs place. We were passing through and booked super last minute for the night. Her house was super cozy and made us feel right at home. Our dog loved to play fetch in the yard. We will definitely stay at Vickie‚Äôs place again when passing through!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was clean and the host had provided some food in the fridge like eggs, milk, and cereal which was accommodating though we chose to eat out.
The bathroom was remodeled, the shower was hot with good water pressure.
The front queen bedroom was a little noisy with traffic since it‚Äôs at the front of the house and the mattress was very firm. The back full size bedroom was much quieter and the mattress was medium.
The area was ok with a Dunkin‚Äô Donuts around the corner and Walgreens next door. I could see where it would be great for those with pets as the backyard is fenced.
Overall a nice place to stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely space, very clean and cute, Vickie was very helpful too, loved it!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time. The place was clean and accurately described. It‚Äôs <30min from ND‚Äôs campus, so it worked well as a place for my wife, 4 kids, and myself to stay for a game weekend. Vickie was very responsive (e.g. shortly after we arrived and the wifi password wasn‚Äôt working, she got us the correct one quickly.)
Great value. We‚Äôd definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have never seen a host like Vicky before-AMAZING.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is the best AirBnb I have stayed in to date. So many extras like a well stocked kitchen that was unexpected but a wonderful surprise. I only have praises to say about this house. Clean and tidy and neat as a pin. The home had a lot of charm and we just loved it.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give Vickie's place more than 5 stars, I would. It was like staying at home it was so comfortable, but at the same time, it was like staying at a 5 star resort. It was immaculately clean, and every detail was thought out thoroughly.
The carpets were fluffy with extra padding. It was stocked with delicious, healthy food. She had a variety of organic flavored coffee available. Forgot your toothbrush? There's an extra. Not to mention, all the other handy things you may need that she kept stocked all over the house. Fluffy shower rugs were clean and folded thoughtfully in a basket near the shower.
The basement is a child's wonderland. Perfectly safe and childproofed with toys, tents and books to entertain for hours. The entertainment stand was stocked full of games - you won't get bored here! There was even a sand box and toys for the kids to play with out in the quiet back yard.
If owning an Air B&B was a competition, Vickie wins first place. It's in a league of its own."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We greatly enjoyed our overnight stay. We had everything we needed and more. After a full day of driving, it was so nice to relax and be comfortable for the evening.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a gem! We met our friends halfway for a visit before back to school time, and all of us loved this place!
From the cleanliness, to the comfortable furniture, and the generously stocked pantry, Vicki thought of everything to make this feel like home away from home.
We do not necessarily want to visit Elkhart again, but will likely do so, just to stay here!
Thank you, Vicki, for such a welcoming, safe, and inviting space!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first ever stay at an airbnb and it was so smooth!

Here is where it gets OUTSTANDING: great snack (people and dog) and food options, bathroom towels that were soft but not too thick and heavy, plenty of ice, dog friendly yard and throws for furniture, tv‚Äôs in living and bedrooms, lots of streaming options. All of this was really great to have after a long day of driving. We are seriously considering going back to Elkhart for a vacation, just to stay at Vickie‚Äôs place. Stay here!"

The basement was a nice surprise as we walked down and saw the fun decoration for kids and the book, dragon and magic wands with the crowns was a great addition. I was able to get a load of laundry done as well! This place has everything you could possibly need. Very well thought out. Thanks for the great stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Have stayed here twice on a cross country road trip and it was a wonderful stay both times. We would definitely stay here again!

Everything was spotless, and Vickie made it all seem so friendly. And I took a long walk around the neighborhood with my dog and just loved all the houses. I would absolutely stay here again, any time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This charming and thoughtfully decorated bungalow home was perfect for us and our 2 little dogs. It's incredibly important to find a place that allows pups, as we always travel with them. The pet friendly furniture covers were wonderful and the big backyard was great - they felt right at home! This home was clean, organized, and comfortable with an attention to detail - it had everything we needed and more! The kitchen was well-stocked with food and snacks - such a lovely added touch that you definitely don't find in many places these days! Vickie was very responsive and easy to communicate with also. Thanks for a great stay!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hi Vickie!
Great stay and your place was so clean and comfortable. The only thing that would have been helpful is a list of favorite restaurants or menus to peruse."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place went way above expectations! It‚Äôs a darling little restored bungalow with a ton of original built-ins, woodwork, and kitchen cabinetry, making it a vintage-lovers dream! It was so tastefully and comfortably furnished that we felt right at home immediately. Plus, it was absolutely spotless!! And the host was so thoughtful and generous‚Ä¶there was plenty of food in the fridge that we could have used had we not brought our own! Big backyard was great for the dog to run in, and comfy chairs on the little front porch where we hung out and sipped wine. It‚Äôs on a trafficky street so don‚Äôt expect peace and quiet, but that makes for good people/car watching!
Extra bonus for us: there is a brand new washer and dryer in the basement, which we ended up needing to use unexpectedly. And the laundry soap was fragrance free! That made me and my sensitivity to scents very happy.
If we ever need to come back to the area (we were there for a nearby soccer tournament) we will book this again!"

2023-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay in Elkhart; the highlight was the Botanical Gardens. Vicky‚Äôs AirBnB suited our needs perfectly and she is a great host. The street is a bit loud but was not noticeable at all once inside. The side streets are nice for dog walks.

The tv is a ROKU tv, so it helps to have your info on hand. We figured it out just took two of us. :)

Beautiful space outdoors to visit, lounge, and gaze out at the beautiful river. The interior is huge - way more space than we were expecting. Faye has furnished the place with everything needed - lots of soft towels, well-stocked kitchen, laundry supplies, etc. There are also lots of nice extras like board games, local tour/sites information, cable TV, etc. Faye is also the nicest host you'll ever come by and she is great at staying in touch and answering questions.

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The view was fantastic with a beautiful river right in the back yard. The only issue is the basement is not finished and you can hear every step from the owners upstairs which can make it hard to sleep. Only 1 real bed as well, 2 couch pullouts. Overall a good experience and enjoyed the stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our third stay at Silk on the Bend. We enjoy Faye‚Äôs place. Will return in the future. An excellent value.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family with 3 small children absolutely loved out time away from home on the river.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town to visit family and we could not have chosen a better property!! We were able to gather, relax, and play with ease. All three kids 4yo & under loved the spacious yard. The grass is immaculate and lush. There were so many things there for them to play with! The river is beautiful and the hosts have done a great job ensuring the fencing is sturdy and secure to keep little ones safe. We also felt very safe in general both inside and outside the home. They provided everything we needed and were very quick to respond to our questions. The only downside was when our trip was over and we couldn‚Äôt stay longer!!!! We will definitely be booking again!!!
P.S: When we go back, we will pack our bathroom things in hanging organizers as there is limited counter space. Ample hooks and hanging bars provided though to make storage easy!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sam and Faye‚Äôs home is an oasis. It is more affordable, more spacious and more private/peaceful than any place we found inside South Bend‚Äôs city limits.
The river in their backyard is one of the most tranquil I‚Äôve experienced, so it was lovely to begin and end the day on their dock, where fish were jumping and kayakers and white geese easily paddled upstream.
It‚Äôs also a short, easy drive (only 2 turns!) into town for groceries and whatever else you need. If you‚Äôre looking for a low key vacation where you can truly kick back and relax away from the crowds, this is your spot!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"you won't find a more relaxing place and super hosts anywhere. Great value, great location, great folks."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came to town to see a Notre Dame game and would definitely return to Faye‚Äôs place again. It was about 20 minutes from campus but was beautiful and right on the river. The check in was simple and Faye was always quick to respond. The amenities were perfect and the three beds accommodated me and my brothers. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this Airbnb even if just for a relaxing few days by the river. I‚Äôll be back for more fighting Irish games!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth every minute. Amazing stay.

The patio and backyard was a beautiful place to relax outside and watch the river and boats go by. We highly recommend it!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"Faye was very easy to communicate with and checking in was easy. I liked the view of the river and there are some decent restaurants in the neighboring towns but not a whole lot nearby otherwise. Some parts of the of Airbnb were very clean and tidy and others were a somewhat dirty (hair, dust, spiderwebs, etc). There were also many many spiders in the apartment, which makes sense given it is a lower level stay. The place does have everything you'll need with a nice kitchenette, laundry, living room, etc."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a calming, beautiful setting and furniture and bed extremely comfortable. Hopefully we will be able to return sometime."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My son and I enjoyed Silk on the Bend for a long weekend of swimming competition in Elkhart.. Faye was so accommodating. Chilling by the river watching boats pass in the evening was a great way to close out the day.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Faye is a gracious host with prompt communication. We were able to spend more time on the dock by the river this visit. There is a nice bench, umbrella, and seating to watch all the boats and fish. This was our third or fourth stay at Silk on the Bend. See previous reviews for more details. It‚Äôs a great value and much less than area hotels."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay here. It's becoming a summertime tradition. The Airbnb itself is spacious and has incredible views. It's peaceful, comfortable and an all-around good time. It's located in a nice spot that is within driving distance to a lot. This time, I trekked around Elkhart and Shipshewana. Take advantage of all the brochures in the Airbnb to give you ideas if you're looking for something fun to do. There's a lot to find and experience. See you next year!"

* First, the communication between us and Faye was easy and clear.
* Once we got there, I was wowed with the view from the windows. I just sat in the living room and stared at the sunset reflecting off of the river, and wished that we were staying longer to be able to sit down by the river during the day.
* The back private entrance is very nice. We felt very at home - it really was easy to forget that they live right upstairs.
* The rooms were kept at a very comfortable temperature the entire time.
* The bed was incredibly comfortable - I have got to find out what kind of mattress that is!
* The bathroom was super clean, (as was the rest of the house), and the shower was great. Good water pressure and plenty of warm water!
* Will try to find a reason to go back out that way again!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super relaxing spot in a nice, cozy neighborhood by the water. Faye and her husband were some of the nicest hosts we've had in all of our travels soo far! The space itself is much bigger and plush than the pictures could do it justice. they have a whole music room that they invite their guest to jam in, if you were into that sort of thing. Based on how little you are paying for such a clean, neat little spot in a beautiful part of indiana... I couldn't think of another place Id want to stay at when we come back around!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I book Faye's place when I just need to get away for a weekend. It's always been great!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and with in a great location. Looking over the river and right in between Elkhart and Mishawaka. Perfect stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I am soooo glad I stayed here. I got in late afternoon and sat down at the water's edge and enjoyed the peacefulness of the river while having a beverage. There are plenty of comfortable chairs both outside and inside.The bed was really comfortable! The shower was sparkling clean. I had no problem getting around. I found a Vietnamese restaurant in a town close by that had vegan options. It was inexpensive and my noodle bowl was delicious. It was in Mishawaka.There were lots of things around for children also. If I am ever in this area again, I would come back if it was available. Full size refrigerator and stove. My only regret is that I was only here for one night. Amazing place, especially for the price!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed four nights at Silk on the Bend. We were in town for an event. Faye greeted us upon arrival and was prompt to communicate when the road to the unit was closed due to utility work. She and her husband gave me alternate directions as soon as I texted. My daughter and I felt safe, comfortable, and welcome. We put the kitchen to the test this visit as we brought all of our own meals. The kitchen has all the basics. You will want to bring your own spices. There are plenty of pans and a baking sheet available. There is a large dining table, outdoor patio, or seating by the river to enjoy meals. It was warm outside but the air conditioning in the bedroom and family room kept us cool. We also had access to several fans. We had a horrible rain storm and the unit stayed dry. We had no issues. We will be back the next time we are in town. Great value.
Please see my previous review for more information on the unit!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really fantastic spot to get off the road and relax for an evening or more. Very private, very peaceful, very comfy bed!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Faye and her husband were very friendly to me. We had good conversations. I spent 4 days in her residence. Spend a lot of time enjoying the river and watching boats passing-by. You can see swans and Canada geese. I had very pleasant stay.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A lovely private walk-out basement suite! This location was above and beyond my expectations! Roomy with wonderful amenities. Watching the boats in the evening was so relaxing. We definitely will be checking availability if we're in the area next summer.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved this Airbnb! We were greeted by the adorable house cat and the gorgeous river view. The beds were very comfortable and the amenities were great. I would absolutely stay here again! Thank you Faye!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We Can‚Äôt say enough! Faye and Sam were absolutely wonderful. We drove for 11 hours and it was dark when we arrived. It was awesome to see a clear, reflective sign indicating the entrance of the residence, and then also being able to walk right in so my husband could get some sleep.
Faye checked in to make sure our needs were met but we didn‚Äôt have to ask for anything! We felt so at home. She went above and beyond to make sure our beds were ready (we have 2 small kids). Just a great place, great people, and would love to stay again!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super great place to stay. We had a great time sitting down by the river and it was very relaxing.

We definitely want to come back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in a wedding and we were looking for a more affordable option for multiple nights that was still nice. This place was perfect! The river was serene, the bed was super comfortable, it wasn‚Äôt too far from Mishawaka, and the hosts were great. We ended up having a tornado in the area and Faye was very prompt with contacting us to figure out our accommodation needs."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful 5-day stay relaxing by the river and visiting nearby family members. The view from inside and out was great and enabled us to watch the wildlife, especially the many swans. Faye and her husband Sam were super hosts and went far above our expectations to make this stay a memorable one. Thank you!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay at Silk on the Bend! The views of the river were beautiful and Faye provided some great suggestions for food. We wish we could have stayed longer!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Faye's place was wonderful! She was very accomodating to my mom and I, as we rolled in pretty late at night. There were so many thoughtful touches. My mom and I especially enjoyed using the table-top fire and sitting out by the river in the morning. The views are incredible. We only stayed for one night, but wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you, Faye, for creating such a slice of heaven!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent! Would give 6/5 stars if I could. Best air bnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in and for a great price. Thoughtful touches, well stocked, and very clean and comfortable.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great spot if you like to relax by the river. You'll walk down the short flight of stairs from the driveway and be in awe of what awaits you. A nice covered deck. A large yard. Climb a few stairs past the gate and sit right on the river. Great for relaxing or for watching the boats/canoes/jet skis whip by. The Airbnb is tastefully decorated. You get a lot of space for the buck! There are several parks in the nearby area. The Mishawaka Riverwalk is close and has a lot of great sights. Dari Fair is an obvious favorite of the locals, judged by the lines it gets. It's next door to a huge splash pad for the kids, making a fun outing for ice cream while the kids play. Tutu's Once in a Blue Moon art/gift shop and Crystal Springs Creamery were fun to check out, as well. Everyone I encountered was friendly and my visit was great! Looking forward to returning and staying longer next time."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Faye's place on the river is a perfect retreat and a great location for exploring the area! Faye is very thoughtful and an excellent communicator. The space is exactly as described. But the pictures do not do it justice as there is a full-sized refrigerator, an oven with a stovetop and a microwave. The pillow-top mattress is very comfortable and there is plenty of space in the living and dining areas to spread out and relax and watch the river life. There are lots of things to do in the area. We especially enjoyed the Heritage Trail and Quilt Gardens. The Elkhart Visitor Center gave us 2 CDs FREE that really enhanced our drive with history and sightseeing suggestions. Faye is full of great ideas as well. We would definitely recommend a stay with Faye!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Silk on the Bend has all the amenities and comforts needed for a relaxing stay. Clean, comfortable, and many special touches to make you feel at-home. The river setting was magnificent as well. Faye was a wonderful communicator and host."

2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We wanted a great nights sleep and this place promised and delivered just that. The cave like sleeping area was so peaceful and dark. Our little one was well taken care of with the tiny playground, and lots of toys that Faye generously shared to keep her occupied while parents unwound from a long drive. Very sweet stop! Photos don‚Äôt do it justice. Bathroom quarters are a bit tight, if that‚Äôs of concern to folks, but with new and very clean fixtures. We‚Äôll be back!"

2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place. It was lovely to sit outside drink tea provided by the host and watch the river. Really wonderful spot. Super easy checkin and very very clean. If you are traveling during Covid this is a great place where you can feel safe. Would absolutely stay again.
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Silk on the Bend did not disappoint! Faye and Sam were wonderful hosts. This was our first time renting a private unit in an owner occupied home. Faye was prompt with communication and introduced herself upon arrival. She and Sam made us feel at home. The signage at the end of the driveway and guest parking was helpful as we arrived late evening. The area was safe and we had no concerns about security for our vehicle. It is a lower basement unit with steps. There are motion lights to guide you to the entrance. The bedroom was clean and the bed comfortable with plenty of extra blankets and pillows. Footsteps can occasionally be heard with a few creaks. The kitchen is charming and had everything we needed for a two-night stay. We brought all of our own supplies due to COVID but Faye has it stocked with essentials. This is a great value if you have an event in Elkhart. You cannot beat the view of the river and my husband was delighted to play his guitar on the dock and enjoy the fall colors.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terrific place. The river was lovely and I got the unexpected bonus of a boat ride. There are a lot of interesting places to get local produce -- I went to the Crystal Springs Creamery which was nearby, and the Kerchers Orchard farm market in Goshen, which is about a half hour away, and the kitchen was great to cook in. I also went to a nearby county park and Potato Creek State Park."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice n clean nice host enjiyed the stay
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Airbnb is clean and quite. Neighborhood is nice. Ran into an issue with the host about stains on the bedding. I was accused to causing the bleach stains on the grey bedding. I did notice this but did not point it out to the host. I stayed at the airbnb while visiting friends in the area over the holiday weekend. I do not have bleached or dyed hair, nor would of done that at an airbnb. I would imagine if there was someone bleaching their hair in your home you would smell the fumes and also notice if there was any bleach on towels or bleaching equipment in the garbage. I only was at the airbnb to sleep, shower and have my morning coffee and simply would have the time to bleach my hair. I do recommend this as a place to stay, but make the host aware of any damage you see prior to check out so you don‚Äôt not get accused of causing it."

They obviously are paying attention to detail and how to continuously improve their place, as they had even just changed the shower door after realizing water would get onto to floor. Very cute, very comfy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a fantastic spot at an incredible price! Fern added use of a bicycle for my stay - wonderful!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnb‚Äôs and Fern‚Äôs place is definitely one of the nicest ones I‚Äôve been in. It is a clean, quiet, private space (like a studio apartment) that is furnished with many things one might need and use. It overlooks her large fenced in garden that is so well kept and serene.
Fern is also very hospitable (I think they do meet their guests upon arrival and maybe even upon leaving), also responsive to your needs/requests.
I was so blessed to have had the opportunity to talk to her for a little bit before I left and share some stories and experiences. I will definitely come back if the opportunity arises. Thank you so much Fern."

Beautiful nature walk to the adjacent forest round out my short but relaxing stay. Definitely a return on my next visit."

Lots to do onsite and Gerry and Natasha didn‚Äôt miss a beat. Everything you could possibly need was provided and more. Very unique and charming. Teenage girls loved the fishing and trails.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tributary Pointe is a hidden gem. Our group of 4 each had our own beds, kitchen and bathroom well stocked, plenty of outdoor space to enjoy and explore, right around the corner from gas and retail stores. We visited the Railroad Museum in Elkhart and loved it. Gerry touched base with us a couple of times, and even though we didn't need anything it was great to know they were there. Would definitely recommend and go back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great experience! Hosts were very considerate, and the location was great."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Tributary Pointe was lovely. The barn where you'll stay is directly adjacent to the owner's on-site home, but they provided us with privacy and we had limited interactions. The barn is spacious, the amenities excellent, and while the stairs are narrow and fairly steep they add to the rustic charm. We loved roaming and relaxing on the property, and birdwatching from the loft windows."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gerry‚Äôs property is beautiful, relaxing, and full of charm. I‚Äôd recommend to anyone who is looking to spend time in some green space."
2022-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely grounds with a most unusual Airbnb. A very well stocked kitchen with good cooking utensils. Large areas for socializing indoors and outside. However, the information one receives before arriving states ""no parties"": luckily we only had 8 persons join us for a graduation celebration lunch.
Not a place for anyone with mobility concerns; lots of stairs that were the steps are unusually sized. One half bath on main floor and one bathroom with shower in lower floor.
Overall a very lovely place."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy going the house is beautiful with a nice big kitchen to cook in. The back deck is just steps away from a seining lake and a sandy river, where they have chairs set to relax. If there is anything you forgot and are missing the house sure does have it. It is also very close to supermarkets and a Walmart for you to find an of those last minute thing. We had a great time and our dog loves to swim and he definitely took advantage of that. I recommend this place for anyone trying to get out in nature and have some privacy. Great experience!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lovely place. Clean. Great paths for walking. Beautiful location on the river and pond. Enjoyed seeing the birds in the early morning and time by the fire in the evening. Host had tons of little touches that were really nice and made our stay extra easy and pleasant. We came with young kids and they absolutely loved everything about the space. Also was super great for our dogs.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hands down one of the best properties we‚Äôve stayed! The attention to detail put forth by the owners was so amazing. The home was exceptionally clean and organized, and the setting was great for our family."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has been by far one of the best Airbnb stays my husband and I have had so far. The hosts went above and beyond to make sure our stay was special and wonderful. The outdoor space is amazing. We spent a lot of time fishing and my husband caught a variety of fishes from the ponds on the property. The house itself was so adorable and spacious and clean. It had all the amenities needed and then some. I‚Äôd recommend this house to those who want to a retreat and to get away from the city, but still be close to venture in for the food and shopping."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our weekend in this luxurious barn! Perfect for a peaceful stay but you also want the finer things. Natasha went out of her way to make sure we had anything we could possibly need and the grounds are beautiful. Even the bed/pillow situation was great! No complaints here. Highly recommend!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great unique stay!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tributary Pointe is stunning and so well curated for guests. So many small things make a huge difference. My family all agree it is our favorite Airbnb, hands down.
First of all the Barn has been tactfully restored to fit everything we needed. The bedrooms were comfortable and scenic loft spaces. The kitchen has everything we needed and more to cook meals and was very clean. The living space is large and grand. We loved playing the board games in the evening in such a beautiful space. Pictures do not do it justice.
The grounds were awesome. Our favorite was the creek. We brought tubes and floated down from a boat launch about a 5 minute walk away‚Ä¶again and again. Kids loved playing in the creek bed looking for shells and rocks. It was October but the water was not cold. We made bonfires nightly roasting marshmallows. We had a really nice hike exploring the miles of clear trails. We saw a deer and it was so peaceful. We went fishing in the pond right outside the back deck and caught and released about 5 good sized bass. The patio and outdoor dinning furniture was a great spot to enjoy dinner.
The Silo was truly unique and picturesque looking over the grounds. We enjoyed coffee and Amish pastries in the mornings at the top‚Ä¶and some cocktails in the evenings. It is a bit of a climb but well worth it at the top.
Natasha and her family were great hosts. We only saw them briefly one time but the communications with them were clear and very timely. The planning and small things they appointed at the Barn show they really care about creating 5 star unique experience that we will be telling our friends and family. Thanks for the great trip. Hope we make it back in the future."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Natasha's home was a perfect place to stay for the weekend away! The check in and check out was very simple as everything was communicated perfectly! The home was clean, charming, and organized very thoughtfully. The inside was as described in listing.... and actually even better in person! Thank you!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place, beautiful, peaceful, very clean, one of the best!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing, comfy and extremely clean home. The view and surrounding area was amazing ü§© highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed staying at this charming little house along the river. It was really clean and uncluttered, yet had many nice amenities (like coffee, etc.). I would highly recommend staying at this place!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, this was the best stay I‚Äôve had. The place matched the photos, the few hours I had to work remote the WiFi was beyond fast, the tv was huge and beautiful picture. But, what sold me was the serene lake running along the back and being able to look out as I slept at the water and even having the patio cracked as I dosed. The kitchen was well equipped, you actually didn‚Äôt hear the street sounds which was the best you get peace and tranquility. I would happily book with Suz again and recommend to anyone I know who is looking to visit Indiana for a quiet time. Also plus was only a 1.5 hour drive to Chicago from here!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This tiny little house was a welcome home away from home for us as we waited for an rv repair. Suz graciously accommodated us as we had to keep extending our stay. Beautiful, waterfront location with swans, cranes and geese to enjoy every day. Be aware that Rt 120 is very close and very busy!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay on the river!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Very cozy. Loved being on the river. Really enjoyed the patio.
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house its self was very clean and exactly as the pictures showed. The beds were very comfortable and had a great view of the water from the back deck. It did have on street parking which wasn‚Äôt a problem as you have enough space for two vehicles.
The only downside was the location. The 24hr gas station next door was the place to be as soon as the sun went down. They had loud music playing and people wondering around at all hours of the night."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôd stay here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This home was wonderful for our stay for our daughters Rugby tournament. It is roughly 8 minutes away from the Moose Rugby fields. The home is older, but has been redone beautifully. The view of the river is fantastic with a new deck and comfortable patio furniture. Amy had everything you could need including extra toothbrushes and other toiletries. Plenty of towels and wash cloths. The back bedroom had the most comfortable mattress. Amy was very accommodating and responsive. So much better than a hotel!!!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Great stay. Will be back for summer!!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Amy was a great host. It was exactly what we thought we were paying for and the house was beautiful. Amy was fast in responses and helped answer my questions even before I booked with her:)

2024-04-01,4,Group trip,Nice and clean inside
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely lovely. It was cozy, clean, and comfortable. Amy is super responsive and accommodating. We felt right at home! She thinks of useful and practical additions that come in handy. Things like toothbrushes, q-tips, cider, wine, Epson bath salts, olive oil, lots of seasonings to cook with, super comfy beds, games, and more!
Definitely a great choice if you are thinking of staying. Thank you Amy!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,house was beautiful and everything was perfect

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and comfortable. We felt at home immediately. It's an old house but very tastefully renovated. The extra's in the kitchen and the bathroom were beyond expectation. It is close to shops. In the summer te deck will be lovely. For us it was too cold in this time of the year. The view on the river is beautiful. It's very easy to park in front of the house.
The only downsite for us was that the beds were very soft."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great beautiful house and friendly host
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amy was very responsive and kind! Home is pristine and cozy
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The description stated a sandy bottom perfect for swimming right off the seawall, but it was full of tall seaweed so we did not swim there. The paddle boat was there, but it was on land and full of rain water and mud. We bailed it out and washed it in order to use it. It was easy to take in and out of the water after that. The floating foam pad raft was helpful to avoid seaweed, but was full of holes and tears so a little tricky to run around on, but the kids were still able to use it. The house was great and the neighborhood was very peaceful. Anna was very responsive. It was a really fun trip."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great time! Anna was very flexible with our check-in and check-out. It‚Äôs hard being on time with a newborn but because Anna allowed us to stay longer it made it easier!! The only thing was not being able to find the cornhole bags, but overall it felt like home and would definitely come back again with the rest of our family!!! So much room for more people and a very peaceful place. Already talking about coming back again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great for a family vacation, highly recommended."
2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great place to relax as a couple or have fun as a family.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This stay is very quiet peaceful, lakeside with all amenities such as boat, kayak and also a firepit beside the lake has added more momentful. Anna was a great host and was reachable at any time."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Anna was great to work with and her home is beautiful. Everything is true to posting and she is super responsive and helpful.
We had a fabulous time in her beautiful home!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this space! Such a beautiful little piece of heaven. The lake views in the morning are just perfect. Anna was so responsive and kind! Anything we asked for, she delivered. We will be coming back and making this place a routine check point for our family vacations!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was cute and quaint. I definitely recommend staying here!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Anna's lake house was beautiful and matched the pictures perfectly. On top of that she was flexible with our check out time due to traveling with 3 seniors. My Husband and I enjoyed
taking turns with my Dad on the fishing boat. The trolling motor was charged up, docked and waiting for us when we got there. Their beautiful, large back yard was lovely and sitting in the 3 season porch sipping coffee in the morning was divine. Thank you Anna for such a wonderful and memorable stay with our parents. We will be back."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a nice time with family in this beautiful lakeshore property. There was plenty of room for 4 adults and 2 children. It looked exactly like the photos on the website. The only issue I would mention is that there were bathroom towels on the floor when entering the property for the first time and the paddle boat was full of water. However, I re-washed the towels, along with the towels that were left in the dryer and the paddle boat was cleaned for a short ride on the lake. Nonetheless, everyone enjoyed their stay and would like to come back again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, clean place. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a really beautiful house--exactly as described. Very comfortable beds, plenty of towels, linens and extras you may have forgotten at home. Huge property with Lakeview. It would be a great place to spend more time and utilize the lake and boat. We really just slept here and went back and forth to Notre Dame for a game weekend but we all had plenty of space to relax and beds were very comfortable. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay at Anna's home. It was the perfect place for an end of summer weekend away with our children and their friends. The teens enjoyed the water access and used the kayaks, paddleboat and fishing boat quite a bit. The space was nice for the kids to have a space of their own upstairs where they could sleep and hang out/watch tv. The downstairs is spacious and easily accommodated our group of 8. From lawn games to meals in the screened porch to fishing to campfire s'mores, I think we took advantage of all this home had to offer."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Anna was always quick to respond and very kind!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"10/10. Clean, bigger/better than the pictures. Host was easy to talk too. You won‚Äôt need to leave the place, we sat by the lake & only left to get a few groceries. Will be back."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Had a great stay at Anna‚Äôs place! The house was clean, comfortable beds, nice outside area and the water was nice."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a fun stay we had! From kayaking to cornhole
The house had a ton of activities available for the family to stay busy. A pellet grill that make cooking super easy.
A welcome book located in the kitchen loads of information and instructions for pretty much everything in the house. Everything organized and in its place. The lake was just as beautiful as the house the sand bottom made for just chillen in the lake our favorite activity. We will definitely be coming very soon."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely time at Anna‚Äôs house.
We were on a little family getaway to play our instruments together and get out of the August heat.
The place was so sweet and the yard was dreamy with sun and shade and the lake as the back yard."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Anna's lake house was perfect for our girls weekend. House was exactlywhat we expected based on the listings and it fit our larger group perfectly.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place! We had such a fun and relaxing stay. Kitchen had everything we needed to easily cook our meals. The lakefront was quiet and beautiful. Would definitely book again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,we had a fantastic time!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This. Was. Amazing. I‚Äôm so glad we chose this location. Great yard. AMAZING for all ages. Grandma loved it. Our 9 year old loved it. 10/10.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as described. Anna was very responsive with any questions. Quiet, peaceful house."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,Had a great weekend on Heaton Lake. Anna‚Äôs home is exactly as described and in pictures! The games/water activities provided is such a great extra perk. The area cleaned out off of the dock was so nice to be able to swim in and not get stuck around seaweed. I love that you could see right through the water. Thank you for having us!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place. As advertised.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay here! The house is exactly as described, in a peaceful setting and made for a nice quiet weekend away from the city. Enjoyed the lake, a local burger joint, and everything was just very easy. Great back yard for our pup, with a bbq, lake toys, and a nice kitchen / living room setup."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and clean home! My kids loved the upstairs part. There are games there for the kids along with a pack n play if needed.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My whole family loved our stay! The place was beautiful and updated and we absolutely loved playing around on the water with all of their kayaks, paddle boat, and fishing boat! Everything was just as pictured and the water was just shallow enough at the sides that my German shepherd could stand and even jump out of the lake which she absolutely loved! We had a slight issue with the fridge not staying cold enough the first night but they were very responsive and helped fix the problem. Definitely recommend staying here for a little getaway. The dogs and kids really enjoyed the big back yard (that was all fenced in) with the tire swing and fire pit right by the water, and the view of the little lake is amazing! Especially at sunset! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Anna was a fantastic host. The set up in the upstairs bedroom, along with the rest of the house, was super cute & comforting. Host is very responsive & helpful.
My family and I really enjoyed our weekend."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Place was great enjoyed the lake access. Very close to place I was assigned to work.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great weekend fishing, grilling and hanging out. Host was accommodating and quick to respond. The house was clean and comfortable to stay in. The amenities that the host provided for us, made for a great time that I would highly suggest experiencing."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place and nice, we loved it. Recommend for a unforgettable trip.
The host is very nice and friendly, responding within minutes."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful home on the water would highly recommend to friends and family.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anna was a wonderful host, very responsive and easy to work with. The extreme cold kept us inside but the yard and outside amenities looked like they would be fun to enjoy in warmer weather. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend staying here if you're in the area."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful place! Not only was in amazing the communication and the hospitality were fantastic! We felt at home from the moment we walked in. Highly recommend!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Great stay with all of my family! We had a great stay. Everything was nice and clean!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"Anna's home was large, comfortable and clean. It was also a short twenty-minute ride to Notre Dame. We would readily stay again."
2022-10-01,4,Group trip,Had a good stay at Anna's place. The house was clean and we enjoyed the firepit.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable house. It had everything we needed. Quiet neighborhood and beautiful lake. Would stay here again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great weekend at Anna's place. It really felt like she made sure everything she would need on a weekend getaway would be there. She responded almost immediately to any questions we had. She and her husband went above and beyond to make sure we could use their trolling boat; along with their pedal boat and canoe. The house was very clean. It was advertised accurately; there were no hidden surprises -as there can be with rentals. Their place was clean, cozy, and had lots for us to do. If we are back in the area, we'd definitely rent with Anna again. My cousin said multiple times that it really felt like we were at home."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anna made our stay amazing. Stunning location, clean, and plenty of space for all of us! If we ever find ourselves near Elkhart again this is where we will be staying!"
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home in a very quiet neighborhood. Everything was clean and orderly. The beds were soft with soft sheets and pillows. Loved having the screened in porch for the evenings. The lake front was clean and very accessible. Check in and check out went very smooth and the one question we had was answered very promptly. The only thing I would give warning about would be the stairs. They are steep with small steps and no handrail. So if you‚Äôre planning on littles or elderly being upstairs take this into consideration. It had little effect on us other than a few very slow trips downstairs to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna‚Äôs lake house is a very clean and comfortable place for families to stay. My kids and their cousins loved the upstairs bunk beds and the adults appreciated the private downstairs bedrooms. Anna provides all sorts of amenities that make it an easy way to get away and make sure the kids are outside playing. Highly recommended!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,The property was amazing and we had a great time! Thank you!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family really enjoyed our time together. The house was clean and the space worked well for the 6 adults and 4 kids we had in our group. The lake was warm, and the kids really enjoyed the swimming and kayaking. Fishing off the dock was great for the kids as well. A couple of the adults had a tough time getting into the swimming area, as there are no steps into the water. I do suggest bringing a fan with you if you go during a heat wave like we did. The bedrooms have little to no vents for the air conditioning to cool the rooms at night if doors are closed. Overall, a great stay!"
2022-07-01,4,Group trip,"This is a great place if you are looking for a family-friendly getaway, the perfect amount of sun + shade with the option to hangout in the yard or go out on the lake. It is a small lake, perfect for kayaking!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We decided to take a last minute weekend getaway and we were lucky enough to find this gem in northern Indiana. It had everything we were looking for for a family with four kids: fishing, paddle boat, kayaks, swimming, campfire, cookout, tire swing, and a spacious yard. The inside of the house was spacious too with five beds upstairs for the kids to lounge and play games. We enjoyed Netflix on the TV during the rainy mornings and plenty of space to relax. We highly recommend making friends with the neighbor to the east, Al. He helped us get the grill going and he and his wife made for friendly conversation. Anna, the host, was so easy to work with and very accommodating."
2022-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Very quiet location with large back yard and easy lake access. House was smaller than appeared in pictures, but that‚Äôs typical. Upstairs bedroom has no door so there isn‚Äôt privacy. And the temperature up there was much warmer than the main floor with the air conditioner running. Kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans and enough dishes to accommodate our group of 10."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at the lake house for 16 days, from the very first message, the host was very prompt and on point. The little things like the beach towels, sun block, fully stocked kitchen, made the experience feel like home! The lake was simply amazing and sunsets were breathtaking! Fishing from the dock and shore made the experience even better! We must have caught over 50 bass, blue gill and walleyes! Very quiet lake, so if you are looking for a place for peace and tranquility look no more!! The host was super responsive with every question that we threw their way! Will definitely be back!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, home and communication!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great place! The air conditioner worked great, even upstairs. The lake is very calm and most people were very nice. The fishing wasnt so great but we aren't great fisherman so i can't complain to much.
Great Place!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful lake house inside and out! Great backyard and screened-in porch to hang out and talk to family and friends. House very clean inside and feels brand new. Host very responsive as well. Would stay here again.

2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great house, very nice amenities, nice mattresses, great hospitality, location and views!"
2022-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house is GREAT. The attention to detail the host have put into the renovation is beyond anything I‚Äôve seen. You can tell they take pride in their rental. The swans, geese, and ducks are beautiful."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,A very relaxing place to spend the weekend. It was neat and clean. Would love to come back in the summer and enjoy the lake.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay.
Everything was as advertised and then some.
Would highly recommend.
Host went above and beyond to resolve 2 minor issues that came up.
Both were resolved within an hour of reaching out."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful house, we got a very good experience"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay with Anna! The house has a wonderful open concept floor plan and enough seating and space for our family of five. Our older boys loved the entertainment set-up (one tv upstairs and downstairs) and our 7 year old loved the upstairs loft area! I think she tried out all four of the bunk beds! Anna was very quick to respond to our inquires and even tried to help us find another air bnb when our flight got cancelled and we had to extend our stay! We would love to return during when the weather is warmer so that we can utilize the outdoor entertainment space!
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The refrigerator was dirty
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Home was exactly as in the pictures. Would highly recommend!
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"Clean, convenient, and cozy cottage, perfect for a family of 5 or more.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and Anna was very responsive!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fun location that was super easy to get to the Notre Dame game and even a backroad way to get home and avoid the postgame game traffic jams! We will stay here again when we come for another game.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay very much. Updated home right on the water with boats and kayaks. Terrific yard plus a very well-appointed kitchen. Every detail is seen to. Communication was fantastic with Anna the host. Highly recommend.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was probably the best place we ever stayed in. Stunning, super clean, the hosts thought of everything. Very comfortable beds, the house is stocked perfectly. We spent hours using the boats on the property and that was amazing. Would definitely stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Anna's cottage in Elkhart was awesome. The cottage was clean and had all the amenities we needed. Any questions our host was accessible immediately. We all could use the fishing boat, paddleboat and kayaks and all were used. A must stay especially for the younger kids too."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was great for my family if 5! We had another property booked and unfortunately, it got cancelled because of a storm and power outage. Anna‚Äôs property was available, and we booked it last minute. We really appreciated the last minute booking and it wasn‚Äôt a problem for Anna. It was clean, updated, spacious and had everything we needed and more! Perfect property for my husband and I, and 3 kids (7, 3, 1.5). The water was also great. Nice small lake, means warm temperatures, and not too busy.
Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"The Lakeshore Cottage was fabulous, private, beautiful, well decorated, and very clean. The attention to detail was phenomenal and Anna was always available to answer questions if we had any. I already want to rebook and my family didn't want to leave. Five Star Rating!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Anna‚Äôs house on the lake is a very clean, modern, and comfortable getaway. My kids, extended family, and I all had a wonderful time here, and Anna included everything we could need for fun in the lake. The kids had a blast playing outside with their cousins all day. Highly recommended!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great location! Lake overflowing with fish! Anna was very responsive and the house was beautiful and clean. The shed had so many fun things to use on the lake and even a tackle box for fishing when we ran out of hooks. I would recommend staying here to everyone!
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, very well stocked! The tire swing and the jump pad were a big hit with the kids!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great place to stay with my family. It was such a relief to let me two boys play in the fenced in back yard and not have to worry about them. The house is very nice and tidy.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time at Anna‚Äôs house! Everything is new and clean!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved our stay and wished we had booked more nights. Very clean, very peaceful. We chose to spend most of our time at the place instead of galavanting in Shipshewanna because it was such a nice place to enjoy. We loved watching the different birds come by the bird feeder.
We want to come back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the most beautiful little cabin in the woods. We enjoyed everything and felt home immediately. In the middle of the nature and just wonderful !!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time celebrating my birthday. The place was immaculate, and you could just feel peace all around the place. They have thought of everything at this place! Would highly recommend to others! The watching of birds, and chipmunks was so fun! Listening to the birds was peaceful. Loved sitting out around the fire, and just enjoying life. There is a lot of cute shops and restaurants around the area, but Shipshewana is a hop, jump, and skip - so plenty to do. My husband and I hated to leave - it was a wonderful weekend, and this place is a great hideaway to get away from it all!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a lovely time at the Cabin! It was so cozy and welcoming. The surrounding nature was beautiful and peaceful. Beverly has the cabin decorated perfectly, everything is spotless and she has thought of anything there houser may need. Pictures online do not do this gem justice! We look forward to coming back."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I loved it! Will definitely be returning!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an absolute gem! Serene simplicity in a perfectly curated tiny cabin. The attention to detail is hard to miss as it‚Äôs everywhere. You can truly feel the generosity and warmth of the host from the moment you arrive. Thank you for introducing me to one of my new favorite tea flavors! We experienced such a peaceful weekend that we have started looking into building a little cabin on our land to. Staying here was truly a delight!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We celebrated our one year anniversary here. It was the perfect place for us to celebrate. We were close to Shipshewana shopping and shows and spent a day there. We could have spent all of our time at the cabin and been happy. We spent a whole day just relaxing at the cabin on the porch. It‚Äôs very peaceful and secluded. Thoroughly enjoyed are stay here and would definitely visit here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beverly's cabin off 39 was amazing! The cabin was small and cozy, and very thoughtfully decorated. Also neatly tucked away, and private."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What a beautiful place to stay! Hopefully next time we can enjoy the outdoor things that they offer! Definitely will be back
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is a beautiful and cozy place to get away! It was very clean, and had beautiful scenery."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay in the Cabin! It rained so we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the fire pit outside BUT we enjoyed the covered porch with the rocking chairs and blankets!
We stayed for a mini vacation before our baby comes in May and it was nothing but peaceful and we will never forget our moments in this cabin. My boyfriend ended up proposing in the kitchen with the porch lights on as the sun was going down and I will NEVER forget how beautiful our surroundings were- inside the cabin and outside! Bev was wonderful with instructions, check in and check out rules were clear. The cabin was very clean as well."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This little cabin is simply beautiful and perfect for a couple's getaway!!! The cabin is super clean and decorated so cute. Definitely will be checking to see if it's available first if ever staying in the area!!!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice getaway for the weekend :)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin is the perfect place for quiet relaxation and rest - would recommend to anyone looking to unwind, even just for a night!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,As delightful as advertised! Never had a more pleasant and peaceful stay. 10/10 recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely find it during daylight hours. Driveway is harder to locate in the dark. Other than this detail, lovely, scenic little hideaway. Very nicely decorated. Quiet. Peaceful. The birdfeeders are a wonderful touch..."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little cabin to enjoy. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was located in the backyard. The front of the cabin and the fire pit faces the house, so it did not feel private at all to us. Everything was beautiful, it just wasn't as secluded as what we thought. We were invited to walk the trails in the woods, but, again, it just didn't feel private. The highlight was the bird feeder outside the one window. Lovely people, lovely place, just not for us."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Beverly‚Äôs cabin - our first time returning to any Airbnb property!! As evidenced in other reviews, this cabin is expertly furnished and beautifully placed in a quiet woods setting, we spent several days here after our wedding and returned this year to celebrate our anniversary. The layout is cozy but perfect for 2 ppl to spend time together - it‚Äôs the cleanest and best cabin we‚Äôve ever stayed in. Both a comfortable bed and furniture along with a spotless kitchenette with excellent coffee selections make this an amazing stay. Keep in mind the kitchen does not have an oven, but we heated food in the microwave and didn‚Äôt leave for our 2 night stay. Beverly is great to communicate with and made us feel just as welcome the second stay. Can‚Äôt recommend any higher - we‚Äôre hoping to return yet again!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the cabin was amazing! The hosts were great as well. Highly recommend with a very comfortable bed, great views, and tons of birds."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin that was a joy to stay at. The surrounding nature is great, and Beverly was a great host who provided tons of local recommendations as well as quick responses when needed. I would recommend staying here to anyone!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin was adorable and very clean. It smelled great as soon as we walked in. We enjoyed watching birds at the feeders and sitting by the cozy fireplace. I might be inspired to purchase a Nespresso coffee maker and a candle just like Beverly had at the cabin! My only caution to other tall guests would be that the loft area doesn‚Äôt have much head clearance, but that was not a big concern for us. The location was a nice proximity to Shipshewana."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin did not disappoint! Peaceful, scenic views, cozy & relaxing. We were able to rest up and enjoyed watching the birds at the feeder. Everything was well thought out, the only thing missing was snow! Will surely be returning!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beverly's place was amazing! Super cozy and relaxing. We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying here in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Everything was wonderful here!!
Thank you for sharing your little piece of heaven with us!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute little peaceful getaway for the weekend. Perfect for just my boyfriend and I, I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant so this place was the perfect getaway before our baby‚Äôs arrival. I would definitely recommend to others."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay at Beverly‚Äôs cabin. It was cozy and perfect for two people!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"One word: Perfection. Pictures don‚Äôt do this place justice. This was by far the most romantic, cozy, and cleanest stay we‚Äôve ever had, with a PinPoint attention to detail. Highest recommendation for anniversary‚Äôs or spiritual getaways for couples."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! It was beautiful and peaceful and I can‚Äôt wait to go back!!! Such an amazing little getaway!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"WOW is all I can say about this adorable cabin. It is tucked away in the most beautiful wooded setting, yet you‚Äôre still close to amenities. The views from the windows are spectacular, as are the outdoor spaces. My favorite thing was the bird feeder out the living room window‚Ä¶I sat and watched birds all day."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying here for my birthday weekend üéÉ We enjoyed our time even more the second time because we stayed two nights instead of one. This is my happy place :) It‚Äôs truly a gem. We really enjoyed the bonfire, listening to the rain on the roof, and the cozy stove ‚ò∫Ô∏è The cabin is pristine and makes you feel at home. We will be back again for sure =) Thanks Dave and Bev for sharing this magical place with the rest of us."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I stayed here following our wedding and it was the perfect place to rest up before heading out for our honeymoon! It was absolutely beautiful and we will definitely be back!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow! Such a great place! Beautiful, private, cozy! Only wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow!
Just amazing. Incredibly quiet and peaceful.
Will definitely stay again.
All amenities, extras etc. Were of the highest quality and you can Tell alot of thought and care went into the choices that were made.
If you need peace and quiet, pick the
Getaway off 39!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cabin.
Beverly did not miss any detail from Quilts to wrap up in around the fire to all amenities inside the cabin.
It's set in a beautiful setting. We watched Turkey and Deer from the couch. The front porch was a perfect place to sit in the morning or anytime and enjoy coffee. In the evening the fire pit was a perfect place to sit and relax. The outdoor shower was amazing.
I'm looking forward to staying here again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. It was so peaceful! Highly recommend for a weekend getaway!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beverly was an excellent hostess - very responsive and accommodating! We had the best time relaxing and unwinding in the beautiful cabin. We will definitely be back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a wonderful retreat at Beverly's cabin. The cabin is tucked away in the back half of the property and feels very secluded. It was all we had hoped for and more! Beverly has thought of everything: from all you need to cook in the kitchen to outdoor blankets for the fire pit at night. She had thoughtfully placed little pumpkins and flowers in fall colors around the cabin and had a birding book to enjoy looking up all the feathered friends who stop by the bird feeder. Our favorite spot was the bedroom on the second floor that feels like you are tucked high in a tree house. You are in for a treat if it rains. Open the windows and listen to the rain on the roof and in the woods! It is remarkably soothing, as was our entire trip here. We would highly recommend Beverly's cabin and hope to be able to return someday!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"EXACTLY as described in the listing! So calm, peaceful and amazing. Absolutely loved our time there!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great peaceful sanctuary

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. Very cozy & comfortable. Beautiful job on the remodel. The outdoor shower feature was very cool. Decor was all very nice. Wi-Fi worked great & cell reception worked great on bottom floor. We look forward to staying at this beautiful cabin again in the near future!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cozy cabin was exactly what we were looking for! private yet still in driving distance to do things and explore!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed! The pictures capture the beauty but seeing it for yourself will take your breath away every time you turn around. The outdoor shower is extraordinary! It‚Äôs an added feature you never knew you needed! With all that can be said about the beauty & luxurious extras, Dave & Bev‚Äôs dream of a cabin is something that is so much deeper than just the beauty of it all. It‚Äôs astonishing how special this cabin is & I undoubtably believe that we were destined to be on the path to this place. We left with a profound connection to the cabin & to each other. We are forever grateful to Bev & Dave for covering us with their love & sharing their cabin. We can‚Äôt thank them enough & feel truly blessed that we were written in the history of the cabin all those years ago without even knowing it. We plan to make this a place we return to regularly & hope you get to feel as blessed as we do if you are destined to be on the path to The Cabin off 39."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our cabin experience was to say the least, beyond any cozy and accommodating experience I‚Äôve ever had. The grounds are beautiful, the wildlife is abundant and no tiny detail in the living quarters was not thought of and implemented wonderfully. Any person or couple that needs some real peace and quiet can find it here and reflect and recharge surrounded by little forest friends. The campfire area outside is the perfect setup for anyone to create a peaceful evening by a fire for any occasion. Heating and cooling options are easy to manage and function perfectly, and who doesn‚Äôt enjoy a top notch shower inside or OUT!? Very private, incredibly beautiful and 5-10% the cost of Vegas, this is truly an escape for anyone looking to improve their mental health, wellness and reconnect with the ones we love. Thank you for a remarkable getaway and we will be making this an official anniversary tradition!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely cabin, great attention to detail, and beautiful surroundings."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bev & Dave's Cabin off 39 is the perfect getaway for Shipshewanna and the surrounding towns. Much thought and care are evident in the details, amenities, and atmosphere. Not only is the cabin exceptionally clean & well-stocked, but it's also so tranquil. We highly recommend and will be back to enjoy cooler weather at this delightful, cozy cabin."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The words peaceful, serene, beautiful, restful, and restorative are not enough to describe this incredible place. It is so close to town, but a world away from all the hustle and bustle of life. My husband and I have stayed in many cabins in the three states we've lived in over the years and this one is by far the best. For the amenities, the privacy, the comforts of home, and the ability to disconnect from everyday life, this cabin gets *all* the stars."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little gem in the woods needs to talked about more! We will be back and would recommend to anybody looking for a beautiful, refreshing getaway! Thanks for all the little details you added to the place to make it feel cozy."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recently stayed here for a writing getaway for myself. It was everything I needed and more. I was blown away by the cleanliness and the beauty both inside and outside this place. And not only was it beautiful but I felt like they thought through small practical placement of things as well. There was also a welcome basket and cold waters awaiting my arrival in the fridge. The hospitality was unmatched and the location was perfect. Only a few minutes from the Pumpkin Vine Trail which ended up being a daily rhythm for me. The one word that sums up this place for me would be sanctuary. If you need a quiet oasis to find some peace and rest this is your place! Good not recommend this place more! I hope to be back again soon!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I spent our four day mini-moon here and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful, relaxing and romantic stay. The Cabin was immaculate, secluded, and absolutely beautiful. The outdoor shower was divine, the bed - oh so comfortable, pretty much everything about this place is incredible. After the chaos of work, the hustle and bustle of the city, and the stress of wedding planning, it was such a relief to spend our time together, surrounded by the simplicity of nature. We can't recommend Beverly and Cabin off 39 enough. We'll definitely be back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this place is so much more then what show. I would recommend this spot to all couples who need to get away from life. Beverly was really nice and helpful. will be booking more stays here
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful and peaceful location. My Husband and I eloped in MI and traveled back to Indiana late at night, we were able to ask for a late check-out the night we got to the Airbnb at midnight. We really enjoyed the fire and ambiance of the place."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beverly's cabin was a slice of heaven. Her attention to detail made all the difference. Beverly supplies everything you need for an amazing stay, from high quality bathroom products to a fully stocked kitchen to tons of firewood. Not to mention the style - this place has a secluded cabin feel but everything inside was something I'd have in my own home. And the bed is super comfortable. We found ourselves wanting to stay and hang out rather than exploring the surrounding towns. We will absolutely try to make it back!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a relaxing and peaceful cabin! The rain on all the surrounding trees and the sounds of the birds made it so hard to leave.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the Cabin off 39! Tucked in the woods, quite location, cutest little cabin, & perfect for a couple. It rained nonstop when we were there but with the covered front porch and rocking chairs we were still able to enjoy outside and listen to the rain."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I stayed for one night while traveling through Indiana. I will tell you that one night was not enough! The spot was private and beautiful. The cabin was gorgeous and well decorated. I could sit and watch the birds at the feeder all day! We ended up going to Wedgewood and it was delicious! You can tell a lot of love when into that cabin! Can‚Äôt wait to stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cute little place. We would go back again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin feels like it should be featured on an HGTV show! It‚Äôs the perfect getaway if you‚Äôre looking to relax. Bev provides a list of all the local attractions including restaurants, trails and towns nearby, but between sipping coffee on the front porch rocking chairs, hanging out by the fire, all the kitchen amenities to prepare home cooked meals right there, and just the overall ambience of the place, you may not ever want to leave once you arrive!"

Absolutely love this Sacred and Holy Ground."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at the cabin and it's a wonderful place to getaway. I love the attention detail and how beautiful the place is.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay! Beverly and her cabin deserve more than 5 stars. Loved everything about this property! Peaceful gorgeous setting. The cabin was just amazing from the design, workmanship, decor. A lot of thought went in to this place. The out door shower was awesome, the fire pit area was great. The cabin was close to The Pumpkinvine Trail. Lots of things to do in the area. Beverly was very responsive if we had questions. Cannot wait to stay here again."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin is truly a hidden gem. Beverly has taken the time and effort to ensure a comfortable stay for her guests.
Spotless, and well appointed, we had everything we could possibly need.
The atmosphere is cozy‚Äî almost cave-like. However, the windows on the first level are nearly floor to ceiling and provide ample natural light‚Äî diffused by the surrounding trees.
The amenities are all quite modern‚Äî providing the perfect blend of civilized creature comforts, and a rustic, cozy log cabin environment.
I only wish we could have stayed longer!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Bev‚Äôs place was PERFECT. Beautiful location, very private, and very gracious hosts. We will definitely be returning for years to come."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back in the future. The cabin is absolutely beautiful inside and out. The owners were great with communication and amenities. I highly recommend, if your hoping to stay in the area.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My recent stay at this charming small cabin property was a delight. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that the owners had gone above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction.
First and foremost, the cabin's location was perfect. It was easy to locate, secluded, and stress-free to get into the house (we got the code to enter the day before). Nestled in the heart of nature yet the property was conveniently close to local attractions. We were thrilled to hike and just a stone's throw away from the river.
The cabin itself was a true haven. The owners had clearly put a lot of effort into maintaining the cleanliness and upkeep of the house. Every corner was pristinely clean and we had everything we needed for our 2-night stay.
The owners were readily available (before and during) to answer any questions we had and went out of their way to ensure we had recommendations. Needless to say, we are looking forward to returning next year (maybe during morrel season again!!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wow! We had a wonderful little getaway at the cabin. This little secret is tucked away in a beautiful and peaceful little woods. It looked just like the pictures.

We will be back! ‚ù§
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We chose the location to bike the Pumpkinvine Trail out of Middlebury‚Ä¶ weather did not cooperate so we hiked Chain O Lakes State Park instead. Series of kettle lakes and evidence of beaver activity both amazing. Loved the peaceful feeling of driving through Amish country and staying in the lovely updated cabin! We cooked at the cabin and found everything we needed and even took advantage of the beautifully landscaped fire pit and the tripod grill to cook a steak!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cute cabin in the woods for a nice weekend getaway as a couple. Very clean!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Beverly‚Äôs cabin! It was in a beautiful and peaceful location, spotlessly clean, and had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. The bed was so comfortable and the heated mattress topper was a nice touch for the chilly mornings. The fire pit made for a perfect peaceful evening too‚Ä¶the whole experience was exactly what we needed and we truly didn‚Äôt want to leave!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is an amazingly beautiful setting. So peaceful and secluded. We will try to come back again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a peaceful setting with very scenic surroundings. So pristine and polished inside the cabin. We stayed 2 nights and left feeling satisfied and relaxed. Beverly was very responsive to a question I had. We made breakfast both mornings and had just what we needed for cooking and serving. The coffee press was new to us and we enjoyed trying the new way for making our morning coffee. There is as much or little as you want to do in the area. We will return when back in this area. Thank you for the wonderful Sun-Tue morning stay! Just what we needed.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect getaway from a busy city lifestyle. Home was spotless and set up perfectly when we arrived. Had a great night by the fire pit.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would not have paid the full rate for this cabin because it feels more like a guest house in someone's backyard (even with it being on a private hill) and the regular price rate for this place feels overpriced for a guest suite/home even if it is a really nice quality place
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The stay at this location was amazing with a very comfortable cabin with just the right mix of no distractions with plenty of amenities.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin was gorgeous, we arrived late at night and had no issues finding the location or getting inside.

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the absolutely perfect place to rest, recharge, and reconnect. Bev and Dave have put so much thought into every little detail in this cabin, we could not have asked for a better Christmas getaway.
In the days leading up to our stay, we received a very hospitable and thoughtful message from Bev with all of the details about the cabin and surrounding area that we could've possibly needed.
Upon arrival that evening, the cabin was breathtaking. The entire cabin was completely spotless, and yet it was so incredibly cozy and inviting.
It was nice to be without a tv for a few days and just relax and watch birds, play games, and put a puzzle together with a glass of wine. We truly did NOT want to ever leave!
We look forward to our next stay at the Cabin off 39."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This was hands down the most perfect little cabin in the woods. The little details everywhere made it feel like home away from home. The bed so comfortable. The entire cabin was spotless. This is the perfect place to get away with no distraction. I loved that there was no TV but there are games to entertain. The birds outside were very cool to watch and there had to be 30 at a time right outside the window. Bev was great and very responsive with any questions I had before and during the stay. My boyfriend and I decided within minutes that we were going to be back again and again to spend time here. Very well done with this Airbnb. Everything was thought of and implemented perfectly.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you‚Äôre looking for a place to rest and recharge and get some peace and quiet, look no further!
Beverly was incredibly responsive and friendly, making our stay so seamless and easy!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I came to this cabin for our 2 year anniversary celebration. We booked a few cabins across a few states and this was our first stop!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this place is spectacular. Unbelievable. It's 10 stars out of 5. I went for a self-directed yoga and writing retreat and it was perfect. Large windows to watch the birds and other wildlife (or just to look out and feel like you're living in a nice cozy snow globe as the flakes float down and your toes are warmed by the gas fireplace). Every amenity is plush and luxurious: comfy bed, quality sheets, resort-quality towels (and TP), a coffee bar with many options, seriously everything. I didn't meet Beverly, but I felt the love she and her partner have poured into this sweet cabin every moment I was there. I will do my best to return in every season. What a find!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful to have been back with my husband. Beverly is very attentive to details, and the small touches. She surely has the gift of hospitality upon her. Many blessings on the little cabin and all who are blessed to stay."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I really needed to escape Chicago and reset. We knew we wanted a little cabin in the woods to truly unwind and were so grateful to have found this place. From Bev‚Äôs generous flexibility about check in and check out times, to the cutest welcome box filled with snacks, the stay was more than we could‚Äôve ever imagined! The little touches that make the place, really go so far for those looking to rejuvenate and recharge. No small detail was missed and we loved that we could take advantage of the kitchen and make food/drinks. The cabin is exactly as it looks and by far one of the most cleanest airbnbs I‚Äôve ever stayed in! When we also discovered the beds had heaters we just knew how much Bev and Dave really went the extra steps to make sure this wasn‚Äôt just any regular Airbnb but the coziest place that feels like home. We enjoyed lighting the little candle at night and turning on the indoor fireplace creating the most perfect ambience for two gals in need of some self care! We know we will be back again soon!! üíú"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Run don't walk to book Bev's cabin! My husband and I booked an overnight for our anniversary celebration, and it was worth every penny. Tucked away in a magical wood, the cabin is just the right amount of rustic with luxurious creaturely comforts. Bev provided delicious coffee and tea, as well as snacks and games. You'll sleep in a lush bed with layers of soft bedding. And get ready for a beautiful and warm gas stove, outdoor fireplace, and outdoor shower experience. The cabin was squeaky clean and uber comfortable. I wish we had stayed three nights!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beverly‚Äôs cabin is the perfect getaway. You are surrounded by nature and all the little touches inside the cabin are just as magical. This is the perfect place to take a deep breathe, relax, and recharge yourself. I can‚Äôt wait to book another stay here soon."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a COZY MAGICAL place. If you are second guessing, then I have one word: DON‚ÄôT. First let me start off by saying the views and sounds of nature at this beauty are amazing and so relaxing. If you are looking to step away from the Chaos that life can bring, then this is the place you need to be at. The cabin had everything we needed for our stay and not to mention everything was Immaculately clean!! There were a lot of thoughtful gestures put into this little piece of heaven and that is why I am already planning my next trip to come back!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I made reservations for my parents and they wanted me to pass on their experience.
Beverly and her husband were wonderful hosts! The entire experience exceeded our expectations. Every little detail meant a lot to my husband and I. It was the best airbnb we have ever stayed at. So peaceful and we truly rested without a worry. Lord willing we hope to make a reservation next year for an extended period of time. I also appreciate the scriptures you wrote in the welcome book. Thanks!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the place you want. Beautiful cabin. Very clean, well maintained with all the details ! We loved it and hope to return. Glenn"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What do I say? This cabin is soooo beautiful. The overall architectural style is semi-modern and it has well integrated with the surrounding environment. The interior is pretty much modern style and well equipped with everything you need. You may think you can see everything through the Photos but let me tell you: the photos are fake, because the actual object looks much more beautiful than the photos. Also, it is extremely clean, especially the floor. It is spotless. You can sleep directly on the floor if you want. It‚Äòs so enjoyable to light the fire pit at night, grill something to eat, drink your beverage, and just look at the stars. Anyhow, our experience in this tiny cabin was beyond our imagination. I recommended this place to all the folks who are traveling or on vacation. You will not regret."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay!!
I‚Äôm so glad to stay at this cabin with my husband.
It was clean, comfortable, and super stylish. Dave and Beth did a wonderful job with this place‚Ä¶ so well-decorated and maintained‚Ä¶
The bed was comfy. My husband‚Äôs favorite thing was the outdoor bathroom. We used it a lot during our stay. They also provided snacks, cookies, milk & tea.
Thank you, Beth & Dave."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This cabin was a perfect getaway. If I could give higher than 5 Stars I would. I surprised my wife with an overnight in this cabin; so, she had not seen the pictures. She walked in and said, ""This must be a super-host!"" The cabin was immaculate. The bed was super soft and easy to sleep on. The pictures are accurate. Beverly is truly a super-host and was so easy to reach and talk with during our stay when I had questions. Her thoughtful touches: spices for cooking, honey, tea, coffee, higher quality snacks, hotel style soaps and shampoos, games to play, and a scented candle to burn all revealed that she has given hosting so much thought and attention. Beverly ranks as the highest of all hosts we have rented from, and this cabin as one of the best places we have ever stayed."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute, serene location in the heart of my hometown. Thank you Beverly for hosting us this weekend!"

We look forward to the opportunity to come back.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My mom & I had planned to visit Shipshewana for 2 days and we needed a place to stay overnight. We are SO glad we found/booked our stay at the Log Cabin off 39. The cabin is beautiful & it had everything we needed. First of all, it‚Äôs secluded but not remote. It‚Äôs just off Rt 39, so mom & I felt safe there. The bed & pillows in the loft were extremely comfortable. We were able to adjust the air-conditioning to our liking. The cabin is beautifully decorated. It was all the little touches that made this one of my favorite AirBnB stays ever, including the coffee selections (Nespresso & French press); water, milk & iced tea in the fridge; the basket of goodies filled with nuts, breakfast items, chocolates, popcorn, & a bottle of wine. Seriously, our hosts have thought of everything! We plan to come back."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at this little cabin in the woods. The hospitality and attention to detail had us in awe. Clean, quiet, and so very comfortable.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This adorable little cabin in the woods is a treasure! The extra ""TLC"" provided by Bev encourages the perfect get away. My husband and I look forward to our return visit. (Plans are in the making as I text!)"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing stay. The cabin is amazing to stay in and Bev is an extremely responsive and gracious host.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were super, the log cabin quaint with everything you would need. The setting is beautiful if you like trees and the quiet. Very affordable."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay, perfect get away!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Cabin is small and cozy with everything a person or couple needs to get away and relax. But it is also close enough to sight see everything in the Middlebury and Shipshewana area. The Cabin was nice and cool with just a portable air conditioner even on a hot day. The rocking chairs on the porch were my husband and my favorite place to sit and listen to the birds in the morning and watch the lightning bugs at night. The cabin looks just like the pictures. Decorated beautifully and very clean!
