2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at multiples of Anthony's places and they are all just as adorable as the next. This place is small but perfect for a short stay for singles or a couple. We can't wait for our next reason to stay in the area!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Excellent rental unit. Well appointed. Washer, dryer and laundry supplies were available right inside the unit and free of cost. That's very rare for a small cottage of this size. Although the unit is within a small RV park, no problems whatsoever from other residents. Very quiet. Small town. Town center is somewhat rundown but probably being reconstructed. Nearby towns and cities like Iowa Park, Wichita Falls have very beautiful parks which I highly recommend. Communication from the host was efficient and prompt. I recommend this rental unit."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Anthony’s Cottage was the perfect spot to rest after a long day on the road. It was quick off the interstate and easy to find, keyless door code check in, cold AC, and spotless. It's so much more relaxing than checking into a hotel. Anthony really thought out the space, it felt very spacious and had a kitchenette with coffee and tea. Full bathroom with shower and a washer/dryer! All were much appreciated! We enjoyed our stay and wish we had more time there. If it's available, end your search and stay here!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Lovely place for the price especially. Great for 2 people. Only issues were the dryer is older so it took a couple times to fully dry clothes and the view is meh but regardless was an amazing time.

Electra is a small town and not a lot to do there but if you are traveling and need a comfortable place to stay that is clean and reasonable, any of Anthony's places are great. We would definitely stay again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Just stayed for a night passing thru to the Grand Canyon. House was very clean and exactly as listed.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Anthony’s cottage was perfect for my wife and me as we traveled cross country. The pictures show exactly what is offered. Everything is near new and spotless. This is tiny home like living at a campsite setting. Just off of the freeway in a small town made it easy to find and convenient to get back to the freeway and on our way. Thank you Anthony for giving us a pleasant stay.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful stay, was very happy to find such a nice pet-friendly location. The outdoor motion-sensor light turned on whenever a car passed on the road, but this did not bother me once I closed the blinds. I was grateful to have such a well-lit outdoor area as I arrived after sunset."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It’s always nice to stop here after a long drive. Great hospitality and pet friendly.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super host - very responsive and extra helpful! Very comfortable cabin but with all the extras! Will definitely be back!
2023-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute tiny home. We stayed one night. Was a little difficult to find. It was out in “no man’s” land. The address wasn’t on the home that matches the listing. It had all the amenities listed. We loved the washer and dryer. Sitting on the front porch on rocking chairs at sunset was the highlight. Host was very responsive.
Might bring your own towels. The ones provided were just bigger than hand towels. Place was very clean. Lots of traffic in the morning. You are literally next to the road. Overall, it wasn’t the best we’ve stayed in but definitely not the worst. This was our 21st."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot to stay during our road trip! We stayed in Anthony’s other cottage on our way there, and loved it so much that we booked his other place on the way back. The place is spotless, with a big tv, and fully stocked kitchen. Anthony also communicates proactively to make sure check-in is seamless."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,this was a great stop along our trip. Anthony was super helpful and accommodating. We appreciated how convenient it was to get to from the highway and all of the thoughtful little details they had in the Airbnb.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This AirBNB is 20 Minutes from Wichita Falls. Close to a gas station. 10 minutes from Starbucks. Anthony did great with the freezing weather, He made sure we had Running water. The inside is beautiful. Well cleaned. Plenty of kitchen ware. The heating and cooling is very nice and super quite. We will be staying here Everytime we visit our Texas family."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Electra
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"These cottages were great . The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was very usable, the washer being full size was a huge bonus , as we were already on the road 5 days."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed over a week,Excellent cottage for a few days (not designed for long stays). Can be a bit loud as the cottage is on a main road into town. Overall great place!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the cutest little house, I rented this out for my parents they absolutely loved it. Perfect for a weekend getaway for two. I highly recommend this cute little house , we will definitely be rebooking ."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is adorable and a bang for your buck! If you’re going for fun just book! Security system in place for those of us traveling alone. Washer dryer mini fridge and all the utensils you could need! Most importantly a wine bottle opener lol! Now if your traveling for work keep in mind there is a train I only heard it once, it’s off a somewhat busy road just close your blinds but it settles down after 6, you may even hear some coyotes but hey that’s the country for you! With that said I will definitely be staying again! He was quick to respond check in was easy and when I didn’t understand my alarm system he gave a girl a hand! Just absolutely amazing service!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the coolest place! 🤩 It is so clean, minimalist, and well-designed. And Electra is absolutely gorgeous. It feels like you're out in the middle of nowhere, yet living in (tiny) luxury. 😁"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay, very convenient just off 287, well-equipped cottage with everything you need!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very clean, comfortable and convenient. No issues, great stay. Hope to return soon."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Oh my goodness! This Airbnb was fantastic. We've stayed in a lot of airbnb's but this one stands out in superiority! Very organized space - not huge, but had everything we needed and things we didn't. I've seen much bigger spaces that didn't have everything this airbnb had. Anthony was very easy to communicate with and allowed us to check in early as we had been traveling since 3 am. Electra had a couple of good places to eat as a bonus. I wish we could have stayed longer than a night. I can see this being a great place for someone to live as a traveling nurse, etc. We plan to try to stay here again on other out of town trips up this direction. It was easy to get to and close to the road. Electra is not a big town and there was virtually no traffic on the road. Bed was comfortable and linens were great. I want to be able to stay here again so don't tell your friends! LOL!!!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Host was very responsive. The cottage was as described. This is one of the cleanest airbnb I've ever stay at. We enjoyed the tiny house experience. They have everything you need.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect stay as we were on the road. Extremely affordable and had everything we needed and we booked super last minute. Would definitely stay again.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,We will be repeat customers! Immaculate! New construction with that new house smell! It's so cute and the a/c blows cold on a hot day! totally recommend!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very clean place, It has everything i needed!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect spot to stay for the night! Anthony had great communication as well!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great location and great overall stay. Looking to stay again in the future.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was perfect. My wife and I had a long road trip ahead of us and this was one of our stops to wash up & rest for the night. This tiny home was one of the cutest homes we’ve stayed at. Very Very clean and has everything you need!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for 2 wks while I finished out my job at EMH. It was clean And had everything I needed.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a cute and clean place! We got quick responses even late at night and it was very much appreciated!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute. Clean. Convenient. And has everything you need!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anthony is such a kind person and really cares about his guests having a good experience, which is really refreshing these days. I got in late after a long drive; he went out of his way to make sure the lights were on when I arrived. The cottage is spotless and has everything you need, with lots of thoughtful touches throughout."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect and relaxing stay! I was visiting my daughter and new grandson who lives nearby. The place was very clean and well furnished with everything you need. Just fyi there is occasionally some road nose from trucks (near hwy business road) but it is not bad and pretty much ends by bedtime. I only noticed it a couple of times. The location, privacy, roominess, and amenities far outweigh any noise. I will definitely stay here again. It was cool to see the transformation of these tiny cabins and how efficient and well everything fits. The WiFi was great and with the Hulu tv I was able to enjoy my downtime and get work done. There is a dispenser in the shower with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. I do feel the owners went above and beyond to make the cabin nice and comfortable. If you are visiting or passing through definitely give these a try!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cottage. Beautiful views in the early morning and evening. Conveniently located. The host is wonderful
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice small cabin, with a lot of unique touches I thought were nice. Host was helpful and when I had trouble with the code (I later figured out I was just pushing the numbers too slowly) the host came and helped me get in and figure out the issue so I could get back in on my own next time. I'd absolutely stay here again if the need arises."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay! Super clean, quiet and safe. Anthony responds very quickly. Adorably decorated and thoughtfully planned out. Bathroom counter also had plenty of space to set your stuff which was greatly appreciated! Definitely a five star place!!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great quiet location , clean and beautiful! The little cottage has everything you could need! Learning about the towns history is a great thing to do while hanging out and relaxing! :) can’t wait to come back"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was by far the best stay I’ve had at an AirBnB!! The host was so nice and helpful, the house was peaceful and quiet, the backyard and parking situation was perfect. We had to bring our dogs with us for thus trip, and they were so accommodating!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Anthony's place was very beautifully decorated and arranged. Everything we could need and more, was available. It was nice and cool, smelled good ,was very spacious and felt welcoming !
The all-fenced yard outside was extremely handy and our two little boston terriers accepted it immediately, rolled in the nice grass, did their thing and then came back inside with us....until the next time , when we saw them waiting at the back door.
We loved our stay, slept soundly on the clean, comfortable bed and wished we could have stayed longer.
We highly recommend Anthony's place !"

Thanks again Anthony!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accomodation. Very clean and spacious enough. Fridge is a bit small but probably sufficient for most guests. Neighborhood is a mix of well-kept homes (and some really large ones) and some small houses that seem near to ""falling down"", but this is typical of small towns in this part of Texas. Neighborhood is safe and quiet. Front porch is awesome."

It was a drive to get to the cottages, but once you were there, it was totally worth it! Anthony was very responsive and helpful. The cottages (we stayed in two different ones because part of our team came down for a few days) were clean, cool, and very homey."

Good sized, easy to find, plenty of parking including covered parking (very handy in an area that regularly sees hail), super clean and tidy, smoking fast internet, etc. I really could go on but you get my point. Whether you're staying for a while or just passing through this place will satisfy your needs."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Definitely spacious and beautiful. I hosted a murder mystery dinner with the other 5 guests and the place had just the right touch of elegance.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second stay in one of Anthony’s places. I thought it would be hard to top the last cabin though the house was fabulous. It was clean and comfortable. The three bedrooms and ample living room space made it a great place to relax and visit family. Oh, and he always has some coffee with creamers on hand in the kitchen! The check in was a breeze and the neighborhood quiet. Will definitely be back."
2023-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,The house was cleaned and well maintained. The backyard did have tons of dry dog poop. The town in general was a little sketchy but the security system made staying in the home feel safe.

2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great little house to stop for the night on our way to Colorado with our pups. Easy to find. It was a chilly night and took a bit to warm up once we got there but had plenty of blankets to stay warm. The train woke us up a few times but we knew that from previous reviews so not a big deal.

Unrelated to the AirBnB and it’s host, I advise caution traveling down the roads in the area- take it slow, and you should be fine. There are a few really bad bumps in the road- though that’s a problem the city itself will gads to fix."

We would gladly pick this house again, thanks for the opportunity to stay here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Excellent place to stay if you’re traveling through with family and pets. Electra has some really neat historic structures to view and you can’t beat a fenced yard. Much more convenient than staying at a hotel.

Everything looked new and tidy and smelled good. We felt right at home, and our kids and I loved all the chicken-themed decor. I particularly appreciated the bright and clean bathroom (including a clean shower curtain), a real stove to cook on, a real fridge, the supportive bed, easy-to-operate TV and AC units, and all the thoughtful touches to welcome us, including things for the kids. This place, set in a sleepy quaint town, was the perfect place to stop between Houston and Boulder on our road trip."

Sheila went above and beyond, last minute to get me in as soon as possible. She was such a blessing to our family. The house is beautiful and spacious! Very clean! Backyard and patio is huge.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. Sheila is incredibly responsive & gracious. Her craftsman home has charming original details & is comfortable in every way. AC, 3 big bedrooms (one w/ a king bed) and an additional half bath. The beds were COMFORTABLE with fluffy pillows. A wonderful rocking chair front porch, a back porch with a grill by the garden & easy parking. The kitchen was exceptionally well equipped with everything needed to cook at home. It’s on the main road but still very quiet; an easy stroll to groceries and quaint shops. Having a 24-hour convenience store so close by was nice. Originally, we were to be staying in Vernon, TX but our place got double booked (only discovered after flying across the country and were headed there in our rental car). Everything around there was booked and we were in a pickle. We messaged Shelia. She was prompt to accommodate our needs and even left us some cookies! Well worth the 30 minute drive from Vernon to have such a rejuvenating place to gather & unwind."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Electra! It’s a great place to go if you just want a quiet stay. The space was exactly as advertised. There were a couple of minor things that could have been better. There were a lot of dead crickets throughout the space, but at least they were dead:) Also, the towels and wash cloths in the bathroom could have been upgraded. They seemed a bit old and had a soured smell when wet. Overall it was a great space to meet half way for a weekend away. Austin was very friendly and quick to respond!"

2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to locate with easy check-in & out. Located in a quiet area. Thankfully it was a little cooler outside this past weekend and it wasn’t needed, but ceiling fan & lights are all on one switch so you can’t run the fan without the lights.
Place was clean and stocked with toiletries. Instantaneous hot water, just wish the shower pressure had been better."

The room was spacious with more amenities than usual. I was able to do my laundry and cook a meal while there. It was very cozy and relaxing, especially after a busy week. I highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here again the next time I have to come back. I couldn’t imagine staying at a better place for that price. Austin was quick to respond with any questions that I had or to resolve any issues. Can’t wait to come back!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great host. Made himself available as needed but also gave space when not. The unit was clean and well stocked as someone who works on the road 100% of a time this was an absolute oasis instead of a hotel room. Will definitely stay again when in the area

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect location! Very clean and spacious. Will definitely be back!!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We needed a 3 bedroom rental close to Thalia, Crowell and Archer City, for a family reunion and related events. This apartment was perfect for our needs and was exactly as it appeared and described in the listing. It was clean, well-appointed, roomy and comfortable. Amber was very responsive and helpful throughout the rental process. The listing mentioned the area may be noisy and we experienced some of that. One of the buildings tenants apparently left early for work several mornings and slammed a lot of doors and noisily loaded a pickup truck. Obviously, Amber can't control the actions of other building tenants, so no fault on her part. The apartment suited our needs and was certainly more economical and roomy than a hotel. The next reunion is 2 years away and I would certainly rent this apartment again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place look forward to staying there again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was a quick overnight while on a cross country journey. The place was beautiful! So well decorated and felt very homey! Even staying downtown on a main road, it wasn’t noisy. I’m sure the cute downtown atmosphere would have been fun to explore. Amber was super helpful and responsive! Would gladly stay again!"
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"great location downtown Vernon. large space, good amenities, nice decor. i only wish it was more equipped with basic amenities such as toilet papers and paper towels because limited quantity were provided for a week’s stay so we ran out after two days. and it might be helpful to put some paddings between the cabinets because it’s very loud when it’s shut and noise travels loudly within the townhouse. overall would definitely recommend this place and come back to stay. Amber is communicative and answers questions promptly."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay; will definitely be staying again when back in town!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,great host ....will be staying at another property of ambers.... recommended if you enjoy staying downtown!!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a spacious, clean and very inviting space. As only one person I had many beds to choose from. I was dropping my son off to Vernon College and this was extremely convenient by rental car. I got take out from a Thai spot just minutes down the road and the food was delicious. There is not a lot to do in downtown Vernon that I could see so I’d definitely recommend a rental or having transportation depending on the reason for your stay. Amber was a delight and so helpful during my stay as well. I look forward to returning for baseball season! Thanks Amber!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Perfect stay, comfortable, quiet, and roomy. Amber was always very helpful.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little cottage that had everything we needed to feel at home for a 2 night stay. 2nd room was kind of a tight fit, but since it was for small kids, definitely not a deal breaker. And after all, it is a cottage. Across from a park and track, so was able to allow kids to play and walk for exercise. Would definitely book again if needed. Great host who was very responsive. Security system was an added bonus to make you feel safe…."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great cottage, wonderful decor"

The place was close to the AFB so we could visit put son and close to loads of shopping and eating establishments.
Anthony even messaged with a picture of an item we had forgotten, and was very helpful in getting it back to us.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The accommodation was perfect, well-decorated,comfortable, and safe. Located across from the basketball courts and adjacent to the high school track afforded me places to exercise. Coming from the city, I enjoyed the rural feel of Electra, Texas.
The house is equipped with an alarm system which was made me feel safe as a solo female traveler. I encourage you to consider this lodging should you wish for a peaceful and quiet place to stay. BTW, Anthony was very attentive to my email messages"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had a great short stay. The place felt very homey and was a great stop between TX and CO. One thing to note it is an older house so it was very squeaky (just something to keep in mind if traveling with a light sleeper infant). There’s also a train nearby and while I absolutely love the sound of train and it didn’t bother us, it is something I wanted to note for others. We really took comfort in the alarm system, it was definitely reassuring. The place was clean and extremely well stocked, especially the kitchen. I highly recommend this airbnb to others and we look forward to staying again in the future."

We had absolutely everything you need to cook & even more! We truly enjoyed the board games they had & the puzzle book. The fire pit in the back was our absolute favorite specially during these nice and cool fall nights. What truly was the best experience was when the hosts were kind enough to let me know they had found my airpods i had left by mistake. It means so much to me, we are beyond happy & we will go back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anthony is the most responsive host on Airbnb! I’ve stayed in multiple spots of his and they are always clean, with great amenities, and he is super helpful. Definitely recommend!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"After re-routing my trip home to swing by Cadillac Ranch, I found this little gem! It was off the beaten path in the small town of Electra, about 3 hours from Amarillo. Anthony's place was pristine, and well designed. The neighborhood was quiet and the beds were fantastically comfortable! I could hear a train from time to time, but I love trains so that only added to the dreamy quality of the space. I just might have to re-route my trip every time I am headed to Texas to spend a quiet evening in this beautiful place."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is the quietest place we’ve stayed in a long time. Everything was very comfortable. Our 7-year old loved the hot cocoa and playing at the playground that can be seen from the front porch. My husband’s grandmother really liked the peace, quiet, and comfort of this little house too. We would happily stay here again."

In the guest book he even took the time to tell the story of how the place was furnished, handmade carpentry and who helped make this cute place possible. Very quiet little corner property, very clean and furnished with everything we needed for the night. Anthony was very responsive and proactive in communicating with us. Highly recommend staying here!!!"

2023-07-01,3,Stayed with kids,"This house is very cozy, nicely decorated, and had everything we needed for our stay. Anthony responded quickly to any concerns..Sadly, on our stay, the air-conditioning went out on a hot July day. Anthony came quickly to fix the issue. It took a while to fix and then took over 5 hours to cool the house under 80 degrees. The host extended apologies, but nothing more. One night stay was spent sweating and fighting kids to sleep.
So as long as the AC stays strong I recommend this house."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place loved it

She got so many ideas, I will spend the summer making our house like yours!!!
