2019-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ellen and JD are lovely people and their apartment rental was perfect for us. It was a spacious size with a large walk-in closet and great air con. We like to fix a lot of our own healthy food and we could do that in the well-equipped kitchen complete with dishwasher and large fridge w/ice maker. There was a lovely ""smart TV"" which we actually used as a computer screen, but there was a huge choice of channels one could watch. We prefer a quiet location and this suited us to a ""T"". The screened-in porch was wonderful for meals, reading or computer work. We loved sitting out here at dusk watching the lightening bugs and listening to the songbirds, two amenities we do not have in our home area. The neighborhood provided excellent walking opportunities among beautiful homes. We were in the area to conduct genealogy research; the location was perfect for drives to Lincolnton, Hickory and Charlotte, each of which was about 30 minutes away. Ellen even loaned us a cooler and ice packs so that we could travel with a picnic. I can't say enough about how pleased we were in our home away from home. We would definitely come back in a heart beat."

Ellen and her husband were close by if I needed anything; however, they knew I was there to learn about a new venture and respected my need for solitude. They welcomed me upon arrival, showed me the apartment, offered directions to grocery stores, etc. and I felt instantly at home.

The house was very comfortable, very clean and well equipped. Brenda was so thoughtful in providing many incidentals that made our stay comfortable and stress free!

I love that it was a short drive to town to enjoy restaurants, ice cream, and fun thrift stores, and antique shopping! But, at the end of the day, the best thing was the house itself. Perfect place to refresh your soul!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow! This is a great AirBnB. It's about an hours drive from the Charlotte Airport, too, so its convenient for anyone who is traveling out the day after your stay.
The pictures show you just what you will experience. It's a VERY PRIVATE place, and you get the whole house to yourself. It's quiet. The house has all you need if you want to make a meal or want to grill out, etc.
We spent our night there at the end of our trip, and it was such a great, relaxing evening. We relaxed outside under a shelter attached to the back patio, and we smoked cigars while the rain pelted the roof of the shelter. It was a perfect way to end our trip and relax after driving so much the other days.
We highly recommend this place, and if we're in the area in the future, we would recommend staying with Brenda at this great AirBnB."

However, if you care to be more adventurous you can explore trails or fish and kayak on the pond. Beyond gracious the host was available to answer any questions.

I was blown away by the attention to detail! The host stocked the kitchen with essentials, and the coffee/tea area is incredible. They did not skimp on any details! I slept so well!

The neighborhood is a bit old but very quiet.
One word of caution, the hot water heater is not set at the recommended 120-140¬∞ temperature. So just be careful if you have little ones that like to wash their hands by themselves. They will be scalded if not careful.

When we arrived, we were greeted with an unparalleled sense of tranquility and seclusion. The privacy afforded by the expansive property allowed us to truly disconnect from the world and immerse ourselves in the wonders of nature.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! It was very clean and private. The instructional videos were very helpful. The host (Jeff) was super responsive and patient. I hope to book this place again when I visit family in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great stay and I will be going back. I had to leave in a hurry due to some family stuff but would have booked longer if I could.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was just as listed on the site it‚Äôs beautiful the surrounding is peaceful everything worked out great I would definitely be booking again in the future
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay here and they were super responsive and easy to communicate with.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to get away in quite the remote location. I did not get to spend as much time as I had hoped on the porch just watching the river go by, spending most of my time away. Just know that it is definitely remote, so driving in at night can be a bit of an adventure. Getting into the door was relatively easy, though a little tricky opening both locks. I felt secure in the setting."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved this trip here. So peaceful and quiet, no one bothered us. definitely will be going back here again. Highly recommend this spot."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My son and i had a great time and stay at Watson's place. i like that it was on a river and was very peaceful. only downfall was it was just a bit tucked in the land and was a 15 min plus drive to get food and supplies. location distance between Charlotte and Asheville was what i was looking for just wish amenities were a little closer and more option. The place was perfect for me and my son and was the type of getaway i was looking for me and him. the set up of the RV was very nice. had a nice rustic feel and a nice deck that was created for the place. I would say a slight downfall would be that there was not any wifi, but i think that help my son and i find more things to do together and bond more. so i would not give that a negative mark."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"we loved this place! The view of the river was amazing and the area was very quiet, almost as if time has stopped. We found great hiking near by and a surprising number of good places to eat. We'll definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay for the weekend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,...
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very quiet and reserved, nice neighbors overall great stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a great last minute stay will return!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely perfect! Plenty of room for two (much larger than you'd expect for an RV), on a lovely piece of property. Ideal for a getaway or home base for exploring. I'd go back in a heartbeat!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place for our two day get away. Location was very private and quiet. Home was extremely clean and everything we needed was provided. Host was great communicator. Due to cold weather, we did not take advantage of the welcoming front porch that overlooked the river, but plan to do so when we return. Kitchen was stocked with essentials including coffee pods. Seating in living area was comfortable. Fireplace in bedroom provided great ambiance. We brought several DVDs and enjoyed the surround sound system. updated pull down u blinds throughout provided all the privacy you could want. Pictures on listing are great representation of the home. Thanks to host for a secluded unique retreat!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Nice quiet spot for the week. Looking forward to checking it out again in the spring.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and location. Will definitely book again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is awesome! The pictures did not do it justice. It is very clean, well maintained and is in a beautiful location. It is warm and cozy and felt like home. I loved the front porch! It is so relaxing to sit and watch the river and listen to its rippling water. Watson is a wonderful host. Very responsive to massages and even sent videos with instructions on how to work everything like the thermostat, gas stove etc. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and will definitely be back. Well worth the money!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,great host
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Really cute and comfortable. This place is a real gem!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful, WARM, CLEAN.
We have verizon and had no issues with connection, was kinda hopeful that we could not connect...kinda. i honestly am the problem lol. My adhd gets the best of me in perfect silences, but not hear. It did rain for our stay but it didnt matter. The porch!!! Omg. The rain on the metal roof, the perfect static from the river, i truely didnt miss my phone. I actually lost it for a whole day cause i forgot where i sat it and didnt even realize till about time to check on the minions at home. Cookware, dishes, good size fridge, bed was great, i want the couch, its just a cool couch lol. Super clean!!! Never saw anyone except just driving by in the drive way which was only twice, and didnt hear anyone. Ohhhhh bruh theres this little fat squirrel, he hangs out top and in the tree he runs down the beam and gives ya the stank eye. He also peeps in the top window in the living area little creeper."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and secluded! Property was clean and very well kept. Access was easy and the host was very helpful with communication. The property was really clean and in great condition. Had everything you needed for your stay! Enjoyed this location and amenities!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great peaceful place! It is deep in the forest and right on the river. We fished and enjoyed the views. If you do fish, be aware of trees and bushes. We lost a few lures but still had fun. The water was fast moving and shallow. The sound system in the house was nice and we watched a couple dvds. We will consider this place again if in the area."
2023-11-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Expect kept, interior is a darker design, and lots of shade outdoors, and a little rugged roadway. Tv n dvd needed explanation, didn‚Äôt end up watching it. Has a nice table and some comfort."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,definitely recommend watson is an amazing host had a great time
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This location was exactly as described & pictures were spotted on! Very peaceful & private! We will definitely stay again if we need to!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved it! Loved the view very peaceful had a great time will definitely be going back!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôd love to stay here again. Some things weren‚Äôt in places where they should be, but I eventually found them with help from the host and put them back where they should be. The host was helpful.
Some minor things didn‚Äôt work, like the porch lights, some blinds, and the bedroom door. But for a quiet place with peaceful surroundings at an affordable price, I‚Äôd say it was overall a good stay."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Lack of TV. Kitchen could have been better equipped. Lights on porch not working. Glad we stayed only two nights
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"View of River was nice! And sound of the River peaceful. We enjoyed using the picnic table and campfire with our 9 yr-old granddaughter. The camper was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The covered porch was also great, and had a little outdoor kitchen area that my husband used in the early morning so as to not wake our granddaughter up. We went to another granddaughter‚Äôs competition at a farm that was about 15 minutes away. With 3 hours between her scheduled events we were close enough to pop back to the camper for lunch and relax awhile. It looks like there may be a seasonal Kayak rental 2 doors down to the left. The public access to the river near the kayak rental was used by a Kayak according to tracks left in mud. Access is overgrown. Bring a grill tank with fuel if expecting to grill. Or bring charcoal - there was a small charcoal grill."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a wonderful place to stay. My only regret is that we couldn‚Äôt stay longer. Everything is clean and the area is extremely peaceful. Just as described.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it here and will be back! We had an event in Casar , so really didn‚Äôt have time to spend at the camper, but we will be back to just spend some time relaxing here!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding in Every Way ! Well Done .
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Really nice place exactly as described
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,The fifth wheel was probably the nicest one we have ever been in. The cabinets were beautiful and the space ample. We felt very comfortable and wished we had booked it for 2 nights so we could have just sat on the porch for a day and relaxed. We would recommend bringing whatever meals you would like to prepare/eat while staying as it is quite a way to town.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place right on the river. Wish i didnt have to cut my trip short. Hopefully i coukd tent in again one day under better circumstances.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely setting by the river, neighbors were quiet, peaceful location. Listing matches both pics and description."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay here yet again! So relaxing and everything you could need to stay there comfortably. The river was very clear this time and ended our stay with a magnificent thunderstorm! We hope to come back again soon! Thank you!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were not sure what we should expect as to whether the pics portraying the camper inside and out were true to real-life or not. But they were, and we were not disappointed. We are already talking about when we might have a return visit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Serene and clean

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It is a great experience! I really enjoy the comfort of an RV. It is homey and compact. Watson's RV is more than expected. It has a very nice porch. The inside is super nice and clean. The bed is very comfortable and the pull out couch is such a nice addition. The built-in surround speaker system makes listening to music and watching movies a nice experience. I plan to book again very soon!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's a really cool place on the river.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fun little getaway only an hour from Charlotte. Only a 12 minute drive to a local trailhead if you want to get your feet in the river. There is no access to the river at this site.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,I highly recommend Watson‚Äôs RV. You would never know it‚Äôs a camper. The most comfortable place I‚Äôve stayed at. We are already planning on booking again üòä

The camper had everything we needed to make it a 5 star camping experience. Thanks again for letting us stay.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,thank you again for a fabulous stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful tree house. Close enough to restaurants but far enough away for privacy. Perfect place for a restful weekend.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Celebrating my husband‚Äôs recent birthday, I wanted to surprise him with a quick getaway to a tree house‚Äîsomething he has mentioned in the past. CreekSide ReTreet was a perfect fit. The location is private, yet close enough to restaurants, golf, and other places. But let me speak a little about that mattress‚Äî-that king size mattress is top quality, 5 star hotel quality, with bamboo king size pillows!! And the linens are divine as well! Awesome! You need to check it out for yourself!"

The host was very informative, I didn‚Äôt have to ask any questions and there were no confusions because clear instructions were given. The treehouse itself is located in a great spot- it‚Äôs secluded and peaceful. The inside was very clean and has everything you need. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend this place to others! Perfect getaway for couples. The hot tub is also a very nice touch."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super sweet place! The tree house is tucked back in the woods so it‚Äôs pretty private (we stayed in the winter after all the leaves had fallen and it still felt secluded). The space is perfect for 2 people looking to get away, my wife and I loved it! On top of that, the downtown area is only 10min away and has a bunch of great restaurants. 10/10 would recommend."

After getting sorted, we relaxed in the hot tub where the natural autumn scenery and babbling creek were restorative to our weary bodies. The string lights adorning the cabin made it glow in the twilight. The treehouse was clean, cozy and quiet. Sleep came easy as the bed and pillows were was extremely comfortable. The sun rising above the hill sending rays of gold through the trees was a pleasant treat to see."

We live at the beach so the mountains are our place to get away and that's exactly what Creekside ReTREEt was for us.

Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was definitely one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed! It was very private, but not in the middle of nowhere.

If you are looking to disconnect‚Ä¶ The trees, the soothing water sounds from the creek and the Hot tub will definitely help you recharge. The pictures honestly don‚Äôt do justice to how beautiful this treehouse is. The host went above and beyond for us, responding quickly and even after we checked out, my boyfriend forgot his watch and Mickey went out of the way to send it back to us! That made us feel so valued and cared for. Outstanding stay! Outstanding host! I‚Äôd give it a thousand stars if I could"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! Would definitely recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a weekend getaway for my wife and me. I wanted to stay in a treehouse for a different experience and after searching, discovered treehouses are either nice but very expensive or they are not great. After clicking several options, landed on this property and was blown away by how nice it was and it was reasonably priced. So I booked it, not knowing a thing about Shelby, NC.
When we arrived, check-in was superbly easy and clearly communicated by Mickey. So we had no issues there. And the property was exceptional. There is always that moment where you walk around to see if the pictures lied to you. In this case, they did not. Mickey's place was beautiful, comfortand the setting was great (and private). We thoroughly enjoyed the deck for reading, the jacuzzi for chatting and hanging out with a few beverages. We also found Shelby to be a neat little town with good food, shopping and some easy local hiking. Highly recommend staying here! It was restful and fun!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A beautiful little cabin my partner and I stayed in after a long day. Check in was easy once we found it and the host responded quickly and was very helpful even though we arrived a lot later then expected. The place was clean and comfortable and felt like a little home away from home. The hot tub was a very nice touch after a stressful day and the bed was cozy.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We thoroughly enjoyed our time at this amazing treehouse! Mickey has thought of quite a few things to make his treehouse a wonderful choice for a weekend getaway.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Much appreciated
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We spent the night at this tree house for my wife‚Äôs birthday. As someone who lives in the shelby area it was nice to find a place that felt like you were getting away, without having to drive a long we to get there.
My wife definitely loved it and it made her birthday great!"

It was beautifully decorated and had just what we needed."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The tree house was beautiful, very clean and quiet.

d benefit.
The town of Shelby was very cute. We celebrated our 25th and was very happy."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The treehouse is beautiful & we loved our stay here! The host was kind & responsive & all of the pictures in their posting are accurate. The sounds of nature were abundant each morning and you could hear the water flowing from the creek all day! We really enjoyed the hot tub because it gave us something to do on the property, instead of searching the small town for a good date night idea. We were lucky enough to witness a beautiful thunderstorm through the large picture windows and it set the tone for a peaceful night. I suggest bringing playing cards or some board games along for some added entertainment. We did step out to go eat, because the kitchen is small and there's nothing to really cook with, unless you plan to grill outside. A toaster oven or air fryer would of allowed for more easy options & simple meal solutions.Wings Etc. is right up the road and they had the best chicken wings-so treat yourself to take out! Overall, this was a great stay & we're so glad we got to visit!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,great place
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Me and my fianc√© had the most peaceful , relaxing, romantic anniversary we could ask for. Listening to the water while sitting on the porch was very calming.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Donna responded quickly to my questions. I was looking for a place to stay with my family while visiting my daughter at GW and this was perfect. The beds were very comfortable and we had room to spread out. My 6‚Äô son slept deeply on the couch when we needed an extra sleeping surface. As others have mentioned Wi-Fi is iffy. We knew this going and brought some card games so it was a non issue for us. We loved listening to the frogs singing at night and the ducks were very entertaining. Hopefully it will work out for us to stay here again.

Donne even let us check in early and check out late. The cabin was exactly how it was pictured. I was so peaceful and quiet. I enjoyed sitting on the porch watching my kids play outside and fish in the pond. The ducks are cute and loved to be fed. The first day we got there, my teenage son caught 2 fish! It's serene but just close enough to nearby restaurants and stores. If in the area again, we'd love to stay again. Thank you Donna for such a memorable experience. :)"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was just amazing. If you like being away from all stress and civilization this is the right place for you.

Donna gave very good directions and instructions and was very friendly. She allowed us to check in a bit early and that was very helpful!
The cabin was just as in the photos and very comfortable.
The only two things I would change‚Ä¶.the light switches are very confusing. Labels would be great! The cleaners could do better. I had to sweep and mop the kitchen prior letting the baby down on the floor."
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,Cute cabin in a beautiful setting provided a peaceful weekend getaway.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This cabin was the perfect place to stay for our weekend in North Carolina. We booked it specifically because it was pet friendly, so a family member could bring their dog. The cabin is tucked back behind the main house and away from the road, so it was very quiet and had plenty of space that we could walk around with the dog. Donna is also very responsive to messages and gives clear instructions for a smooth check-in."
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,Donna was very helpful and quick to respond to the issues we shared. She does not live locally and said she would have someone visit the property to make improvements. The outdoor space was beautiful and the ducks are a hoot.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful getaway.
We were lucky to be in town seemingly just as the fireflies started to light up the evening sky.
The overall property is big enough to explore and small enough not to get lost.
This is not a work remotely area. Cellular connection is weak and we were unable to figure out the wifi connection. But to be honest that was a good thing requiring us to be in the moment and enjoy the peace of the space. It is the country after all. Having some friends that live in the area they confirmed minimal internet is a common thread.
They have some fun active spaces such as a horseshoes area. Fire pits and bbq pits for your pleasure. The furniture was comfortable and the water for showers was hot. There is a family of ducks you can feed who are just so fun and will follow you if they think you will be feeding them soon.
The area at night is so peaceful and quiet. Overall I would recommend staying here again. It was a pleasure to get away to."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice house‚Ä¶very peaceful, spacious, and easy to find"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna's house was a great place. cool and quiet place. definitely enjoyed the horse shoe pit while grilling dinner. the bed was more than comfortable. I definitely didn't want to wake up and go to work. My favorite part was talking to the ducks. When working in the area I will be looking to reserve another stay at Donna's house.
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at the quaint cottage. The duck pond was so picturesque. The bed was very comfortable. We were comfortable there while we visited family in Boiling Springs.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great accomodations and surrondings. Quiet, beautiful nature setting"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Far enough away from town to relax and unwind but also not far for things to do in Shelby!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very comfortable, nice place to stay. I would have liked to stay longer! There is lots of space for three couples or other family members, although there were only two of us this weekend.
We were not able to enjoy the firepit or trails because the weather was not cooperative. I can imagine coming back in late Spring, early summer would be DELIGHTFUL!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool place
2023-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was great and Donna was a very attentive host. The only issue we had were problems with internet access and while Donna did her best, it was a problem for us."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great quiet getaway. We wanted to camp this weekend but the weather didn‚Äôt agree. We found this gem and it was the perfect balance of rustic and peaceful for us. Cabin like interior, mountain like exterior. We loved it. The pet ducks were our daughters favorite!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was as expected! Great communication from Donna on check-in and check-out. She was also flexible on the check-in and out time which was helpful for holiday travels. We will keep this place in mind for future trips home to visit friends and family!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great, cozy cabin with cute pond and ducks. Beautiful location, private, and spacious. Would definitely stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Met my main criteria: clean and comfortable. Location is remote but worked for our purpose. If Wi-Fi is a must for your stay, would not recommend this because due to the rural location it is virtually impossible to get on line and TV is limited. Otherwise, nice surroundings, quiet and peaceful, helpful host, clean and comfy."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin with pond and ducks. Arrived on a cold rainy night, covered porch and parking next to porch made for quick unloading of our luggage. Plenty of heat options with central, baseboard, gas logs, and a wood stove. The ducks like attention and my wife, who loves animals, was sure to give them some. Very quiet at night and with all lights off it is pitch black dark, which I loved! Great little place to disconnect for a few days!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A charming little converted barn situated on a pond with resident ducks. The loft is split into two bedrooms and furnished with very comfortable foam mattresses and pillows. The kitchen was a spacious way in kitchen overlooking the coveted porch and pond. The backyard had a nice fire pit, picnic table and horseshoes.
The wifi was spotty, but unnecessary for a wilderness retreat. There isn‚Äôt strong enough signal to stream tv, but the living room tv had a nice antenna making tv channels plentiful.
The bathroom had a washer and dryer, small standup shower and the hot water was plentiful.
The owner was very responsive and helpful throughout."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,She is great at communicating and understanding. Would highly recommend to anyone.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The property is beautiful and obviously well-loved. We were so comfortable. The WiFi is next to non-existent though. We would stay again!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just what we needed. Quite and a country feel. Loved the pond and ducks. Would
Definitely stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are a family of four with 2 small furbabies that Donna's cabin accomodated. We loved the porch, the pond and how much in the woods we were. It was a lovely house with no issues with checking in or out. We spent time by the fire and used firewood that was available to us and also made dinner on the grill that was provided. The cabin was perfect for us and made us feel like we were truly in the mountains. Donna also was extremely responsive to any questions we had. Great host!!
We will be back for sure when we are up this way!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is the cutest cabin! Donna was so nice to get us in quickly and efficiently as we were evacuating from hurricane Ian and was there for anything we needed. The area is fantastic so many hiking spots and great views. The ducks in the pond are the cutest! Very quiet and peaceful.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as promised and more. It was an excellent and relaxing stay. Would recommend to anyone.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a delightful experience to stay in Donna's cabin/home in the tranquil setting of Cleveland County. It was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the outdoors. The ducks were so much fun to feed and watch from the cabin deck, and the walking trails offered relaxation. Most importantly, it's dog friendly! Donna is truly a ""super host"" as she made sure our visit was perfect."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful view
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I were looking for a space to disconnect from technology and enjoy some nature, and this place was just what we were looking for! The cabin is cozy and comfortable, surrounded by green with a lovely nature trail right off the back porch. We didn't use the fire pit or grill, but those are great additions to the space for those who will - though just check the fire pit for froggies, we saw a couple hopping around in there a few times we walked by.
The inside of the cabin was clean, organized, and the chicken/duck decor suits the space perfectly. Being able to watch the ducks swim around in the pond both from the living room and the front porch was a great feature, and getting to feed them was a fun experience - just watch your fingers, they can be a little nippy! The beds were comfy, the kitchen was well-equipped, and the whole stay was just amazing. Both TVs have HDMI ports for those who want to use a laptop or game console for entertainment, just know the internet in this part of Shelby is spotty. I was able to get a decent signal with my AT&T hotspot so that is an option if you need it.
Overall, we had a lovely stay here and would happily return for another. Donna was a great host and communication was top-tier, any questions I had were answered quickly and clearly. Check-in and check-out was a breeze! If you're looking for a quiet place to reset from modern life while still being close to town (15-20 mins) for food and such, this is the place for you."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Donna's Country Cabin is a delight! Tucked amid trees overlooking a pond it just begs you to relax on the porch, or inside in the cathedral ceilinged living room.
The property is a ways out of town and may be a little hard to find. Trust Donna's directions and kick back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place and very relaxing stay !! Wonderful location for GWU families who are visiting
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a beautiful cabin to stay in!!!!! Very very peaceful and comfortable. The pond was so nice and the ducks were so cute !!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first airbnb experience. I rented this place for my husband father's day getaway. It was perfect and he was so excited about it. The ducks are hilarious,, the property is perfectly tucked away. It was very relaxing to sit on the porch and listen to the fountain in the pond. The bed was fantastic. I laid in the bed very early on our last night, just to enjoy the comfort of it a bit longer. Im pretty positive we will return again."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and cozy little cabin in a serene setting. The bathroom is downstairs from upstairs bedrooms which can be an issue if you are a frequent night time visitor but we really really enjoyed our stay here.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna‚Äôs cabin was such a great getaway! We came for work and wish we could have stayed longer! The cabin is on a beautiful property with a pond that‚Äôs home to some ducks and geese. We were able to enjoy a fire at the fire pit at night to unwind. Donna was so helpful and stayed in touch in case we needed anything. The house had everything (towels, etc), and the beds were incredibly comfortable to sleep on. Looking forward to staying again very soon!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is truly a gem! It was very enjoyable for the short time we stayed. We would definitely stay here again!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful property, clean and Donna was very nice. Definitely will stay again. Only thing is the bedrooms are basically connected and it‚Äôs all out in the open. So if you‚Äôre two different couples and not just a family I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôd like it."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"a quiet, relaxed place to spend a few days disconnected from the city"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"my son, my husband, and myself stayed at this place for the weekend just to get away and enjoy a nice relaxing weekend.

Do yourself a favor and check it out!!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an excellent stay at the quiet creekside getaway. absolute wonderful host and comfortable place to relax and rejuvenate. definitely would recommend. We plan on using Jody as our goto host when we stay in Shelby N.C.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jody and Ruth were communicative, friendly, and helpful. They left lights on so I could find my way easily when I arrived after dark. They checked in the next morning to make sure everything was okay, and were always available, but not in any way intrusive. The neighborhood is quiet, the bed is comfortable, and the location was great for the appointments I had there over the weekend.
Also got to spend some time chatting with Jody and Ruth, and they are kind, fun, and gracious folks.
Highly recommend staying here if you're in the area!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Jody's place was amazing! I wish 6 stars rating is an option. Both Jody and Ruth were hospitable. The entire place was clean and well supplied. Jody's place is definitely our new home away from home. Thank you so much for having us.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jody made us feel right at home. Very cozy and perfect for a weekend stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this place and the host, It was perfect! They are very thoughtful in way. We lacked for nothing. My son loved the swing so much. We felt very comfy and cozy there. Will definitely stay here again in the future!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was amazing! The place was nice and clean, coffee and soaps were provided. There was a full kitchen and fridge with many cooking utensils and cook wear. We do not have children yet, but there are children‚Äôs eating utensils and I think even some bottle sterilizers. There was a full washer and dryer with some laundry soap and dryer sheets provided; this made our extended stay very convenient! Definitely will return again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I loved Abbie's place!! It definitely felt like home and I'd definitely stay again. No complaints here and you won't be disappointed if you stay. üòâ
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The space was great! My husband said to earmark it for every time we come to NC to visit our son and his family. I loved how deep the bathtub was, I was able to easily soak my newly healed broken shoulder in Epsom salt bath, and was able to finally get the bruise I got when I broke it on Christmas Day to dissolve and disappear. My husband rates places on the power of the shower, I rate on the bath. Lol. It was great!"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very responsive.
My recent stay at this Airbnb was a charming experience. The location was ideal for us to commute to our event.
However, there were a few aspects that could be improved upon to enhance the overall guest experience. One notable issue was the lack of a dishwasher and dish drainer, coupled with limited counter space in the kitchen. This made washing dishes after meals a bit cumbersome and less convenient than desired. Full size blankets and/or comforters would be a nice addition as well.
Despite this minor inconvenience, the host was attentive and accommodating. In conclusion, while there is room for a little improvement, this place is cozy and quiet."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Would stay again next time im in the area, easy to get to, easy to communicate with Abbie"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host was very accommodating and responsive. She made sure to communicate all necessary information and the check-in/out process was extremely easy with thorough instructions. The home is very cute and quaint. It's very close enough to Kings Mountain you could walk (if in the summer). Excellent area and safe! The home was newly remodeled and decorated. It is a two bedroom one bath. The main bedroom has a tv and large open closet for hanging clothes. The bathroom has a nice deep tub. Overall a great stay. Much appreciated, Abbie!!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ken's place is well-maintained, clean, comfortable, and neat, making me feel like I'm at home. I got more than I expected at his place. So please, pretty please, since he's already tried to make his place as clean and comfortable as he can, respect that! Whoever you are, if you're staying at his place, help him keep it clean too. Oh! And leave a good review too. #smile"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Some occasional noise from other areas but not much. There is a large school across the road with some noise coming from there but could not hear it from inside.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive and overall great stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a couple! We absolutely loved Ken‚Äôs place. We were in town for a Gardner-Webb baseball game. Super cute and super clean.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little getaway for a couple! Really close to activities in the area!

Charming, cozy, clean, good vintage decor. Small and private."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ken was proactive in opening communication so I knew exactly what to expect. He stayed available during my stay if needed. But after check in, I did not see nor hear him or his family. Questions at check in, that I had, were treated as important and he took time to introduce me to the Amazon fire stick this unit uses. My stay was so much more comfortable than a hotel! I highly recommend!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was super clean. Ken was very responsive. The bed was very comfortable.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,By far the best studio airbnb for the price! Will totally stay again if I‚Äôm in town!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I felt right at home, it's the first bed, which I didn't want to get up from, really very comfortable, the reception in the room is very good, there's coffee, tea, water and oatmeal in the room for me personally it's better than a hotel room, the room was very clean and the place is very nicely located, shops, restaurants are very close.
Mr. Ken, you were very kind in your communication with me."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect location for attending a wedding at the nearby Veronet Vineyards. The hosts communicate very well and are really friendly and helpful. They are up-front about any noise or traffic in the area, and we found it rather quiet after 9 pm. One tip for future travelers - lots of restaurants in the area were cash only, so come prepared or plan to stop at an ATM."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ken was very helpful with all his messages and instructions. The space looks identical to the pictures! There was absolutely no deception of size. The bed was comfy and I had everything I needed for a comfy and safe place to stay while in town doing some house hunting!

The space is cozy, and well set up. For a small space, you don‚Äôt feel cramped or hemmed in. It‚Äôs just right.
The area is peaceful, easy to find and you can‚Äôt beat the price. So much better than staying in a hotel."

The hosts truly go above and beyond to create the perfect stay!!! Thank you, Ken and Zsuzsi üôè"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can honestly say, good people are hard to come across, and I can proudly say that Zsuzsi and Ken are amazing hosts! Always attentive and responsive on every move. Super flexible with check-in/out. Overall this Airbnb is a must I‚Äôm when traveling for work/military! 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è all the way!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a quiet, clean, beautifully decorated place, this is the right choice. Ken made the stay easy, stress free and ensured we were good to go on a daily!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,The hosts were very friendly and often checked to see if I needed anything. I'd recommend these hosts to anyone near or far.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,I had to change my reservation to a day earlier in order to check in at 2am. Ken was understanding and allowed me to check in at this unusual time. The place was very clean and very suitable for a short stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome host, the place was super clean, secure and comfortable. I was in the area for job training at Duke facility, so it was exactly what I needed. A warm shower, a comfortable place to sleep and study. I would definitely recommend and would visit again in a heartbeat."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were honored to be the very first guests at this quiet little suite in Kings Mountain. For us, a couple of retired hospital workers, it checked all the boxes‚Ä¶kind and helpful hosts, lots of brochures with information about things to do in the area, a really comfortable bed with a big fluffy comforter and plenty of pillows, a shower with lots of hot water and great water pressure, and the softest towels. In the little kitchenette we appreciated and enjoyed the complimentary coffee bar and a few snacks. We took advantage of the Walmart grocery store just up the street to prepare simple meals on site. As for sightseeing, we loved the Pinnacle Trail at Crowders Mountain State Park, and the Battlefield Trail at Kings Mountain National Military Park. We ran out of time before we could explore the other parks and trails in the area, but they are plentiful. The suite is a great value, too. Two nights for less than a night in a hotel. Couples traveling in the area, don‚Äôt miss it."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Great stay
2023-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,"Mae' Place Two was a very njce, cozy, historic property. It has the charm and authenticity of an old/ historic North Carolina home. It is well maintained but in its original form. Marilyn was fantastic as a host and very communicative. I would certainly visit again and recommend the property (other guests should simply know that it is a traditonal well kept home but does not have some of the newer amenities that a newer property my have. Nevertheless, the overall charm of the home and the surrounding historic district, combined with Marilyn's superb hosting, will make me a return customer."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place near historic Shelby.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marilyn is an excellent host who provided everything we needed to feel relaxed and ‚Äúat home‚Äù in Shelby. The location was quiet and peaceful, yet close to town center restaurants and events. We would definitely stay at here again!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This is a nice place to stay. Close to downtown. It‚Äôs an old house that‚Äôs been renovated. Most outlets are just 2 prong (just fyi if you have a laptop or device that needs 3 prong).
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay within walking distance to farmers market and restaurants in uptown. We loved our time here. Thoughtful touches for the kids and was a pleasant stay.

It‚Äôs older and has creaky floors, which was awesome! It‚Äôs close to downtown very good restaurants. If I come with a group again, this will be the first place I look for. Thank you Marilyn!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is THE place to stay in Shelby!! She is well organized and has a smooth check in and check out policy. She has lots of extras. Clear instructions. Cute decor and great location. So happy.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The upper level of this house was very roomy and comfortable. The location was very convenient: walking distance to the square and close to some of the events planned for the wedding weekend. Although it‚Äôs not a full kitchen, it was large and had just about every appliance you would ever need. The porch was a nice place to hang out and talk. Access to the laundry room was very helpful.
Unfortunately, the first morning we woke up to bed bugs in one of the rooms. I hate to mention it here, but I wish I had been warned ahead of time, so I feel it needs to be said. It seems to have been limited to just one room. The host was very responsive to the issue. I would love to give this place a perfect review, but the added stress put a bit of a damper on our important weekend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This rental is very accommodating, comfortable and clean. The location is great for walking to downtown Shelby. We were very pleased and hope to be repeat guests."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,It was a great place for my group friends to stay before the wedding. The size was great for what we needed it for. Plenty of card games and other games to play within the house to enjoy the night.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with a surprising amount of space. Things are well stocked and the location was perfect for us. We will certainly stay here again. Ideal for a group that needs separate rooms.
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"we stayed at Marilyn's place this past Labor Day weekend for my daughter's wedding nearby, Uptown Indigo. This apartment was so very close and convenient and we very much enjoyed our stay! Being so close to the restaurants brewery and shops was fantastic but really, the place was awesome. we had a group of 5 and had plentyvof room, although we spent most of our time at the out. but the attention to detail, decor and all of the bonus touches were very nice and the screened in porch was lovely at the end of a long wedding day.

2022-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Such a neat property. Old house with cool charm and a few quirks :) The hosts were very thoughtful toward our small kids, and it made us feel safe and welcome. (Baby gate, kid books, bumbo seat, toys, etc) A good place to unplug and pick one of their books off the shelf. Close to downtown. Snacks and drinks upon arrival. Personal touches that beat a hotel :) Although not all the bedroom doors shut completely smoothly (old house, no biggie) we were able to put the pack n play in the game room so baby could have his own space. Would recommend!"

Large, spacious bedrooms, living room, and screened-in porch."

Although the house was very old and I know you can‚Äôt expect it to be perfect being soo old- we had cold water in one of the bathrooms when taking a shower and had standing water in the other bathtub while trying to take a shower in the other bathroom. Overall very cute, spacious and clean."

There were toiletries and linens so all the little things you may have forgotten were right there. We would definitely stay here again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I stayed at Mae's Place Too for 4 months and can say it's a great place for short term as well as longer term stays. I am a very light sleeper and my bed was very comfortable and it was peaceful and quiet late at night as I slept. All the necessities functioned properly. I worked in Shelby for 30 years many years ago and it's a nice place to live. I had close friends from all economic backgrounds, I played lots of golf, and ate at some fine restaurants which still exist today. There were lots of things to do in Shelby and I have seen great progress over the years. People who visit can find a pleasant stay. I try to walk at least 2 miles every day and enjoyed my 2 mile walk down the sidewalks. I found a combination of hot sun (which I like) and cool shade from the giant oak trees. I like to read the ratings before I sign up for anything and after staying 4 months I found all the favorable things people wrote about Mae's Place Too to be correct in my opinion. Marilyn and Gary were great hosts for my stay."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place. Walkable distance to everything in down town. The screened in porch was a great place to sit and relax.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family was displaced temporarily from our home due to repairs. We have a two year old, a five year old and a 15 year old. This space was perfect for our family to reside for a few weeks and it was much more private than a hotel. The host was very responsive, and they added some special activities for the kids. The game room was great and we played the games there."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,the best place in town to stay.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Robert and Laurel have the best mountain retreat! The cottage is as every bit as cozy as it appears in the pictures. It is not advertised as a hikers paradise but it is! I spent the week hiking Kings and Crowder's mountains and this was such a a great spot to begin and end my days in.

It smelled of fresh linens and looks exactly like the photos. Very cozy. He provided everything we needed for the kitchen so that was a huge plus for us. Each bedroom had its own theme which made it feel more homey. Also, I liked that they offered different pillows of soft, firm, and cooling gels. Being from the country, I loved it had a nice seating area outside on the back deck. I enjoyed how peaceful it was to drink my coffee and watch the cardinals from there. There is a grocery store about 4 miles from the home. Our commute was to Gastonia and was only about a 30 to 40 minute drive. We would definitely recommend Robert's home. Robert is an excellent host. Very responsive and friendly. We had a storm come through and he checked on us and told us where to find a lantern if needed. 5 star stay!! Thank you again!!"

I am a country girl at heart & I love love love the country and the scenery which is what attracted me to this lovely home. This home is EVERYTHING! It is secluded, quiet, & finding this location was not hard at all! And if you‚Äôre from the country you know the country is prone to having ‚Äú country bugs ‚Äù listen to me, I didn‚Äôt see ONE BUG! Not a fly or anything & I loved that as well! My family and I drove in from Texas & upon entering this home we felt as if we never left Texas. We had everything we needed and even things we didn‚Äôt realize we needed! Robert even checked in on us personally & I loved that because it is very seldom that I actually meet the host in person. 5 stars just isn‚Äôt enough for this stay! This home needs 10! You will not be disappointed!! If you need a place to get away and reflect, this is the place for you!"

2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The grounds surrounding the house are peaceful & beautiful. The owners (next door) were helpful, kind & welcoming but not intrusive. Nice touch to find bottled waters in the fridge & an assortment of muffins. The house seems to be an older modular type but is spacious and feels like staying at Grandma's house. It was frigid during our Dec. stay and the house was very drafty. Individual plug-in space heaters were provided for each room. Adequate linens were provided for our length of stay. Kitchen stocked with basic amenities. Great master shower. Pool table/foosball/air hockey/trampoline were fun for the kids, but wifi cut out every few minutes which made watching tv difficult (A booster would probably remedy that.) Disappointed the gas grill was unusable and the stove/oven was malfunctioning. The lake out back was tranquil and pretty with a full moon. Firepit looked inviting but sadly we didn't get around to using it."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,My family had a very relaxing time and enjoyed the scenery and nature

The ducks are very friendly and we also saw Canadian geese with their 7 goslings.
Overall we really liked the house and would stay there again!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna's place was awesome!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Donna has a beautiful place to get out into the country. It is pretty secluded and private. I loved the ducks and how homey it was. My only concern was managing not using too much WiFi data because it wasn‚Äôt mentioned that there wasn‚Äôt unlimited WiFi. Donna was very responsive to message and clarified things greatly.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's place was more than expected! Beautiful decor and design. If you are looking for a bit of peace and quiet (with an occasional quack or two from the local ducks/geese), this is the place for you! The perfect location for an overdue Girl's Weekend. We found ourselves in the den area between the two bedrooms the most. The provided throws enhanced the coziness of the space. We explored the downtowns of nearby Forest City and Shelby. A few of our favorite shops in Forest City were Gifts & Talents, Dovetails & Rusty Nails, Harrill & Harrill Design Company, Enchanted Boutique and Nex Door Used Books. Best Italian food was downtown at Babbo Italian Kitchen! Shelby did not disappoint either, you will not want to miss the Antique Market of Shelby (formerly a JCPenney!) or the Vintage Market Antique Store. All these locations are within a 15 minute drive. Oh, and don't forget to feed the ducks! Just a handful of duckfeed will get you in their good graces!"

The location was great‚Äîbeing very near the college our daughter is attending and yet still in the country where we could relax in peace and quiet. Our kids loved being able to interact with and feed the ducks. We love playing games as a family and really enjoyed playing the ‚ÄúCarcassonne‚Äù game in the house‚Äîso much so that we immediately got on Amazon and ordered it to have at our home. LOL! Donna was very responsive when we had a small issue and resolved it quickly. We will definitely look to return in the future whenever we are in the area. Thanks, Donna!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had such a wonderful stay! The property was exactly as described and we felt right at home. We were looking for a quiet area, away from the city and this house delivered. The ducks were a bonus!
We will definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Everything was great about the house, but the only thing about the house that we did not like was that all the entryways into different parts of the house had an uneven entryway. Anywhere between 1 inch to like 3 inches. My grandmother had to always pay attention to where she was walking."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great time!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Iloved Donna's place. It was serene! I loved the island in the kitchen. My girls enjoyed the ducks and feeding them.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"this was our first Airbnb, I was so glad that we chose Donna's place, it was the perfect place to spend time with our grandchildren whom we haven't seen in a while. they love to play with the Ducks and running through the yard near the pond, the kitchen was perfect for making meals. we will return"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved our stay here! The pond is stocked so we had a wonderful time fishing everyday and it was so peaceful. There are ducks that welcome you and greet you every time you go outside. Thank you so much for letting us stay for the week. It was just what we needed.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna‚Äôs house was the perfect place for a peaceful getaway. We enjoyed the restored farmhouse vibe, the tranquil pond, and the friendly ducks. It was also just 15 min. from Gardner-Webb, which was our purpose for the trip. It gave our family the opportunity to relax and connect while we moved our daughter into college, and it provided a peaceful place for our boys to fish and enjoy nature. I‚Äôm sure that we‚Äôll be back again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna‚Äôs place is beautiful. She is very easy to communicate with. My only complaint about this place is that the beds are very very soft. Two people in the bed and it‚Äôs a lot like sleeping in a hammock.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"A beautiful house and yard full of old majestic trees. The inside is beautifully decorated with spacious rooms and exquisite kitchen area. Fast, reliable Internet.
The pond and outdoor sitting areas made it feel like I had my own private park.
The resident ducks were a hoot, or more appropriately a quack. They would greet me and follow me around.
Very quiet neighborhood with little traffic."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home, gorgeous property. The chatty, cheerful ducks waddled up to the fence most of the time I came out to talk to them, much to my delight. I enjoyed the two living spaces - one at the front of the house and the other between the bedrooms. My iPhone and other Apple devices connected to the wifi only for a couple of hours on the first evening inside the house. I was able to download messages and access the web by the carport, however. My friend was able to access the wifi most of the time on her Android phone. Highly recommend this spot!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is everything it says...and more. The area really felt special. It was good for the soul and to recharge a little. Donna was very helpful with our stay and it was greatly appreciated. The home was just like the pictures. Clean, well organized, well layed out with plenty of space. This is definitely a property I will be returning to, the next time I am in Shelby. Thank you Donna, for a great experience."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Donna's place was awesome!! We loved her place. She kept in constant communication with us until our arrival and was available for any questions we had during our stay. We definitely will be back in the future.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've worked in the travel industry for over 20yrs, and I'm so glad I went with Donna's place instead of a hotel. Her home was as beautiful as the pictures and we fell in love with the kitchen. All of the family gathered around the kitchen island, and we chatted and laughed until the wee hours of the morning. We had a great time and would recommend 100% - do yourself a favor and stay here!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family rented the house because of its close location to Gardner-Webb University. We came for my college graduation! This home was so very cozy! We loved it! It was beautiful and homey! The outside was just as beautiful and peaceful. My oldest two boys loved fishing and exploring the area! The ducks were a hit as well!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Looking for a comfortable home to relax and enjoy nature? This is it. Forget the hustle of day-to-day life and find your calm. The home had everything we needed, beds were comfortable, kitchen spacious and equipped and nature put on a show for us. Saw more animals than people and could have stayed a month. Home was comfortable for four adults and the front porch was our favorite spot. A few of our favorite things : Pond, ducks, geese, fireflies in the evening, groundhog family, heron, sunsets, cool breezes, chorus of frogs, picking blackberries along the road."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was far beyond expectations. The pictures literally don't do it justice!! You pull into the property, and it is as if the weight of the world rolls off your shoulders. I had not expected this in Shelby, but Donna has truly created something magical!! Highly recommend. We WILL be back!!!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has to be one of the most peaceful and relaxing stays I have ever had on a trip. Donna was such an amazing host, and the house is such a gem. We enjoyed listening to the bullfrogs at night and laughing at the ducks during the day. The kitchen is so spacious and the bed was so comfortable!! We will be back. Thank you, Donna, for being so amazing!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna‚Äôs place was beautiful and clean! All necessities were present and the house was very comfortable!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was just as beautiful as the pictures! My children loved feeding the ducks and they loved how the ducks followed them around the yard. As others have stated, as well as Donna, there is no cable, satellite, or streaming on the TV (only one of the 3 TV's has an antenna). This is definitely a breath of fresh air for you to come, relax, and unplug from the world! We are people who live in and enjoy staying in the country, so a place in the country and an amazing outdoor space was a MUST! This place is amazing inside and out! We loved this home and look forward to staying again on the future!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely loved our stay in Shelby. This place is an Airbnb rare find gem! Highly recommended if you have any travel needs with visiting Gardner Webb.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoy the house, it was nice and clean. I highly recommend it if you in the Shelby area."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Donna's place looks even better than the pictures! We had such a wonderful time. This place is truly a place where you can unplug. There's a serene pond with friendly ducks and the area is just beautiful. It was too cold for us to use the fire-pit but we would've if it hadn't been so dang cold. The south Mountain State Park is near by with lots of hiking trails. Shelby had everything we needed for grocery stores and restaurants. The only thing that is poor about this place is the internet which is not Donna's fault. You will not be able to work from home here. There's no streaming available. There is a TV with an antenna. We watched PBS mostly. Once the internet gets upgraded in Cleveland County this place will have absolutely everything. But if the internet doesn't concern you then this place is the very best! My friend had brought her hotspot and that worked pretty well for light things like checking email and facebook.
The beds were super comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed. The screened in porch is amazing. This place is the perfect getaway to unplug and relax. The showers were hot with excellent pressure. There were plenty of towels. We bought extra TP and Paper towels but some is provided for you. Donna as super fast with her responses. Thanks again Donna!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Liked the extras in the fridge and pantry. Thermostat was easy to use and adjust for comfort. Full kitchen is perfect for relaxing dinners. Screened in porch was bug free and peaceful. Fire pit offers plenty of firewood (Firestarters available too). Carport is big and shelters you while loading and unloading. Washer dryer was convenient to have. Wifi in this rural setting was ok - occasionally cut out.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The covered dbl car port was a bonus due to the rainfall while packing to leave‚Ä¶ although we wanted to stay forever.
This place is a gem! The pond and the silly ducks were entertaining wether watching from the screened porch, small fenced in area, or just out in the yard. A private place with little traffic and the chance to unwind is almost the best quality.
Close to Shelby and Forest City (within 30 minutes).
Felt safe, and again, we didn‚Äôt want to leave! Communication was great with the host. If you enjoy cooking, it‚Äôs a dream kitchen. The aesthetics and quality of the decor is ever present. Cannot wait to go back !"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Donna was fantastic! The home was beautiful and exactly what our family needed! I can‚Äôt wait to visit again.

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is one of the best I have stayed in, it was absolutely beautiful. The outside area was very inviting with the little patio and grilling area along with a fire pit and pond. I am sure I will circle back to this one again. Loved it!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful farmhouse that has been beautifully and tastefully modernized. Relaxing setting with a nice pond, fire ring and outdoor areas. The bed is very comfortable although the sheets are ill-fitting on the thick mattress. A few cleanliness issues, but overall a great property which we enjoyed very much. Host was very responsive. Would stay here again."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were able to spend almost a week here for Christmas and we loved it! The place was very clean and Donna was great with communication. It‚Äôs a very beautiful house and landscape. The pond and the ducks are the best part, especially if you have kids. Our 3 year old fed the ducks once a day as long as they were out there. We plan to stay again in the future"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An absolute beautiful home and the host is wonderful as well! The home was very clean and just provided a warm welcoming feeling...just the perfect family get a way for us! We will definitely be back!

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is wonderful! Donna was an excellent host!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was just what I needed for a weekend getaway for peace and relaxation. Donna was a wonderful host. If I'm ever looking to stay in the area again, I'll definitely keep this place in mind!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful place. We stayed there for Thanksgiving and thoroughly enjoyed it!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property and home with so much charm! The home is stocked very well with everything you need. Great communication from Donna, the host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and host was super helpful. Definitely recommend.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful stay at a beautiful home. The setting was beautiful and peaceful! Donna was excellent with all communication needs. Definitely would stay again!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully restored cottage with a calming fountain in the pond. Multiple outdoor areas to hang out (screened in porch, bbq area and fire pit.) You can feed the ducks and walk the property. Donna has all your basics provided and is a very gracious host!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house it self is absolutely beautiful. Very peaceful. The view is out of this world. I will be visiting again soon‚ù§
2021-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Cleanliness left A TON to be desired. We chose this place because of the commitment to cleanliness on the post. The owner was the last one at the house, so she left it how we found it. There was a blanket or duvet in the dryer that smelled like wet dog. There was dog fur all in the bedding, sheets, under the sheets and on the mattress protector in the master bedroom. The other bedroom had long black hair all in the sheets, there was a scrunchie with long hair hanging out if it on the headboard. We wound up going to purchase our own sheets to sleep on. (Every grocery store, Walmart, or place to eat is at least 30 minutes away). Popcorn fell out of the ottoman when it was moved, there was a used cotton ball under the master bath vanity. There was trash in the kitchen trash can at arrival. And I surely wasn‚Äôt unloading a dishwasher I didn‚Äôt load. To top it off there is NO water pressure in the entire house. Needless to say this was a truly disappointing experience."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a place to unwind and feel like you are home away from home you MUST stay here.
Donna communicated very efficiently with me before arrival, during the stay to answer any questions and at the end of the stay for check-out expectations.
I loved the kitchen, lounger chairs on the porch for reading, the friendly ducks and just having the opportunity to walk around on 3 acres.
The gas grill was a plus as I cooked one of my dinners on it.
Her place is about 30 minutes away from South Mountain State Park, shopping, and restaurants.
I will definitely come back when I‚Äôm in NC."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful and location is serene and peaceful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope so visit again soon!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Exceeded my every expectation. Felt at home from begining to end. Highly reccomend this property.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This farm house is a wonderful place to stay. It is clean, comfortable, beautifully decorated and is supplied with all the essentials and then some. Sincerely hope I can get back in the future."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of our very best Airbnb experiences in this peaceful farmhouse. It is updated beautifully and Donna has provided so many extras, especially in the kitchen. We had coffee every morning watching the ducks which was so relaxing. Only 20 min to GWU, where we enjoyed a volleyball and football game. Also enjoyed a gorgeous waterfall hike at the nearby state park. We had several questions about the area and what was at the house and Donna responded immediately and was so helpful. We will be back to this gem!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My two coworkers stayed here again and will always enjoy staying here while working out of town.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay.!! The view of the pond and the friendly ducks were just perfect.!! Looking for some peace and quiet with a wonderful Host‚Ä¶this is the place.!!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was absolutely stunning. If you like a craftsman style home, you will love this place. The kitchen has a definite WOW factor, and is very well equipped. We loved the screened porch and the back yard grill area was great. The view is beautiful, and the pond is so nice, especially when the water feature comes on. There is plenty of wildlife to watch, and the place is secluded and peaceful. It was just a short drive into the town of Shelby, which was quaint, clean and fun to hang out in. The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms have everything you need and are beautifully done. Donna was so nice and pleasant to communicate with. She was very quick to respond to any questions. I would definitely stay here again"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Magical!!! I was greeted by a family of ducks every morning. Leaves fell from the trees like sparkles. Truly fairytale environment.
Super clean & comfortable. Donna was impeccable with communication, so friendly helpful and I honestly never waited more than 5 minutes for a response.
We will definitely be back:)"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first experience using the Air BnB service. I don't imagine it will ever get any better. Donna is a joy to work with and the place blew us away. We loved everything about it: the d√©cor, the atmosphere, the grounds. We will definitely be back. Thank you for making such a great place available, Donna."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Donna‚Äôs place. Exceeded our expectations. Our 4 Year Old loved playing with the ducks ! Very thoughtful touches throughout - right from providing mints at living room, well stocked and trendy kitchen, Netflix,Amazon prime, duck feed at duck house, TV at Screened porch, beautiful and scenic dining area in backyard with Grill, woods and neat seating at fire pit! Oh , and the bridge with night lights! Everything was just nothing but delightful.. This place had everything we needed. Can‚Äôt ask for more! Thank you for opening up your property to us. We will be definitely back!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My coworkers stayed in Donna's home while working out of town and loved how tranquil the home was. It was the perfect spot to relax after a long hard day working in the heat.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Property is beautiful with friendly ducks. Beautiful home interior. The picture on the site just doesn‚Äôt do it justice.
2021-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous kitchen. Spacious. Beautiful view. Peaceful and fun stay.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We didn‚Äôt want to leave! This has to be one of the most charming and peaceful Airbnb rentals in which we have ever stayed. It is an older home, built by craftsmen and constructed of materials that can‚Äôt be matched in modern homes, and has been thoughtfully updated and well maintained. It is situated on an amazing piece of property, featuring a spring-fed pond and many beautiful shade trees. The kitchen was a wonderful feature: it was large, stocked with pots, pans, dishes, cooking tools, and cutlery. We were able to prepare quite a few meals there after stocking up at the nearby Ingle‚Äôs grocery store (about 10 minutes away). We had our morning coffee and breakfast on the screened-in porch each day while gazing at the pond and enjoying the resident duck family. Having been on the road for several days before we arrived, the ability to use the washer and dryer to get caught up on laundry before checking out was helpful. If we didn‚Äôt have prior commitments to meet up with relatives, we would have had no reason to leave the property, as we so enjoyed the peace and tranquility that surrounded us there. We wish we would‚Äôve booked more nights, but we will have to be content knowing that we shall return in the near future, with a longer stay in mind."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a BEAUTIFUL property! So tranquil and spacious, both indoors and out. It was really nice to arrive to a home with some basic items already in the kitchen. From the beginning, Donna had excellent communication. Check was smooth and she answered the questions we had during our stay promptly. We even had a really bad thunderstorm and she took the extra step to make sure we were ok. These little things, little attention to details, are what makes a stay extraordinary! There is an area for a campfire outside that you can use and my kids just LOVED the ducks in the property. They were very friendly and so fun just to sit and watch. We already booked the house again to stay during the winter and we are so excited."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna was a Great Host and the Property is amazingly clean and peaceful . Definitely will be vacationing here again
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is everything you think it is and even more. Donna is very responsive and answered all our questions. She was very accommodating and gave us top notch hospitality! It's so beautiful here, clean, and the scenery is majestic! The ducks were so cute and my son loved feeding them. My family enjoyed fishing and it was nice to see my 6 year old unplug and enjoy nature. Everything was fully stocked from the outdoor grill to the gorgeous kitchen to the bedrooms and bathrooms. Don't miss out on this gem! We are already planning a future (much longer) stay. Thank you Donna!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to ‚Äúunplug‚Äù and relax. Host was very responsive and the house was beautiful. We drove to South Mountain State Park and hiked to the waterfall, but other than that we spent all of our time at the house enjoying the scenery. Planning your meals and taking all of your food with you will make the best of your trip there. We would definitely visit again!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home in a quiet location, perfect for a weekend trip to Shelby! We spent one day hiking in South Mountain, and a day tubing down the Broad River. We enjoyed drinking coffee outside with the ducks in the morning. The host is responsive and easy to communicate with."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This property is such a GEM! We enjoyed our time at Donna's house very much. Her communication from the very beginning was great. Check in was nice and simple. The house is cozy and was a perfect size for our family. Having 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a washer and dryer was awesome. We cooked all of our dinners in the kitchen. It was nicely stocked with pots, pans, dishes and everything you need to prepare meals. They also added a grill outside which we never got to use but is a great addition.
The property includes a pond full of fish. Literally every cast would result in catching a fish! There is also some nice hiking around the property including a beautiful babbling brook and beautiful trees.
We made campfire and s'mores each night and were lucky enough to see tons of fireflies!
As much as we love the house and surroundings, our favorite feature was super friendly ducks! They are so cute and would come to greet us every time they would see us.
If you want somewhere to relax, with beautiful surroundings and built in pet ducks, don't hesitate to book this house."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, quiet and relaxing. Perfect getaway from the city. Fishing, hiking trails, and fireflies! You‚Äôll make friends with the ducks, we gave them names! The house has so much character, and everything is very clean and updated. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"The owner is very helpful and friendly. The cabin is absolutely gorgeous and sits on a remote property with lots of charm and privacy. The kitchen is well stocked with pots and pans to help you cook, but grocery stores are a little bit of a trek. So try to plan your meals fully and make sure you buy it all at once to save yourself having to trek to the store.
Overall it's a wonderful property with great value for money. We will definitely consider returning!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful gem this place is. It was a stunning home! It was a wonderful place to unplug from the day to day grind. Beautiful surroundings with a great pond to fish, fire pit to relax by or even cook a meal over the open flame. We enjoyed being outside soaking up the peace and quite. I highly recommend checking this place out as your relaxed, will be relaxed. Oh also the host is incredible and made sure we had a remarkable stay."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing Airbnb find!! So peaceful and quiet! My boys had the best time catching and releasing many fish! There are plenty of restaurants and shops 18-20 minutes away, including ingles and Walmart. Donna was great at communication! We enjoyed hiking nearby at South Mountains State Park, which has 2 beautiful water falls. The house was spotless, and very comfy beds. We will be back!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This home is even more charming in person! I could not recommend this place enough!!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,As a traveling construction worker I have been using air bnb a lot more often recently. Mike‚Äôs place more than met my expectations. The Cove was peaceful and allowed us to get plenty of rest during our off times. Mike is a great host and was easily reached with any questions we had. I would certainly stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice views and a comfortable stay! Mike made us feel welcome.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed a great stay at the lake! We had fun playing on the water on the peddle boat, kayaks, and paddle boards and loved the community saltwater pool. Then we relaxed in the comfortable home and enjoyed a fire with the gas fire pit. Mike thought of everything and we really enjoyed being his guests! My only word of warning is to arrive before night fall off at all possible since finding the place in the dark is tricky."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property everything was so nice. Mike was a great host also there's plenty activities you can do with your family in the Lake Adventures Community!!!! Very impressed definitely will be back soon!!!!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay! The house had everything we needed, and it was so clean and well taken care of. Everyone loved the kayaks and paddle boards, and the peaceful lake is the perfect place to try these if you haven‚Äôt before. The community pool was a wonderful addition. Mike is super friendly and helpful. This is one of our top vacation rentals ever."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is peaceful and perfect spot to get away. The kids love the community pool. The location was 35 mins from Spartenburg and right there at Boiling Springs, NC. Being right off the lake was relaxing and the beds slept sooo good! That was a plus! Also the inside has obviously been redone and the master bathroom with the huge walk-in shower was beautiful üòç"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Courtney was very responsive and super easy to work with. The accomodations were as pictured and clean. Thank you sharing with us.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Courtney was very responsive. We stayed there with our young children for a wedding in town and were amazed at how cute/beautiful Shelby is when we walked into 'uptown' down the street. As described it is a historic building, but is very smartly furnished and has a lot of charm/character."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at the McSwain house. The house is clean and smells great! Towels and bed linens were new and clean. The house is very close to downtown Shelby and you can walk to great restaurants. Our host was responsive and checked on us several times to see if there was anything we needed.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Courtney was very responsive and the location is great.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Perfect accommodations!
2023-11-01,3,Group trip,"I booked this house for a wedding nearby based on the number of 5 star reviews, however I felt misled as this house is not a 5 star residence. The host asked me to give a 5 star rating or consider giving no rating as a lower rating hurts her business. The house is listed as historic, but in fact it is quite old with structural defects that cannot be approved upon such as floors that are uneven throughout the house. The stairs to the only bathroom are quite steep and have low ceilings that even shorter people could hit their head. The kitchen was antiquated with low end appliances and could use at least a 13 gal garbage can-we had to buy bags. Paper products were limited-2 rolls of toilet paper for 5 people for 3 days, no paper towels. The upstairs was always hot as the HVAC system does not adequately cool the upstairs or heat the downstairs. We kept thermostat on 70 but it was always much warmer upstairs. Generally the house met our needs and was clean with comfortable beds."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in the area for my friend‚Äôs wedding and are so glad we found this cute place! It was close to stores, the venue, and places to quickly get food while we were in the chaos of wedding setup! The beds are SO comfortable and the place was very clean! Courtney was extremely nice!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tremendous host. Very open and responsive to any questions and through on her answers and explanations.
Thank you so much!!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All of the items were in great order, and the host was very responsible.
Just know that the bathroom is upstairs and the stairs could be challenging for older guests. We are in our 50's and hike regularly. Overall, we enjoyed the character of the house along with the soft linens and bedding."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thank you for our short stay. We were minutes from downtown- but did not mind hanging out till we knew where to go get great food.
