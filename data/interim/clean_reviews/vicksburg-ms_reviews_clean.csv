2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,wonderful place. I mean it's amazing. I can see why everyone says it's awesome. you may think because it's on the main hub of the town but it's honestly private and secure. cozy.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a really cool spot! I’ve been to Vicksburg many times, but having such a great base in such a great spot made it memorable. The condo is clean and spacious and just all around really neat. The balcony was perfect at night as the sun set and the street lights turned on. Tyler’s place is walking distance from most of the museums and best restaurants in town. My boys, 9 & 11, had room to play and my wife really appreciated the big tub after a couple of days marching around the hilly streets and the military park. Tyler was very responsive and helpful. I am thankful for his suggestions about places to eat and things to do. Next time we’re in town there is no doubt where we’ll be staying!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tyler's place really exceeded our expectations! He provided very clear instructions via video on how to find and enter the condo. It is very centrally located to all the cute shops on Washington street and is still a very quiet place to stay. It has a cool, modern vibe and we appreciated that the lighting could be varied from regular lighting to red for nighttime. The beds were very comfortable in each of the ensuite bedrooms and we appreciated having a bathtub in one of the bathrooms for soaking. The washer and dryer worked great and it was so nice to have the use of them. Tyler was instantly responsive when we reached out to him with questions a couple of times. We expect to return to Vicksburg in the future and will hope to be able to stay at the condo again. It was fantastic all the way around!"

Tyler was very welcoming and communication was top notch. The loft was just as described. Beautifully decorated. Spacious and clean. Short distance from the highway. Walkable to great restaurants, shops and the river for a gorgeous sunset. Our favorite part was being able to sit out on the balcony and watch our two-year wave at the cars as they drive by.
This is the place that defines Airbnb!"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We enjoyed a comfortable, quiet extended-stay at Sky Cottage by the Park. In five minutes we could be walking or cycling in the Vicksburg National Military Park which encourages walkers, runners and cyclists. All area attractions were within a 10-20 minute drive. Evenings were peaceful and relaxing at the cottage. The kitchen and linen closet are stocked for settling in for a while. We appreciated the convenience of all kitchen appliances, washer/dryer, crock pot, electric frying pan, electric mixer, and more. The living room furniture is comfortable. The wifi is strong and reliable. (If you plan to work from Sky Cottage, bring along an ethernet cable for even stronger connection.) Host Mary Ann added touches that made for a comfortable stay. We recommend this cottage for a short or an extended stay. We hope to return next year."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Mary ann house was perfect for us. We traveled 14 hours. Had a bad experience in the past with another host / air bnb so I was nerves about Mary Ann house. But I must say it turned out great! Very clean, had everything you would need and was in a good neighborhood. All bonus in my eyes will definitely rent this house again."

Full kitchen, clean, great wifi, comfortable beds, and decor that made it a special place to hang out. The very best of AirBnB!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,good place great host
2021-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,Great host great place we'll stay again
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Perfect house for a group of 6. Great stay for Mother/Daughter weekend! The house was sparkling clean. Fully stocked with needed supplies! We loved the deco and the added touches!
2020-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,This is a great option if you are visiting Vicksburg but don’t want to stay in a hotel. The cozy home is nicely stocked and you can walk or bike easily into the military park. Mary Ann is an enthusiastic host and even set out books and toys for my children to play with.
2020-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We were three adults. Father and two grown adults (son & daughter). We chose this BNB to be close to the Battlefield park for bike riding. In that respect the location was great. The house is small and somewhat retro - which was to our liking. The beds were comfortable. We shared the one small bathroom without any inconvenience. The kitchen is small and not what you want if you are a real cook but it suited us just fine. Ice trays furnish the ice. The neighborhood is friendly and quiet. You can walk or in our case bike into the park at the end of the road. There is only one concern. There is a 6 inch or so step down from the living area into the larger bedroom. It presented some concern when navigating in the dark. I have suggested a night light or stair light. For our purposes and lifestyle (we eat out) it was great. The bottom line is that we would certainly stay there again and we recommend it.
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,This house is beautiful and very cozy. Very quiet neighborhood. My family and I are very comfortable here. We decided to stay few extra months now. Mary Ann is a super host responses very quickly. Thank you Mary Ann.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,the location was perfect. quiet area. reminded me of home. clear details and instructions from the host. the cottage was clean and very well kept. everything we needed for a comfortable stay was provided. I can't say enough good things about the stay. I would definitely recommend and will be staying again if ever in the area!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place! It was so clean and comfortable wish we could have stayed longer. Great location and wonderful space. Will stay again if in the area.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This property is absolutely beautiful and very safe. The owners were always quick to respond to any questions and were very hospitable. The home was immaculate. We didn't utilize the pool, but it was very inviting. We would definitely return."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place is exactly as the pictures show - it’s very rural and in beautiful settings. Lisa and Fred were helpful and friendly but didn’t intrude in any way. There’s plenty of everything you need in the kitchen and other guests have left sauces herbs etc so don’t buy too much and if you stop at Walmart on your way ( all in date I hasten to add ) it was particularly helpful washing powder was provided and we were able to do a load to help us with our laundry
Thank you for a memorable part of our trip"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The property is beautiful, private and peaceful. Our kids enjoyed being able to swim. All household + bathroom items were stocked and well thought through. Very comfortable. Felt like we were staying with family :)"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a comfortable and relaxing place to stay after a long day on the road! The home was comfortable and quiet, and the kitchen had everything we needed and more. It’s always nice when the kitchen isn’t completely empty cabinets, which we’ve experienced in the past. Instead, there were eggs in the fridge, coffee creamer, instant oatmeal, etc. We all had a great night’s rest and felt ready for our next day of driving. Thanks, Lisa and Fred!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. Fred and Lisa were great hosts. The place was nice and just what we needed for a quick stay over the weekend.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night and my only regret is that I wish we could have stayed longer! Maybe we will someday! It was comfortable, clean and cozy!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"an oasis in the green. with birds and squirrels to be seen from your terrace. It's wonderful to sit there in the morning with your coffee playing a game or watching something on the TV. The cottage is equipped with everything you might need and more. Also very nice that they have some basic needs ready for their guests. Fred was a nice host, who always responded quickly, explained the area and made sure we could swim wonderfully. The surroundings of the house are very beautiful and quiet. And yet you'll be in Vicksburg in no time. Recommended!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa and Fred’s place was great for our stop with our two pups. Although the yard is not fenced in, there was plenty of room in the yard to walk our dogs. We were only there one night so we did not explore that area before leaving. The home was very comfortable. Everyone slept well! We will stay again if we are in the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Quiet, secluded, peaceful and beautiful. They let us check in early, communicated frequently, and Fred met us at the door when we checked in. Had a delicious meal on the river front, not far away, and a good nights rest in their comfortable luxurious cabin. Very nice.
Thanks guys,

The guest house is so private, serene, and lovely. Comfortable and clean and quiet with big trees and a nice cozy porch. A very cute and friendly dog made this place perfect!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cottage in a very quiet and safe area with plenty of room inside and well equipped kitchen. Everything was clean. I liked the beautiful 3-mile trail around the area with lake and forest. I am glad I found such an exceptional accomodation near Vicksburg.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The location was wonderful! Beautiful drive to the cabin. We brought our 2 Aussies and they had a blast running around the property. The cabin was roomy and very clean! There was everything in the cabin you would ever need for a stay! Fred and Lisa were so friendly and easy to talk with! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our quarterly girls trip. Been going to Hot Springs for the last 8 years. I live in Louisiana and they live in Tennessee. We are old friends 30 and meet to catch up, laugh about old times. Honestly we've been known to sit at the kitchen table all day. But this time we had beautiful patio in the woods and wonderful weather. Lovely cocktails and a friend sweet dog, Jolene who welcomed us with warm eyes and an inquisitive look. The Wisteria was wonderful. it lightly scented air and added to the experience. The kitchen is well stocked as we do cook. The bedroom was comfortable plenty of towels and blankets. We never left during our stay. We have decided to put this hidden gem on repeat and return at least spring and fall."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful private setting. Was great to be able to let our dog run around. Very peaceful. The apartment was very clean and had everything you need.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The lakeside cottage was sweet and exactly as advertised. Though we only stayed the night, we did take in the beautiful and peaceful surroundings before nightfall.
It’s difficult to find good airbnbs that allow big dogs, this one did not disappoint."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Definitely one of my favorite stays and I can’t wait to return and take my son. I’ve been in communication with the hosts for over year and they’ve always been great, fast response, very thorough and kind. They have considered everything a guest could possibly need and made it available! All I needed was my clothes and fishing gear. A+++ accommodations, no complaints!"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great visit very well organized and clean

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay! Very responsive and kind! The home was very cute and had everything you would need! Quiet neighborhood and beautiful property! Wish we could have stayed longer. Lisa was very nice and even came outside when we arrived to help us park our trailer.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonder stay at Lisa & Fred’s place. It was very quiet and peaceful. Their place was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. We will stay again.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent in every way!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stop. Lisa and Fred were very responsive, the house was cute and clean, and our dog was able to make herself at home as well. We would book here again!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a very secluded and quiet place. If you want to get away and unwind like I did then stay here!! Very well stocked with all you need. Just bring clothes and food!! Highly recommend and I will for sure return!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place. Very comfortable and beautiful. Every consideration was made for this cottage. By far one of the best stays I've ever had.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We did a quick overnight on a road trip with our 2 pups and this was a perfect stay. It was comfortable, clean, had plenty of extra pillows and blankets, and a beautiful property on the small lake where we watched the sunrise. And great communication throughout. Thanks for the stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was perfect for our Christmas getaway. Clean, cozy, well stocked, and peaceful. Our host was friendly and responded quickly. We are very grateful to had such a great place to stay."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location in wooded area and close enough to cities for entertainment. The cottage itself gave a different impression online, on arrival we noticed the garage it was located in. Else inside all was clean and good!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay at the cottage. It was not far off the highway but just enough to be silent! It was so comfortable and relaxing and truly was like a home away from home - it had everything I needed/wanted including laundry and a yoga mat! Perfect recharge before getting back on the road.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wish we could have stayed longer. Great cottage, Lisa was so welcoming and our dog absolutely loved playing with Jolene. Hope we can come back."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What an adorable cottage in such beautiful, peaceful surroundings. I wish we could've stayed longer to spend time on the lake and just relax there. If there was anything you thought would be nice to have during your stay, they had already thought of it - anything/everything you need in a kitchen, things to do in and around the cottage without being connected to technology. Would love to stay here again but for longer than one night (we were driving through). Great hosts, great place."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lakeside Cottage is truly a hidden gem! We look forward to our stay each time, as well as our pups, who love playing with Jolene. Lisa and Fred are the most hospitable and friendly host and have made Lakeside Cottage the best thing to home."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lisa and Fred’s cottage was a perfect place for myself and my dog to stay on a recent road trip. I will be back!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After a long day of driving, this was the perfect resting spot. The wooded location of the property is beautiful and tranquil. Lisa and Fred are friendly and very responsive hosts. And the rental unit is immaculately clean, very attractive, comfortable, and supplied with everything one could possibly need. Our dog also appreciated his welcome! This was a winning experience for us in every way, and we most certainly will return if we are ever in Vicksburg."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely place and great host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My daughter, son-in-law and I really enjoyed our stay. We brought a dog with us who had fun running and playing with Lisa & Fred's dog. We travel a couple times a year from South Carolina to Texas and would love to stay at this location again. It is private and quiet and not far from Vicksburg and all it has to offer. We were very comfortable at the Airbnb and we enjoyed visiting with the hosts. I Highly recommend this location!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Definitely 5 stars! The place was great and I really appreciated being able to bring my dogs. They’re well behaved but it was nice seeing the concrete floors in the event of a needed cleanup (it was raining and muddy during our trip). The kitchen was well stocked and we were grateful for the coffee and treats that were made available to us. All interactions with the owners were very friendly and made us feel welcome and right at home. I would absolutely stay here again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great place to stay! My family and dogs felt right at home
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Fantastic stay! Very peaceful and quiet. Nicely appointed in comfy, lake motif. Very clean and everything is in perfect working order. Kitchen is extremely well stocked. Very responsive hosts. I highly recommend."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home had all the accommodations that anyone would want or need. The home and the property was beautiful. The leaves were changing it was absolutely beautiful and peaceful. The home was very clean, and the host was very accommodating. We enjoyed ourselves and will be back one day. We thank you Lisa and Fred for having a great place to get away to."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Can't say enough positive things about the stay. We needed a place to overnight on a long drive home with our fur babies and this place was perfect! Pristine all around and we were made to feel very much at home with snacks, coffee and other niceties. Highly recommend!
Scott and Laura"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"After multiple stays, this is our go-to halfway point place to stay in our travels to visit family. It is always clean and tidy, tucked away in a neighborhood. This time, we were towing a small trailer, and there was ample parking and a driveway that loops, so no crazy turn arounds. We feel safe in this location and appreciate all that is done to make this a home from home. They left some snack for kids on the counter that were great for the kids to have while I got dinner together, and as always, they love the board game selection they have for the kids to play. We definitely recommend this place!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay couldn’t ask for a better location & accommodation was great. Lisa & Fred’s property is a very peaceful quiet location also a nice safe neighborhood. Definitely would stay here again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice safe neighborhood, good communication from hosts! Will stop in again on my travels along Hwy 20."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our family's second stay here as our halfway point traveling and feels like a home away home. Very clean and cozy. We brought food to cook and had all the amenities to make dinner and enjoy a family meal. the shower has great water pressure! the linens are clean and the bed is very comfortable! the kids slept great on the sleeper sofa. there were also several games that the kids had fun playing. this has become a favorite stop, and we will be back in our travels!! A+++ rating!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. Perfect location for our trip.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was immaculate, very comfortable and fully stocked. Hosts were very nice and accommodating. The neighborhood is quiet and the area beautiful. Very relaxing stay. The only ""negative"" is that it is listed as a lakeside cottage. It is really an apartment built into the end of a large metal building, and it is not lakeside. The lake is within walking distance though, and is pretty. We did not use the pool but it attached to the host's home which is a brick home a stone's throw from the pictured porch. While we pictured something a bit more private, we still enjoyed our stay there and came away refreshed. I highly value comments when choosing a place and just wanted the next person to understand what to expect."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved Lisa and Fred's place. Went above our expectations. Definitely would stay agian.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and quiet. Lisa and Fred were very friendly nice area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lisa and Fred are gracious hosts. The unit was spacious and comfortable. Every switch was labeled. The kitchen was well stocked. They left guidebooks for the area on the table. The outside porch was very comfortable and private. Every interaction we had with them was friendly.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lisa and Fred have created the perfect home away from home! Their AirBNB has everything you could possibly need and more for a comfortable stay. The space is incredibly roomy, cozy, and super duper clean, and I wish I could recreate their shower at my house, because it was the best! The instructions for getting to and in their place were detailed and excellent, and it was very nice communicating with them. They have made their place an all around FANTASTIC place to stay!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable and spacious. We only stayed one night on the way from Arkansas to Florida so didn't really explore all they offer. Labels on the light switches is a great touch and providing two stands for suitcases very thoughtful.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay and it was a nice place to stop on our way to Alabama
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and pleasant environment. Host was very responsive however i didn't have any problems. Bed was very comfortable
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,Lisa and Fred’s place was beautiful and very comfortable. We had everything we needed. They were great hosts with very helpful and friendly communication. I enjoyed my walk down the road surrounded by trees. It was a short ride to the National Park (which we thought was 😎and impressive). If we find ourselves in Vicksburg again I hope to stay here again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Outstanding place in an outstanding location. The hosts were great and very responsive.
There are not any food or pizza delivery options so be prepared/ready to cook or to travel into Vicksburg.
Overall, this is a fabulous place to use for a business trip or a vacation."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lisa and Fred are super hosts for a reason! Our stay there was perfect and they went above and beyond to help us with any issues that we had. They gave us great recommendations for food and let our boys shoot a potato gun! Lol…we will definitely stay here again and recommend it for anyone else whether you’re staying for a few days or just passing through.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This Vicksburg Airbnb was a lovely place to stay, in a quiet wooded neighborhood away from the noise and busyness of nearby Vicksburg. It was a pleasant 20+ minute drive to town for restaurants, grocery stores and historic areas. We especially enjoyed revisiting the Vicksburg National Military Park, and also the Walnut Hill restaurant, both of which we have been to several times as we have passed through the area on driving trips.
Everything was very clean, convenient and well-supplied. The decorating was lovely, with all kinds of interesting touches. We didn’t have a chance to use the pool, but it looked lovely.
It’s a small detail, but we really appreciated having two luggage racks, so that neither of us had to have a suitcase on the floor. We wish all hosts would supply luggage racks, an easy and inexpensive convenience.
This Airbnb is a really good choice for a couple to stay at while visiting the historic Vicksburg area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lisa and Fred offer an exceptional and unique housing experience with their listing! It was extremely clean and organized, not to mention they are incredibly responsive and we felt right at home in their space. I can’t wait to book with them again and will definitely be recommending them to all my friends and family!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Peaceful spot just outside of Vicksburg.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a really beautiful and comfortable place to stay. I love the views in their back yard. Feels very safe and secure, too."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"loved the location felt very safe very homey super comfortable bed we had 5 adults (ages 22- 55) staying there and I would say it is probably well suited for 2 to sleep comfortably as there is only one bed if there are young people or adults who do not mind a sofa bed the one there is equipped with linens, etc. There is a twin blow up mattress in the bedroom closet that would be perfect for a child to sleep on. Overall, we were very satisfied as the location was lovely and our crew enjoyed the pool. The home felt like ""home"""
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice white place to stay. Very peaceful
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay. The pool was wonderful and so was the home. Our family had a great time. It was very clean and the beds were so comfy!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay here! Very nice, unique cottage in a beautiful neighborhood. Very quiet and peaceful. Hosts were very helpful and responsive! Would love to stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was the most well equipped Airbnb, she provided everything from shampoo to coffee, everything you need for a vacation. The cottage is so cute and porch was relaxing."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Even better than the pictures. I may have misread the description but the pool is behind their house not the cottage. Pictures are a bit misleading but like I said, maybe I misread where it said the pool was separate. You can still walk across to it and can swim until 9pm. Host was very friendly and the cottage was pristine. Comfortable and supplies with everything needed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cottage was a gem of a find!! We were passing through on our way home, and after hours of driving, this was like a home from home. Everything was clean and tidy. The kids and I went out to swim for a couple of hours and had a blast. There were plenty of swim floats, toys, and accessories to keep them busy. The shower and water pressure were great!! The bed was extra comfortable, and there were plenty of extra pillows and blankets for the kids who slept on the pull out couch comfortably. We loved all the games and played Monopoly before we went to bed. There were both Keureg and traditional filters with coffee grounds available with cream and sugar, which we gladly enjoyed before leaving in the morning. Wished we had more time to explore the trail and lake but hoping to visit again on our travels through in the future!! We definitely recommend, thank you Lisa and Fred for such a great stay!!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Don’ t be fooled by the rough exterior looking almost Like a garage - this is a Nice place for a couple of nights. The place is clean and has all stuff needed for cooking and a super Nice pool. The sofa bed, was uncomfortable to sleep on, though, and Maybe should only be used for smaller kids. We enjoyed The games and pop corn."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Everything thing was better than advertised. Lots of personal touches to make us feel at home. Would recommend it to anyone
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa and Fred's place has a mini-lakehouse feel, with everything you will need for a comfortable stay in their neck of the woods. The kitchen is especially nice and well-equipped. I enjoyed sitting in the little window-seat nook with a book and cup of tea. We appreciated that we could have our dog with us, and the floors inside are perfect for pets! The hosts are very friendly and interested in making sure you have a great experience! We hope to stay again on another trip through the Vicksburg area."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here, it's like a lovely cottage in the woods. I made a casserole the day before and froze it so we could just pop it in the oven while we were unpacking and have dinner. Full kitchen with everything you could think of! My kids enjoyed swimming in the pool and playing with Jolene their little dog and petting the cat. You can see the stars at night because it's out in the country and hear the sounds of bullfrogs and crickets as you fall asleep. Next time we will try to stay longer to explore the lake!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. Eveything was very relaxing, just whst we needed."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a nice place, full kitchen and well appointed. Will definitely use again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Peace and quiet only a short distance from the Vicksburg battlefield park and downtown! Easy to access, very clean, full size fridge and laundry. All around just what we needed!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay!! We enjoyed the pool after 5 hours drive, Lisa and Fred were very friendly , polite and helpful . We jogged around neighborhood in the morning safely, thank you. Everything was so clean"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lisa and Fred were fantastic hosts, we felt right at home. We had a great time in the pool and the wife and I did some birdwatching and had coffee under the covered porch. Wonderful place!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean, nice, and super comfy! The pool was great! Very nice hosts!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place! Quiet, peaceful, and beautiful surroundings. Worth every penny!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you are looking for a quiet, beautiful home to enjoy, this is the gem to stay! We wanted something secluded in a quiet place that was not too far from town and we found just that. I’m an avid airbnb booker and have stayed at many locations in many states and my Husband and I felt this has been one of the best experience thus far. We live busy lives and are always looking for those hidden gem areas with charm, historyand serenity.
This was our first experience bringing our pup and by far an amazing opportunity was created by not only the hosts but their pup too! He had the freedom to roam and play with their pup as well and it made the experience even easier as many pup owners know how limited and restrictive travel with animals can be. The serenity came in the form an immaculate cottage stay, pool access& also the many animal sounds heard throughout the wooded area.
Lisa was so friendly and helpful with everything! (Our first encounter with owners & they were so accommodating!)🩵"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great location to explore the Vicksburg area. The pool is much needed in the summer heat. The only issue we had was recent storms had knocked out the wifi, but back working 2 days after we arrived. Lisa was quick to find a fix if this problem should happen in the future. Highly recommend, and Lisa and Fred were great hosts."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed there 2 times so far and will for sure be back again. They were both very kind,helpful, very responsive any time I had a question. Their property is Beautiful 😍 and we loved the pool! It was the perfect spot to stop on our trip to and from Florida!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great host! Quick, friendly and thorough responses during my planning phase. A+"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lisa and Fred were amazingly accommodating especially considering they were out of power due to storms. They gave us the option to cancel or offered to run the cottage off of a generator. We showed up to a comfortably cool cabin and special touches like fresh muffins and fruit for breakfast. They made us feel like we were at home and the location was the perfect halfway point to stop on our way to Gulf Shores. I will definitely be back as their place is so much more comfortable than stopping at a hotel…and the location is beautiful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"They were great to work with, sorry we couldn’t stay longer."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lisa and Fred's cottage is absolutely wonderful. We didn't stay long as we were in the middle of moving our two pets cross country but the area was beautiful and very private. The cottage is extremely well appointed and the kitchen is enormous. Definitely recommend grabbing some groceries nearby and making use of the lovely kitchen. Thanks for the wonderful place to stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa and Fred are great hosts and were extremely responsive, friendly, and considerable. The cottage was clean, cozy, and peaceful, nearby woods and lake. My dog absolutely loved her stay and new friends she made. Highly recommended!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay! Only 15 minutes from downtown Vicksburg but it feels like you are in your little world.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great getaway for the wife and I. Easy drive to Vicksburg and enjoyed the peaceful secluded area. Would stay here again if we came back to Vicksburg.

Very clean"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great location close to the Interstate and Vicksburg. Cottage is private and fully equipped with everything you need. Everything is top notch in the cabin with a great patio for hanging out or a bbq. Large bathroom with a large shower. We were visiting Vicksburg National Military Park and this was a great place to stay in this area. Owners were responsive and place was immaculate. Awesome place and well worth the money.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The house was amazing! Fred and Lisa were very accommodating and friendly! It was peaceful and private feeling with a beautiful lake.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful area. Convenient for stopping off on a road trip. Lisa is very welcoming.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The best Airbnb ever! What accommodating hosts. Lisa and Fred communicated with us every step of the way according to our needs. They provided the most comfortable stay we've ever encountered. The amount of extra pillows, blankets, towels, & toiletries are one of the many things that makes us so grateful we didn't have to worry. They made sure the TV was connected/ready and that we had ample toilet paper when we got there, which are basic needs that surprising are rare to find in other Airbnbs. The kitchen was divine with everything we needed and more. We had a medical emergency which made us leave early, Lisa and Fred made the defining effort of wishing us healing and safety when we left, that made us feel like they are absolute angels. What a sanctuary!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed staying at this cute little place! Very friendly and great location!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Y’all have to stay here, it’s truly a gem! Everything was clean and hosts were so kind to prepare sofa bed since there was 4 of us staying and we were coming from far and it was super late. House feels super cozy, very thoughtful touches everywhere from toiletries to treats and coffee. We definitely will be back when we make the trip again! :)"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lisa and Fred's cottage was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood and was such an ideal stopping point for us (on our way from Texas to Florida). Stepping into the cottage we felt welcome and able to unwind and relax after a day full of driving. Our family of five fit perfectly for an overnight stay. The kiddos used the sofa bed and an air mattress in the living room. We appreciated the extra amenities provided -- the fully equipped kitchen along with welcome snacks, and plenty of extra towels, etc., and sheets, etc. Wish we had longer to stay -- I would have taken advantage of the exercise mat and weights and would have loved to bike around the lake described in the listing. Definitely recommend!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time staying at Lisa and Fred’s! Very comfortable and had everything I needed! Lisa was so nice and very responsive. The lake was beautiful and peaceful and it was a great place to stay for my time in Vicksburg! Would very much recommend a stay!!
2023-04-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"Upon arrival we immediately noticed the infestation of bee's and wasps. They actually live in the door frame of the entrance to the unit , as well as the rafters and siding of unit . The lake is quite the hike and we had to drag the provided kayaks on an obstacle course to get them to the lake, although we did inform them of our plans of kayaking before we arrived Very little effort was made to make our kayaking experience enjoyable.They did however,bring the kayaks to the unit in a travel cage . But were left in the cage for us to unload . The life jackets were not provided until the end of the day . After we were done kayaking . This was a trip for just my granddaughter and myself, so all the heavy lifting and dragging was quite a burden .The photos they posted were misleading, I was expecting a lake view from the unit .There was only trees no view of the lake unless you hiked to the lake.The lake was cut off by a road so it was more like a large pond UUM ..The weather was great"
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great cottage and very friendly hostess!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We Enjoyed our Stay there at Lisa and Fred’s Country Estate in the Little House By the Lake. They were Responsive and Generous ( This is really a well finished Home—it’a a Pa in-law place built for the previous owners father). It is very Professionally Crafted, attached to the shop but you would never know it once you are inside: it’s beautifully crafted, well, appointed and maintained, with a large furnished terrace, located in a Lovely Spacious Location Filled With Nature and near a small lake. Lots of Nature sights and Sounds to Sooth the Soul. Lisa is a Responsive Host and you have the Use of the pool. Her Dog and kitty are Very sweet and love attention if you want some Animal Love 💕🐾🐾❤️
All of our Needs Were Met there: a Full Kitchen that is well-equipped, Nice Bath (fully stocked, hair dryer), Laundry Facilities with detergent and no cling dryer sheets, a dishwasher (w/dishwashing liquid) . Lots of room to Park.
Everything was Very Pleasant. We traveled with two 🐶🐕🥰"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location, very peaceful, wonderful hosts, made our weekend trip exceptional."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"One of the best! After a very long drive from North Carolina with pets, my son and I stayed here en route to Texas. There could not have been a better balm from a rough day than this place. I only wish we'd been able to stay longer! The kitchen is huge and has everything you could need, the shower has two heads and tons of pressure, perfection after my day. Communication was great, and the place was perfect for my allergies to scents and bleaches. Decorations were just right, and there was something for everyone - even yoga mat and weights. The woods behind patio are so peaceful. I could not recommend a place more."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great people and nice quiet place would stay again !!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Another wonderful stay! Can't wait to go back!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place! & huge! Bed was super comfy and a huge kitchen :) definitely recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were only in town for 2 days and only needed somewhere to stay for 1 night and this was a perfect place for us. We primarily booked an airbnb rather than a hotel so that we didn’t need to eat out and this place had everything we needed.
Great hosts that communicated well and although we didn’t see them in person, we felt we could reach out to them for help if we needed it.
Having lived in the Vicksburg area before, my wife and I didn’t need any help with amenities or things to do, but again, I felt the hosts would have helped us if we’d needed help.
Highly recommend this location for a couple/small family vacationing in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was a beautiful retreat and the kitchen had all the amenities we needed. It was a wonderful stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay overnight on our way thru to to Texas on I20.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa and Fred's property was absolutely beautiful. Everything you need in a quiet sanctuary. The perfect place for a quick stop over or extended stay. Lisa and Fred are very welcoming and made us feel right at home. Their sweet dog, Jolene, was a super host for our 2 pups. Can't wait for our next stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We stopped here for a one-night stay on our road trip to Texas. It was right off the main highway and easy to find. I was very excited to see a yoga mat and weights in a basket. A good morning stretch was wonderful after a very long car ride! We would definitely stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family of 5 was passing through from South Carolina to Texas and Lisa’s place provided the perfect overnight stay. Location is beautiful and quiet.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Would definitely recommend! Wonderful little place.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay and sweet little cabin. Clean and stocked with EVERYTHING you could possible need, made us feel right at home. They even left little biscuits for our puppy! Easy access to lake for scenery and catch and release fishing. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,While we didn’t end up staying to sleep (because of our own change of plans) we did view the lovely property and found it very homey and clean! Normal country critters and sounds! The mattress was comfortable as well. Lisa was an attentive host who responded quickly and I can see why they have many other great reviews.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is great for those who want to be away from the noise of the city and embrace the sounds of nature. The area surrounding this place is so Beautiful! Though city life is close by you could never tell!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The place was perfect. Very spacious, decorated amazingly, everything we needed was there.
The weather was great so we staying on the nice patio watching TV most of our stay. Lisa came to say hi just before we left, very friendly.
We will stay again next time we make the same trip.
My husband was ready to bring his recliner and move in."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very lovely place - the scenery and house are very nice, we are very satisfied! We hope to stay there again someday!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay at Lisa and Fred’s cozy place. Would definitely recommend if you’re driving through the area and looking to get away from a hotel. Their place was most ideal especially with traveling with two young children and a dog. Very clean and has everything you need. If I’m ever driving back through we would certainly stay again.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Couldn’t have asked for a more perfect location! Traveling with dogs and the cement flooring in the AirBnB provided good grip but easy to clean. Big, well maintained yard and even access down to the lake.
The entire feel of the AirBnB was welcoming. Super comfy bed, very clean and even board games provided! Will definitely stay again if ever in the area. Also super close to the Vicksburg National Park which is well worth the $20 fee to drive through."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved the remote location and the fact that it backed up to woods and a lake. It was raining during our stay yet we were still able to grill out on the covered patio. The place had everything we needed. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again should I need to visit this area in the future.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Lakeside cottage surpassed my expectations! It’s a beautiful and comfortable space that is stocked with everything we needed for a perfect weekend! We bought groceries and cooked in the kitchen and it felt like home.
We didn’t get to meet the hosts, but they were proactive and responsive in all communication. The location is remote enough for quiet and privacy, but within 15-20 minutes of restaurants and museums. And there’s a Dollar General right down the road for when you realize you r forgotten to pack your toothbrush and favorite coffee creamer. 😄 We will absolutely stay again if we find ourselves back in Vicksburg!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Loved the privacy.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place! Very private, beautiful natural surroundings. Had everything we needed, would highly recommend. Very responsive and helpful hosts."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa and Fred were excellent hosts. I communicated my late arrival, and they offered to leave the lights on in the guesthouse to make it easier for me. A kind, welcoming gesture from kind, welcoming people. The property is pretty, with woods surrounding it and since it is a more remote location, which I liked. A great stay, thank you!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great place Lisa and Fred have! I was driving through and it was close to the highway, yet peaceful and secluded. The bnb is part of a shop and is very spacious and nice. The antique furniture and lake decor are cute, the amenities are spot on, and the lake view is so beautiful. They have a nice pool, but I didn’t get to check it out in the winter! Fred was very responsive and helped me find the drive when I was lost in the dark. They are so kind and this place is so welcoming!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful and quiet country location. Very comfortable. A bit far from restaurants but don’t let that bother you.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing stay great people
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was perfect for our family. The teenagers were able to have their own space in the bottom game room area. Three beds in that area were great for the cousins to spend time together. Our toddlers were able to have their own space in the upper rooms. Toys and a highchair were also available which was an added bonus!! The house was located just minutes from family members that also have a lake house. We look forward to staying in this home again. The hosts were excellent with response to any questions. Thanks for a great Memorial Day Weekend!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,everything was so beautiful & worth it when we stepped inside we fell inlove and just made ourselves at home so cozy and comfortable definitely a 1000000/10 :) will book again real soon !!! (:
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lynn and Paul were very good hosts. They responded quickly and very helpful. Check in and check out instructions were easy to follow. I only wish their was a tv in the living room, especially at night after the sun went down and you could no longer see the gorgeous view of the lake. We definitely enjoyed our stay, thank you."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our stay at this beautiful lake home! We enjoyed fishing at a near pier and caught a few different type of fish! We also got to see some beautiful sunsets and are excited for when the dock is fixed. We will be back!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"was a wonderful stay! has more space then we needed and was fully stocked! much more then previous stays I've had elsewhere. check out was smooth and simple.
one note - 40 minutes from everthing and anything. make sure to stop on your way in to get groceries, but the kitchen is equipped with everything you need to make a home cooked meal."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great!
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"Lynn, Paul and their adult kids were great hosts!!! They communicated well proactively and swiftly to my questions!! The house was just like the pictures, spacious, welcoming and accommodated our family, even our 4 legged little girl. It is on a beautiful lake in a rural area,a good distance from stores so come prepared with your food and other personal items. Lynne and Paul did leave a tray of snacks and bottled water to welcome us. Interacting with them was like communicating with old friends. I would definitely like to stay again if in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you to Lynn and Paul! They were great hosts! Eagle Lake was so beautiful, and the home was very comfortable. We hope to stay again in the future."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Swannie's At Eagle Lake was a great space and the view from the living room window looking at the lake was fantastic. There were lots of extras that made the stay easy to do with small children like a high chair, toddler bed, and packnplay. Lynn and Paul had nice touches like chips, coffee, coloring books/chalk, & toys in addition to the standard things like toiletries and cleaning supplies. The beds and furniture were comfortable! The place will really come together for fishing when the dock is repaired. We tried fishing off the small boat ramp, but the way the water was moving, there was brush that made it not ideal.
Lynn & Paul were great hosts. They were super responsive and even made inquiries on our behalf to help answer a few questions I had before the stay! If you’re looking for a peaceful place away from the rush of everyday, this is your place."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay at the lake! Very peaceful and safe place to stay for the fisherman. Very responsive to our messages. Thank you for allowing us to stay there for our fishing trip!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,must stay
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Let me put it this way..... If you think this might be the place you've been looking for, then let me tell you, it is. I used this location to plan my wife a secret 30th birthday party. I invited friends and family from nearby states to come visit, and the location could not have been more perfect for the event. From the exquisite kitchen and patio for cooking and grilling all weekend, to the massive downstairs room with the 70 inch TV that was perfect for gathering everyone to showcase a video I made of all her friends and family who couldn't make it wishing her a happy birthday, to spending time out on the lake. It was the top of my list as far as AirBnB experiences have gone, and I would love to come back again one day. It helped that Lynn and Paul were EXTREMELY responsive, helping with every question that I had, and even recommended a place to hae a custom cake ordered which turned out delicious. Everything about this trip was fantastic."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time . It was right on the water. Very relaxing . Basement was perfect for all the kids . They were very accommodating!! Will go back
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at the spacious and welcoming house. Well-equipped with everything we needed (and more), clean, and just incredibly comfortable.

Home away from Home I would say but better. Had the pleasure of meeting Jackie and her Husband very warm and kind such a pleasure to have met them and learn some of the history of their place. Without any hesitation we will use them again. *The Rocking Chairs outside on the Deck was a extra amenity that I so enjoyed."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"The host amber was amazing, i was on date and having a great time. So we decided to continue our evening after dinner we went to get cocktails and sing karaoke. I requested to book the air bnb amber had listed because the pictures look amazing and they did the room/apartment justice. Even though i booked late Friday amber responded immediately with professionalism and a friendly southern charm. Definitely owe a huge thank you to amber for making an Already good evening even better for my date & I.
I Was not aware Vicksburg had such a nice unique option downtown and the Name “Hidden Charms” is a great description of the experience."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"A perfect stay that's exactly where you want to be when in Vicksburg. I felt secluded, yet safe during my weekend stay. The available parking in back was super convenient for checking in/out. Communications from Amber throughout my stay were warm, welcoming, and helpful. I couldn't be any happier with my experience–thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay in Vicksburg. The unit worked well for us.

If you’re looking for a nice getaway to Vicksburg this is the place! Walking distance to lots of great restaurant’s. Already in the planning stages of our next trip back!!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amber’s loft is in a convenient downtown Vicksburg walkable location, just a few blocks from the 10 South Restaurant. The decor of the loft has a cool urban vibe. The hallway is lined with fabulous Delta Blues art. There is a balcony at the front of the building and a terrace at the back. However, the apartment has no windows, which was a surprise to me, as I have a touch of claustrophobia. Amber & Daryl were very responsive to my questions. There is a free parking space by the back door."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars. Great location in historic downtown Vicksburg. Easy walking distance to good restaurants, craft brewery, art galleries, Mississippi River, and more. If you are a cyclist, the Vicksburg Military Park is one of the best biking trails in the southeast. Historic, scenic, traffic-controlled and challenging - Vicksburg’s nickname is the “Hill City”."
2023-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice accommodations. There are no windows in the unit, but just a short walk to the back porch overlooking the river(s). You are also on the main strip downtown making the unit very convenient to restaurants and activity."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Enjoyed the stay, highly recommend to anyone coming through Vicksburg!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were travelling between Fort Worth and Augusta GA. Vicksburg was a great place to stop and we knew of several great restaurants on Washington St., but the stop was spur of the moment and was for only one night. Tough for an Airbnb booking, but amber stepped up. The room we wanted to book was not ready but she put us into a larger suite and on short notice got the room ready for us even though it was 9PM when we arrived! She went above and beyond. Her instructions were clear. The street that fronts the building is small and narrow but there is parking at the building, which was fully occupied so we parked on that small street with no trouble. There is a nice porch you can look out on the river and the shops and restaurants are right around the corner. The space itself has a comfortable bed. The kitchen seems well appointed. It all looked very new, so no coffee, salt pepper etc. I would check with Amber if you need something stocked. great space and host!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute plCe in a great area of town. There were several great restaurants and bars in walking distance. Host were super quick to help with any issues.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very clean (cleanest place we have ever stayed) and beautiful little place. If you love old looking buildings, you will love this place. The host supplied menus of all the restaurants in town. There is an axe throwing/bar establishment on the first floor and everyone there was very helpful. On Saturday, we were trying to find a place to watch a college game. The manager of the axe throwing/bar said they didn’t have the networks for the game but told us to comeback and she would have that game on that we were wanting to watch. When we came back at game time, she had it on. After the game we got to talking to one of the employees and he gave us a list of things available to do on Sunday. As tourist, it would have been nice to see the stores open on Sunday, but I appreciate the fact that they weren’t. It wasn’t a show stopper though. I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks Amber, we loved your place!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,Amber was very nice. She quickly offered to help out with anything I needed and answered any questions I had.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely keep this place in mind if we ever need to stay in Vicksburg again. It was so clean, cute, and conveniently nestled in downtown around everything there is to do and eat. Check in and out was also very easy! Love love love this place!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was cozy and well appointed, with lots of local dining and shopping nearby. We really enjoyed the new axe throwing place downstairs and the quiet atmosphere for our weekend!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great weekend! The place was perfect for a weekend getaway and in a great location!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, convenient and Cool! Right in the middle downtown! Walk to the restaurants and coffee shop."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the very nice, clean and eclectic space. Loved walking around the district."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location and gorgeous details. Amber was so quick to get back with me on any questions I had. She also had local event flyers and sent me details of local events in case I wanted to take part. Great stay!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was really cool and super convenient to all things Vicksburg has to offer! I loved that I could walk down the street for coffee or dinner. I was in town visiting family and working remotely so it was nice to have good WiFi, a comfortable bed, and place to relax after long days. The building was very quiet, parking was easy and I felt safe traveling solo (with my service animal). I travel a lot and really appreciate hosts who are great communicators and accommodating! Amber and Daryl were great."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was great. Amber replies quick. No complaints. I would recommend to anyone.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was tidy and was steps away from all the activities downtown.
2021-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,The spiral staircase in the front is dangerous. My wife almost feel from the top step. Nothing in the listing says you have to go up VERY narrow spiral stairs......not fun with a suitcase.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a awesome place to stay and the location is great because it's centrally located and the area was so scenic and historic with a lot of lil shops and restaurants to visit and ask within walking distance. Amber, her partner, the residents and staff were so nice and accommodating. One hiccup was the wifi but in their defense it worked fine when Mark came to fix it but as soon as he left I couldn't access it anymore. I decided to just let it go and use my phone's wifi. I also suggest you bring your own throw if you are like me and like to snuggle under a blanket while watching TV. Other than that everything was great. Oh and be prepared for stairs but without them you don't get the wonderful view. I totally recommend them and will not hesitate to use them again."
2021-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Amber let us stay very short notice as we werrle evading hurricane ida. The space was super clean and was in a super cool location!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The best location for a Vicksburg stay; it's central to all the fun making everything walkable. The room is a nice size with a great flow to it. I'd definitely stay again.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location Location Location! Right in the middle of everything. Barely had to drive anywhere. Such a cute loft and very clean. Felt safe and at home. Perfect place for 2! The back patio was an added bonus with a great River view. The spiral stairs are a trip, but adds to the “urban vibe”! Would definitely stay again and have already recommended to a couple friends."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The sweetest people and very proactive when we ended up there during a major storm. They even generously offered us a light breakfast after the power went out! The place is super comfortable and the hosts are beyond generous! Also, the view outback is so beautifully picturesque!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Super friendly host. Made us feel more than welcome. Offered blueberry picking right outside our front door, but unfortunately we did not take them up on the offer as we were only staying for a quick overnight rest.
The entire space was spotless with every amenity you could think of provided. Felt safe and ready for our next day of travels."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kyle was great host
enjoyed. cabin is fully stocked & clean recommend others to stay their"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay! The host and his family were so friendly!!! Will definitely stay here again if we ever come to Mississippi!! 😁
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"my only complaint is I wish it had more blankets or comforters, however I didn't ask for extra so it's fine. other then that the beds were comfortable, the shower water pressure was nice and strong. I really like this place and if coming back in the future would probably go back to this place."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a short but nice stay!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best Airbnb’s that we have stayed at. The cabin was so cute, clean and had everything you needed. The back porch was our favorite, we sat outside for hours listening to the birds and watching the swans and ducks in the pond.
In the evening the host family came out to feed the animals and the kids were so fun to watch run around in their muck boots and splashing in the pond.
Inside was absolutely spotless, the bed was so comfortable and we had the best nights rest after a long day of driving.
I can’t recommend this place enough. We will definitely be back for a relaxing stay!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is great! I would recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Fantastic, idyllic location. Quiet, located in the middle of nature. The theme of Africa at stay is perfectly implemented. And get fresh eggs from our own chickens. This made breakfast perfect.
Always happy to come back"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everyone writes it, we too - watching the ducks and swans is just relaxing. You're right at home with Kyle's Africa. The area is very quiet, yet Vicksburg and the surrounding area can be reached quickly."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great time! The cottage is clean, cute and warm… sitting on the back porch and looking at the swans, the ducks… peaceful, relaxing and absolutely beautiful.
Kyle has been great, I asked him a bunch of questions and he always replied quickly and with a smile! We’ll definitely be back!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in Kyle's guest house for one night on our way from New Orleans to Memphis. We had a great stay. Kyle is very friendly and hospitable. He was having a bbq and also cooked some hamburgers and sausages for us!
The Airbnb is clean, has a well equipped kitchen and a nice outside space.
we would definitely stay again and recommend the place to everyone!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a cool place! We loved the decor and the scenery is beautiful. Kyle gave excellent direction. We loved all the neat little touches. Check out The dish on the sink in the bathroom! We also loved all the information about the animals. My animal loving girl loved it. The crib is an awesome touch. Such a very cool place.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Country living at it’s best. Sitting on the porch in the morning drinking coffee and enjoying the swans. Home was stocked and comfortable. Beautiful area not far from state parks and walking trails. Would definitely stay here again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My kids begged to stay an extra night! We enjoyed the cabin, the shower pressure and heat was great after camping a few nights. The kitchen was perfect for a sit down meal, and the beds were comfortable. My family appreciated the theme and information on the animals. The family deemed it ‘the best night yet.’ If we are ever in the area again, we’d stay here!"

We felt right at home. if we are in need of accommodations in the area we would definitely re book here. Enjoyed coffee overlooking the pond while the rooster crowed. our grandson had a blast. Very close to many area attractions and dining choices. The host was friendly and very responsive.

The house was very clean and comfortable and went above and beyond on amenities (including toys/blankets and books for our littles). 10/10
recommend and would look to stay again if we are ever back in the area!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kyle’s place was wonderful! We stopped overnight on our trip from SC to Texas and I only wish we could’ve stayed longer! The beds were super comfortable and I slept like a baby! The water pressure was amazing in the shower and the kitchen was very well stocked. I wish I could’ve gotten a tour of the farm but we got in late and left out early. Kyle was very easy to communicate with and the price was perfect! Thank you, Kyle, for your wonderful place!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place to stay, small but perfect for 1-2 people. If I have to go back I’ll try to stay here again"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Kyle’s place was one of a kind! Very interesting and felt like I was in Africa:) so thoughtful of the decor and so well maintained and had all the eminities you need and more!! Haven’t had a chance to explore the backyard but will come back soon while driving back to Dallas. Thanks Kyle for this experience!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a fabulous lil place. In the quiet peaceful country but just a short distance to town. Very close to Port Gibson and Vicksburg. It really is a hidden lil gem. Front and back porch to sit and admire the beautiful outside!
It is clean, comfortable and
stocked with everything you can think of that you might need. A lot of thought and consideration went into furnishing, decorating and making this an exceptional place to stay for sure.
We will be booking again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will stay again
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I was just passing thru Vicksburg for a night while on a 1,000 mile weekend drive, and I was very pleased with my stay at Kyle's guesthouse! Location was ideal for me, someplace quiet and private, and someplace where I could rest easy before another day of driving. The property is located a short distance from Interstate IH-20, and the neighborhood is cute and safe. The guesthouse is comfortable and well maintained; really appreciated the effort that Kyle made to give the guesthouse an African Safari feel. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics and more (spices, condiments, coffee, tea, creamer, honey, etc.). Also enjoyed visiting with the chickens, bees and rabbits at the little farm out back. I can 100% recommend and hope to stay again soon!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved this place, from the unique African decor to the very comfortable and quiet accommodations. Kyle was a very responsive host and welcomed us warmly. We will be back if we are in the area and recommend it to others."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Kyle’s place. It is very spacious and comfortable in a beautiful and quiet location. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was great too. Would definitely recommend this place and look forward to coming back again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were very kindly welcomed at the place, Kyle and his family are very lovely. The environment is quiet and idyllic, on the large property you can relax and unwind. Actually, we wanted to take a look around the city, but decided to stay in the cabin and enjoy the peace. The cabin was clean and with everything you need. Guests are lovingly cared for. The pictures don't quite correspond to reality, it's much nicer than it's shown on AirBnB. We would come back anytime, also longer than for one night."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is not Kyle's fault, it is my fault for not looking at the pictures, but there were 5 huge animal heads in the apartment. Yikes.
Ok, but it was still worth it. The price was 50% of other airbnbs. And, this was the only one with 5 stars for cleanliness. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. It was beautiful and perfectly clean and private and super well-stocked. Kyle thought of everything. I don't cook but a great chef could have had everything they needed to make a great meal.
I never could turn on the TV but I was only there one night so that was ok. It was a super comfortable bed and bedding.
I recommend you walk around the property. There was a stunning pond with 3 swans! And, there were chickens and roosters and rabbits.
I recommend it highly. Kyle was very nice too and was flexibile with check-out! Thank you, Kyle."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place! Perfect for our family! Loved the decor and pictures. Had everything we needed. We will definitely stay here again when we pass through and recommend it to anyone we know who will visit the area! Thanks!!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kyle’s cottage location was INCREDIBLE! It was located next to the main house but extremely private. It was amazing to wake up surrounded by nature, huge trees, and hill with a pond. So quiet and peaceful. The family was super friendly, and were kind enough to show us the chickens and rabbits in the morning. The cottage had everything we needed, even a crib and toys for our baby! Fully equipped kitchen with extra beds, linen and towels. Kyle was kind enough to recommend a place to have breakfast. We will definitely stay here again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place just a short 15 minute drive off the Natchez Trace Parkway.
Kyle has put alot of thought into this place and as others have said previously it is a hidden gem.
Comfortable bed, hot shower and a stunning place.
Would stay again if I was ever in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"By far my most favorite place I've stayed yet! So much that I don't wanna share this hidden gem but it was so peaceful and cozy. We felt right at home and Kyle was very accommodating with anything we may have needed. Including additional cookware for something special we were making. Out of Africa had comfy beds, amazing hot water and was the best place to recharge your mind! If you love the quiet setting of the country and like to enjoy your coffee on a the porch... this is the place for you! Plus Kyle recommended an phenomenal restaurant in town to have dinner at. This is definitely my go to place from now on when I am in Vicksburg, MS."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay with Kyle and Amy! He went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed every single time we spoke to him!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great hideaway, every detail designed with care. Absolutely lovely"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice cabin in Vicksburg. If you need a place to disconect your head this is the right spot. Very quiet place! We went there just to spend the night on our way to Dallas and we enjoyed that quiet place. Cabin is super cozy and clean. Recomend this place to everybody passing by Vicksburg.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kyle’s place was GREAT, definitely recommend and will stay again if in the area!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where to begin? This was a medical emergency trip vs a pleasure trip, however, Kyle and Amy went ABOVE AND BEYOND to anticipate and meet every need possible. The property is peaceful, beautiful, and immaculate. My husband and I couldn't have felt more safe and appreciated as guests. We would highly recommend this property."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kyle was a great host & his house was lovely! i would definitely rec! When we asked for restaurant recs 4 a family member whose vegetarian, he even brought us a lovely salad from his garden...above & beyond helpful!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kyle’s place was AMAZING. Our only regret is that we only had time to stay one night. The theme was so fun and NEAT. We stared at the huge wall mounted animals several times and Kyle even took the time to share the story about them! Kyle was very hospitable and this place exceeded our expectations. There was a lot of thought given to detail and the beds were the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in with an AirB&B!!! We definitely will be staying here again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed it and will definitely return. Thank you Kyle for the hospitality.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Kyle and his family are exceptional hosts. They kindly showed us around their small farm and offered us fresh chicken eggs. He also took the time to arrange a special tour of the surrounding area for us. They left a very pleasant impression on us.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really liked that it was a more secluded area away from the vast typical neighborhood, and many beds were available, even though we were a small group. The Wi-Fi works great! The house has the old 50's feel by the older fixtures, heating, & cooling set up, but it all worked fine as everyone needed in their rooms--all needs were met."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home had a beautiful view of the Mississippi River.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great place to stay. We were on trikes with trailers behind us, and we unhooked them in the front yard, and they weren't bothered at all! Only problem we had, was the queen size bed. It was very uncomfortable. So we slept the next nite on the bunk bed. It was comfortable. But other than that we loved our stay there. We stayed 2 nites. When we go back to Vicksburg, we will stay there again!! Thank you James!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very responsive host!!! Clutter-free. Roomy. Cozy. Home has 4 window air conditioners that were able to keep the home cool in the Mississippi heat. Great place to stay if you need room while visiting Vicksburg.

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at James's house was exactly what we needed. Perfect location. James advised that the washer was not operating in the spin cycle , so he sent extra towels for our entire stay of 4 adults for 5 days. The only other cocern was that a battery in one of the smoke alarm kept churping, but I'm sure he has taken care of that it was our lastnight so he jad no time to addtess it while we were there.
James was so very helpful and accommadating with our early requests check-in.
Amazing host.
Will definitely stay there again."

The King bed was very comfortable and the privacy of the location is what we were looking for. Vicksburg is a great place to visit. We loved the City and we really liked our accommodations here.
Only thing missing was a can opener…. (Ha Ha)."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"It is an old place which is reflected in the price. The location was convenient right outside of Vicksburg. If you don't mind space heaters for heat (winter time) you will be happy with this place. There is no central heat or air. All in all, it was a clean place and it did work well for us."

Thank you to James for being a wonderful host. The information provided and his responsiveness to questions was the best!
We would definitely book again."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,The place was very clean and fit our needs perfectly. Was nice to have multiple rooms for separation at times. Location was not to far from anywhere in the Vicksburg area. Also nice view of the MS river. I would and will stay again if in the area. Great spot for the price.
2022-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"House is conveniently located across from the casino which has a restaurant. Only minutes from everything such as Walmart, downtown , and fast food. The AC units in each room were a plus , it kept the house comfortable and cool. Water pressure is a little low but remember this is an old home. The Roku tvs were a plus ! Everything was very clean and as described ! Wifi was fast and check in was easy! We would definitely stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,House was great the beds were comfortable and clean plenty of space for everyone and in a good location with good sunsets
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was as pictured on the website. The place was very clean and very close to many of the attractions in Vicksburg Mississippi. We had a big group of people but plenty of room the way that the house is set up. Great place and I recommend this place to anyone traveling with a big group to Vicksburg.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent place. Great accomodations. Though not fully accessible it is definitely doable depending on the situation.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely little house exactly as described. Check-in was easy. Home was clean. Gas stove that was great to cook on. Bed was comfortable. Felt just like being at my great aunts house with some modern conveniences. James was responsive and friendly. We have family in the area and will be staying again as we have big family gatherings and this gives us our own space to relax in the evenings. Perfect location as it’s convenient to so much. We are used to travel and keep a go container that holds all the necessary things. House was well stocked and we needed very little out of our go container.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Great communicator.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had an awesome stay! Loved having 4 bedrooms and the house is in a great location. Sunsets on the Mississippi were beautiful! James was an awesome host had a super fast response time every time I messaged. If we're ever in the area again, we'll be back!"

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,The house was very nice. It comfortable. Conveniently located. We hope it is available next year
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"House is clean and easy to find, and in close proximity to most attractions around Vicksburg. Check in was smooth, and we never had to text James for anything. He was always ahead of the game with the information needed.
The home is older, but well maintained. It has several window unit style air conditioners, which allows everyone to set the temp of their rooms to their comfort level.
We did have to go get our own toilet paper, paper towels, coffee filters and bath soap and shampoo. I don't know if that was an oversight on the housekeeping, but it wasn't a deal breaker.
Our family of four enjoyed a 5 night stay. The beds were comfortable, and linens in good shape. Our oldest son is a chef, and he prepared a nice meal one night in the kitchen, and he had everything he needed.
We highly recommend this property!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Absolutely amazing place! When I tell you the pictures don’t even amount up to how well kept this place was! The host was very responsive to our needs. Great view next to the river and very fast wifi! Can’t wait to come back through to stay with our team!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is amazing. Well equipped for a home from home stay. You do need a car to get around as downtown is a good 25 min walk. Don’t let this put you off as the location is very quiet. Highly recommended!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed the house. It was clean and everything we’d need was provided. Appreciated that there wasn’t a huge checkout cleaning process required, as with some other places we’ve stayed. Easy walkable access to a Dollar General for things we might need made for a nice location. You can basically see the river from the front of the house, which was also nice. Would stay there again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The bungalow was comfortable and private. The inside was spacious and clutter-free and had calming wall colors and decor which was great after a long drive.
Both bedrooms were clean and large in size with very comfortable mattresses. Lovely birds sang us awake each morning.
We would definitely stay again on our next trip to Vicksburg."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house. Very clean and had everything that you may need and more. They even had things that you may need for a baby. The back yard was very nice with lots of amenities too. The beds we comfortable. I would definitely stay again.

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel’s house is a great place to stay when visiting Vicksburg!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful house. You can tell the host put a lot of work and effort into making this a beautiful place. Lots of thoughtful touches and notes with directions. Even the closets were wall papered and decorated. The laundry room area is beautiful. Detergent pods are provided which is also nice when you’re traveling to be able to do laundry. The bed was comfy and had a really warm fluffy comforter. We had some issues with the hot water in the shower but the host was very responsive and helped give us some tips to fix it. The driveway is really long which was nice for us to be able to park our truck and boat. It’s a beautiful cozy home and if you love home decor, you will love the attention to detail in this house. We were just passing through so we only stayed a night, and didn’t get to enjoy the back yard but it has a beautiful seating area outside. You will feel right at home at this house."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place with nice charm. Our host did a great job and we can tell she really cares about her place. We were just passing through, but we'd love to stay again and spend more time."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,The home was quiet and cozy. Wish we could of explored more but the weather was pretty terrible. Would visit again if we were in the area.

glenda"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed the house, it was exactly as described. Free of clutter and very clean. The neighborhood was a bit sketchy but overall a great stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with the most comfortable bed (front bedroom). The house had an old style feel to it with some modern amenities and updates like the USB plugs in the Kitchen counter outlets - loved that! Hot water was a little ""finicky"" but I figured it out."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great looking house very well done. We had problems finding plugs that worked but finally found a few to charge our phones.
Also bathroom was so cute but the floor tile was all busted up and the vanity needs a good coat of dark Old English oil to restore it’s overall appearance. Kind of easy to replace busted tile to “vintage looking” water proof vinyl flooring. Not too expensive. We’ll be back again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay. The house was clean and cute and cost the same as a hotel but with plenty of room for us and our one year old. Rachel was very responsive and even messaged me about water going out in the area to check in and see if it affected us, despite being out of town herself. The water never went out and we had no issues. Will definitely stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Rachel’s spot was exactly what we needed! Great for a quick stop on our way to family. She was kind and very responsive/flexible with a delayed check out.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was exactly as described and couldn’t have been more perfect for our stay. It was only a few minutes from downtown and the location we spent most of our time in Vicksburg. It was very peaceful and was overall a great space. The only issue we had was regulating the tankless water heater but Rachel addressed the issue promptly and even went as far as to give a partial refund for the trouble. Would definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was great for our family’s stay in Vicksburg. It was nice to have the basic things to be comfortable on the trip. All the comforts of a home while out of town.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome home! Near town but very peaceful and quiet
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,It was just perfect! A beautiful house and a very nice garden! We felt very comfortable!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Th place was impeccably furnished, clean and comfortable. The hosts were responsive. The neighborhood was great, walking distance to the historic downtown."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"House was in a good location close to the Main Street and the casinos. Kitchen was a little light on utensils and cups, plates and bowls. The only real issue was the shower was very hard to get a consistent temperature. It would fluctuate from boiling hot to freezing and back without touching the knobs.
The TV is a smart TV but when trying to download YouTubeTV it asked for a pin to allow downloads and the owners didn’t know the pin so we were unable to watch TV other than Prime.
Overall, the house is nice and in a good location and was as described. Hosts were responsive."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, older neighborhood, close to historic downtown."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful older home, very comfortable and really nice outdoor area with an outdoor fireplace. We didn’t use the fireplace but appreciated that firewood was provided. Quiet neighborhood but close to downtown amenities."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy home conveniently located! Everything was super clean. Kitchen was well equipped. Laundry with generous supplies! Awesome patio out back, nice new concrete driveway."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Overall great experience. Lots of amenities and thoughtful touches.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This house was a good fit for our work trip to Vicksburg. It's is really well located to downtown and the historic parts of the city, restaurants and supermarkets. You will definitely need a car. If you want to prepare food, note that the kitchen is fairly basic and we had to ask for a few more items, but Rachel was kind enough to bring them over which was appreciated. Hopefully the kitchen can be restocked with a few more things to make a longer stay more comfortable. The house could do with a little bit of TLC which would really set it apart as it's a quiet and great location with a lot of space."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very beautiful home with great amenities. Felt right at home and comfortable. Will definitely book again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely Airbnb equipped with Everything you need !

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Was great location and close to everything. Beds were super comfortable and nice kitchen! Had a pretty strong odor, maybe cigarette smoke from the past? Other than that, super nice!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love this place great place for your money! I will stay here again if available when I visit Vicksburg again.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Rachel’s place was sweet and quaint, close to downtown. There were fun special touches like outdoor games and sitting areas.
There was a bit of a strange smell. I’m currently pregnant and have a hypersensitive nose so it might have just been me, but it felt strong.
Everything seemed clean and homey, though."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cute little bungalow appears to have been inspired by Magnolia/Joanna Gaines. Soothing colors and comfortable furniture. The beds were amazing and the linens were high quality. Appreciated the washer and dryer after being on the road for a week. Plenty of hot water and the shower had strong pressure. No networks on the TV (so football for Hubby was not accessible), but still had access of personal Netflix account. Spent the morning coffee and pre-dinner time on the front porch on the swing, which was delightful! Host was very responsive to an unexpected need, and deeply appreciate the flexibility. Would stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Hassle free checkin/out. Cute place. Love love love the outdoor area.

2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The place was beautiful and as expected. They provided a pack and play with linens needed. We were really satisfied overall. We had a minor problem the night of with the hot water, but they responded that morning, because it was very late when we discovered this issue, and came over very quickly to adjust it. Rachel was very easy to communicate with. Mosquitos were really bad in general so bring bug spray."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Well appointed, cute space. Comfy. Responsive and helpful host. Yard needs some attention."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place.

2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Clean, cute place - loved the vibe and having a place to sit outside in the evening while we did our laundry (!) was lovely. We love old houses, and so this is not to criticize, but lack out outlets and lots of long extension cords did make us a bit nervous. Overall, though, a great value and a great place."

2023-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I went to go to my niece’s graduation, and little did I know that the Airbnb was literally a block away from her place!
The area was nice and quiet and the backyard was just awesome for sitting at night!
The best part of the house for us was the old style tub! It made the house!!
Both bedrooms and bath we’re comfortable and lovely.
Setting up for WiFi was a breeze.
Thank you for everything and I would rent this place again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you Rachel for sharing your lovely home with us. We felt super comfortable and right at home! The beds are comfortable, lovely amenities in the bathroom and kitchen and the location is quiet and convenient to great restaurants (thank you for recommending Rusty's Seafood!) and shopping. Also close to the MS River and only 5 mins from the Americorps campus (super convenient for us since we were there to see our daughter graduate). Definitely a 10 out of 10 place to stay and if we ever get back to Mississippi we'll definitely be booking this lovely home!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Rachel’s place was nicely decorated and comfortable making our stay relaxing. Located in a quiet area south of the historic district of Vicksburg it offers plenty of space for 2-4 people. Given our short stay we were not able to enjoy the outdoor space in the back of the house.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect for my one night stay in Vicksburg, will stay again !!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice, quiet, comfortable stay at Rachel’s house. It was perfectly pictured and described and the bed was very comfortable! The house is located conveniently to everything and Vicksburg is a great historical city to visit!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel’s place is a great two bedroom home only a few minutes from everything in Vicksburg! It’s a little too far to walk into downtown on a hot summer’s day, but just off of Washington St. and fairly convenient. We appreciated the long driveway for parking, keyless entry, and comfortable bed.
If you’re like us, and like to actually use the kitchens at your Air BnB’s, this one was fairly well stocked with pots and pans, knives, and even an array of spices.
We enjoyed this little home away from home and greatly appreciated Rachel being willing to adjust our check-out time for a more casual last morning. Thanks, Rachel!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little gem. I adored the attention to interior design . Perfect location. Quiet neighborhood. Would stay there again if ever in Vicksburg. We liked it so much we extended our stay by 2 days.

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice stay. The home was so cute, decorated nicely. We had everything we needed. The bed we slept in was very comfortable. It was centrally located in a quiet neighborhood. One of the bedrooms needed blinds to darken the room and provide privacy, but we just needed one bedroom so we just went to the other bedroom. There are stairs up to the front and back door, so be aware of this if you are handicapped or have small children."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had a great stay for my one night at Rachel's. I traveled to Vicksburg for some not so great circumstances and her place was a bright, comfy, clean space to escape to. I really enjoyed the claw foot bath tub, my bed, the lounging area in the back and the vodka and ice in the freezer. I was hoping to stay for two nights, but knew one was a possibility and Rachel was flexible with my slow decision making process. I travel to Vicksburg once a year and hope to stay at Rachel's in the future."

2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Cute and cozy home, was good for our one night stay as we were passing through. One thing that would have made it better is blinds or room darkening curtains in the 2nd bedroom. The street light shines in the window at night with the sheer curtains."

2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location of Nicole's place can't be beat -- in a nice residential neighborhood not far from downtown and the levee, and not terribly far from the battlefield. I spent a very pleasant evening following a guided walking tour in the local visitors' guide -- that part of Vicksburg has some beautiful homes. The apartment is up a long flight of stairs above the carriage house, and it was very comfortable. There's a lot of work being done in the yard and adjacent house. I was sightseeing in the area and the apartment suited my purposes fine."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"After multiple days biking down the Natchez Trace we decided to take a detour for some Civil War history in Vicksburg, where my great great grandfather served. Looking for a quiet and comfortable stay we found Nicole's place. It was wonderful. She has done a great job creating a comfortable space with all amenities above her garage. Her ""locals"" guide was full of suggestions on local restaurants. We visited the 10 South Riverfront Bar and Restaurant for drinks and an appetizer with sweeping views of town and the rivers below. Next was dinner at Rusty's with an extensive menu and good homemade desserts. At both we tried the fried green tomatoes, and were excellent! Nicole was an absolute joy to interact with. Fantastic host."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nicole's place was very comfortable and roomy. It was also very well supplied -- kitchen supplies and toiletries, even down to cotton balls and bandaids.
The neighborhood is very attractive and walkable. It's also a short drive to downtown and the battlefield.
Nicole was an excellent host. I was happy to talk cars with her."

It was very clean and well taken care of. I loved the antique sink and doors/door handles. It is very quiet there. I would definitely recommend Nicole’s place.

Thank you Nicole for a wonderful stay and it met all of our expectations - 5 star from one Super Host to another! Come see us in Wichita, Ks someday at my “your private garden escape”!

It is situated in an old historic residential area, and it appears to be a very safe and secure. The host house is on the property and that too always is a plus when thinking about safety. Nicole has a very informative handbook she has prepared with instructions, local restaurant suggestions, and other locations of interest for an overnight guest. The apartment is very nicely decorated and clean. We especially enjoy the comfort of the couch and rocking chair in the television watching room."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a nice private apartment in a wonderful neighbor of historic homes. Very quiet and comfortable bed made for peaceful sleep. Off street parking was a plus for us.

It is a small place but is very well organized to include everything needed to make for a comfortable and enjoyable stay for two. The bathroom is spacious with plenty of hot water and towels. The area surrounding it is a bit run down but we felt safe. There are many historical sites within 10 miles. There are also several eateries available. We found Walnut Hills to have delicious catfish and fried chicken. They also have a variety of desserts available. The biscuit company of Vicksburg was very good as well. We would definitely stay here again.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nichol's place is conveniently located (walking distance to downtown) and comfortable with one exception: there were three fragrance ""air fresheners"" throughout the apartment which overwhelmed us with perfumy smell when we walked in. We had to remove them to outdoors but the smell remained. I had a terrible allergic reaction and suggested to Nichole she remove them. I hope she does. We met Nichole briefly and she was a lovely, helpful host."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The experience we had staying at Nicole’s place was exactly what one would expect from a Superhost! She greeted us upon arrival and helped us with the lockbox. The apartment was clean, which is important to me, and had comfortable bedding and other furnishings. It was super helpful to have the non-skid mat in the bathtub and Nicole’s personal guide to Vicksburg on the table. There is an outside staircase that goes up to the apartment door. That was no problem for me, but I mention it to help others for whom stairs are a challenge. Highly recommended!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nicole's space was inviting and thoughtfully curated. She had products available in case guests forgot any necessities like shampoo, toothbrushes, etc. She even had board games available. The washer/dryer would be great for those staying a few days.

5 Stars"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place amazed me. Every corner of the loft has a story, and the view from the roof deck is one of the best in the city. Aside from the beautiful accommodations, you are staying in H.C. Porter's loft above her studio! If that weren't enough, it is also the coolest block in Vicksburg with some of the best places in town--like 10 South, Highway 61 Cafe, Bohemia Cafe, and Key City Brewery--just a few steps away."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a jewel this little loft is tucked over the gallery, which has fantastic works, by HC. she and her assistant were very friendly and responsive.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What an experience! This loft was good for the soul and the mind. Visually stunning art and a gracious host. My husband and I felt right at home and discovered a love for Sinatra. Perfect romantic retreat in a lovely downtown area with tasty eateries and a picturesque skyline. Chris and Lydia were so personable and made us feel like family right away. We felt like we were visiting beloved family instead of a stranger’s home. We can’t wait to book again! Thank you!!

The kitchen was stocked with everything needed to cook a Christmas dinner. The apartment is on the 3rd level. But no worries! There is an elevator, so it was very easy to get our things up there! The views from the roof top patio were gorgeous!
The sunsets are a must see!!
So, if you are looking for that perfect place to stay while in Vicksburg, I highly suggest staying with Chris!
She defiantly made us feel like we were at home!!
The Blazier Family!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quite the downtown, you are right in the middle of it."
2022-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is perfectly located to enjoy the many interesting sights in the historic downtown area and Vicksburg National Military Park. Several very good restaurants within walking distance and wonderful shops to explore.
The loft and rooftop terrace are as described and offer all the perks and quirks of a +145 year-old building set amongst other historic structures. The rooftop terrace offers spectacular sunset views and occasional vessels travelling up and down the river. The art gallery below has many cool pieces, so be sure to spend time there too!
The host, Chris, and the gallery employees are amazingly friendly and helpful with touring and dining recommendations. It's like having your personal concierge.
Our only negative (and the reason we rated the property a 4) is there is construction underway on the floor above the loft. The host has taken many precautions to minimize any impact to guests - such as limiting work hours and keeping a clean job site (since you go through it to get to the rooftop terrace) - but sometimes there are inconveniences. We feel the construction project should have been disclosed at time of booking."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay

2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was above and beyond all expectations. From the foyer to the far back wall of windows, this loft was filled with beautiful touches of creativity and inspiration. The layout and ability to use the space in so many ways is also great. As a professional photographer, it was incredibly inspiring to spend a few days in the intimate space of Chris’s previous, personal loft. The artistic touches permeating every nook and cranny are not only a delight to explore, you can get lost in the sheer glory of her personal artwork and brilliance. What a treat for this loft to be shared with others. Food options within walking distance are awesome and overall amazing experience."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, relaxing space filled with eclectic art. The terrace is the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine and watch the sunset over the Mississippi. This was our second stay in the loft & we hope to return many more times in the future."

Porter gallery below and enjoy magnificent river sunsets from the well appointed rooftop patio. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to return. Chris is a terrific host. You will not be disappointed!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,H.C. welcomed us in her gallery and took time to show us around the loft as well as future plans for the building. We loved our weekend there and will be back soon to enjoy warmer weather on the rooftop patio! 5 ⭐️’s

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful experience. The loft is absolutely gorgeous and was the perfect place and location. Chris is such a gracious host and we appreciate everything.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space. Fabulous experience.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a gem! The space is huge, clean, and so tastefully furnished. The rooftop deck is amazing, especially in the evenings. We were able to watch two beautiful sunsets overlooking the Mississippi River. It had everything we needed, plus some. It was just such a cozy place to hang out, and it is conveniently located to explore Vicksburg’s lovely downtown. Chris was so easy to work with, and we loved getting to meet her and see her beautiful work downstairs in the gallery. One of our favorite Airbnb experiences yet!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The loft, in Vicksburg, offered by HC Porter was fun, - lots of art, sculpture, and collectibles - roomy, clean, comfortable, well- appointed, well-stocked and located right downtown. Local museums and eateries are in walking distance. If u you enjoy history, there’s a national park memorializing battles of the civil war. The hospitality was lovely. Highly recommend staying at the gallery loft."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely ‘artists loft’ above an art gallery in downtown Vicksburg. (Yeah, right? Who’da thunk it.) The space is so nice, comfortable, and extra roomy. Great for a private getaway. I hope to return soon."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft and a great location.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This place is fantastic! The loft is beautiful, filled with amazing books and art, and very comfortable. The kitchen is well-appointed for cooking. We loved using the rooftop deck - we had a great view of the 4th of July fireworks show. It's also wonderfully convenient to all the Washington Street bars and restaurants, and to the Strand Theater."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Airbnb location ever! My wife and I were very impressed and can't stop telling people about our stay here. It's such an interesting and relaxing place and convenient to shops and restaurants. We can't wait to return!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a cool loft! It’s as pictured, CLEAN, and perfectly convenient to downtown Vicksburg and the Washington Street commercial strip. The kitchen is very well stocked, the walk-in shower is large, the heat works great (it was 20’s & 30’s during our visit), and did I mention that the loft is clean? Clean feet after wood floors? Never...but in the loft, clean feet! Comfy bed and pillows. The rooftop is awesome too. My only criticism: the WiFi is slow. We could never get more than about 8mbps down, but we streamed Netflix A-Ok. Could’ve been tough if I’d needed to work.
We’d ABSOLUTELY return. The gallery manager downstairs was incredibly friendly, responsive, and gave some great recommendations.
We always felt safe, comfortable, and this may be the cleanest AirBNB I’ve ever stayed in!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If you're anywhere near Vicksburg, this is the place to stay! A wonderful space to relax and get away from it all. Chris has created a great atmosphere for creatives, business travelers or those looking to recharge. She's very attentive and wants her guests to have a wonderful experience. I highly recommend to those who are visiting the area long term. An added plus is the best restaurants Vicksburg has to offer are within walking distance to the Loft."

2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space!

Very clean. Centrally located.

2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Had to make reservation at spur of the moment for an emergency visit and hosts were most accommodating. I look forward to visiting again.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place to get out of town and still social distance. We brought food to cook. Kitchen is fully stocked with everything but food. So you don't have to bring your own pots, pans ect.. Everything in the studio was clean. We loved looking at all the artwork. There were some board games available, lots of books to read, tv and radio. Big Bonus was the private rooftop terrace. Could see a beautiful sunset on Yazoo River. Great location. Walking distance to shopping, some museums, and restaurants. I would highly recommend to anyone. There are so many good things to say and not one single negative. You won't be disappointed."
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location met our needs perfectly. It satisfies a small families needs to be together and visit, plus, its central location is a plus under normal conditions I’m certain. Our stay during the health crisis was very, very quiet. Probably not that quiet normally! Enjoy!"
2020-05-01,5,Group trip,"This Loft was amazing! The gallery is so cool! My friends and I stayed for one night, but regretted that we didnt we didn't stay for two. The area is so area is so quaint and cool! The locals were so friendly that it was almost odd!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, very centrally located. Rooftop access was awesome. Vicksburg was a pleasant surprise! Will be back."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My stay here was amazing. The kitchen had all the appliances we needed. I liked the rooftop although it rained our first night there, we enjoyed it the rest of our stay. I was glad that the owner allowed small gatherings for parties or events. It was easy to contact for questions. Although it's located downtown next to restaurants and bars, it was quiet and safe. So much better than a hotel."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We truly enjoyed our stay in the Artist Loft. It is stunningly beautiful and very clean. Thank you very much!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space for our family get-together!

2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a true find! Lovely artist loft in historic Vicksburg.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft Great views great location Will definitely stay here again
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our all to short stay at this fascinating artistic space. The king sized bed was comfortable and we woke up refreshed.
Next time we will plan ahead to catch the renowned rooftop sunset and recommended neighborhood restaurants.
We were able to stroll down the street this morning for excellent barista coffee at the Hwy 61 Coffee House and spent some time upstairs from there in the eclectic Attic Gallery.
We will be back !!"
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,Love it! We have had our Sisterhood Retreat here for the years!!
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I surprised my wife for an overnight getaway from the kids and work for just the two of us. She loved the loft. We sat for hours talking on the roof and watched the sunset over the Mississippi river. It was a Beautiful place. Thanks for sharing the loft with us.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place from which to explore Vicksburg while enjoying the quiet, spacious sanctuary of the loft and rooftop deck in the evening!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chris’s place was beautiful and super stylish! We enjoyed the area and loved hanging out on the rooftop. We would love to stay here again next time we are in town.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great stylish loft with a great view. Wonderful amenities. Would be perfect for early check in and hang. Go see the McRaven house.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at this loft for one night and enjoyed it so much! The bed was very comfortable and we were able to watch the sunset over the river from the rooftop. We spent almost the whole night on the roof just relaxing, listening to good music, playing the ukulele and enjoying each other’s company. The studio was right in the middle of everything. A very distance to many restaurants, coffee shops and shopping.
Many times Airbnb stays can feel pretty impersonal but H.C. Porter bleeds from the walls and is undeniable without feeling like we were intruding. It was so welcoming that we felt like we were visiting a really awesome family member. We left with a piece of artwork to take home as well to commemorate our anniversary and can’t wait to hang it up in our house.
We will definitely be coming back!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much Chris for sharing your home with us. It is an amazing place to stay- very clean, impeccably decorated & furnished, great location. We loved every aspect of our stay, Chris & Nikki were great with every need or question we had. We will definitely re-visit her place in future..."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful accommodations, would highly recommend for a nice get-a-way!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place...great location.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"A great place for a small group gathering. Our group of five adults very comfortably spent time together, played games, etc. and had plenty of room and amenities to stay overnight. And a big benefit is it's in walking distance to great restaurants and bars!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our start at this loft! We were greeted and shown around the building once we arrived and had every detail explained perfectly. The view from the roof is gorgeous and the space is decorated beautifully. The loft was very well stocked on anything we might need and was very clean! We look forward to booking here again!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend Chris’ loft- it was a perfect location, the loft itself was great- we got to enjoy our dinner and drinks sitting on the rooftop terrace and watching the sunset over the river. The hospitality was awesome. I’d definitely say if you choose to stay here, you won’t be disappointed."
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Pretty durn tootin'
2019-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Large open loft space, well decorated and furnished. Communication was great and check-in process was seamless. Highly recommended!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The space was great. Just like described. You enter through the hosts art gallery and it is so much fun to look at all of her art. You are in walking distance of restaurants and the waterfront and two museums. The outdoor patio is an extra bonus with great views over the river. Would recommend highly.
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and loft had all the needed amenities.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely adored our stay here. The space is amazing, and HC had gone over and above to provide everything we could possibly need. Needless to say the rooftop terrace is sublime. We drank a lovely bottle of wine as the sun went down over the Mississippi (make sure you arrive in time to do this!). Couldn't recommend it highly enough."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really enjoyed our 2 night stay. The loft is convenient, warm, & eclectic. Such a great place to relax & recharge after exploring the historic sites of Vicksburg. So much to enjoy about the decor, furnishings, & rooftop view of this place."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful loft in a great location! And the artwork was just amazing! Will definitely stay here again!
2019-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,Great location. Very spacious apartment.
2018-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a fabulous place! Beautiful, comfortable, and close (walking distance) to great dining options. I was initially a little concerned about the parking situation, but we never had a problem finding a space right out front. Drew (the gallery manager) was fantastic... helped us get checked in (an hour early, no less), showed us around, and even helped bring our luggage in! Chris was incredibly accommodating with our last minute change in travel plans and was quick to respond to our requests. Will definitely book again when we are back in Vicksburg."
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for thanksgiving, perfect spot to rest up and cook. Really unique space, thanks again for being so accommodating."
2018-11-01,5,Group trip,What an amazing loft! We loved it and the rooftop view was awesome! We will stay again when the need arises to be in Vicksburg!!! A great place to stay!
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just a wonderful Airbnb experience! Rich American History/Sites [and Golf☺], good People/Food, and a Kool place to stay! Everything you need to make a memory. It might be a small town, but it's dynamite. And the loft, well bring your imagination, and it will run wild here! Super place."
2018-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved the loft! It’s so much bigger than we thought it would be. The beds were super comfortable, and there’s lots of really cool art around. The place is very well stocked with all the amenities and there’s a lot of signs around explaining things. My only warning is to people who don’t get around well- the only way in and out is down a narrow, long staircase in the back of the gallery. Beautiful place, with lots of natural light!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,You will love this loft. The beds were really comfortable and the space is really neat and clean. AC is an artist and the space has a lot of art and other personal touches that make it comfortable and homey. The balcony is great also. I would definitely come back.
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful loft! Beautiful old building with history. All things you need.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely, spacious, well-appointed loft. The beds are comfortable, the kitchen has flow, and it is well decorated--All of which gives it a warm, homey feel. The deck is a great place to watch commerce and weather on the Mississippi River. Conveniently located to historical tours, food, and easy access to major streets. H.C. and the gallery staff are friendly, gracious, and helpful with suggestions for places to eat and things to see and do. Great place with great space."
2018-08-01,5,Group trip,Nice quiet and relaxing!! Good for a meeting or just to spend some family time.
2018-07-01,4,Group trip,"It was smaller than I imagined but nevertheless it was a really beautiful space. Also there is only one bathroom which is a slight bummer. There are only two beds (enough to fit 2) and couches and 1 slider. An unusual “event fee” was increased the week of my stay. It was originally $35 but the host increased it to $150 after I already made a full payment. Unfortunately I did not have any other options so I paid it without complaining.
Once again this place was beautiful and it’s best feature is the rooftop and the beautiful artwork."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the coolest little loft over a true art gallery. Her quirky mix of vintage juxtaposed with southern modern perspective was super interesting. Lots of great little sitting areas, fully stocked kitchen. Rooftop river view patio was incredible - don't miss the sunset with a glass of wine. Suggestion to eat at 10 South Restaurant (10th floor rooftop w/ view and live music) was a lot of fun, too. Terrific way to enjoy the ""key to the south""... Highly recommend."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were delighted with the loft! If you're looking for a place with personality and funky style, you'll love this space. It was obvious that someone had given a lot of thought as to what would make guests feel comfortable--every amenity was provided generously. Next time we'll be back for longer!"
2018-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a special place to relax and enjoy beautiful views of downtown Vicksburg, the Mississippi River and the stars at night. One of my favorite places!"
2018-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Chris was a super host. The large studio is literally a work of art! Great location. Close to local attractions and a great sunset view of the river. I highly recommend her studio as the premier place to stay in Vicksburg. We will definitely go back.
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location for downtown Vicksburg. Able to walk to many restaurants and bars. The loft was huge and very comfortable. Had a great time. Chris communicated almost immediately with every question. Rooftop terrace was nice view of the river. Unfortunately, we didn't get there until Saturday afternoon and all of the shops were closed on Sunday. Check-in and check-out was very easy. Would recommend staying here."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The rooftop is wonderful for watching sunsets. This place is as good as it looks on-line. Excellent!
2018-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful space in a charming small town. It's a vast, high-ceilinged loft with columns, tall windows, and sophisticated decor, mostly of Mississippi artists, including the owner. Everything was very comfortable, clean and of high quality. We were able to go up to the wonderful rooftop terrace, pleasantly rugged and comfortable, with views over the river. The host and her assistant, who is also the gallery manager, were very helpful and kind, suggesting local restaurants. The only reservation for staying here is just that it would be difficult for people who cannot walk easily, as it is necessary to walk upstairs to the loft, and further up to the roof. Otherwise, there could be a better place to stay."
2018-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely one of most unique, beautiful places we have visited in our 10 years of VRBO stays. Comfortable, clean, open loft apartment in historic Vicksburg overlooking the Mississippi river. Chris and Bridgette went the extra mile to make certain the experience wouldn't soon forgotten. Chris even gave us a great recommendation for dinner on a Sunday evening. We look forward to coming back."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very large, comfy place in a convenient location. Would like to have had a longer stay. Guests need to be prepared for awkward steps to the room and to the deck. The host was very helpful with local attractions."
2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very spacious loft with lots of interesting art pieces and a beautiful view from the comfortable rooftop lounge. Right in the center of Vicksburg, parking on the street in front of the house.
Chris and Mary were both really kind and helpful, thank you!"
2018-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious, convenient, and friendly."
2018-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome place! Super unique, and right in the middle of historic Vicksburg. It felt a little like spending the night in your own private art museum. We loved it!"
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful loft! Everything you need at the palm of your hands!!
2017-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Marvelous flat, well worth it."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This loft apartment is absolutely stunning! Amazing location - walking distance to wonderful restaurants and shops in downtown Vicksburg as well as stunning views of the Mississippi River and easy distance from many sites. The apartment is HUGE and has everything you could possibly need for a stay. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful home - we will definitely be back!!
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend staying here! Everything is provided for comfort and beauty in the heart of Vicksburg. The artwork and amenities set the tone for relaxation and entertainment, and Vicksburg itself has surprising entertainment value. Don't miss Hwy 61 Cafe for coffee (and the fun, colorful, ecclectic artist's loft upstairs), Anchuca for an amazing weekend brunch, and Ten South for sunset cocktails with a view. We also loved visiting Captain Tom's wood shop, Lorelei's Books and The Strand (for community theater or movies). But coming back to this well-appointed, spacious, loft apartment with surround-sound music, paintings, sculpture and soothing decor as well as comfy beds was the icing on the cupcake!"
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is INCREDIBLE. The picture do not do it justice. Huge open space, artfully decorated and perfect for families. The view from the rooftop is spectacular. Mary was very helpful and accomodating. Def try walnut hills for the best southern cooking and go to the rooftop bar across the street to see the sun set over the Mississippi."
2017-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Very relaxing.
2017-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"if you are going to vicksburg, this is the place."
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it! Will stay again!!
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing, expansive space in the heart of downtown. Great beds and linens. Very interesting historical city. H.C. was a fantastic communicator, always replying quickly and thoroughly. I look forward to coming back someday!"
2017-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Fantastic place. Wonderful view. You will not be dissapointed!!
2017-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Chris's place is within walking distance of some great shops and eateries. It is quiet and very well kept. We loved our stay and highly recommend her place for anyone travelling to Vicksburg!
2017-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a unique place to stay! The entire experience from booking to checking in and out was very convenient. Great downtown location. If you are planning a trip to Vicksburg I definitely recommend staying here.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The loft was comfortable and clean. A nice side bonus was viewing the art work in the loft and in the gallery. You have to travel through the gallery to enter the loft. Gallery staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.
2017-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This is an amazing spacious and elegant art filled loft in the heart of downtown Vicksburg with a beautiful view of the Mississippi River from the rooftop terrace. Chris's staff is very helpful and informative. You will definitely love it.
2016-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were greeted by Katherine who kindly showed us around the Loft and helped us with questions about the area. The Loft was absolutely huge, very clean and more importantly, comfortable. The location is downtown yet very quiet in the night. The beds were perfect as well as the pillows. Vicksburg is a great place for history buffs and you definitely are exposed to Southern hospitality. Highly recommend staying there."
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What a wonderful experience at The gallery loft! Vicksburg is wonderful and our stay at the loft made it even that much better. We enjoyed seeing Chris' art throughout the building (so talented) and the loft space itself is huge. Comfortable beds and everything you need! I just wish we could have stayed longer. Location is perfect.
2016-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful experience at the loft. The staff was warm and accommodating, and the roof is incredible! Take advantage of this unique stay!"
2016-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying in H. C. Porter's loft was the highlight of my and my husband's visit to Vicksburg. Not only was the loft spacious and comfortable, but it was also filled with works of art and numerous coffee table books on the subject. This space would be great for a group--I counted seating for 35! It is also conveniently located. Truly an experience!"
2016-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a stunning loft in the heart of Vicksburg sure to stir your creative energy. Although the kitchen was well appointed, we didn't cook as we could walk to charming restaurants and coffee shops. The openness of the space still provided sufficient privacy for sleeping. And the rooftop deck allowed for reflective mornings and evening relaxation. Check-in and out was a breeze. Loved it!"
2016-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great Great Great!!!!!!!!!!!!
2016-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This is such a fun place to stay! We traveled with another married couple and enjoyed walking around downtown Vicksburg which is literally right outside the door. Will definitely stay here again in the future.
2016-02-01,5,Stayed one night,This was my second time staying at this great place. It always exceeds expectations. Chris and her gallery staff are excellent hosts!
2016-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for my wedding weekend with my bridesmaids and it was absolutely perfect! Very spacious and just what we needed not only to sleep, but to get ready. There isn't a question in my mind that I would stay here again."
2015-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Katherine greeted us warmly and showed us around the loft. It was just as beautiful as shown in the pictures. We really enjoyed the common space; the furnishings were comfortable and the artwork was really fabulous. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked. Future renters, be advised that the main space in the loft is one big room, so although there are two large beds, privacy may be an issue for some. We just adjusted our expectations and enjoyed ourselves! Vicksburg itself was a a sweet surprise on our trip...while not as touristy as some of the other cities that we visited, we found it charming. Everyone made us feel right at home."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,What an amazing place. Really huge!! It would be fun to stay with your group. Catherine was so sweet and helpful. The place she recommended for dinner had the most delicious shrimp and grits and The View! It was a lovely and unique experience. My only complaint... I wish we would of had the time to stay longer. Very cool place
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, wow, wow, wow and wow. Fantastic place to stay. Can't recommend enough."
2015-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pictures do not adequately describe this loft. This loft is amazing! It is in a great location to enjoy historic Vicksburg. The root top view was an incredible experience as my group watched the sun set over the Mississippi River.
The host and her assistant made sure we knew about everything. The check-in process went smoothly, and the host left pertinent information for me inside the loft. We felt welcome and right at home.
This is definitely worth the trip to Vicksburg!"
2015-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow... what a great space with lots of amazing works of art ! We had such a good time at Chris' loft. Even enjoyed the roof deck for a beer in the evening. It is a great location in downtown Vicksburg. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
2015-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Most perfect place I could ever imagine getting in Vicksburg. Beautiful views, original artwork and centrally located."
2015-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"The entire stay was fantastic, we were warmly met when we arrived and given all the relevant info about the apartment and the surrouding area. The apartment was beautiful, wonderfully furnished and homely - most comfortable beds of our entire trip! Absolutely loved the roof terrace too, such a great view for a morning coffee!! Would 100% recommend and would most definitely stay again if I find myself in Vicksburg. Thank you!!"
2015-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a stunning loft apartment in a great little town. We were just passing through on a road trip and booked at short notice. Chris was very helpful and everything ran smoothly. The apartment is very well equipped and has the most amazing roof terrace looking out over the Mississippi where we watched the sunset. We would recommend this place highly if you are in town.
2015-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is what AirBnB is all-out, a unique place shared with people all over the world. Judging from her work Chris seems a remarkable person and a great artist. Unfortunately we have not met her, but she took care of everything in a perfect and very responsive way.
Highly recommended."
2015-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment is stunning - very airy, attractive and comfortable. The beds and lounge area are great. The kitchen is really well set up for whatever you need.
The area is beautiful, not just for the history but for restaurants too.
Chris was really great as a host, very flexible and easy to be in touch with.
Comfortably my best airbnb experience in several years using the site. And great value for money too."
2015-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I do not know how to describe the listing other than it was exactly like the photos! This is definitely the most unique and stylish location I have ever stayed in from Airbnb and one of the most spectacular ever. The location (downtown Vicksburg) could not be better. I was able to park my car on the street and then just walk to shops, restaurants and many sightseeing venues. Communication before hand was exceptional. I knew exactly who would meet us at the gallery and exactly when. The young man who met us was prompt, helpful (helped take our luggage upstairs) and knew a lot about the area. He gave us all the particulars on the loft and gave us all the information Chris had left in the loft. The loft is well marked - wifi, private areas, ac, alarm system.....There is a full kitchen and as a bonus The Miss Mississippi Pagent parade was Monday night. We bought frozen catered food from down the street and prepared it in the kitchen. We ate in and watched the parade from the windows! We were not able to utilize the balcony space as it was too hot. However, a trip in the fall or spring might be necessary! The loft was exactly as promised - I cannot stress that enough. Amenities are plentiful, wifi, cable, full bath with an awesome shower and for this time of the year a phenomanal ac! This loft is a must rental for anyone visiting Vicksburg!"

2015-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Beatiful place; Sam arrived on time to open on Sunday. Grabbed sandwiches from McAlisters and enjoyed sunset on deck with wine. Little street noise in AM but OK as we had early departure. One of best places we stayed on 14 day trip!
2015-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host's agent Sam was responsive and kept in touch with us on the road to coordinate check in. She welcomed us warmly and efficiently acquainted us with the apartment and neighborhood. The apartment is just lovely, beautifully furnished and comfortable. The old-town street is gentrified and there are interesting places to visit nearby on foot. The view over the river bend from the roof is magnificent."
2015-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft is absolutely amazing! The atmosphere was warm and elegant, and it's conveniently located near restaurants, shops and attractions...within walking and driving distance. We are definitely looking forward to returning soon."
