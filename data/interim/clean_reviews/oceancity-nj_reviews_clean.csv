2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Exactly what we were looking for
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Love this place! Location is unreal like others have said. Guy at the front desk was super nice as were other building employees. This condo has awesome beach vibes!! I’m kind of OCD so it was nice to walk into a place that was ACTUALLY VERY CLEAN! I felt very comfortable with the job they did. The host was super friendly and answered all of our questions including a nice place to eat and they hit the nail on the head. I will certainly come back and stay here again, we loved our time here and will be repeat guests."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We love this condo and will be back! We have never been to Ocean City before and so glad we picked this place for our quick 1-night trip. All in all, we wanted a place that was more modern, clean and value for our money. This was definitely it!
It’s super nice, new, super clean, cozy. Steve has literally thought about everything you need during your stay. This place has a ton of amenities compared to most of the other Airbnb listings we looked at before deciding on this one. I loved the beach decor throughout, and all the amenities it had to offer. Location was top notch literally just out the door to the left is the boardwalk and beach. Cannot beat it!
Steve’s communication was great and he even helped us with the later check in to accommodate us so that was nice of him. All in all, when we come back, we will certainly stay with him again no question!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Much needed time away for our family of 5! The location was perfection - girls loved playing water sports off the dock. We even caught (and released) a few fish.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Bill's house! Everything was clean and organized. The house had everything you could need for a beach vacation- fully supplied kitchen, comfy beds and pillows, beach chairs and towels, bikes, great outdoor furniture on the balcony to sit and relax and a view of the ocean! Parking for two cars is an extra added bonus. We would definitely stay here again, and hope to!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband & myself, my mom and 20 month daughter all stayed at Bill’s lovely OC house! The view of the ocean from the balcony is stunning both at sunrise & sunset!

We all slept comfortably and soundly in the very comfy beds! We will definitely be booking again in the future!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bill’s Home Is Perfection! His home was extremely clean, fully stocked, Bill responded immediately and answered all my questions, But the Best Part was the Bed & Mattresses in his Master Suite!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My sister and I stayed at Bill’s place for the weekend. It was an incredible space. The top floor corner lot allowed for a view of the ocean on a beautiful fall weekend. We loved it. We even got to go for a bike ride borrowing Bill’s bikes. So fun!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hope to return this summer!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Bill is the ultimate host
He quickly answers all your questions.
His place was spotlessly clean and very tidy.
Bill was helpful in letting us know what was happening locally and
when we had a health hiccup he worked with us to help find a solution to our questions.
A very kind and helpful host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay - good place to work
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bill was an extremely responsive and accommodating host. The place was spotless and well maintained. We were very pleased that all was exactly as advertised and we felt right at home. Beautiful views from the deck. It was a wonderful stay! We would love to plan a stay at Bill’s place again!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about the stay was flawless, we felt so welcomed. The instructions & communication prior to arrival were complete & clear. Any questions we had were addressed promptly, making us feel well taken care of. We were blown away by the condo’s order and cleanliness & the Owner stocked it with everything we could possible require during our stay. The beds were the most comfortable we ever slept in & the high end choices made throughout the condo made our stay very enjoyable.
The location with beach & sunset views are even better than what is shown in the listing. Pictures do not do this place justice. The sound of the ocean makes a great lullaby as you drift off to sleep at night & the oversized windows allow the sea breeze to move freely throughout the condo.
The house itself is beautifully appointed, with a comfortable and stylish interior. The Owner seems to care about the little things which made for a truly unforgettable experience. Highly recommend, don’t miss this gem!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thought this was a great find!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gary was a responsive host, quick to answer back messages. It was spacious and peaceful, no loud noise or ruckus from neighbors. Close to the beach/boardwalk. Overall, it was a good experience and stay."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a nice stay but there were nails sticking up in the floor of the master bedroom. Besides that though it was clean, as described, and a good location."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great Location, beach and boardwalk only a few blocks away, overall good stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"First time taking our 2 kids to Ocean City and staying overnight anywhere! Robert’s apartment had great parking, the apartment wasn’t too big nor too small! Perfect to know where my kids are at all times. The place is also great location!!! Only few blocks from the boardwalk! Robert was also very clear with his expectations and what’s best is he allows pets!"
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Small second floor apartment, owner was responsive. Could use some updating and TLC. Beware of tack strips sticking up through worn carpet. Apartment not suitable for bare feet, my wife stepped on a rusty old tack strip coming up through worn carpet and it punctured through her foot. Thank goodness she was up to date on her tetanus shot! Reported to owner, but no response as of yet. Hopefully this issue will be addressed."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert is very helpful and communicates often. Really, really nice and easy to work with. The place could use a sprucing up but it was a very good deal and we were not in a lot, as we just needed a place to sleep for a few nights."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, clean, simple space, very responsive host."
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a small spot with two bedrooms. Beds and pillows are very uncomfortable, couch also not very comfortable. No soap or shampoo in the shower. Only one of the burners on the oven worked. With new mattresses, pillows and a couch, would be infinitely better. Robert was a great communicator otherwise, and the place was ready on a same day booking."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Second place we’ve stayed in that Robert runs. Extremely accommodating every time! Highly recommended!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert’s place was small, cozy, and clean. The area was nice. Very quiet, but a five minute walk to a street with restaurants and a farmers market, and a 5-10 minute walk to the boardwalk."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great house to stay out!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The best weekend getaway with my little ones! Thank you for hosting us Robert!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's place was very cozy and comfortable. He was very accommodating and responsive. We had a lot planned, so we didn't get to spend as much time in the house as we wanted, but it was very enjoyable. We come to AC often and will definitely stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was great, we both enjoyed our stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great little spot center of everything
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good value.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Lovely area and peaceful. Roberts communication is 10 out of 10. Felt at home at the apartment.
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay! Good location, exactly like the description. Cute place for a weekend trip."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Needed a 1 month rental while waiting to make settlement. Robert had numerous properties to select from. This one stood out with 2 BR, open concept living area and a washer/dryer. Two of us work remotely; internet reliable. Robert responsive with washer questions and snow! Employee came over to demo washer and she was out early next morning to shovel and salt! Proximity to many boardwalk, coffee and eateries was appreciated daily. Pet friendly! Hard to leave. Enjoyed stay. Would recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great stay and felt like a home away from home. Robert was very responsive and any issues were addressed the next day (such as a burned out light bulb). Thanks for making our stay fantastic!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Cute and cozy definitely worth the stay!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This spot is exactly as you see and read about it. Clean, good location, roomy enough for 4 people, and even warm in the winter! Only downside was the WiFi was a little spotty but we were totally ok with that."
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"From going up the steps, the handrail is really a narrow bar with 2 pieces of PVC pipe cover , with a split at the top. Don't understand why it's installed on a railing, which makes it tight squeeze with luggage by the rain gutter. Should have a real handrail connection to the house , which will make it more secure. Does OC have codes ?
I know it's a summer rental but I told you why I was coming , to spend time with relatives for Christmas. That said, you had ample time to do after season cleaning and repairs. The living room sofa with a crapy cover and a chair that should have been trashed on
a rug that should have been ?? The bathroom toilet paper thing ?? You have spackle, where it used to be and some rusted TP holder that doesn't even fit in the space. A screen in the window would have been nice too.
You should have been truthful and said it is a summer rental. There' not much I could do as it was Christmas weekend. Didn't feel secure with a code that should and can be changed"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First time using airbnb Robert provided a great experience!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you it was a good day. Thank you for everything.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I had a great stay. The lodging was cozy and comfortable. I would recommend it and I would stay again.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Great stay. Was here for work, and this was everything i needed for a work trip. minutes from the beach and restaurants."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint 2br upper floor apartment walking distance to boardwalk, coffee shops and restaurants. Not handicap accessible, street parking was easy for us in November. Could be difficult in the summer. No bathtub, which was not an issue for us. Would rent again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This stay was amazing! We couldn’t be more happier. We felt right at home.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great option for inexpensive and comfortable lodging on the island. Pay attention so you understand where you will be located. You are close to the bay. I saw a pavilion at the end of the street overlooking the bay. A decent walk down 12th in the other direction gets you to the shops of the boardwalk and the ocean. (I would drive and park on Central) You are close enough to the business district to be convenient to food, shops and grocery stores but not in the middle of it. The location seems quiet (everything was quiet at the end of October but I know Ocean City well) The beach at 12th is great. The apartment is small but all you need. The bath is small but the space is well utilized. All was clean and in good shape. The kitchen had the essentials for light cooking, full-sized fridge. I was surprised to see a washer/dryer. Robert was a great communicator - the details you need and often photos to go along with it. Pain-free experience. Enjoy your stay"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Robert's place was exactly in line with our needs (family of 4 for a three day stay). We felt very comfortable. Communication with Robert was flawless. The area was safe and very well maintained.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good spot, walk able to the beach and the main goings on in OCNJ. A good option if you just need a place to crash."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mother Nature affected the parking availability out front because the area in front of the rental was unfortunately flooded. Nevertheless, there was parking close by which we took advantage of. This rental has all the basics you need, plus is within a short walking distance to Wawa, the beach, and the boardwalk. We would have appreciated the ability to watch the football games on Sunday, but Netflix and the other option did not make those available. Otherwise, we had a fantastic experience."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I stayed at Robert’s place this weekend and my boyfriend and I had a great time! The place was pretty and clean. The area was quiet and nice. It was just the place my boyfriend and I needed for a getaway weekend. Would book again with Robert as this is my second time booking with him and he has been nothing but great!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the place! It was very homey. Perfect for our family of 5 for a quick beach weekend getaway. Robert was very responsive and place was exactly as described.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot for our family of 5. Walkable to the boardwalk and quiet at night. Robert was very responsive and a great host. Would definitely recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,easy walk to the boardwalk/beach...10 minutes.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Love coming back every year! Robert is the perfect host! Worth every penny!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Special place , cute and peaceful. We will be back for sure."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I went with 2 of my girl friends and it was our first time using airbnb. We got inside and all said “omg this is sooo cute!” It was so cozy and cute and the perfect size for all of us. The place even included brochures for places in Ocean City which helped and also a cute guestbook with recommendations for food and things to do from others who have stayed there. Robert also made communication very easy and instructions were straight forward. We only stayed one night and wish we stayed longer! The place also came with several beach badges.
We were a little nervous being 3 girls walking to the boardwalk at night from the house but the area made us feel safe and it was about a quick 5 minute walk.
The bedrooms were tidy and I have to mention the pillows were very comfortable and so was the couch!
We created so many memories here and can’t wait to come back next time and create more.
Overall, we had an amazing time and enjoyed our stay! :)Thank you Robert!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed in Roberts home to spend a night shopping and going on rides - great for a quick over night trip when being part of the board walk action is the intent. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Would recommend and it did not work out on my side to bring my dogs, but for me a dog friendly stay is awesome and I am always thankful for opportunities to travel with them. So bring your pooch or kitty cat if you can!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great stay - exactly what we expected!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great had plenty of space and very convenient for the beach.
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,Was excited to spend time at the unit. Upon arrival there was dirty towels still hanging in the bedroom. Leftover dorito bag on the table and toothpaste in the bathroom sink. The amenities did not match the listing. The dryer kept beeping 24/7 during the whole stay . The washer would not work. Owner did not address the issue during our stay. Will not choose this unit next visit.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family of six (inc. 4 teens) spent one night at Robert's place in O.C. The place was really cute and had all the necessities we needed for our stay. There were enough bath towels and the beds were comfy. Robert was responsive and provided very helpful information/resources. The beach tags were a huge benefit (and key to picking this spot). The unit is less than a 10 minute walk from door to boardwalk (carrying a full load of beach stuff).
Although the unit was small, it met our needs for our short stay. The kids and us enjoyed every minute of our trip to O.C. this Summer.
I would definitely recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for my daughters and I for a few days..
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I loved our stay here! Perfect place to relax down the shore. Thankful that we could bring our dog as well. Highly recommend!!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The shower curtain Rod was rusty and wouldn’t stay tight against the wall. The only dirty thing in the house was the inside of the shower curtain but the rest of the house was spotless.
Overall it was a nice small place for our family of four. For the price I would say it was worth it."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little place for a last minute overnight stay at the beach. Super easy check-in and ideal location in Ocean City. Robert was a great host.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We truly enjoyed our stay at this place. It is such a short distance to the beach and boardwalk. We appreciated the visit and had a super time. We would pick this place again next time! only thing I'd add is it is not suitable for anyone with difficulty going up and down tricky stairs.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great time during our stay. Perfect for a low-key weekend with some friends! Clean, comfortable, easily accessible, close to some places to eat and not a bad walk down to the beach/boardwalk. Will definitely look into renting again :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very pleasant house, responsive host, everything as advertised"
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another problem, the outside stairs leading to the second floor is too narrow. The roof to the first floor is right there and it’s kind of dangerous when carrying your luggage up. And the railing was cut in half. And there was advertisement of a backyard, but with people downstairs and us being on the second floor, it felt kind of intrusive. Because it’s all fenced in."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was glad to have the privacy I paid for. Like most things, you don’t notice until you really pay attention. Intermittent irritations popped up.
WiFi did work for my laptop and phone - would have been nice to watch the television. After messaging the owner to reset the router for Smart TV connectivity, he was unhelpful. Had I known I couldn’t watch any television channels or log into my own streaming services on the television, I would have brought a dongle to connect the HDMI cord to my MacBook. It’s not very difficult or demanding to reset a router. The hosts were home + I wish they were more supportive around this. It went on for days unfortunately.
If you have problems gripping anything with your hands, good luck. The shower knob is impossible to turn when your hands are wet. The liner and I became far too intimate due to close proximity and the owner needs to fix the curtain rod and add storage. I had to move a piece of furniture to store my toiletries."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great little place! Close to many shops and restaurants.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Robert was very responsive and the place was lovely

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little place. Robert was constantly checking in to make sure everything was ok. The furniture and carpeting needs some updating but it has everything you need for a solo/couple weekend trip.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall the stay was a great value for the location. The street was quiet at night as to be expected in Ocean City. Very cozy upstairs apartment.
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Robert is an attentive host and effective communicator. He checked in with me at key moments of my trip.
This second floor simple decor unit met all of my expectations for a peaceful winter weekend retreat. The clean unit is comfortable, cozy and comes equipped with a small yet efficient kitchen. The master bedroom bedding was perfect.
Overall my experience was relaxing and peaceful. I am grateful for the opportunity to rent this unit."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very cute upstairs beach house a couple blocks off the bay… lovely sunsets from the deck at night
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Robert's place was pretty much as described, nothing fancy, but basically clean and comfortable.
The listing states that there is cable TV, IT DOES NOT - (normally that wouldn't matter much, but game 2 of the World Series was on and we were very much looking forward to watching it) and wasn't able to stream through You Tube. Disappointing.
There was no hand or bath soap (an oversight, I get it). Robert alerted his ""cleaning staff"" and she delivered soap to the wrong house (not her fault)... it didn't make it to our Airbnb until the next day, fortunately Wawa was a couple blocks away ...."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cute little place! It was exactly what we needed. Robert was a great host! Couldn’t ask for more!

Parking was available and always within feet of the rental."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute place to stay and location is great! We had a great time with it being so close to Wawa and Fractured Prune. About a 10 minute realistic walk to the boardwalk and beach, but it was a nice walk! Really only meant for no more than 4 people to stay there though, so it was a good thing we had 4 people!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great price for the location and our small family!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The location of this air bnb was actually perfect! It was near literally everything and close to the boardwalk. Although we weren’t physically in the apartment much, we felt that it was clean and cozy. The communication with Robert was clear and concise and if anything were needed, the response time would’ve been speedy! The only thing we had hoped for was the air conditioner being a little more powerful/cooler in the queen size bedroom. Otherwise, we would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert is a great host - good communication and follow-up throughout the process. We enjoyed our stay and found it to be a nice getaway spot, easy access to the beach and boardwalk."

2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location for shopping and beach. Beach about 1/4 mile away. Second floor of house was small but cozy. Air conditioning with window units, front porch small and could use power washed. Overall, gods place for visiting Ocean City, NJ."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Cozy place. Small but had everything we needed and great location. Easy checkin and Robert is a great communicator. Comfortably sleeps 5 but any more would be very tight.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cozy 2nd floor was great for a hub for our family. We did have family at a 2nd home that we would spend most of our time if we weren't at the beach. 5 people was very tight including our 3 kids.
Seriously thinking of a getaway with my wife next off season. Will keep this one in mind, esp if the price is still as low."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for a short weekend getaway in the off-season when being very close to the beach didn’t matter too much. Cozy and easy, with two chairs on the landing in front of the unit. Note that if you are more than 2 people there is no dining table/chairs that makes sense. Hopefully Robert will add a house manual for future guests. Thanks for a nice stay."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful little shore home. Perfect for our needs. Thanks!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,awesome place !

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great value for what we paid. This place is not fancy, but it has all the basics and was perfect for a long weekend stay for our family of 4 with two small children. Our kids loved the trundle bed."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this is a cute place. close to boardwalk and things to do in town. i would recommend this place to stay will definitely be back.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The best in OC Nj
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place in a great location, nice and simple!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean, comfortable apartment close to the boardwalk. Perfect for a weekend with the family."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,It was good for what we needed. Appreciated the firm mattress’s and Robert responded to our requests. Within walking distance of the beach!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Having a washer and dryer easily accessible is a big plus. We were very comfortable during our stay.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great Place, Great Host...simple as that. It's a clean house in a fairly quiet location but everything around is still easily in walking distance. Perfect spot for a small family. Has everything you need for a getaway. And the beds are extremely comfortable. All around a great stay and experience."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First time ever using airbnb and all I can say is that this place is absolutely perfect for a couple it’s small but is a ver comfortable spot all round. It’s pretty much in the middle of the island so walking anywhere shouldn’t be an issue and Robert was very quick to respond to any questions I had and made it easy to just relax and not worry about small things. The place is definitely a must stay especially if you wanna be comfortable and have easy access to pretty much everything you need
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place to get away! Thank you Robert for excellent communication with us before, during and upon our departure."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, great area. All around a great experience."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great spot close to the center of Ocean City, so if you don't want to drive everywhere, the center of town is just a quick walk away as is the boardwalk. The unit was very clean and recently renovated, so it had a fresh and more modern feel. Robert communicated quickly, and check in was a breeze.
If you're looking for a reasonably priced place to stay in Ocean City and still feel like you're not being cheap, this is a great option."
2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,This place wasn’t bad. It was smaller than I expected for sure. I wouldn’t recommend this place for longer stays. A few days wouldn’t be bad at all. We stayed for a month and it was pretty frustrating. The kitchen is almost unbearable. The 2 back burners don’t work. You’re given one pot and I think maybe 2 pans? Most cooking utensils had rust on them. There’s no counter space so cooking could get frustrating at times for sure. There is no where to put food you buy that doesn’t go in the fridge. But like I said for short stays that wouldn’t matter too much if you’re eating out. But more than a week would be bad. We had to use the entire kitchen table for food storage. So kids had to sit on the floor in living room to eat. The sink is a corner sink which sits a bit too far back to be comfortable washing even cups. Let alone dinner dishes. The washer is the loudest appliance I have ever heard in my life. Dryer stopped working and host acted as though he didn’t know what was happening but talked to the repair guy like it has happened a few times before. The shower is the smallest shower I’ve ever been in lol. That was kind of a shock. Beds were comfortable though. Couch is a bit older but still has life in it. The area is quiet and the best McDonald’s is right around the corner. Don’t eat the pizza place. It was awful! Lol All in all. I would stay again if it was just a couple days. But not for a long stay.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am not sure what happened because the air bnb gave me your text number, I texted you but I never heard back. Any clues?"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is great. Just big enough so everyone can still have their own space. Very clean too. The town is just a few blocks away as well as the beach. Everything you need is walking distance. I would highly recommend. Robert was an A+ all day host!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's place is rustic and very nice. Bring a couple of bars of soap and some extra towels, you'll need them. Otherwise, my only issue would be the length and angle of the stairs to access this upstairs unit. I'm in my 70s, and although very healthy, it was a chore getting up and down those steep stairs - especially with luggage. I wouldn't recommend this unit for seniors for that reason."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was as described. Very roomy. Thank you for hosting us.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Robert was very responsive and his house was homey, relaxing and had all the necessary amenities already on site—just what we needed for a weekend at the shore!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Adorable space, perfect for a couple and child. Close to everything in Downtown OC-about 8 blocks to the beach and boardwalk. Easy check in and the host is very responsive. Late check-out was also available."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very amazing place great communication and location was perfect!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything you need for your trip is ready available in this apartment…just pack a bag and go. I would highly recommend. Robert has thought of everything!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent place for a beach getaway near the Jersey Shore 😎
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was our first AirBnB to booked, excited the place was just as described! As soon we got in, we felt at home right away! My kids and my mom loves it, and the kids really started to be soo curious, looking at every corner of the house specially their same height windows (their 2yrd btw haha). I really loved the house, it was simple yet the ambience was so relaxing. The location was so convenient and quiet, and your in the middle of the town which is almost close to every store that you could think of. I/We would definitely come here again without a doubt. Thank you again Rob!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Robert's place is perfect for a short trip to the beach for two people! You are so close to the boardwalk and parking is a breeze. Robert's space offers privacy, two nicely-sized bedrooms, plenty of A/C, a large TV, and a large sitting area. A great spot from which to explore the South Jersey beach scene!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and value. Would def stay again!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Robert’s place! Smack in the middle of all the fun things to do in OCNJ and a clean, cozy space. Would definitely recommend!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My family and I had a great time during our stay in Ocean City. The location is close to the beach, easy to get to, and exactly as listed. It was cozy, clean, and comfortable!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Robert’s place was great for our group of six. He was very accommodating and quick to reply to messages. It was about a five minute walk to the boardwalk and we were happy to have good AC throughout the house. Would recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is in a great location and within walking distance of shops and restaurants. The check-in was easy and it's just as advertised. If we're in the area again we'll definitely rebook!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Our family of 4 enjoyed our stay at Robert's place. The location was great and allowed for easy access to the boardwalk. Communication was a bit challenging at times, but it did not have much impact on our stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t say enough how fantastic, our stay was, it was that good. We arrived to seamless check in and friendly emails. It is a wonderful little apartment, on the second floor. The place was so clean and had beautiful furnishings. They include 4 beach tags as well. The kitchen was a big draw for us, because we had different ages of people staying with us. The kitchen has everything we needed, fully stocked. The beds were comfortable and bedding was clean and beautiful. The bathroom has a shower, sink and toilet. They had towels and toilet paper supplied. It was again, very clean and beautifully furnished. There is a little breakfast bar, were you can eat. The living room has a comfortable sofa with a television. Cute pillows and furnishings that make you feel at home. My daughter enjoyed the free WiFi that was very fast. Air conditioning in each room keep us all very comfortable, the whole time. There was a list on the refrigerator, of things to do and place to go and suggested place to eat. That was very helpful. The owner emailed us through out our stay his communication was fabulous. Plenty of free parking, in the area as well. Check out was seamless again and communication was fabulous."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little escape for a small group of 2-4 adults or a family of 4 or 5. The house was very neat and clean and well stocked with supplies in the kitchen! We enjoyed our weekend stay very much and would definitely recommend this place!!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent clean little place. Perfect for two couples or a small family. Super clean place and Robert was a great host and easy to deal with! Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location with short walk to restaurants and the beach!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 5 (2 adults + 3 kids) really enjoyed our stay here! The location is very convenient, and we were able to find everything we needed within a couple walking blocks radius (iced coffee :-) , food basics, etc). We walked easily to the beach and boardwalk, about a 10-12 minute walk.
The kitchen is well stocked with pots/pans, cutlery and dinner ware, as well as some paper goods. I had no problem preparing meals with the tools provided (maybe just need a baking sheet if you plan on baking in the oven!).
The beds were comfortable and everything was super clean when we arrived. Oh - and the washer/dryer were a godsend!
Would 100% recommend this home to a friend, or book again in the future!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This property had everything that we needed and was a much better value than some of the motels/inns in Ocean City. It suited us well for a one-night stay. Communication and information from the host was very thorough. Contactless check-in and keyless entry are an amazing bonus! No problem finding street parking (around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon). It was a tight fit for 2 adults and 4 teens, but much better than a single motel room, for sure! VERY clean!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place accurate listing
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Simple and clean accommodations right down from the 12th street beach entrance. Also walking distance to Wawa, Starbucks, lots of restaurants. Easy parking too. Good choice if your priority is spending time at the beach but want to sleep close enough to be able to walk."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we had a great time at robert’s place. the house was very clean and comfortable.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cozy little apartment that is close to all the great things that OC has to offer: shops on Asbury, about a ten minute walk to the boardwalk and beach. Loved being able to walk there every morning. The host provides beach tags, which is great. Kitchen is well stocked with the essentials to eat meals at home. Dead End Bakery, Bennie’s Bread, and the Sunrise cafe are a couple of minutes away. Host communicates well before and during the stay. Now, the bedrooms are small and while it fit four adults just fine, I agree with another reviewer who said that six guests would be a stretch. The two twin beds are actually a trundle bed and there was too much furniture for us to “un-trundle” so my son slept on the couch. It was clean and bright. The bathroom needs a facelift to
match the cute little kitchen. The railing to the stairs us a bit wobbly, and they’re narrow. It is part of a residential neighborhood, but there are larger businesses just a 1/2 block away.However, OC is not industrial in any way. Parking was easy. All that being said, I would recommend it to others because it is cute, the host is communicative, and the price is reasonable for July at the shore."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute place in the middle of everything! It was a short walk to the boardwalk and not far from everything we wanted to do. Robert gave us recommendations about the local area. Cant wait to come back! Thanks for making our OCNJ stay fabulous.
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little beach house is homey and cozy. It can sleep up to six; but, in my opinion is better for 4 or less. 5 minute walk to the Bay. About a 12 minute walk to the beach. Too far for me to be hauling beach gear with an arthritic hip. We just drove up and used a parking meter. Not a big enough deal to give this place a bad rating! The only downside can be the parking. During the week; generally, a parking spot can be found close to the beach house, However; on the weekend, you may have to park a block or two away (parking is at a premium on the weekend)."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very cute place. SUPER convenient to the boardwalk and beach. Was so nice to stay here (versus a cramped hotel). A few short blocks from the beach, which also means quiet and peaceful at night. Also washer/dryer in the apartment was super helpful for beach days.
Robert and Bob are super responsive and patiently answered every one of my questions."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Robert’s. The apartment could not have been more well located, and there were some nice touches like a smart TV and the beach tags. For what we needed during a weekend trip, this apartment was perfect!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Robert’s place was really nice… close to the bay and an easy walk to the boardwalk. I’d definitely stay again next time I was in OC

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Amazing place
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This beach house is exactly as described. The walk to the beach is easy but if you have alot you like to take then a wagon would be best or dropping someone off near the boardwalk would be helpful. Its a short walk but a pain with alot of stuff. Great location for the public restrooms on the beach and stuff to do on the boardwalk. Steps to the place are alittle steep if anyone has issues with stairs. Very quiet at night. Would stay again.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very clean and Robert was very friendly and informative. We would definitely stay here again.

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all: Decent place for what we paid. No major complaints.
Very small room, located in a OLD hotel (circa 1928) in a busy section of town. Beach is about a block away, again-8th St is a busy area-beach was packed.
Window AC unit ran constantly to keep room at 72, bathroom was HOT."

2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,barbara was really nice and helpful. she responded quickly and gave us an extra fan when the AC unit wasn’t getting the room cool enough. little bit of a small room and stuff was painted over. it was a close room to the boardwalk but wasn’t the nicest. there was an elevator which was nice but the room and hallway was hot.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was exactly as listed. Like others said, it was small but the location was great and it was the best value around. Barbara was very good with communication and told us where to park so we didn’t have to pay. She also allowed us to check in early. I would recommend this place for a couple without kids. We brought our toddler and wish we would have had a common area to hang out while he was sleeping. Really no complaints with the place though!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great value in a wonderful location at a beach resort that’s one of our favorites.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Be careful looking at the photos. The photos look like there are two beds, really there is only one and It is just moved and has two different comforters on It to make It seem like there were two beds. Overall, the location was great and checking in was easy. The place was also very clean, just a lot smaller than we expected since there was only bed and It pretty much took up the whole room."
2021-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location. Al is a very nice and helpful manager of building.
We had a fun time with our grandson but 3 people are pretty tight in this space"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay!! I took my son on a weekend trip for his birthday. This condo was perfect. Literally steps from the beach, boardwalk and across the street from 2 bike shops for rentals. So many choices for eating, fun and games for kids or just lay on the beach. The complimentary beach passes and free mini golf tickets were a nice touch!!
The condo is an efficiency so it’s small but has all the necessities and more. Coffee with a coffee maker, utensils, dishes, stovetop, small fridge, sink. There were games and TV for rainy days but we didn’t need them.
I am especially grateful to the building maintenance for meeting us after hours to let us in the first day as our flight had been delayed. We did not make it for the normal check in time. It’s was a small extra fee but well worth it!!
The communication with the host was quick and reactive. Loved the stay so much, already thinking of when we can go back!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for what I needed. My family was staying nearby and I had to work a day before I started my vacation. It had a nice desk space and was quiet but comfy!
The location was only a 3 minute walk to the boardwalk/beach, staff (Alan) was very friendly and helpful (helped with my luggage and parking tips), bike rental across the street and a great smoothie/healthy choice breakfast/lunch place on the corner. Free parking was easy to find. Barbara was very responsive. I had a wonderful time and would definitely go back."
2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, just a minute walk to the boardwalk and beach. Room was clean although somewhat tight. Maintenance and supplies provided could be better. plenty of items are simply painted over and some are held together with tape. Additionally pans were dirty with no soap, sponges or paper towels to clean anything. Expect limited window views and window ACs. However customer service and promptness was excellent with the host and on site staff being friendly and helpful. Overall, the room is quaint but not what we expected for the price."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect spot for a get away. Minute walk to boardwalk and beach. Clean and spacious. Will definitely be back!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super clean ... everything you need and so easy to get to beach .... restaurants and shopping . A great value as well!
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Barbara's place is super convenient. It is a short walk to the boardwalk and beach. We had a 5 year old with us which proved slightly difficult at times just due to his energy level, but the room was able to accomdate the 3 of us easily. I would surely stay here again."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute studio apartment. Exactly what 2 people need for a night at ocean city. Incredible location for the boardwalk. Make sure you check in before 7pm because the front desk staff leave. Would absolutely stay again.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host!!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Really good spot near the beach
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We love this location! This is our 3rd stay this summer at Hanscom location. Al and les at the front are amazing! Super helpful and friendly. Room was decent. Clean. High queen bed I loved it but my 5ft mom had trouble getting into bed. No window screens in any windows. Wish there was a fan or ceiling fan to help keep air flow. The AC unit only gets so cold. Room was clean. No toaster. Located super close to 8th street board walk. Lots of places to do that are walking distance. No parking. Have to fine street parking. Some free some not.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a beautiful little spot on the street side of the boardwalk. Barbara also included mini golf tickets to accommodate our stay!!
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute little place!!
2020-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"I needed a quick beach getaway for my little family so I decided on a quick last minute beach trip . Barbara was a great host , everything I needed wasn’t even a block away as described . I ran into a bit of a dilemma before check in which caused me to run a few hours late , but the maintenance /front desk guy was still right there ready to greet me and showed me around the building with a great attitude. When entering the room , I noticed two mini golf passes , my son absolutely loved that ! Thanks Barbara .It was a getaway so of course I shut off my phone for the weekend , but upon checking my emails today . Barbara sent me multiple emails to make sure I checked in okay and offered me a bunch of suggestions for activities . Overall I would definitely book with Barbara again , she was great and very patient with my lack of communication.
However , the pictures of the booking and the explanation can be a little tricky . Upon booking I thought the bedroom was a separate room from the kitchen , but once I got there I realized what I actually booked was a studio . There wasn’t much room , and was sort of cramped for 3 people . I would recommend updating the booking to reflect this information . Both washers were also broken , however the machine still charged me 5$. I would pay and it would say “machine failure “ on the screen . I was unable to do laundry the night before check out which sucked as well .
Besides that it was a great experience. Thank you for the getaway !"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I loved our stay at Barbara’s little place! It was just what we needed for a little getaway to the beach. The room ended up being ready early, which was great because we were already on our way down to the island. It was exceptionally clean and they has even left 2 mini golf passes for our use! The location was absolutely perfect since it was close to the boardwalk, beach, and parking. Barbara and her sons were great about recommending great places to eat (Manco’s is a MUST!!) and giving us indoor options when storms came through. I would absolutely love to stay with Barbara again!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara has a great little space right off of the boardwalk. The bed is incredibly comfortable and we truly enjoyed our weekend in the space. As a host Barbara was warm, welcoming, and responded readily! I highly recommend."
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Barbara was a great host! The staff at Hanscom was very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. This place was a block from the boardwalk, literally steps away!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for an affordable price!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Host goes the extra mile to make sure all of your needs are taken care of. The bed is very comfortable. Although sits high off the floor. This room has a “boutique” feel. I can’t say enough how CLEAN the room is. No smells. Really, extra care is given to make you feel at home. Parking is just a few steps away in the Public parking area. $20 for overnight parking. So our stay was $100 for 5 nights. The front desk will help you with whatever you need. And the Host answers questions quickly. There’s a washer/dryer (2.50$ a load ) downstairs. You remove your garbage as well as recycling. The Host gives you everything you need. You just bring your own “extras.” The beach can’t be closer ! Overall, it’s an excellent value. I would definitely recommend this place. It’s a quiet getaway. The building is extremely well maintained. Beautiful sea life murals on each level. You know your at the beach. Or as we Jerseysan’s say : “down the shore.” You’ll love it❤️"

We also utilized the second bed for my mom. We loved the table by the window- plenty of light and could view the ocean/boardwalk. This was a great location, and we used the parking lot for overnight parking down the street. Our stay felt safe- personalized lock code for our room and also front door of building you needed an access card for after hours (7pm).

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved everything about the experience, Karen was very friendly & helpful. Literally a block away from the boardwalk, had so much fun would definitely book again/ recommend to my friends."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Karen was very accommodating! She went beyond and above when I made the reservation. The place even small still comfortable for a family of 3.

Would have loved to stay longer, the area was amazing as well! It was a great place to stay overall!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Me and my boyfriend spent the weekend here and we had a great experience! It was the perfect little room for me and him and had everything we needed. The location was probably the best part, basically right on the boardwalk, asbury ave is about 4 blocks up which was great, it was right in the center of everything we needed or planned to go to. Karen our host was wonderful! She responded very quickly and was a huge help and made everything very easy. We will definitely be coming back in the summer for an even better experience!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my second time staying at this location. It has become one of my favorite getaways. Perfect for 2 people. Host is always repo dive and accommodating. Love this stay and highly recommend!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are trying to book this apartment, don’t hesitate and just book it. You’ll not regret it. Karen is literally the best host we have ever met, my fiancé and I planned a very last minute trip to ocean city this past weekend. The apartment is small, we were aware since she mentioned it on her description so we were not expecting it to be big. She constantly texted us to make sure we were okay and we didn’t need anything, she accommodated us so much since we got there late and checked in late and also allowed us to do a late checkout with absolutely no problem. The beach is literally a block away which was also a big plus. We just booked another stay for the summer because we loved our stay so much"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Karen was a warm and welcoming host, all communication was responded to promptly ensuring it was a worry free trip. There was one minor mishap which was no fault of karen at all and she resolved it beautifully. I appreciate a host who ensures a great stay even if there are minor mistakes.
The Condo is cute, cozy and has everything you need. it has an ocean view!! and it is in an incredible location. Loved the stay and hope to come back some time!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a perfect little place for me and my friend. Would LOVE to come again. The host Karen was incredibly helpful and sweet.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A last minute pick, and Karen was WONDERFUL! The place is a perfect size for a overnight stay! (Pictures make room look a little bigger, I didn’t mind) We were running late to check in and Karen was flexible and responsive! Super clean, comfortable, and stocked with beach necessities (beach is like a 3 minute walk). I would 100% revisit !!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It's a small place, as described, but has one of the best views in the building, is cozy and clean and really in the heart of everything. You cannot get a better location for the price!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed here twice now and I love this place. great views, clean and comfy."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Clean and well stocked. Great location and the host had great communication. Can't wait to come back.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Big thanks to Lauren and Rich for our stay at “The Teal Turtle” studio. The space was extremely clean throughout and up to date. Our hosts were incredibly swift in greeting us upon confirming the reservation , very clear with providing us check in instructions and were super welcoming. Everything we needed to enjoy the beach including chairs and towels were provided by the hosts. The location is centric and very walkable to all Ocean City, NJ has to offer including the beach, boardwalk, eateries and shops on Asbury. It was perfect spot for our short getaway. Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place to stay for our weekend getaway for Ocean City. The studio is walkable to the beach, boardwalk, and all the other amazing things OC has to offer. Lauren and Rich were wonderful to work with. When we had questions they responded quickly. Highly recommend staying here!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was everything we needed it to be. Super clean, very close to everything, quick beach access and parking was easy to find. Everything listed in the description was in the apartment (first aid kit was very helpful). I would 100% come back !! Lauren was very quick to respond and super helpful !!"

We loved everything about it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was awesome and what was described. The place was close and convenient to the boardwalk. While it’s not the biggest, it was enough for 2 people and perfect for people who were planning on spending their time doing stuff in ocean city."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at this unit. It's cozy and they have all the essentials for the beach. The unit is super close to broadwalk which makes it perfect. The bed might be a bit small if you are bigger person, but everything else was fine"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a two night mother/(adult) daughter stay at Lauren and Rich's to relive some of our memories of many vacays in OC in years gone by before she leaves for a military assignment (thank you, Lauren, for gifting us with a military discount which we weren't expecting but was certainly appreciated!). It was great being able to find a place that rents for less than a week. We love our week vacays in OC, but sometimes, you just need a couple of days. Great communication. The condo is cute, clean, well-thought out and lots of extras - we especially appreciated not having to pack sheets and towels and although we brought our own, there were even beach chairs, towels, umbrella available for guest use! Wonderful location - I enjoyed grabbing some coffee from OC Coffee and sitting on the beach in the early morning before the crowds. Thank you, Lauren and Rich for your warm hospitality!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best stays I’ve had! Everything was extremely clean and neat, the place looked new. It seemed a little smaller than anticipated when we first got there but everything was very well thought out and the space was utilized perfectly so it was really plenty of space for two of us. The hosts were so nice and responsive which was a big help. Lastly, the location was perfect. It was right near the boardwalk, parking lots, bike rentals, and other restaurants and cafes. I would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Communication was excellent, easy to check in, Great location!! We really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great little place in the center of ocean city! So clean and has everything we needed. Lauren was super responsive and helpful with any questions we had! Definitely recommend and look forward to staying there again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had such an amazing stay for the amount of time we were there at Ocean City NJ. We loved the area and how cutely decorated the space was! Felt right at home and was sad to leave on our last day.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very kind and thoughtful!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,such a cute place! i stayed with my 2 daughters for a couple of nights. can't beat the location- so close to the boardwalk and shops.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay!! Location was perfect and the studio was so cute and very clean.
Thanks you for having us, can't wait to go back!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Small but perfect for 2 nights with my 10 and 11 yr old girls
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little place! Very small, but well decorated, clean, and right off the boardwalk!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small room but perfect for weekend couple getaway. Close walk to the beach and restaurants. Lauren and Rich were very responsive to any questions. Place was clean and stocked with amenities such as beach chairs, towels, coffee, brita pitcher, etc. Thanks for being great hosts!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, clean, close to beach."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay here! The condo was very small but cozy and had everything that we needed. The location was perfect and we were able to find free parking right near the building. Maria was a very helpful and responsive host. We would definitely book this place again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy- close to beach- Ocean City is a dry city so keep that in mind- family oriented town. Don’t expect to party here- its solely for relaxation
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria was very pleasant to communicate with. she always provided us with plenty of options any time she responded to us.
great couples weekend getaway type place (we only did 1 night as we're ""locals"" and live pretty close to O.C.)
nice and clean, everything we could have needed was provided.
clear check-in/check-out instructions.
accommodating.
highly recommend if you want a clean, minimalist type beach stay."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very small condo right by the boardwalk. We arrived a bit prior to check-in which was allowed and no one was present, called front desk and got everything secured. Room was freezing and only has 2- 1/4 toilet paper rolls. We bought a pack of 4 and left for the condo. Construction was going on in building-started before 8 and lasted past 5. Very loud, many different types of tools. Was told post stay I should have mentioned something. As someone who has lived in a complex not sure there was much that could have been done vs given a warning pre booking. Internet was spotty mainly for TV. It was a complete blackout on Wednesday. Easy to clean, hostess fairly nice, again just often pushed blame onto myself for any issue vs anything else. I would probably stay elsewhere next time-not due to hostess but due to size of condo. When they small, they mean it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a nice stay at Maria’s place. She was easy to get in touch with and was accommodating. Would recommend her place.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria is very friendly, she responds quickly and reached out at the end of the trip to confirm everything went well."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"very cute space and the location is perfect, basically a block from the beach. I highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our second stay and we’ll be back for a third! Great location, excellent value, lovely host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay at Maria Evelyn's place. Our host was very responsive, kind, and proactive, and she was great to communicate with! The spot is as it is described and was very comfortable. It was clean and seemed well cared for. It was very easy to check in to the building (the unit is a small apartment in a larger building) and the staff at the reception desk was very kind. It is made clear that this is a small space.
You feel quite safe in the unit as other reviews mention: there is a lock pad to gain entry to the unit itself, and the exterior building doors are locked overnight, requiring use of the provided keycard to get inside. Free parking was easy to find in our off-season visit (early October).
The only reason I listed < 5 stars for $$ value rating is we felt the $85 cleaning fee was expensive for such a small unit. Aside from the higher cleaning fee, the price was definitely reasonable.
We enjoyed our short stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Marie Evelyn’s place for a weekend and had a great experience. The studio is located less than 3 minutes from the boardwalk and the beach. In addition, we were within walking distance to a ton of great places to eat. It was an especially hot weekend but the studio was cool and acted as our oasis during our exploration of the area. We appreciated the bottled water in the fridge, a bowl of snacks, coffee and a bathroom full of soaps, shampoos and lotions.
The studio had all the amenities from the kitchen area to a good sized TV which made the stay very comfortable. The place is quiet and we felt very secure due to the touch pad locking system at the front door and to the studio. Looking forward to using it again in the future.
Gloria and Dan Hennessey"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I paid more than like definitely too much. There’s an extra 85.00 charge. I assume because it was Labor Day weekend. It really was beyond what I think was reasonable.
The space is very compact. But I have to say. We slept extremely well. That was a very pleasant surprise."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Noisy place .upstairs unit was noisey late nite after 10 pm and noise started again 5:45 am .had a office work table which took up alot of unnessary space. Hallway smelled like smoke
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy. Close to the boardwalk. Only issue was parking. Had a great time and would definitely stay again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,place was great and so was maria!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Location was perfect and host was very helpful. We had no complaints!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Little smaller than I expected from the pictures maybe add the square feet to the description.
GREAT LOCATION!!!! right off the boardwalk and next 4-5 different breakfast spots
Acme is right up the street for grocery needs
Clean room and the host was very nice to work with!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a very nice stay at Maria's spot. The location is excellent. Al and Eric at front desk were friendly, accommodating, and helpful. Elevator/stairs were easy and convenient. Despite being in a busier, centrally located place, it was a very quiet spot. We appreciated how walkable everything was. The room itself is very small and cannot accommodate more than two people, but we went into it knowing that. It was very clean and cozy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had such an amazing stay at this place! It was clean and cozy. The boardwalk was a 5 minute walk away, and the neighborhood was safe as well. So much to do; you will never be bored. Maria was always incredibly responsive, kind, and accommodating to all questions I had. Would love to stay again, 10/10!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had an amazing time staying at maria’s place! will definitely be back again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well done. Older building but well kept. Compact but comfortable. Just what we needed and the desk clerks were great at helping with parking, restaurants and things to do and see. Owners were easy to contact.
Only one block from the beach and one lock to free parking on 7th street
We enjoyed ourselves"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were looking for something close by to where we needed to be and this was perfect. Maria was extremely communicative and helpful when needed.
Check in was easy and friendly. The space is VERY small/tight - but was exactly as it was described and served the purpose - 1 night stay - all you really need is a bed, shower etc. If you have a family/children - this would be a great place to stay location wise b/c it's literally steps from the boardwalk and amusements.
Marias place was CLEAN and that's my #1 priority - Thanks Maria!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome little spot. Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We can’t recommend this enough. We had a great stay. We love how close it was to everything! The beach was great! The space was just enough for us!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a place to step away from my busy life for a few days and Maria’s condo was exactly what I needed.
From the moment I rented her property, Maria was prompt to respond to messages and answered questions that I had.
The condo was lovely and when I opened the door to the space, the smell of clean laundry filled the air. Everything was clean and comfortable. The decor was great for a little shore point.
Location of the condo was perfect! It is close to renting bikes, getting a massage or a frozen snack. You can see the boardwalk from the front door of the property. I felt safe going to and from the condo.
There is a paid parking lot conveniently located next door but you can drive around to find a free spot if wanted.
All in all, I loved my stay at Maria’s place. I look forward to visiting again soon."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is an excellent place to stay for a couple. The proximity to parking and the boardwalk is fantastic. The unit is adorably decorated and well stocked with amenities. It is small but is perfectly designed to provide plenty of room for 2 people. We hope to stay there again when in Ocean City!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, Maria was a great host and the place was great too. It was clean, made well use of the space given, and checking in and out was easy and hassle-free. Instructions were clear, but, listing of the appearance of the condo was slightly misleading. The condo is much smaller than expected and with the way it is listed, it looks a lot bigger than it is. We were surprised when we entered the room to see how small it was, but Maria did make great use of the space that was there. Location is literally a 3 minute walk from the beach and there are lots of restaurants and other amenities within a walkable distance. Only other complaint is parking is difficult to find, but this isn’t Maria’s fault! You can pay per day to park or go a few streets down to find free local street parking. Maria was fast-to-respond, friendly, and clear in her instructions. Location was a great spot for 2 people and was a very fun trip! We would purchase from Maria again! Beach passes and chairs were awesome!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The condo was perfect for me and my husband. Short walk to the boardwalk and beach We would stay there again and recommend to everyone
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent location right by the heart of the boardwalk. Clean and cozy, but very small, like a studio apartment which is fine, just know that going into it.
Great front desk service and easy check in.
Shower in the back for sandy feet. Lots of great places to eat and shop a few block around the area.
Parking isn’t too bad, you may have to walk a few blocks but you’ll find something."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a cozy room. It was pretty small but it worked well for us two for a night! Very clean. The beach and boardwalk was not even 2 mins from the place so that’s perfect if you want something nice and close.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We felt that Maria Evelyn's accommodations were more than adequate. She makes great, efficient use of a her space. Checking in and checking out was seamless, and the location was excellent. Street parking was also available. I would surely come back here for a weekend stay."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was amazing. Would definitely recommend. Very comfy and cozy.
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The airbnb was much smaller than we had anticipated. We were also unaware that we had to pay $25.00 per day for parking in a public lot. There were so many decorations in a very tiny space which left little room for our suitcases and travel supplies. However, it was nice to have a small but functional ""kitchen"" space. The location was conveniently close to the boardwalk."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and will be back!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay! We were super close to the boardwalk which made going back and forth very easy! Maria was very responsive and helpful leading up to our stay so we had no worries and could enjoy our trip!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect small space for 2 people for a short stay and fantastic location!
Clean and quiet."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Very close to the beach and easy to navigate around once you figure it out! Very intimate room! Would stay again!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was smaller than I anticipated but still very nice. It’s extremely close to the main streets and boardwalk, making it easy to walk around and find things to do. The free street parking was easy to find and very close by, which was also very nice. Maria was very kind and responded quickly. The shower was confusing for warm water, it’s the opposite of most faucets so if you fully turn it you get cold water. The elevator for the building is also very small, so it can be hard to fit in with all your stuff and feel comfortable. Overall I was extremely satisfied with the stay, area, and host and would recommend this to anyone looking to stay in the area!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay and the best vacation, thank you!! The room was perfect for two, very cozy and clean!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Before arriving, Maria Evelyn was very helpful in figuring out what was needed to check in. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and it was a great atmosphere. The room was cozy with all amenities needed, many snacks and needed items are provided for the guests even though we didn’t use much of it.
Despite spending much of our time on the boardwalk, it was a nice room to relax in during the rain.
Absolutely would recommend and look forward to hopefully staying again in the future.
The price is INCREDIBLE for what you get. Perfect for a solo or two person trip!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is perfect for 2 individuals. Cozy, clean, comfortable and located very close to the board walk. It had all the basic amenities . For parking I used the lot next to the building, payment is usually a flat rate depending on the hours. The studio was worth the money spent, I’ll definitely be back in a few months."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I were very happy with our stay! We came for our anniversary and the room was very comfy and cozy. The location was within walking distance to the boardwalk and beach and we were surprised at how many stores were open during the offseason. Everything was wonderful and we would definitely love to come back again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time in Ocean City for the weekend. A wonderful location clean place. Nothing more you can ask for. Thank you.
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,Floor needs to be redone other than that it was just a little small very close to boardwalk

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room and location was nice. There were nice amenities and touches through out the space. Check in was an issue. We communicated to the host that we would arrive later but before the cutoff time. We were instructed to call a number before arriving. When we arrived, no one was available to let us in. We ended up waiting for other guests in the building to let us in. Make sure there is someone there to let you in before you arrive."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. The location is excellent and was walking distance from the beach/a lot of good restaurants. Would recommend.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cozy condo that was perfect for my husband and me. It was so close to the beach and boardwalk.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Maria Evelyn was a a great host and very easy to communicate with. Her place is literally within less than 5 minutes walk from the Ocean City Board Walk.

We highly recommend her place and will definitely rent from her again in the future. Thanks Maria!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful room! It was prime location less than a block from boardwalk. The host allowed me to check in early and was great in communicating with me. I appreciated the beach tag and chairs. The show pressure was also amazing! Very beautiful building & front desk staff was helpful and kind. I would definitely book again for longer stay next summer!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Maria was an excellent host! She had great communication and everything was exactly as the listing described. The location was perfect!

The location was fantastic and there were so many little touches that made it even better. Spacious mini fridge, coffee pods, creamer, and a chip/cookie bowl!! There was also a cute little table with benches to eat.
For a large building, the WiFi was great, and there were a ton of TV options like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc… We had access to beach tags and beach chairs, and for those that love a good after beach shower, the shower head was awesome 👌🏻
Shout out to Al who was super nice and helpful at the front desk!! We will definitely be back."

Maria Evelyn was a great host, answered questions in a timely manner. Parking could be challenging. There is free street parking a few streets away from the unit but we couldn’t find any spots. There is meters with a 4 hour limit. We parked in the lot next to the building for $20 every 24 hours. Great place and location!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This air bnb was great for a little getaway to OC. The location is perfect. It was easy to check in and get to the room. Anything we could have needed was in the room. My tip on parking. If you can’t find a free spot on the street, pay for a few hours some where and then move it once the crowds leave OC. I would definitely recommend staying here."

Maria has everything you could need in this smart efficiency condo. The front desk staff, Al and Eric, were both very cool and knowledgeable. We found free parking just a block and a half away on 7th and Atlantic so no worries there. Walking to and from the boards and beach was a breeze. Try Augie’s for breakfast on 9th and Atlantic, good food and nice staff. We will be back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful room!! Super close to the beach!! We loved our stay definitely will be back again!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Small but charming little spot that is a 2-minute walk from the boardwalk. Place is quiet during the nighttime and located within walking distance of several restaurants in town off the boardwalk – you won't need to worry about giving up your street parking however many blocks away you were able to park during your entire stay. Everything is as advertised, the beach chairs that are provided in the unit were quite comfortable."

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little AirBNB! Perfect for a couple wanting to get away. I definitely was taken aback by the size of the room, as it is small, but is detailed in the description of the place! I’m just a bad reader lol. It smelled divine too! Front desk help was absolutely stellar, and this spot is just steps from the beach and minutes from everything else! Only complaint I have and advice I’d give is MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CASH FOR THE TOLLS ON YOUR WAY IN AND OUT."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful spot! Exactly as described, close to the boardwalk. Great experience."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maria place is adorable.cozy and best location. Walk out the apartment building door and the boardwalk entrance is there. Comfortable bed, little kitchenette area is great and nice sized bathroom. The building is really neat and has some local history and easy check in and communication was a breeze. Enjoy all OC has to offer at this cute apartment"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This room is adorable and the location cannot be beat. Evelyn checked in just to be sure we were situated which I thought was so thoughtful. There is no doubt we will be back!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Maria Evelyn was a nice host ! OCNJ is my all time favorite place. The only thing is since we went to the beach out of season, there was no one at the front desk to check us in. But luckily a nice lady was there to help us. I’m sure if we contacted Maria, she could have given us the info we needed. But it was just easier to do it that way since the lady I think lived there year round and was right there. Great stay overall !"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We will be back thank you for everything!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and great value!

The location is fabulous literally steps from the boardwalk. The kitchen though small was very functional. I was able to make dinner for two several times with no problems. Almost everything I needed was already there (except can opener). We enjoyed our stay. We would book this room again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Lovely little studio - so close to the beach and other amenities. You also have ever you need within the unit and in case you have to work, the Wifi is strong. Maria Evelyn also made sure to reach out to see how everything was going. Very pleasant stay!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Charming little hotel room, turned into an efficiency apartment. The history of the building, a former luxury hotel built in 1929, gives these accommodations that much more charm and intrigue if you’re a history buff. The unit itself is small, probably best suited for one or two people (not a family) but has all the modern accommodations you would expect from an efficiency. Decorated nicely with a fun beach theme.
The host is wonderful. Very responsive, answered questions and assisted with check-in."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"omg the most cozy and quiet spot ever.
Beach is a few steps away from the place.
I was able to cook which I loved..
If you don't drive there is a bus that goes straight to AC.
I would absolutely book again.
Extremely clean met all our needs.
Beautiful place."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice little beach condo. Close to the beach and the board walk.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, literally down the street from the boardwalk. Everything that we needed to make ourselves at home was available, we were able to cook our own meals and relax. Would definitely recommend, thank you again to the host!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay right next to the beach great for the price!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maria’s place was in the perfect location! Right next to the boardwalk. The room is perfect for dropping your stuff and having a place to sleep and shower. Bed was very comfortable and had access to Netflix. The room is very small but has AC/heat, ceiling fan, small fridge, stove with pots and pans and microwave. The size of room didn’t bother me because we spent all day on the beach!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay here! Did a solo getaway and the place was all I needed for it. Very clean, cozy, and decorated cute! Lots of tv watching options, coffee in the AM, and toiletries. It’s great she has beach chairs for uses and the place is located 1 block from the boardwalk/beach! Great location! Maria is extremely responsive and answered me right away if I had any questions. Thanks for a freak stay Maria, I’ll be back!"
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was tiny and cute. The building and room was a little outdated.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Maria was an awesome host and we loved our stay at the apartment. It is a great location, very close to the boardwalk/ beach and a short walk to downtown ocean city. We would recommend this to any couple!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Private and perfect location to the boardwalk, shops in town and great restaurant's in OC! If you want to getaway with your significant other...this is the perfect place!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little spot. Close to everything. Clean and bright. We would definitely stay again.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Very cute room. Quaint, tiny, nicely decorated. New beach chairs and umbrella. Used one chair once. Kitchenette fairly impractical - didn't use it, as there was no real place to eat. Computer desk was a nice surprise, especially since I brought my laptop. Had to rearrange the furniture at night so I didn't bang into it if needing to use the bathroom in the dark. (<--that was a tricky feat) Steps to the boardwalk and beach - absolutely wonderful. The parking, however, was expensive. I stayed three nights, and parking overnight cost me $60; and I had to return every 24 hours to the parking lot to make sure I upped my time expiration. There is a closet for hanging clothing, but no place to put your folded clothing. Husband used the closet shelf; I'm short, that wouldn't work for me, so I used a window sill. The room was quite clean, having received a nice wipe down. Just a few spots were missed. Owner was immediately responsive to a minor need, and it was handled promptly (at 10:00 pm), even though it could have waited until the next morning. All in all, not a bad place."
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Glad we were able to book this close to our travel date. The stay was fine but it was in dated building (window air conditioner in room) and room was so small that it made us feel claustrophobic. Pretty much their is a bed, a tiny kitchette, small bathroom and almost no room to walk around the bed since it is so small. Location was good since it was close to boardwalk but the building and room were very underwhelming."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Maria's place is perfect for a quick stay. One person or a couple are ideal. Right next to the boardwalk/beach with accessibility to the bridges and plenty of stores. Cute and clean.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place, check in was simple, and location is great!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super cute! Close to beach and boardwalk! Very clean and comfortable!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Maria Evelyn was very communicative and made it really easy to check in and even get the beach tags before check in. The place was in the perfect location and I would definitely recommend.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Maria’s place! The room is small but had everything we needed. Maria was awesome at communicating. She got back to me within minutes whenever I messaged her and the people at the front desk were very helpful as well. Definitely would go back!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"PERFECT LOCATION!! One block from the beach/boards. Great for 2 people, and has absolutely everything you could need! Highly recommend."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time using Airbnb and we were not disappointed!! Maria was our host and was amazing, she was sure that we had everything we needed and even double checked with us! The room was perfect for me, my husband and our 18 month old, everything was very clean and taken care of. Check in was a breeze, and check out was even easier! We will definitely be trying to book this room again if it doesn’t book up so quick :)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent location! Staff was super welcoming and we felt safe in our building always. I’m a single mom so that’s important to me. We had a great time!!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location to the beach/boardwalk and very clean! Nice little get away!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"5 stars for location & convenience! This is a small Airbnb, but was perfect for us (mother/daughter trip) for a night or two at the beach. The studio was clean, well appointed, & would be great for a couple or a kid/parent type of trip. More than two people would have been uncomfortable, in my opinion. We did not cook or eat there, but the refrigerator was much appreciated!
We did not find any free parking around the condotel, however there is a lot right between the beach and the room - $15/day (24hrs) using the app. This worked really well for us as we didn’t need to move our car around and could drop our beach stuff off easily when we were finished with it. You really don’t need to drive once you’re there as everything seemed super accessible in this location.
I can’t stress enough how convenient the location is. We could easily go from beach to condo and back (stopping at the car on the way to leave chairs and beach bag). We really enjoyed our stay and would return. Thank you, Maria, for a much needed getaway!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Perfect for a weekend stay. Dana was super friendly. Check-in and check-out instructions were easy to follow.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was exactly what we were looking for after a night out and wanting to wake up at the beach, in a quiet neighborhood that we are very fond of, and have friends nearby."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very comfortable and in a safe neighborhood. It was very clean and the furnishings were very cute and functional. The place looked just as depicted. It was challenging for me to find the lock that had the key but Brad quickly responded and initiated a FaceTime to walk me through where to find it. It was nice to be able to borrow a beach chair and there were lots of beach towels in the unit (although I didn't use any). There were also bikes available to use, although I never got a chance to take advantage of it. They were also kind enough to let my son and his family use the unit in my place on the last day of my reservation. I flew home early so they could stay there. We were in town for a funeral and they would have had to stay elsewhere with family although there was barely enough room. They were happy to have a place to stay with their own space. It was also nice to have a parking space so close to the entrance. Minimal stairs was also a plus for someone my age :)"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice quiet place for a short stay. Appreciated being able to rent it for only one weekend night.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really great place to stay in OCNJ! Super cute, clean and very quiet and cozy in a beautiful part of town close to the boardwalk. Great layout and decor with everything you might need in the kitchenette, family room, bedroom and bathroom with beach gear available for use too. There were also some board games that we enjoyed while waiting out the rain. We appreciated the welcome book with detailed info as well as local recommendations. Tried the donuts from Browns- they were really great! Easy check in and out. Nice sitting area out front. Would love to stay here again. Thanks Dana!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay here! Dana is a friendly and thoughtful host, she left a basket of snacks and bottled water. The apartment is cute and cozy, in a very nice and quiet neighborhood, ""The Gardens."" Very nice linens and towels are provided, which was super convenient.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We really liked our stay here as a family of four! The bedroom is spacious so we could easily set up a pack and play and the mini toddler bed we brought with us. We really appreciated the beach towels and use of the wagon - it was so appreciated! The neighborhood is quiet but just a short drive or bike ride away from most things. Highly recommend!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Close to beaches, restaurants and shops. We did drive to the beach, but definitely accessible by walking or riding a bike. The beach tags, chairs and wagon were a very nice bonus offered by the host. Clean and comfortable stay!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place. It is well organized, clean, and a nice location. The ceilings are low in places. I am 6'3"" and had to duck in a couple places so as not to hit my head. It didn't detract from enjoying our stay."

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dana’s place is quaint and sequestered in a quiet part of OC, a five-minute drive from the boardwalk and main “downtown.”
There’s a great beach not too far away (we drove, but you could bike).
Dana was super responsive and accommodating to our *multiple* changes to travel dates, and our request for room heaters the first night. (It was a chilly 49 degrees outside!)
Overall, the place was perfect for our two-night stay.
Thanks, Dana!
PS. Check out Dana’s recommendations. For breakfast, Hooked on Breakfast is a must!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Attended a childhood friend's wedding at OC yacht club this past weekend and Dana's listing was a few minutes walk. They had parking, bikes, and beach gear available for use. The house itself was clean, and very comfortable. Would definitely book here again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dana is great! She left out the beach tags and supplies for us when we arrived earlier than check-in so we could hit the beach before checking in. She left a great binder of helpful local tips. The beach supplies and bike were a great plus & the home was clean & well stocked.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Delightful stay. Met all of our needs. Handy beach cart and beach chairs were great to have. Great location.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dana’s place was just perfect for my family’s (2 adults, 2 toddlers, and an infant) quick beach getaway! We only stayed 2 nights and were out of the apartment most of the time so we didn’t need a ton of space. The kids shared the bedroom as my husband and I took the pull-out couch. Everything was clean and just as described in the listing description. We walked to the beach (about a 10 minute walk) that Dana recommended in the welcome package and it was amazing! Not as crowded as the boardwalk beaches as Dana mentions. Ice cream is only a ten minute walk as well. We didn’t utilize the bikes as we have 3 small children but the beach wagon and beach toys were a much appreciated and enjoyed addition. We had an amazing time and would definitely recommend this listing!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a great week in Ocean City. Dana, the owner, is very nice and she takes care of these customers. The apartment is welcoming and comfortable. I recommend this place"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Dana was super helpful throughout our stay and her place is super cute! It was spacious, clean and close to the beach and boardwalk! Highly reccomend taking the bikes out for a ride in the area. There's tons to explore in locally."

I recommend to anyone who want to have a great time in OceanCity!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family loved our stay at Dana's! There was plenty of space for the four of us (2 adults, 2 children). It was a great location, very clean, and had everything we needed. Dana so kind and helpful upon arrival and was very quick to respond when we had questions during our stay. We would absolutely love to stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dana's place was absolutely amazing. Great location! So clean! We will most definitely be visiting again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay. It was clean and the hosts were easy to communicate with and flexible and nice.
They made a recommendation for a coffee shop for us and we liked both of the places they suggested.
The neighborhood is cute and it's nice to look out at the bay from a block away."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to stay to enjoy some quiet beach time. The house is very clean and Dana is super accommodating . When we arrived there was one window AC unit & the temp inside was 84. I emailed Dana & she brought down another unit right away. The temp inside was then very comfortable. Sheets & towels are provided as well as beach tags, chairs, boogie boards, & bikes. I would definitely stay here again & highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you so much Dana, I enjoyed my short stay!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place close enough to everything but far enough to enjoy peace and quiet. Host is very responsive and thought of everything in this place!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I took my parents to Dana’s place for 3 days, 2 nights - it was perfect for 4 people. Dana was very thoughtful, communicative, and kind. The location is peaceful and quiet, perfect for a relaxing getaway! We enjoyed using the bikes each morning. I highly recommend this stay. I am so grateful for my time at Dana’s!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay !
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home with everything you could need to enjoy the beach town! Dana was very sweet and was quick to respond to any questions my group had. Would recommend to anyone looking for a little getaway!

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The suite was wonderfully spacious and everything was set up for an easy and relaxing vacation. Dana was very accommodating to my group and staying there really felt like everything was set up for us to have a seamless experience. I would definitely stay here again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dana was a great host. The apartment is in a great area and she makes the visit very comfortable.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very clean, nice condo in Ocean City, NJ. Excellent location if you want to be in a quieter part of town and able to get away from the craziness of the boardwalk at times. 5 min bike ride to north end of boardwalk. We drove to the beach, but could probably bike to the north beaches in 5 min, too. Large bedroom with queen bed, comfortable large fold-out couch in living room. Bathroom is small, but clean. Kitchen was a little sparsely furnished (only 5 plates, 5 mugs, 5 glasses, no bowls, no pans for oven). Several pans for stove top and trays to make ice cubes were provided. Dana was very helpful when I reached out to her asking about a can opener and sharp knife. She lives above the rental and came right down with these things! Fridge is small (larger then dorm size, but not full size) and my eggs and veggies froze in the back. Three bikes were provided, and Dana offered her own bike if we needed four! The porch was peaceful and quiet in the mornings. I highly recommend this rental for two adults and two children or 3 adults. It is small, but also very reasonably priced and Dana was a very attentive and responsive host."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dana was so very helpful thru the whole process after booking, checking in & out. The accommodations were great - adorable 1 bedroom cottage with a porch with direct views of the lagoon & bay! The porch was so lovely in the morning & evening. The bikes with locks were helpful for local adventures. Everything was great!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great spot to stay in OC! Very accommodating for 3 adults and my 2 month old son. Plenty of room for his bassinet and it was very clean! We really enjoyed it here!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for us, and Dana and team were fantastic! They thought of all the little things (including real half and half for my coffee!!) and even had the place decorated for the holiday. It was comfortable and well-appointed, and the location was ideal—close to everything! We really appreciate how responsive and attentive the hosts were and will definitely stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stay for a couple! No problems! This property had bikes and beach items available for you. It also came with beach tags.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very responsive and friendly. She reached out before check in and a couple of times during our stay. She was quick to accomodate us if we were in need of anything. Everything was exactly as described. The place was quite charming, even as a family of four it worked out well. Very nice, professional and excellent host."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was a clean, cozy place for our 3day stay."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay for a get away!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent communication and cute little place!!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay with Dana was great! Communication was consistent throughout the entire process - if I asked a question, Dana got back to me within a reasonable amount of time. The place was clean and comfortable. The location was perfect for what we needed - a place to stay while visiting with family and friends who were located in Longport. The rest of this review is probably only relevant if you’re traveling with a little one: There is a mini fridge, so perfect for sleeping snacks and milk. you can’t get to the bathroom without going through the bedroom. the bathroom does have a tub, which is great for bath time with little ones. we brought our dome drain cover and bath time was a breeze. the bedroom is big enough to fit a pack n play + slumber pod and you can still maneuver around comfortably. the bedroom is still pretty bright even at night, so travel blackout curtains are a must bring. the door to the bedroom was kind of harder to open and close quietly, so made it tricky for sneaking in to get to the bathroom while little one was sleeping and my husband and I were hanging out in the living area. but at least you’re not trapped in the same room as a sleeping little one all night. all in all this place was great and the ideal set up for traveling with a little one that goes to bed super early. Oh and there were chairs on the front porch - we would’ve used that to hang out at night but the weather was too cool at night during this stay. Would definitely consider staying here again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My best friend and I had an amazing 2-night stay in this Ocean City, NJ suite. Clean, well-stocked, and cute! I stayed on the pull out sofa, which was very comfy! The bedroom was very spacious, too. Towels (beach and bath) were provided, as were shampoo, conditioner, soaps, paper towels, toilet paper, kitchen essentials, beach chairs, bikes, and beach tags. The location is amazing!! Gorgeous, safe, clean, quiet neighborhood - perfect for enjoying the area. I recommend taking Surf Road to the beach access area there. This is a 2-minute car ride (free street parking) or a peaceful, 4-minute bike ride through quaint neighborhoods (easy ride!) I enjoyed early mornings on the beach, which was practically empty! For brunch, I recommend Dockside Kitchen and Jon & Patty's (downtown). Rojo's Tacos was also amazing! I would definitely come back to Dana's place. She was hospitable and friendly. Very responsive to all my questions as well! Highly recommend! Great trip!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a quiet, private, and serene stay, look no further than Dana’s home. You truly feel like a local here, with the beach minutes away in a beautiful residential neighborhood on the very northern end of OC. We have been coming to OCNJ for over 30 years and this was our first time exploring this end of the island. The beaches are less than 5 minutes away and are more beautiful and natural with jettys and a view of AC while the surfers come out at high tide. Dana provides everything you need for a relaxing stay. She is so easy to communicate and shares her love of OC with suggestions and resources to fully enjoy your vacation. Plus the bay is 2 blocks away—beautiful sunsets! Had an absolutely wonderful time!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Short stay. Place was great. Communication was on point and accommodations were made on behalf of the owner which were very much appreciated. Would definitely stay again.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay with Dana was amazing. It was hard for my family and I to leave. It’s so cute and cozy and you feel right at home.

Thank you, Morgan!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beach bungalow totally matches its name! Cute and cozy. I loved the decor and felt very at home. Close to the beach/boardwalk for my morning coffee and walk on the beach, and just a short stroll to the shops and restaurants on Asbury Ave. For a single person or couple, this is a great place, and I would definitely stay again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for the Doo Dah weekend and it was the ideal location. It was extremely close to the boardwalk and easy walking distance to Asbury Ave. It was like a home away from home with everything needed provided and such a relaxing, comfy place. Although I was solo, Morgan goes out of the way to ensure that it’s very family friendly. I would DEFINITELY stay here again and recommend it to anyone who wants an ideal location. Thank you Morgan! 😁❤️"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location and size for a 2 person getaway! Walkable to boardwalk and shops of Asbury. Morgan was a great host and we would stay again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were soooo excited to fiinally see the beach and we were so much closer than we expected ( that was good for my husband and cane walking :) ) the only thing that we have to say negative is that we were not happy with the April Fools joke of this terrible rain storm HAHAHAHA) but hope to come back again sometime as the roads were flooding and our trip ended early. Morgan was very patient with our questions and very helpful when we reached out. She's a wonderful Super host!!! Highly recommended !

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect relaxing weekend getaway! We loved being there on the off season and enjoyed the convenience of walking to the boardwalk and beach and the quiet. Could not ask for a better location. Morgan’s bungalow offered everything we needed. We loved it!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Morgan’s place over the weekend for our 1 year wedding anniversary, and would definitely stay here again!
The apartment was exactly as described and even though it was the winter we were able to walk the boardwalk and found plenty of close places to eat. The apartment is steps from the beach/boardwalk, great for walking to see sunrise and sunsets ! It’s the first time I’ve stayed at an air BNB with a really comfortable bed and got a restful night sleep!
Morgan’s place also had all the amenities she listed and plenty of extras in case you forgot to pack things. I would definitely recommend!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved staying here! Super cute and clean space that is easily walkable or a short drive to just about everything! Perfect for an off season getaway! Will definitely return or look into Morgan’s other listings!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and exactly as pictured.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Morgan’s place was very clean and we enjoyed our stay. I would suggest having better/stronger bathroom tissue and an upgrade to a higher toilet. Other than that, everything was great. It felt like home."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Beach Bungalow is exactly as described, cute, cozy and clean.
Just steps to the beach and boards, the location was great.
And, the bed was extremely comfortable!
I'll definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was the perfect place to stay during my time in Ocean City. I stayed during the off-season, so I am not sure what the noise level is like with the water park during the summer. I imagine it would be super convenient for families!! :)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband & I stayed at the Beach Bungalow for our Babymoon last week and it was honestly everything we hoped for and more! The Bungalow is walking distance to the boardwalk, and even though it's off season, we had such a great time -- we actually really appreciated that it wasn't busy and it seemed we were the only ones in the building of the Bungalow (which was great since we really wanted peace and quiet). Even though there was a mishap with the bed frame in the bedroom, our stay here was exceptional! I contacted Morgan the next morning and she was very responsive, friendly, and extremely accommodating. She took care of the issue right away and I can't thank her enough for it. I can honestly say that our stay was top-tier because of her. My husband & I still talk about how amazing our stay was in Ocean City. We're even planning for our next visit and will definitely be staying at one of Morgan's listings again. 100% recommend staying here any time of the year!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This beach bungalow definitely felt like home away from home. It was our first time visiting Ocean City, New Jersey and it was fabulous!

Everything about this beach bungalow is perfect and I highly recommend this bungalow for anyone who wants to be a couple steps from the boardwalk & beach. :)"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All was as advertised. Great location. Would stay again. And plan to in the spring. Tim & Freddie

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you’re looking for the perfect retreat, this is your spot. From the host to the atmosphere, my expectations were surpassed. This was my wife’s first vacation and solo trip and it is safe to say she was thrilled! We found everything we needed, from a cozy blanket down to mugs and even beach chairs! She spent her time taking leisure walks and relaxing in front of the tv or watching the sunsets. The light that goes in through the windows in the mornings is immaculate and you feel right at home while in another world. The decor and the little details in colors made it all even better. Thank you Morgan for a great experience."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful visit and loved the location! Morgan was responsive and the house was just as advertised.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was beautiful and very accurate to the photos. Morgan was very responsive with questions and she even provided some favorites at the beach. It was nice that she provided a small list of the many things that are at the boardwalk. Morgan also provided information about what was happening locally. We were there during their block party event and Morgan made sure to notify us what is was and where it was. Everything was GREAT!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, a bit smaller than anticipated and came with a few more rules/choirs than I’m use too. Overall though it was a great stay for price! Location in a rock throw from the boardwalk so can’t beat that!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Morgan’s place was super cute and exactly our style. Had everything we needed as a family of four for the weekend. Loves how easy it was to walk onto the boardwalk. Would love to come back again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy and very clean. Comfy bed. Linens included. Perfect for a few days of boardwalk or beach or just nice walking areas. Morgan was very friendly and helpful!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From my first interaction with Morgan I knew our experience would be first rate! The beach bungalow was everything we hoped for! Walking in the front door we were immediately greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. Bright, clean, cozy and decorated beautifully. Morgan’s attention to detail was greatly appreciated as she provided everything we could possibly need, even a hairdryer! Located on a quiet street and literally a few steps from the beach and boardwalk, the bungalow is an excellent place for a relaxing and peaceful getaway. We are looking forward to planning our next trip! Thank you so much Morgan!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Morgan’s place and we loved it! Such a cute get away and perfect for a couple, added touches from the first time and it looks great. Highly recommend and look forward to maybe trying out some of her other places ….. super clean!!!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay. Perfect location.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This bungalow was worth every penny!
The space was cozy and thoughtfully organized. The location is literally steps from the boardwalk which made beach/boardwalk trips effortless.
Morgan was responsive , flexible, and incredibly accommodating. She would check in to make sure we had everything we needed, provided prompt responses to any questions, and even mailed us back some toys our toddler left behind !
We are hoping to book this location again next year ! Thank you Morgan !"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location and very nice place! It was perfect for me, my husband and our baby. We loved the fact that it was on the ground floor for the convenience of our stroller. Very close to the boardwalk and beach. When I had any questions, Morgan was very friendly and responsive! Thanks for the memories of our first family vacation!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the best experience from the moment I booked to when we finished our great vacation. Morgan’s communication and assurance to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay was above and beyond, more than we could have asked for. She has such attention to detail to the service she provides, with added touches to make you feel welcome as soon as you enter the home. The home was at a great location with everything we needed nearby. I would highly recommend renting this property and any other property from Morgan."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Morgan’s beach bungalow is a fantastic place to stay because it is clean, cozy, and close to the boardwalk!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The beach bungalow was perfect! Great location, super quick walk to boardwalk/beach. The window unit cooled the apartment very well . Everything was clean and comfortable. The clothesline for beach stuff was great and the outdoor shower for rinsing off could not have been more convenient. I've stayed at a few Airbnb's in ocnj, but this was by far the best. Unfortunately, I ran into an unforseen issue and had to leave a couple days early, but Morgan could not have been more friendly and sweet. I would definitely recommend staying at the beach bungalow!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had an amazing stay! The house was right by the beach and boardwalk. It was clean and cozy and worked well for us as a couple with a one year old.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved our stay! The Beach Bungalow was cozy and a great location! Morgan is an excellent host.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This beach bungalow is a home away from home. We had a great time this week. The location is perfect. The house is exactly as described & extremely clean. I will absolutely be booking there again soon. Morgan is a delight to work with. ❤️
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We couldn’t have had a better experience at the Beach Bungalow. It is just as pictured and described, the location is perfect, and Morgan is an incredible host. We will be back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The main reason to rent this place is the location and the guaranteed parking spot. Within view of the boardwalk, it's so convenient. Place was nicely decorated and exactly as shown in the photos. However, it's only a few feet away from the back fence line where the water park's lounging section will be in full swing all summer. My mom slept in the bedroom and I slept on the pull out sofa with my toddler. The living room desperately needs an overhead fan and its own window air conditioner or a mini-split. Sofa bed is flimsy and uncomfortable for an adult. The place will be hard too cool in summer with only 1 unit in the bedroom that needs cleaning (filter). Expect to move dangerous and breakable decor/objects if you bring a child. Opened back window for more airflow, but window is old and felt like it might fall out of the framing. Used kitchen and bathroom fans for more airflow, too. I'd only recommend this rental for the off-season for the aforementioned reasons."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not sure how many times we've stayed with Morgan at this point, but there's a reason we keep coming back - reasonable rates, fantastic location, and a beautiful, well kept space that feels both honey and beachy.

It is very clean and very walkable to the boardwalk. We especially love that most amenities you find at a hotel are included (toiletries, towels, sheets, etc.). It’s one less thing to worry about especially when traveling with young kiddos. Thanks again for a great stay!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Morgan's place is a gem! This was perfect for our family to enjoy the beach in the off-season. The location is amazing.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place for two for a friend’s wedding nearby. The area was extremely quiet and inactive in March due to the off-season and colder temperatures. That made for a peaceful getaway. Restaurants nearby were great and the area is very walkable.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Beach Bungalow was adorable, almost exactly as pictured! Very walkable; we went in January so it was quite peaceful. Summer guests should know that it is RIGHT by the waterpark and although there are window shades, noise could be a problem.
Morgan's welcome packet was thorough and easy to understand, and there were plenty of opportunities to communicate. Great stay!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my weekend at the Beach Bungalow! The space was exactly as pictured, it was beautiful, clean and comfortable, I felt at home right away. I really appreciated the linens and towels being there so I didn’t have to bring any. I loved that the location was very convenient to walk to the beach, boardwalk and downtown areas. Morgan’s communication before, during and after my stay was really helpful and she was also very responsive to my questions. I hope to stay here again or at one of her other properties in the future!"

She is indeed a Superhost."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The beach bungalow was just as it was shown in the pictures and as it was described. The location is within walking distance to many businesses and it comes with a private parking space. We were very pleased and comfortable with our stay. It felt like “home” as soon as we arrived.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,N/a
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was beautiful, clean, and a great value. When some weather-related issues arose due to the intense cold after our first evening, Morgan was immediately responsive and helpful, showing up with coffee and ultimately offering us with the option to move to another of her nearby properties (which we did). She went above and beyond (and on a holiday, too!), and I would happily stay again at either one of the two properties we got to stay at."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is our second stay at one of Morgan's properties in OC and it was great. Morgan's place was super clean and had everything needed for my husband and I and our infant son. Super quiet (off-season) and easy to get around. Can't wait to come back to this one or any of Morgan's properties!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Beach Bungalow is a perfect getaway. It's centrally located near stores, restaurants, and steps from the beach."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend. The location was incredible, steps to the boardwalk. The condo was very clean and welcoming.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice stay! You won’t get a better location in OC - right by the boardwalk, walking distance to downtown. Thanks Morgan for a great stay!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Morgan was an absolutely wonderful host. I desperately needed a few days away at one of my favorite places and this little getaway spot did not disappoint. The pictures were exactly what the home looked like. Everything was clean and ready for my arrival. I will definitely be taking more trips to Morgan’s homes.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Morgan’s place! It was perfect for what we needed! We went in the off season so there wasn’t as much activity on the boardwalk but her place is just steps away from it so I’m sure it’s wonderful in the summer! Everything was clean, as advertised, and she was VERY quick to respond to texts!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Morgan has done a wonderful job at creating a beautiful space minutes away from... Everything! The boardwalk is right there, you can hear the ocean as you walk into the apartment, and downtown is a quick walk away for some coffee and breakfast.
Morgan is a gracious host. We brought our infant son for a weekend with his grandparents and the apartment was very baby-friendly.
Overall, this has been one of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve had the pleasure of staying at! The space is clean and honestly, just very beautifully and intricately decorated. We were thrilled!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful clean and quiet 2min walk to the board walk would definitely stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful time at the beach and it was made even more enjoyable by the location, the ease, and the thoroughness of how Morgan has set everything up.
Anything I had a question about was because I didn’t read her information carefully enough. She has thought of everything and I will absolutely be booking again. Thank you Morgan!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a few days in October and The Beach Bungalow is perfectly located about a minute’s walk from the boardwalk so it’s a short walk back and forth to the beach as well. The entire bungalow was very clean and appeared to be recently remodeled. The price is right and we were very happy to discover this place in our favorite beach town.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our 2 night, 3 day stay in Morgan’s Beach Bungalow. Her condo is small but she uses the space creatively. There’s a place for everything to be stored making it neat and tidy. It was clean (which is a top priority for us) and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable and so was the sofa bed!
We had a great time and we will definitely come back again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location near boardwalk. Very clean. Can’t wait to visit next year.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Morgan's bungalow is well equipped and a very pleasant place to stay when visiting Ocean City NJ. It is very close to the boardwalk.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Despite the fact that I managed to book a beach trip on some of the rainiest days possible, I had a great time in the Beach Bungalow. It’s less than a block from the beach, so it was easy to run back if I was a little too damp. The apartment is cozy, clean and comfortable. You really can’t beat sitting in front of the electric fire after a busy day out. Morgan is super responsive and very helpful—I would definitely book with her again for a future OCNJ trip!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This condo has great accessibility to the boardwalk! Morgan thought out so many details in putting the place together that makes it very comfortable and homey! Everything was exactly as described.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! would return!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our 4th stay with Morgan at her beach bungalow and once again it was great. We will be back again. It’s almost like our second home away from home. Doesn’t get better than this.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love the Beach Bungalow! It is the perfect spot for a family with a young toddler or two. The beach and the boardwalk are right on the other side of the waterpark, so it's easy to make small trips back and forth during the day. The house is stocked with everything you may need from cookware to a Keurig. Highly recommend for young families who want an easy beach vacation!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Morgan was a great host who was communicative throughout our stay. Location was great and the bungalow was beautifully decorated and cozy.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for such an awesome stay. We really enjoyed your space and I’m going to steal a few of your ideas with the really clever maps and handouts you provided. Such as chic and awesome location! We’ll be back
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Would definitely recommend this place for a small family - super cute and perfect location if you love spending your days at the beach/boardwalk without the bother of driving/parking.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Morgan provided everything we needed for our stay. Her communication was timely and concise. The bungalow is comfortable and beautifully decorated. Location is ideal, so close to the boardwalk and guarded beaches. It was peaceful in the evenings, very quiet. we had a fantastic week!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have zero complaints about staying here and would absolutely stay here again. There were so many accommodations that were thoughtful (coffee was provided, plenty of sheets and towels, fully supplied kitchen). Morgan was easy to get in touch with for any questions and provided a helpful guide to the condo and our stay. The location was right by the boardwalk and beach, which we loved! Overall a fantastic stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Beach Bungalow was very clean and well put together. Being able to walk to the beach at any given moment is awesome. There’s tons of restaurants and stores within walking or short driving distance which made our stay super convenient. The one thing to note is it is right next next to an event venue that the water park uses sometimes. During our week stay there was 2 events, one with a DJ and loudspeaker and the second one which made no additional noise or anything so we didn’t even know it was happening. Obviously the host doesn’t have control over that and that’s one of the choices you make when you choose to stay at a condo in the heart of OC so we still gave 5 stars. Morgan was also very attentive to any questions or concerns we had and usually replied within just a few minutes. We will definitely be considering the Beach Bungalow as a spot we would return to next time we come back to the beach."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very stylish, comfortable, and convenient place mere steps from the boardwalk and beach. We enjoyed it!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and great value! We would definitely stay here again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Morgan's ""OC Beach Bungalow"" made for a dream vacation! It could not be in a more convenient location and the cottage is filled with joyful designer touches. Thank you, Morgan, for providing such a great getaway spot at the shore!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location just a short stroll from the boardwalk. My little one loved looking at all of the shops and exploring the beach. Very clean and cozy place!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Morgan’s beach bungalow was perfect size for our family of 4 and amazing location, just a half block from the boardwalk and beach. The place was stocked with everything we needed."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for anyone looking for a little beach getaway! The home is beautiful, very clean and yes literally just a short walk to the beach. Our host was excellent and answered any questions we had clearly and in a timely manner. We enjoyed being able to use the little kitchen as well. So if you are looking for a nice little place right off the boardwalk this is the spot! I will definitely be recommending this place to any friends or family looking for a vacation spot! Hope to come back again"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Beach Bungalow is such a treasure. The place itself is impeccably clean and beautifully decorated. The space is the perfect size for our family of 3, but I could easily see fitting more comfortably - we don't even use the sofa bed. All of that being said, probably the best part of the place is the amazing location. A 3 minute walk to the beach and maybe 7 minutes to Wonderland Pier (not to mention all of the other great shops and stores on the boardwalk on that end).
We've been lucky enough to stay at the Bungalow 3 times now, and I predict it will be our go-to for many years to come.
Thanks for everything Morgan!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Beach Bungalow was clean and cozy! We appreciated the convenient location to the beach and boardwalk!! Thanks Morgan!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fiancé and I stayed here in May (before beach season) as a little getaway and we had a great time.

Thank you for having us Morgan!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Morgan is super easy to deal with, she contacts you enough to know she is there if you have any questions but not so much that you feel smothered. The bungalow is steps from the boardwalk and music pier and only a few blocks from the center of town. It was so nice to park the car and just walk everywhere.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love Morgan's place! The location is amazing and less than half a block from the beach and close to a water park (but minimal noise). It's so cutely appointed, and though the place is not that large, the space is very well used. Morgan was great at communicating with us.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location right by the boardwalk! The airbnb itself is compact but has everything you need, including a very comfortable queen size bed. Laura was quick to respond to all our questions and went above and beyond to fix a small issue we had during our stay. Would highly recommend!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect Airbnb for our mini vacation. My daughter and I had a wonderful time, and Laura’s room added to it. The room was neat and tidy, the location is within sight of the boardwalk, and Laura and the on-site manager, Al, were great in terms of communication and assistance. A lovely place to stay in OC!"

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was just as expected and pictured. Plenty of space for two of us for a long weekend. The bathroom was large for such a small room, which was great. Can’t beat the location! Parking is always a hassle in OC, so that was a pain as always. Everything was very clean."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a blessed stay! Homey & Cozy! Convenient location!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing trip and love the room and location. Laura and the staff we're very friendly, helpful, and responsive. We are already talking about coming back!"

Less than a block away from the boardwalk and beach with lots of places to eat within walking distance. We were able to find free parking within a few blocks which was great. The room is the perfect size for two and has everything we needed. Laura was a great host and communicated with us, as well as was able to give us an earlier check-in time as well as a later check-out. Will definitely be staying again in the future!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is amazing, and Laura is equally as amazing. You won't be disappointed with this getaway by the sea. It's impossible to be here and not let your troubles wash away."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Aimee's place! I stayed with my husband, toddler, and my dog. We loved that the condo was close enough to the beach and boardwalk to be walkable for a toddler and we majorly appreciated that all the beach essentials (cart, umbrella, chairs) were provided. . We had everything we needed inside as well- sheets, towels, soap, coffee. The location is on a quieter side of OCNJ, so we didn't have to fight for a spot at the beach It was also so great to be able to bring my dog along- that was another huge plus. All in all, our weekend trip was easy and relaxing, thanks to all of the above accommodations! We will definitely make an effort to return soon! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I love this particular section of Ocean City, and the space was super clean and neat. It was nice that the pictures matched exactly what we experienced. I loved being so close to the beach, too!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were very happy to find Aimee's rental for our stay in OC. The space was clean and cheerful, perfect for 2 adults and our dog Brody. The rental had all the amenities we needed and everything worked great. We also appreciated the availability of boogie boards, beach chairs and beach umbrellas since we prefer to pack light. We enjoy running on the boardwalk every morning so being so close to the boardwalk and beach was such a perk. You really can't beat the location.
Aimee is the best at communicating information and reaching out so we knew she was available should we have questions or need help. We will definitely rent from Aimee again and would highly recommend a stay here."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location and value for a small family!
I stayed at Aimee's condo with my husband, our baby, and our dog. The location really could not be beat – a half block from the beach, at the quieter north end of the boardwalk. The front porch was lovely, we spent lots of time out there, and appreciated the outdoor shower as well. The condo was clean and equipped with everything we needed. It is small, but for our family it was all the space we needed, and a good value.
Aimee was easy to communicate with, responded quickly and was very kind. We had a wonderful time, thank you Aimee!"

We enjoyed having the balcony to sit out on and it was great for the dog also.
A block from the beach was very convenient and it is in a nice quiet location. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this cute condo."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A very convenient place to spend time in Ocean City, NJ! Aimee was a great host - very easy to communicate with. The apartment is clean and has a wonderful front porch. The kitchen has the essentials for cooking and a large refrigerator. Parking is on the street and spots can be tough to find, especially on the weekends. We lucked out with one in front of the building and Ubered and walked everywhere. It's a family-friendly (dry) town with a lot of people out walking and riding bikes. It is very close to the local beach and the boardwalk (neither of which allows dogs, so plan accordingly if you're bringing your pet along). We had great fun with our dog at Malibu Dog Beach (2 miles away). Best find: Browns on the boardwalk for fresh (warm) cinnamon donuts in the morning!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time. The location was great and our family enjoyed the week!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really clean with windows that open if one doesn't want to use the A/C. This is great. The location is hard to beat in the less heavily travelled north end and the neighbors were friendly. We are OC goers since the late 90's and have stayed almost everywhere in every kind of accommodation; the value of Amiee's place on Corinthian is superior.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super host! Apartment and location were great as described! So close to the beach! Any question we had Aimee responded promptly. She even let us check in a little earlier! The apartment was very clean and has everything you need! We loved the outdoor shower especially.
Thanks again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, short walk to the beach and to the board walk. As described, cute and comfortable spot. Love having the deck out front and the shower in the back!
Just know that if you're using the couch bed, that it may limit space to move around the living room / hall (bc you need to move kitchen table), but it's no trouble if you open and close after using it at night. It was easy to set up."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cllse to the beach, beautiful neighborhood. Host was accessible. I had a great time."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Conveniently located, small apartment. We had a great stay at Aimee's place.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aimee's place is in an awesome location - just north of Wonderland near a quiet section of the beach. About a ten minute walk down to the busy stuff.

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aimees place was an amazing location. Very quiet and only a minute away from the beach. The apartment is great for two couples.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed at Laura’s place for a quick mini-moon after our wedding and everything was fantastic! We were able to check in early (although was never promised going into the season) & she let us check out late since we were only staying one night (again, not expected but appreciated). The place is perfect for a little couple getaway and is a short walk to the beach, restaurants and boardwalk! Laura was communicative and sent all information we would need ahead of time. Would definitely recommend staying at Laura’s place!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolute GEM!

Wonderful overall, and will definitely be back here if possible!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cozy little place! Despite the weather not cooperating, the room had everything needed and it was all clearly listed ahead of time. It was wonderful and so clean! Great home away from home for a short vacation!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a few different obstacles when it came to staying at this Airbnb. Not because of the place, but because of our own personal detours. Laura worked with my daughter and I in the most special way to help make our Mama/daughter trip the most amazing time. I can’t recommend this little perfect place enough. It’s everything we were hoping for! My sweet girl (9years) took the time to thank the whole place for helping her have the best time ever!"

So much to love."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I spent this past weekend in Laura's condo. It was small but just perfect for 2 people. Laura was the BEST communicator and offered both early check in and late check out. The room was decorated perfectly and we immediately felt like we were on vacation when we stepped into the space. Bed was a dream! It was hard to get up the 1st morning bc we were so comfortable. Views of the waves and ever- changing colors of the ocean water & sky. We couldn't have asked for more! You must try Jon & Patty's on Asbury for breakfast or lunch. They were our favorite! Thank you again, Laura! We can't wait to come back! A+++"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful weekend all because of Laura’s place and her helpful personality! Such a responsive host and truly so kind!

Laura was amazing and communicated promptly and proactively. Upon entering the building, I was greeted with a cheery hello, and things only got better from there. The bed was extremely comfortable, view of the ocean was amazing, and the entire unit was so very clean. 100% would recommend staying here! I know I’ll be back!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laura is a great host. Her apt. while tiny uses the space well and provides the essentials. making beach towels badges and chairs part of the rental makes a beach getaway easy.

Laura was a wonderful host, very accommodating and attentive. Looking forward to staying here again in the future!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura’s attention to details raised what I knew would be an enjoyable stay to another level. Brita water pitcher in the refrigerator was a welcome addition for hot summer days, Keurig coffee maker complete with Kcups and shelf-stable half and half was a home run. Laura came to my rescue via text as my door locking skills were lacking - felt so silly, Laura was extremely kind and gracious. Laura’s unit is fully equipped and it’s location ensures a memorable OC beach vacation."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Laura’s place, and it was just as good as the first. Clean, comfortable, and close to everything. Laura has thought of every little detail, which made our stay so great."

would absolutely book this again"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My mom and I stayed at Laura's place for 2 days and 1 night during July. Laura's space is a beautifully decorated and welcoming one bedroom studio. It is super homey and incredibly clean. The view from the bedroom window is absolutely beautiful: ocean, and a little bit of the boardwalk. The bed was very comfy! Also, I don't recall seeing this in the listing, but I really appreicated the sleep sound machine!
Laura's place is just one block from the boardwalk and everything we needed was within walking distance. There was no street parking available when we arrived (11am on a Wednesday), so we went to the reccomended parking lot; while it is $20 for the day, if you want to stay overnight it is an additional cost (we paid $35.45).
We really enjoyed our stay and already discussed coming back in the fall for another visit =)"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura’s place was a little gem! It’s small but very cozy. Laura left a little welcome gift and all the items came in extremely handy. There were card games conveniently located on the table that we played when we got rained in. We ordered some food delivery and enjoyed the view and crashing waves. We had some rain during our stay but it didn’t stop us from getting out and enjoying the area! On the day we got in, our flight was delayed and Laura was so helpful with helping us get into the unit after hours. On the day we were leaving, we finally got some great sun and Laura was so accommodating with giving us a few extra minutes on the beach before check-out! All in all, it was a great stay and Laura was an amazing host! We will definitely be back! Thank you."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described! Great location right near the boardwalk with ocean views. Small, but well-appointed.

2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location and the place were wonderful, however, there was an issue. We were on the top floor and in a heavy rain storm the roof leaked into our room. The building manager believes he has solved the issue, but he thought that before we stayed as well. I would ask before scheduling your stay if the leaks have been fixed."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! The bathroom is small but enough, the dining area with the lookout is great. The room gets a little stuffy but the ceiling fan and opening the windows helps with that. The building is less than a block to the boardwalk and a few blocks to downtown, we were able to walk everywhere which was nice! I love that the building has an elevator, it made carrying luggage much easier (the room is on the 6th floor). The beach chairs provided were a nice extra as well as the noise machine located next to the bed. We ate A LOT during this trip. Lol. Check out Primo Hoagies, Opa's on the Boardwalk, and George's Grill. If you are going ""off season,"" unfortunately many places are not open past 8p even on the weekends, but you do get the perk of having the beach to yourself and far less traffic! For the great price of this room, it is definitely worth it!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is a JEM! The location can't be beat. Parking was a breeze. The place is adorable. I even text Laura to get the links to some of the decor. We can't wait to stay there again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice little room with the best view in the building! A must have for a weekend in OC!! Building staff were like family, and laura was amazing! Always responsive and you can tell she cares about her guests."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So amazing, so grateful we found this wonderful place! We will be back!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our weekend getaway at Laura's place. We were surprised that we could clearly see the ocean from the room. The kitchen area had just the right supplies. Though it is a studio room, it was very well set up. It is nice to be so close to the Boardwalk. We look forward to staying here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn't have been more pleased with the accommodations. Everything was exactly as described on the Air B and B site. The place was clean, cozy and comfortable. The view of the ocean was beautiful and the proximity of the boardwalk, restaurants and shopping was perfect. Laura is a fantastic host. She communicated with us before, during and after our stay and provided us with all the information we needed to make our stay perfect! The staff at the facility was also very friendly and helpful. When we travel back to Ocean City we will definitely be booking with Laura!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely space with an ocean view.. Laura let us know that we could check in early which was a nice thing to do. Laura was easy to contact and very helpful with suggestions on where to dine, etc. Highly recommend."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, great location! It had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay!!! I was only there for two nights, but I had everything I needed!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We highly recommend Laura's place. It is well decorated, the bed is very comfy, and it was extremely clean. When I called Laura with a question she answered right away. We enjoyed drinking our morning coffee with a view of the ocean from the table window."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an amazing time in Ocean City, and Laura was an amazing host! She sent clear instructions on how to check-in and reached out to me on check-in day to make sure all was well and I knew how to get to the apartment. There was a small snafu in that the weather was truly terrible my first night there and the ceiling began to leak a bit. Laura responded immediately and offered to move me to another unit. Laura allowed me to use either unit for the weekend as no one was staying in the extra unit, and she also refunded me the first night. I was blown away by her prompt responses and amazing customer service.
Both units are amazing. The pictures are an accurate representation of how it looks, and the bed was so comfortable I had a hard time willing myself to get out of it in the morning! The unit has an amazing ocean view, and the beach/boardwalk are right there. You cannot beat the location! I would definitely recommend this unit and Laura as a host! I hope to come back sometime myself!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a sweet little old fashioned hotel room in a renovated vintage hotel rather than an apartment. Despite its tiny size Laura made excellent use of space. Everything you could want was compacted into a single unit including mini fridge, kitchen sink, microwave, dishes, silverware, glassware, cooking pots and single burner which we didn’t try Aa bay window contained a round table and two chairs for a cozy eating place. All in all it was quite nice for a last minute Thanksgiving trip. And the Flanders Hotel provided an excellent holiday buffet. Though I must say it was a bit small for two people. I think it would be a great choice for a single traveler in a secure building with a front desk."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely little retreat in a prime location. I recommend.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We love everything about this place!
The room is well appointed with tasteful decor. It was just right for the 2 of us.
The location was just steps to the beach. It was perfect to catch every sunrise complete with Ocean City Coffee.
We were lucky enough to encounter the cleaning team and witness the thorough job that they do!
The host was always readily available and quick to respond to anything we needed.
We absolutely loved it and will be back!!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The room and location were absolutely perfect! The view was amazing. We loved the building. Check-in & check-out were easy and the guy at the front desk was great. We had a wonderful visit! We hope to stay there again.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Laura was a fabulous host and this location is ideal for a solo or couple get away. Adjacent parking lot is free during off season, and you are mere steps from the ocean side."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and i loved our stay here. Was a cute little studio that looked out to the water. Came during the fall festival and we saw fireworks right from our room to the ocean. Everything in the apartment was carefully thought of and super helpful/comfortable. You can tell the owner thought of all potential problems and remedied them. From the decor, to the little intricut details, this will definitely be a repeat stay for us as it was the perfect size for two people and close proximity to our favorite places in ocean city.
The host was very communicative and accomaditing. Would HIGHLY recommend."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, just past the parking lot next to the boardwalk, super easy beach access. Laura was an excellent host, giving clear instructions ahead of time and checking in to make sure everything was going well around checkin/checkout.
The space is very well arranged for being a small space, it had everything I needed to crash at night after spending the day on the beach. I appreciated the nice big windows where you can see the ocean!
Felt very secure being inside another building. The lobby personnel were helpful and friendly. And it was nice to have an ice machine and vending machines on site."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful experience we had! I hadn't been to Ocean City in about 45 years and Laura was terrific with answering all my questions about the area.
The room itself was fantastic! Laura has cleverly made the space into a lovely little haven that has everything you could possibly need and want. The view of the ocean was great--especially while siting at the table having my morning coffee.

You can see the boardwalk from the windows and it is literally a 5 minute walk! We found there was plenty of free parking if you go towards 7th & 6th avenues. The sunrises in the mornings were amazing to wake up to! The bed was super comfortable and the mini kitchen was a great plus.
Definitely recommend! We will be back!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Laura's place could not have been more perfect for our mother/daughter get-away. Laura and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Everything was exactly as described and pictured. We can't wait to come back!

Super conveniently located to a parking lot, but plenty of street parking if you look hard enough just up the block. A great first strip to OC!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect little getaway spot for 2 people. Clean, cozy, and in the heart of OC. We did have to pay for parking, but only because we were too lazy to look for a spot on the street (the paid lot was close and safe). Thank you for everything and we look forward to staying there again in the future!!"

She was even able to accommodate early check-in for us, which was much appreciated. Location is super close to the boardwalk and beach. The space is a little tight, but it was fine for my husband and I. Overall we had a great stay and would stay again in the future."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as expected! The only downside is parking but the bike rental place is right next to it so we found a free parking spot and biked around most of the trip, which enhanced the experience. Laura will let you know where you can park for free too!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Laura's Ocean City, NJ airbnb Suite fantastic and suited our needs perfectly! On a high floor (there is an elevator and stairs if you like exercise!) of a quaint historic building, we could sit at the table and watch the ocean every morning before we did the very short walk to the boardwalk for some fun. The queen bed is memory foam and extremely comfortable. Laura has provided everything needed for prepping an easy breakfast or other food but honestly, with so many great places to eat almost in sight, why bother! The management folks on-site at the apartment were excellent and available should you need anything (which we didn't). We highly recommend Laura's place for a cozy couples getaway, you won't be disappointed!
Kellie & Phil"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little space! Laura’s place is in the perfect location-a very short walk to the boardwalk and beach.

I would definitely go back, maybe when it was a little warmer but not during the busy season."

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazing getaway. The view is amazing too
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect great communication, prime location and all the comfort of home away from home. The design of the condo is so clever because it’s styled so well and also very functional for the space. The picture doesn’t do the ocean view justice- it truly is lovely to be laying in bed and looking out into the water.
The host goes above and beyond to communicate directions for getting to the rental and the details for enjoying the space. She really made the visit smooth and comfortable.
Definitely go for this spot for your visit!"

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time staying at Laura’s place. It was just like the photos and description in her listing. We had a view of the beach!! Laura was very kind and communicative and gave thorough check in instructions. The space was so close to the beach and boardwalk (less than a block!) that we took loads of spontaneous walks to play at the beach and explore the boards. The bed was very comfortable. I think it might have a foam top on it, but I didn’t actually check. The mini kitchen was stocked nicely with dishes, cups and silverware. It also had a microwave and a hot plate (it heated up very fast) and pot with a lid, and two coffee machines (regular and Keirig). I brought a mini frying pan to make eggs. She provided little soaps and bottles of shampoo/conditioner, sheets, towels, toilet paper, paper towels and blankets which made packing so much easier. The windows open and there was a great breeze in the evenings and the room was very comfortable with the overhead fan running. We chose to keep the AC unit off but it was running when we arrived and was quite cool. There is a shower behind the building for washing off after the beach. Our first morning there we woke up to the most beautiful sunrise of fuchsia, purple and yellow. The mini couch/single floor bed thing was my daughters favorite hangout place. She loved cuddling up with her stuffed animals on there. My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay. Thank you Laura."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was PERFECT! We had an oceanside view from our bedroom window, and were maybe a 3 minute walk from the boardwalk and beach, and 10 minute walk from Ashby street and a bunch of cute shops.

The space is small (not too small for a couple) but has everything you need. Dishes, small burner, microwave and small fridge. The bed was comfortable too!
Great view of the ocean and the boardwalk/beach was literally a 2 or 3 minute walk.
Thanks again Laura!"

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t beat the location and view - can see straight to the ocean. Clean. Great air flow. Tight quarters inside for two adults, but manageable. The surrounding outside area is loud in the mornings starting quite early, at least during our stay. Top shelf host and building manager. Would stay again for sure"

,,,"Please do not stay here . The place has a rodent infestation. We fled in the middle of our stay as a mouse ran through the living room. The cleaning crew left behind a dirty hairbrush , a cigarette butt on the roof , and a portion of the bathroom not cleaned . The refrigerator had a bad odor . Imagine sitting reading when a mouse is running through the living room. Robert refused to acknowledge the rodent infestation or refund a portion of the money paid to stay here . Don’t rent this place ! You will be disappointed or even horrified as you see a mouse sharing the vacation with you . I message Robert when the rodent was running through the place . By his own admission , Robert did not see my message and sent me an automated message . Do not stay here ! I have contacted Airbnb to have this situation investigated. Do not rent from this man !!!!!!
What a nightmare!"
,,,"Quaint and comfy but very small-perfect for a family of 3! 4 is a crowd! Bathroom is tiny but do-able! Bring your own bedding sheets. Current bedding is not comfortable. VERY IMPORTANT TIP-video/film how you arrived and video/film how you leave -owner will say something is missing and will charge you-owner also asked if we video and to my mistake we did not.
Overall nice stay…but will not go back."
,,,"The place had cock roaches and we cleaned the place took photos and then he said we trashed the place when the pictures show otherwise. Communication was so so, but having a cockroach found is disgusting"
,,,"honestly we were really disappointed in our stay. We had SO many issues. other than a good location close to the beach and boardwalk, I do not reccomend
[ ] we booked for 3 guests - didn't notify it's only for 2. Thankfully our friend canceled, had he not, he wouldn't have had anywhere
to sleep. Why didn't we get noticed about that when we registered 3 guests. The limit should be 2
] No extra towels, nor any for the 3rd guest we had registered
[ ] Ac unit loud / didn't work right
[ ] Didn't call ahead to even let the staff know we were staying here - and because of that nothing was turned on
[ ] Mini fridge wasn't turned on and ready for us
[ ] Freezer had a massive chunk of ice melt and spill over our food and fell out
[ ] No curtains- morning sun too bright
[ ] The silverware and kitchen utensils were so dirty
[ ] overall the photos make the room look way bigger than it actually is. it's deceptive. it's such a small space, even for two people"
