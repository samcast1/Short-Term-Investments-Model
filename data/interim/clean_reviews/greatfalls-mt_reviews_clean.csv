2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place to stay with my daughter for her sports camp. It was close to food, walking trails, etc. Everything was clean. The place was easy to find. There is no ice machine but we just bought ice and put it in a cooler. Great little place to stay. We would definitely stay again when in Great Falls."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was an amazing place to stay. Everything the host could control, they did extremely well. This unit is clean, quiet, and well stocked with what a visitormay may need.
Great Falls itself was a bit of a let down, (the falls have a hydro dam, a lot of the antique shops were closed...). The location is close to train tracks, so it may not be the best place if you are a light sleeper. Otherwise, I highly recommend this spot. A+!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and cozy place. A lot of amenities for a small studio. Have a cot for people that may need it. Keep in mind you'll have to wash your dishes which wasn't a problem at all for me but Troy did mention it in the rules prior and also I believe there is not a cleaning fee or it is really small if there is one. Perfect distance to the downtown areas without being in the center of commotion. There is an awesome induction stove but not an oven which you can see from Troy's photos. Worked wonderfully for my family and myself. Simple instructions. Comfortable bed and the tv/speaker system Is awesome for watching action packed movies. The bathroom is very spacious for a studio, wasn't expecting that and it was lovely. Great water pressure but since it is chilly give the hot water a second to run if you like really hot showers. Smelled marvelous when we walked in. The a/c and heater worked great. Everything was very clean. 10/10"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean and looked new. Its a separate space from the house so you have privacy and you can park right in front.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and cozy apartment for our trip with amenities around us and easily accessible
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Communication with Troy was simple and expedient. The rental is nicely designed. The days we visited were hot and Troy had the air conditioner on for us before arriving so we entered pleasantly. We came and went the same way and were pleased that we didn’t have to fool around with the settings for indoor temperature control! Instructions were simple also- clean dishes before checking out. The bed was uncomfortable and I tweaked it before the second night. Hopefully it will be better for your stay. It was hard and had a moisture barrier cover only under the sheet between that and the mattress. The lower north side where the rental exists can be questionable but we felt safe and fine. Traveling to and from the rental around town was again - simple.

The apt is in a great location, and parking is super close to the front door.

I haven’t slept better somewhere I’ve never been before in my life. Troy is very responsive and polite. If you’re worried about the location being to close to the owners home.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay here with our 3 kids! The house is centrally located, and very close to a park. The house was clean and well stocked, and the pool table, jetted tub and sauna were nice unique things to do. We ended up only leaving to go to the airshow we came for, and spent the rest of the time just doing various things at the house! This place also has a deck with a bbq and table to eat outside, as well as a nice front yard. It’s a great bird watching house as well since the windows are large and the trees in the front yard are beautiful and seem to attract wildlife. It was hot this weekend, so having the air conditioner in one of the bedrooms was a life saver! Full laundry washer/dryer access was very nice as well. Looking forward to another stay in the future!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This house was perfect for our trip! The layout is open and spacious. Check in was a breeze.
The house is stocked with everything you need. The pool table was a bonus and in excellent shape. They even had chalk for the cues.
Kitchen and bath were both stocked with all the necessities. The grill on the deck is another wonderful bonus. The soaking tub was a dream, even though we never used the jets.
The location was great and street parking was easy. The host was quick to respond and friendly. We’d definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was literally the greatest vacation I’ve ever had, my family and I did a lot but I will tell you we had more plans.
As in a day in Bozeman and might in Billings.
But no the farthest we went was the gates of the mountains for the day, we stayed in great falls in heathers house for 75% of the trip housed 5 nights of barbecues for my mom and dad who live half the year in great falls. Very comfortable place to stay with people you love. Great falls hands down will be the only place I stay in Montana now.

Each unit is self contained, so we were able to find additional cookware items downstairs; leaving an ice cream scooper we purchased for future guests.

We appreciated not having to eat out for all our meals. The bedrooms were roomy and comfortable.

Our stay was during March Madness and we could not watch the games even though we tried streaming:)"

The inside is newly done, modern and new. Everything you need will be provided. It is comfortable, clean and quiet.

The apartment has more of an upscale condo feel, yet retains the novelty of the historic building & surroundings. Everything was as represented and described, and the charm of the space exceeded expectations. The stairs are not for the faint-of-heart yet consistent with any multi-level complex, so just be aware if you have mobility challenges. The location is great, especially if you are focused on activities around the downtown area, however, nothing is very far in GF! I was delighted overall with my stay and would highly recommend it to others:)"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was originally booked at a boutique hotel just a few blocks from Nicole's downtown flat, but the hotel messed up my reservation and in the end it worked out great because Nicole's place was a far superior experience. The location was perfect as I could walk almost everywhere I needed to go during my trip and there a bunch of good restaurants, coffeeshops and bars nearby. The space itself was clean and exactly as presented with no gotchas or bummers. Nice and quiet, and very clean, I'd gladly stay there again.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures accurately reflect the spacious condo which was nicely decorated.
Our stay was good — warm & comfy. We stayed in December during the extreme frigid weather (-22°) so a warm condo was of utmost importance.
The condo was well stocked with the necessities. When needed, Nicole was easily accessible & promptly responded.
Having a washer & dryer inside the unit was a nice plus.
For some, a drawback would be the stairs to the third floor. We handled them ok. It was good exercise!
This was my third time staying at this condo and will definitely return. Great value for the space & convenient location.
Thank you Nicole & Steve."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole’s place was a great stay for us the night before we had a 6am flight out of great falls airport. Extremely spacious with high ceiling. Great lighting, coffee pods, all the amenities you can imagine we would love to stay again next time we visit Great Falls, MY! Beds were super comfortable as well and I loved the exposed brick/industrial ambiance. You are located right next to a bunch of amazing eateries, restaurants, and good coffee places- Al Banco has amazing espresso and is right down the straight a couple minutes walking. At night I could hear a neighboring family’s child cry and parent talk. If you turn off the window AC unit at night it does get quite warm in August month l. Stairs didn’t bother us at all and were quite easy wall up on. Having a washer dryer in the unit is the best!"

They had some of the best pastries we have ever eaten. The full size washer and dryer in the apartment were fantastic. We spent a few days camping prior to arriving at Nicole's and they were helpful to clean up our dirty clothes. The beds were soooooo comfy and cozy - very comfortable and just the right firmness. Parking in the rear of the building was easy and very secure. There are fantastic running or walking trails right along the Missouri River just a few blocks from the apartment. Tennis courts, a skate park, dog parks, and playgrounds are very close by too - all along the river. The food at Tracy's restaurant just two blocks away was great and varied - so something for everyone. Cannot say enough good things about our stay. Nicole was a great host and got back to me right away with any questions I had."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super clean AND super cozy! Check in and parking were easy and the location is fantastic! We really enjoyed our stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious two-bedroom with a full kitchen - great alternative to hotel/motel rooms! It is on the third floor with lots of stairs (a good workout) and not far from the train that comes through town in the wee hours, but we actually enjoyed the train horn in a nostalgic way. Location is very convenient to everything and the parking lot in back is perfect. Kind of a Wild West former boarding house feeling, but with great furnishings and well-stocked supplies, very much worth it!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great palce to stay. Communication with Nicole was easy, quick and accurate. We stayed 4 days and would have happily stayed 4 more. A comfortable, well-lit, well provisioned apartment. Comfortable bed, good kitchen!
thanks!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We needed a place to stay while getting our son settled in at the university. Cute place! Perfect location. Will definitely stay here again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place is very well maintained and spotless. Nicole is very responsive host. We had a lovely stay. This place is in close vicinity to everything. The only problem we faced was that this building don't have any elevator and the apartment was on 3rd floor other than that everything was great.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This apartment is just like advertised! It’s a fun old building with great apartments and amazing hardwood floors. It is easy to access and parking is easy as well. There is a train near by and when it blows it’s horn it’s very loud but that isn’t to bothersome since I don’t mind trains. I would stay here again if I am ever in Great Falls.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay. It was just as described. The parking in the back was fine, in front is metered with a 2 hour limit. The rooms were a nice size, the bathroom, while small, was just fine, lots of storage space for clothes, good wi-fi, tv was fine, I think, but I hardly had time to watch any of it. The street in front was full of newer upscale businesses, farmer’s market a block away. The only negative, a few blocks away the area wasn’t as new, and clean."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Very clean! Older building with quite a few stairs but that was not a problem for us. Probably a faster entry/exit than most hotels. On the end of downtown and we stayed on a Saturday night and it was quiet! There was a couple trains in the distance and a couple times there were some car noises. But there was white noise machine one room and and a window a/c unit in the other so it didn’t bother us. We were only awake because our baby was up for a night feeding. Close to lots of restaurants and coffee shops! Overall, great place and would stay again if we make it back to Great Falls."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice older charming apartment right in downtown Great Falls. The accommodations are very spacious with two bedrooms, large closets, and a fairly large great room. Our beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked, but there isn't a dishwasher so you need to wash your own dishes. The place was pretty quiet even though there were revelers downtown on a Saturday night. That being said, there are definitely restaurants and bars within walking distance. There is also a convenience store a few blocks away. Great value for the area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect stop on our way from denver to glacier np! The place is clean, beds are comfy, and Nicole was so helpful with house instructions and a binder of local recs. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nicole does a really nice job and this apartment is exactly as advertised and is a really good deal, well outfitted, and comfortable. She has updated an apartment in an old building and you are right in the center of down town Great Falls. I'm not a fan of Great Falls itself, but if you need a reasonably priced unit and don't mind climbing stairs, this is a nice choice."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host was wonderful, the place was fabulous and centrally located. Great place"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spacious apartment. Spent one night on my way to Glacier National Park and would definitely want to come back. Nicole was friendly and very accommodating. 10/10.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for business and my birthday. The location was as described in the listing and I felt safe knowing I was in someone’s fenced in backyard. I never heard or saw anyone, felt very private. I paid the extra $25 so I could use the hot tub on the property and that also felt very private because of how they have it situated on their patio.
Jacob was very easy to communicate with and quick to reply!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great neighborhood and Jacob was so helpful getting the reservation last minute. It's just like the description and the hot tub is absolutely worth it. You get to look at the stars and it's so relaxing. Thanks again!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,I would have gladly given this a 5. I loved everything except that the room was cold (the weather was quite cold the first 2 nights).
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jacob’s place was great! My lovely wife and I only stayed the one night but everything was very smooth! The neighborhood has a very peaceful right at home feeling! We would recommend staying with Jacob if you’re traveling to Great Falls! Thank you Jacob!

I highly recommend staying here!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jacob did great at staying touch even when I had to make a last minute cancellation. He provided a partial refund which was very considerate. This was perfect for late arrivals and early departures to and from the airport. Will stay again. Very affordable

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were in Great Falls for 1 night and basically just needed a place to sleep. The Tiny House met all of our needs.

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jacob was very helpful. He responded quickly to inquiries and addressed issues promptly.

It is very small, but all we needed was a place to sleep and get cleaned up.

If ever in Great Falls we would stay there again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great place would recommend
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The place was fine, decent and good for short stays. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was walking through the backyard to the accomodations and the side gate was not easy to go through since there are steps up to the side gate and the gate is not easy to open, especially if one has bags to carry. I hope the owner makes it clear it's not accessible for people with physical disabilities such as difficulty walking and if the person cannot do the two steps to enter the gate area."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"100%. I will definitely be back not only were the accommodations exceptional, but Jacob was attentive and easy to communicate with. It is definitely a shed with a bed, but it is also so much more. I called it my secret bungalow The peace and quiet was exactly what I needed. 10 stars all around 😁💛"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The hot tub was only 25$ fee to use and it was well worth it! With high prices of chemicals Im sure his time and chemicals is all that covered. It was quiet and a save environment. Very adorable!

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean . Most the pictures are of the hot tub. Upon checking in reading through the instructions to find out you have to pay extra money to use the hot tub and also be approved. Just thought if most the pictures where of the hot tub it would be included in stay.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place to get some rest for a night on our trip to Glazier National Park. Less expensive than staying at local hotel. Would not stay here for extended period with two people because of size, but overnight to catch some sleep was fine. Nice neighborhood and easy entry. It was warm in there when we arrived with no A/C or fan, but it cooled down overnight. I had to make a Walmart run to buy a fan around 10 pm so we could get some air circulating."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"a great place to feel like you are away from everyone the location was perfect, the hottube is such a nice feature to the place"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication and easy check-in and A/C was a must! The shower was great and loved the comfy bed!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely would recommend! Jacob is amazing! The shed did get pretty hot after a 90+ degree day and took some time to cool down, but there is an A/C unit and a window to help!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely recommend
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot to spend the night for a couple! Everything you need in a clean “shed” - more like a tiny house with bed and bathroom! Host is friendly and helpful, the neighborhood is nice too. The shower has good pressure and lots of hot water. I highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thankyou for sharing your space with my daughter and I. Loved it.
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Cute tiny place. It was a little bit stuffy and we had a tiny issue/losing power temporarily - but the host was very quick to help and fixed it for us! Thank you so very much.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jacob's shed with a bed was very clean and cute! He did a great job putting all the essentials into a small space and creating an positive and affordable stay. Great communication as well!

2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Jacob's listing is very clean and cozy. Great location and close to the airport. We stayed when the outside temperatures were in the 90s. The shed did have a portable AC unit, but it was on the wrong fan setting when we arrived so once we changed it to a different setting it did eventually cool off but it took about 6 hours. Otherwise would recommend this stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is exactly as the description reads. Was an ideal overnight pitstop on my route from Glacier National Park to Colorado. Clean and all the amenities needed for a place to lay your head.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed here for only one night as we passed through on our road trip. It was exactly as it was explained- a shed with a bed. The only thing was that the AC didn’t keep the room cool, but it was 90 degrees outside. Once it cooled down a bit outside the temperature in the room was just fine. Overall, we’d stay here again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy! What you see is what you get. The place is extremely clean and comfortable.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute, exactly as advertised! Jacob was so kind and great at communicating while we planned our trip. Directions were easy to follow and his place was a great stop on our way to Canada! We’d definitely come
back!"
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,I needed a quiet space to sleep on a business trip. I arrived at 10:30 pm after a long day of business appointments and travel and needed to be up early for another day of appointments and travel. Owner said he would turn on AC to insure room would be cool when I arrived. The room was tiny. The AC is huge and loud but the room was roasting when I arrived. It stayed hot most of the night and I couldn't sleep. I couldn't ever risk staying here again as I need good rest so I can be my best for my customers and stay safe on my travels (5000 miles a month business travel).
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jacob’s place was the perfect stop after a week of camping! The shed had everything we needed and more! We ended up leaving an item behind and Jacob was flexible and willing to meet us. If we are ever traveling through Great Falls again we will absolutely rebook!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great spot to stay for the night!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great find for a quick stay while traveling through Great Falls. Super quiet place and great neighborhood. Owner is an awesome guy too.

Call it small or call it cozy, the place is clean and neat as a pin, and access to the bubbling hot tub under a canopy of Montana stars is a relaxing way to wrap up the day. Jacob’s neighborhood is pleasant and has easy access to the rest of Great Falls. BYO blow dryer, though, if you think you need one. Looking forward to returning to the Shed soon."

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Sparkling little place exactly as pictured. It is located in lovely neighborhood with a well-lit path and motion sensors leading to the shed. Jacob was a very responsive host and the value is great. After 2 weeks of tent camping we were looking forward to a good bed but unfortunately the bed was not that comfortable. I think it needs a new mattress, less creaky frame and fluffier pillows. Also a chair on the porch would be nice. I was very impressed that the little shed had plumbing and electricity and a great shower but it was a little too small for the two of us and we probably would not stay here again"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Jacobs place is definitely just like the ad says! Shed with a bed! It was small clean and perfect for 2 people! My husband and I booked for a week but we had to check out early cause of a family emergency and Jacob was very understanding no issues what so ever! He was definitely very communicative with us and helped us with issues and or questions! The hot tub was great! A/C unit was perfect Aswell! It was still kinda hot but it helped a lot!!! 10/10 would definitely recommend and stay again! Thank you Jacob!

However, it is clean, comfortable, quiet, in a nice neighborhood, close to things in town and an INCREDIBLY AFFORDABLE PLACE TO STAY! You kinda feel like a local resident! And the JAQUZZI, small also, feels great!"
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful room! If you’re staying in the summer, it gets very hot and the AC unit was not very effective."

He was able to have the house cleaned and ready to go for us a night early (and on a holiday for that matter) than shown and we ended up needing to stay an extra night as well which he accommodated. He was also quick to respond to messages.
The house is just as described and so welcoming. The beds and pillows were so comfy and the beds upstairs also have an adjustable base which was a nice feature. The movie room has a built in projector which was really cool. We also enjoyed the hot tub and the kitchen has everything you need to cook and store leftovers. There is a book with recommendations for things to do, places to eat, and clear instructions,
expectations and rules for the house, none that were unreasonable by any means.
We would love to stay here again if we’re ever in the area and I highly recommend the cozy charmer."

To say this place is a cottage is humble. There is care and thought in every amenity.
The hosts, Michael and Melissa, are communicative and give clear, yet uncomplicated instructions.
From the luxurious hot tub for adults, the cute little playhouse in the backyard, the entertainment media area in the basement, to the decor…everything here invites togetherness and a great time for all.
It is obvious they’ve cared for this house and want their guests to have a wonderful experience.

The home was very clean (which is the most important for me) and the beds were wonderful. Michael was helpful with all my questions and very quick to respond. ￼

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brady was very responsive. The place was warm, clean, uncluttered. The area is being re-gentrified but I felt completely safe. I would give 5 stars for squeaky clean because the place was, in fact, squeaky clean. The only not-squeaky clean part was the oven and that was a 1-off. I have no doubt that it will be taken care of. I loved the gas stove and gas fireplace/""wood"" stove. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a quaint place the hot tub was fantastic, easy access to restaurants and shops.
The lighting at the front needs to be brighter as it is very hard to see in the dark. No light in front entrance is needed.
After the exchange rate usd to cad and fees it was a bit disappointing for the price, as it has only one real bed, a day bed then a pullout on the floor bed both of which are quite old.
Brady was very responsive to our questions which was great."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Overall a nice and well appointed place to stay. A little dark at check in. Couldn’t see the street number and patio was dark. Hot tub was cloudy and luke warm so we didn’t get in. Check out instructions were a little excessive.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I have stayed at Brady’s. My son (Air Force) and I have made many memories on my yearly trip out. Brady’s place served as home base and a place for me to cook homemade meals for my boy. It is close to everything and truly feels like home! If my son ever returns to Montana (he got orders), Brady’s place will once again serve as my home away from home!"

We felt very at home and would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brady provided a clean, safe space with outstanding amenities, (hot tub!) good on street parking, in a quiet residential neighborhood.

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Went on a last min road-trip and found this cute house whilst driving down and reserved this place because of the hot tub that had great reviews on how clean it was (too dirty for us to go in). I told Brady we wouldn’t be there till 6ish, he replies “looking forward to hosting you! I'II send check in instructions shortly.” at 135pm. Check In on Airbnb is 3 for this place, Brady didn’t reply to my next message at 430 saying “thank you” hoping that would get him to send our check in instructions. he read it, no reply. I now am anxious because i don’t understand why he hasn’t sent it. at 535pm I asked if he had any instructions on check in for us, he reads doesn’t reply. I ask again around 605 reads no reply. We arrive and message him “we’re here” keep in mind the anxiety i had the whole drive. We notice the door was OPEN so we stand and call the hosts name nothing. I call him via the app no answer. not till 723 did we get the pin to the door of the open house. leftovers in fridge aswell"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a great little spot within walking distance of pretty much everything in the historic downtown area and very near Gibson Park which has an amazing playground and duck pond.
This home worked out pretty well for my family, including our two-year-old. That said, the bedroom doors don't actually catch shut very well, which is a little bit of a trick with a toddler..."

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Had some miscommunication with a check in, if I was not traveling with a toddler, it would’ve been no problem, but with a toddler after a 6 hour drive it was a little bit of an issue.

The kitchen had the basic things we needed for making our meals. Brady was great to communicate with as well. The neighborhood was quiet, although it is an old part of town. The house was really quiet which allowed us space to relax and rest. The main bedroom's bed is very soft, so that is something to be aware of. We also really enjoyed the gas fireplace in the living room. It warmed up the living room nicely and provided nice ambience. I highly recommend staying here!"

2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The house was cute and has character. The hot tub was turned up so high, we couldn't use it.

Great communication, had everything you need and more for your stay. It was as if we were walking right into our home away from home. It is an older home that has been renovated to be very modern. The floors creak when you walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night but it's the leftover character of an old renovated home. The kitchen is fully stocked with more than you think you will need. Make sure to review what's in the kitchen before going to the store you'll be surprised at what you don't need to pick up. Very quiet neighborhood, large back yard, clean hot large hot tub, fire pit with wood ready for us to us use. Beds and sheets very soft, bathroom beautiful and modern. Older home but they have A/C and furnace so not to worry if your cold you can get warm, if your warm you can get cold. We wanted two separate sleeping areas, one for the adults and one for the kid. NO snoring could be heard which kiddo felt was extremely important! Perfect hosts."
