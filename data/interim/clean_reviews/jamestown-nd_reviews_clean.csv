There were a couple things that needed cleaning but I didn‚Äôt let him know because it was easy for me to take care of. However, the beds, living room, all of the upstairs was spotless.

Centrally located and the house was filled with the decorative touches and household items you will probably not see in your own home.

Thanks again Kimm!"

It is very centrally located (although in Jamestown everything is close), she has thoughtfully stocked all amenities and anything you could have forgotten. There is a beautiful updated kitchen and multiple areas to spend time together. The bedrooms are lovely and comfortable.
Kimm is extremely responsive and kind. My family was there due to a sudden death and it was always going to be a difficult week, but this gave us a soft and extremely comfortable place to land. 11/5 stars."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best air bnb stop in the area (literally for hundreds of miles). If you are passing through, it‚Äôs a must. Don‚Äôt stay anywhere else. The house is spacious, beautiful, and FULLY equipped. Literally, every nuance of hospitality is covered from an open bar to a coffee bar to a hot tub‚Ä¶ the list goes on. Kimm is, as one would expect, very responsive and sweet. We messed up and came a day late, and she accommodated us without charging us a penny for our mistake. SO, if you are passing through or looking to get away for a few days - look no further. The best AirBnB we‚Äôve come across in the state."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Rust House is an amazing Airbnb to stay at. Kimm is very responsive whenever we had any questions or things pop up and she solved any issues we had in record time. We stay here with our two toddlers and some extended family and everyone finds spaces to play and relax without disturbing others. The house is so beautiful and comfortable. This was our second stay here and when we walked through the door after our 6 hour car ride I felt like we made it ‚Äúhome‚Äù. Highly recommend.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rust House Inn had everything we could‚Äôve possibly needed for our stay.
We didn‚Äôt use any kitchen appliances besides the microwave (which was so cool because it slid in & out!) but if we would‚Äôve baked or cooked, we definitely would‚Äôve used the lovely kitchen more.
We used the hot tub a few times and that was very nice. Used the outdoor grill and my husband LOVED the grilling area set up.

The kitchen utilities were very cool. Highly recommend this place. :)
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kimm's home was the perfect getaway for my husband and I - we kept thinking while we were there how we can get back with more of our family as we only used one of the four bedrooms. It is by far the best airbnb experience we have had - the amenities like the expresso machine and the hot tub made it even harder to leave. The furnishing and decor made our time so relaxing yet luxurious. Every detail was thought of! We found the kitchen island to be the heart of the home, and all the extra nooks and hangout living spots made it possible to get alone time too. Can't recommend it enough."
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The Rust House is such a great place to stay! It has such character and makes your time staying there extra special. It is very clean and the host adds all of those touches to make you feel at home.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Rust House Inn and host Kimm were amazing. My fianc√© and I have had multiple international and regional trips cancelled this year - like many people - so we were really looking for a place close to Fargo with excellent amenities. The Rust House Inn had everything and more. First off the hospitality and responsiveness of the host, Kimm, was warm, welcoming, and very prompt. When we arrived, the place was incredibly clean. The house had many luxurious amenities such as a hot tub, espresso machine, coffee and tea selections, and more. It was also incredibly quiet and relaxing which was just what we needed. I highly recommend the Rust House Inn in Jamestown. If available, we will be returning the next time we are looking to get out of Fargo. Thank you Kimm!"

I was asked multiple times with surprise ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an Airbnb in Jamestown?‚Äù This house was absolutely beautiful and more than what I wanted for the purpose of the weekend. The keyless entry made check in simple, there was cheese, wine and a wonderful note upon arrival and there was a binder that provided directions for use of all household items and electronics.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was beautiful. Decorated appropriately with bison accents. It was very private. Loved to see real bison and eagles in the field next door. My husband wants to build this exact house for us.
Thank you"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The location was beautifully secluded and we saw deer and coyotes from the Airbnb every day! It was also nice to get out and go for a chilly walk on their private road after meals. The house is beautiful and we had everything we needed in the kitchen to cook for the 12 of us that were staying there. We would definitely go back!
The only things we'd do differently is ask about pet hair prior and bring humidifiers. It was pretty dry in the house and one of our family members is allergic to cats. It says no pets so we didn't think to ask but one of the rooms sheets was fairly covered with cat hair and so was the main rug in the living room."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful place to stay! Everything was top notch!!!! Loved the location! Beautiful lodge! A great place to make fun memories!!!!! I especially enjoyed the fire pit, the fireplace, the artwork and the beds!!!!!!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful place to stay, highly recommend it."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! Especially if you need space. Gravel road in and out was a bit of a challenge for our little car.
2023-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Bison Lodge was the perfect place to have a family weekend. We spent time ice fishing at near by lakes and relaxing in front of the beautiful fireplace. Even though it was chilly outside, we were warm and toasty inside. Wonderful place to chill for the weekend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is just an outstanding place to stay. We love the quietness of the house and such a nice get-away. I'd recommend this place for large groups as it will accommodate quite nicely. The kitchen is amazing to work in!!! And love the fireplace inside and outside.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures don't do this house and location justice. You are on a small ridge, looking at at miles of beautiful farmland, all by yourself. To the rear is a waterfowl reserve where the bison occasionally roam behind the house (they were there the morning of our last day). Gorgeous sunsets. The house itself is new, well stocked, has TWO washers and dryers (which is great for a large family). Beautiful fire pit near the prairie. Again, hard to find faults with the place. You are about 25 minutes from the nearest grocery store in Jamestown. Jamestown has some neat attractions like a buffalo museum and frontier village - you can probably find enough to keep you occupied for a day. Fargo and Bismark about 2 hrs out. We drove up to the International Peace Gardens (3 hours) during our stay. Dirt roads were fairly bike friendly. Hay bales in the front lawn, deer in the woods nearby."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is breathtaking!
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The ranch was just as advertised with TONS of room for our large family group! We particularly loved getting together around the fire pit. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place in the Jamestown area!

2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kelsey - this was the perfect place to gather with our family while we were in town for UJ graduation. Thank you for giving us an extraordinary place to celebrate! We took advantage of the kitchen, the fire pit, dining room, great room, and outdoor patio. We loved seeing the bison, and the lodge was beautifully decorated. The instructions and the amenities made it straightforward. Thank you for your hospitality!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a Great place to stay and would recommend this place for groups, retreats and family gatherings. It‚Äôs nice and quiet with no crowds or distractions!! The house is so accommodating with all accessories necessary to make your own meals!! This is the second time we‚Äôve stayed here and have so enjoyed both stays!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"""O give me a home where the buffalo roam...""
If you want away from it all, long prairie vistas, bison in your backyard, deep quiet, clean and spacious accommodations, large and well-supplied kitchen -- Kelsey's place is for you! It was just right for us."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Already trying to figure out when we can all come back again. Such an awesome place to stay and the photos do not do the place justice. It is way more roomer than any of us thought it would be. Really happy with our stay and will highly recommend to others.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ashley's place was Awesome! The house was super clean and all the amenities that you need are there! The house was spotless and the Ping Pong table was a blast! I highly recommend staying at this place!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As Airbnb hosts ourselves, we can tell that these hosts put a lot of effort and thought into the detail of this place to stay! Worked out very well for our family of 4 (two toddlers!) to visit family in the area. They provided some toys, a pack n play, and an early check in so our kiddos could get a nap in after long travels which was so helpful! A lot of nice little features and details to make your stay comfy, the hosts were communicative, it was very clean, and it worked out much better for us than a hotel."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 6 enjoyed every moment while being at the Prairie Cottage. Handful of yard games, bicycles to ride, large swings, fire pit for s‚Äômores and peaceful beautiful grounds to walk. Linda was such a wonderful host. She shared so many fun details about the area and stories as we both are large homeschool families. Exploring the old church building and grounds was fun and relaxing. It was a great weekend with family. And Linda is a generous accommodating host."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was lovely. Linda was most helpful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved Linda‚Äôs place. It‚Äôs unique to covert a 1900‚Äôs school into a Airbnb. The layout was nice and beds comfortable. Was great to talk to Linda about the history of both the school and church and hear her entertaining stories. She also let me tour the Depot/Peggy Lee museum which is about 10mins away in the small town. The school house was perfect for us and tons of land to have our pups walk around and enjoy. Was great to have peace and quiet while enjoying the sounds and sights of nature. Thanks again for everything
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Would stay here again. Very accommodating and Linda is easy to communicate with.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Linda greeted us personally. We got a tour of adjacent church and a bit of history. Peaceful surroundings would be an understatement.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Seems like a fun place for families and those with more time to spend. We were there only briefly, but appreciated the chance to explore the grounds and history of the schoolhouse. We didn‚Äôt get to meet our host but she was proactive, nice, and loaned us some supplies we requested. It was so nice to have bottled water provided. Showering in the tub was a challenge because it rocked back and forth - I hope that gets fixed.
In all, we appreciated the accommodation/welcome and would recommend to those looking for a unique experience with interesting history, especially suitable for larger groups."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great renovated school house! Such a unique place to stay. The kids loved the school house and the bikes and yard games.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay at the Prairie Cottage! We rode the bikes, typed on the old fashioned typewriter, enjoyed a lovely breakfast, explored the grounds, heard incredible stories about the history of the place, watched a movie, slept well on the comfy beds and just felt relaxed and at home!
I highly recommend a stay here for a unique and homey experience! I wish we had time for a game of croquet!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved this place, our children had fun exploring. Plenty of room for everyone inside too. Linda was a great hostess, don't hesitate to book!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Truly a one-of-a-kind stay in an old one-room schoolhouse on a North Dakota farm. We enjoyed meeting Linda, the host, and learning about the farm and the community."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay immensely.
The location: conveniently located between Jamestown and Fargo.
It was very easy to find and as it is located on Linda's land it was so calm and private.
The space: it was great staying at such a beautiful and historical place. They have preserved a lot of the school vibe, and it is so fun to learn about how one-room schools were operating back in the day. (It has three bedrooms now). It is very spacious with high ceilings, and Linda was so kind to let us pick our own rooms. Everything was very clean, and the beds were super comfortable.
The host: Linda is one of the loveliest people. She was super accommodating and very generous with recommendations of places to see and things to do. Communication was great, and she even gave us a tour of the space, and we enjoyed learning about the history of the school.
Thank you so much, Linda, for making our stay so memorable!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful trip into the history.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a quiet, peaceful place to relax and visit for the weekend...this was perfect for our needs. Linda was very helpful and showed us around the schoolhouse upon arrival & was available when needed during our stay. We enjoyed the yard and flowers!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved our stay here! A very peaceful setting and comfortable cottage. Linda was super friendly and welcoming.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay enjoying the memories of a school house. Appreciated the hospitality of our host.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Linda's beautiful farm is one of our all-time favorite airbnb stays. The property is just as picturesque as the photos. There were horses across the street that can be seen through the front door, chickens, cows in the field past the trees, and ducks. We couldn't hear the chickens or any of the other animals from inside, which was nice. Linda and her family took great care to restore the schoolhouse and church. Her stories were funny and meaningful, and we could have listened to her talk about her life on the farm all evening. She brought us muffins when we checked in. Every supply we needed was in the house, a basket for s'mores, a grill and firepit, etc. The house has many antiques and was laid out by someone with an eye for design. Honestly, even after how much fun the farm was, what made the experience for us was just how kind and thoughtful Linda is. Thank you, Linda, for hosting our family."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A working farm with a lot of interesting history. We really enjoyed it. The house was very comfortable. I hope we can get back next year.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This schoolhouse lets you step back into time and enjoy rest and peace. It has many rooms, nooks, and crannies; fascinating decor; a piano; comfortable furniture; many books and games; and plenty of towels and kitchen supplies. The big windows let in so much light. It's a gorgeous retreat."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is so fun and Linda is so nice and an excellent host. The old schoolhouse is exactly as described and was everything we hoped it would be. It is clean and the beds are comfortable. It is in the country. So peaceful! I loved the old church next door and the rooster in the distance in the morning.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was an awesome, unique, clean stay!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My group had such a lovely time in this sweet school house. My kids played with puzzles, and loved the bunk bed. And the adults had a wonderful time visiting in the cozy living room. Thanks to Linda for thinking of everything we might need!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is a must if you are in the area!! Quiet and peaceful, it will bring you back in time, yet with all the modern conveniences. Linda is friendly and helpful, and eveything was very clean.
Highly recommend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,lots of character and very unique stay with great host.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a gem that the pictures almost undersell.
Linda was extremely welcoming and shared interesting history of the space and her potential future plans.
The schoolhouse was very comfortable and had plenty to keep our 3 kids entertained."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a great place to stay for our daughter‚Äôs wedding! Your place was well stocked and a lot of nice little extras-like the first aid kit üòÅ and s‚Äômores supplies. We enjoyed our stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was such a wonderful stay. Definitely one of the most unique experiences of my road trip through North Dakota. I feel really lucky for the opportunity to stay there for the night.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved staying here!!! Linda stopped by and shared her history with us!! So interesting!! Would highly recommend this listing!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Enjoyed our stopover time in ND at Linda‚Äôs schoolhouse exploring the grounds, church, prairie houses, and schoolhouse. Kids loved the bunk beds and it was so neat to hear stories about how the buildings came to be here and how they were used over the years. House had plenty of common space, kitchen essentials, so quiet at night, A/Cs in rooms. Would stay again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Linda's hospitality is simply unmatched and truly was the highlight of our stay. She greeted us with a wonderful snack after a long road trip, took the time to show us around and share about the history of the property. The home had everything we needed (and then some!) for a comfortable stay including preparing meals. The farm is a really special place. Our daughter loved staying in the home and was sure to take advantage of the many books, chalkboards, and desks. It's a fun spot for families with so much room to explore and play outdoors. Linda perfectly balances being a hands off host with being highly accessible. We will surely visit again!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay Linda was a great host and a pleasure to hear her stories
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I wish i could have spent so much more time at your place as I am a HUGE huge fan of historical sites. The school house could not have been cuter and as a fellow airbnb host, I appreciate your thoughtful notes and touches. I hope I can revisit again for a longer amount of time in the future. Thank you!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a former schoolhouse and so much fun to stay here. It‚Äôs not modern, but has everything you need, and it makes it more fun. We cooked a meal here, and had what we needed. We also toured the little church on the property. The bedrooms are off one center room, and we gathered there to watch a movie."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had the most amazing stay! The schoolhouse was perfect - charming and peaceful, just what my family needed. Linda was gracious and ensured that our stay was lovely in every way. We look forward to returning!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful place -- We are SO glad that we stayed in the charming schoolhouse with Linda's warm and gracious hospitality. I highly recommend this AirBnB with no reservations. The house fit 6 of us comfortably. Clean, full of historical reminders, comfortable, cheerful, easy to find, and unique describe it well. My grandchildren think that the best vacation place one could ever go is North Dakota because of staying in the school house!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Snow happened while we were there and we went in the ditch. A quick call to Linda and her son came to rescue us. Nicest thing she could have done for people she did not know.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed Greatly.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,From fuss. No muss. Our hunting group was able to use the grounds to spread out our gear and were quite comfortable in the school. Game cleaning station in the back made it easy.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family had a lovely time! It was so charming and the host included many thoughtful touches.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Prairie Cottage was the perfect place to stop on the drive from Mpls to Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The kids loved the chalkboards, desks, piano and bunk beds! The grownups loved all the school related decor and details! Linda was a fantastic host, she greeted us with homemade rice krispie bars, homegrown tomatoes and a smile. Overall a great stay!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such an interesting and unique place. We had a great time and wished we could have stayed longer. Linda was a great host and came to meet us and even left us some delicious pumpkin bars!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Linda's place was such a great experience and the hospitality was top notch. I would return without a doubt. It's very peaceful and secluded, and the authentic touches around the schoolhouse are much appreciated. The space is homey, comfortable and clean. I loved the outdoor space and the surrounding property, including the chapel and sheep! I would recommend staying at this unique place. By the way, Linda is a gem!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Unique home. Comfortable. Amazing outdoor space for kids to run around and explore. We had lots of fun with all the historical objects. The rice crispie treats and fresh picked produce left for us were such a delight. Would have loved to spend more time there.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Linda was an amazing host. We had gotten to her place a little later than we planned so we had no groceries. We asked Linda if we could borrow some eggs. This sweet lady brought us eggs, butter and HOMEMADE JAM AND APPLESAUCE! The ""cottage"" is a converted schoolhouse. It is very charming and there is a small historic church a few yards away. We enjoyed stepping back in time and singing hymns in the pews!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We met up with friends of ours at this wonderfully unique Air B&B and had a fantastic weekend! It was clean, the property and the surrounding area was beautiful and perfect for a weekend of catching up, watching the olympics, and playing board games. We also enjoyed exploring the property and riding the bikes around. If it had been cooler outside, we would have taken advantage of the fire pit and croquet set! Thank you Linda for a wonderful weekend!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Prairie Cottage was a perfect stop for our family on our trip west. We only wished we had booked more time here! Linda was the perfect hostess from the moment she greeted us, providing everything we could have needed. It was a pleasure getting to know her!
The schoolhouse was clean, charming and comfortable for our family of 7.; we loved the character of it! We enjoyed the books in the library, playing croquet and cornhole, riding bikes, exploring the trails and having our own service in the church on Sunday morning. Would definitely stay here again and even considered the same route home just for that purpose!
We've been staying at Airbnb's for several years, and this is a favorite for all of us."
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We enjoyed our time at the cottage so much! I was born and raised in North Dakota yet this was still a gem to me. I loved the history of the building and all of the incredible school material and pieces inside. We explored the church and enjoyed every moment we had with Linda and her family as well.
We came to the cottage with our four children. They loved the school and fun games as well. Our oldest girls finished 1st and 2nd grade this year and learned about US history and how our country began. The cottage is RICH in history and memorabilia.
I packed extra things to travel with our family but upon arrival, discovered that was unnecessary. Linda had a basket of goodies to make s'mores and a first aid kit by the front door. There was a delicious plate of homemade cookies on the table as well. We used the kitchen mostly and the fire pit only some as it was 90 degrees outside almost the whole time we were there. We enjoyed our time at the cottage very much and can't wait to plan our return trip next year."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"To celebrate my moms retirement as a teacher of 44 years, we hauled ourselves from the Twin Cities to the sweetest little schoolhouse in ND. We frolicked around in smocks and pretended we were in the olden days. Lots to explore on the property, including a beautiful church (belting out O Happy Day was a must). The schoolhouse itself is charming and beautifully kept. Cute little rooms, plenty of living space and very clean. We plowed through the library and enjoyed several rounds of croquet. Linda was a great host amd super helpful and available!
Nearby, Jamestown had a frontier village next to largest buffalo statue and great coffee shop in town. Valley City also was fun to putz around. Fargo is a must if you drive that way. Loads of restaurants (the rooftops!), coffee, ice cream, etc.
A truly lovely trip to celebrate my mum:)"
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Adorable hidden gem of a place! If you're anywhere near you should definitely stop by. There are plenty of things to do and see on the farm and in the towns. My city kids (teens) were fascinated by it all. Linda and Dick are very friendly and helpful (and tolerant of our crew). They know the area well and gave us some good suggestions of things to do. People around there are also very nice. Overall it was one of the best experiences we've had.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about our stay. The cottage is part of a beautiful and serene property and, best of all, unlike anything you will find elsewhere. The place is thoroughly equipped and Linda is at the ready to provide anything you might need. She is a super friendly, fun and welcoming host. We‚Äôd turn around and go back tomorrow if we could!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pleasant, peaceful and a true respite from the road. The place is unlike anything else‚Äîmy kids were mesmerized by the decor and toys and all the personal touches. Linda truly cares‚Äîshe had great communication the whole time! Would come back in a flash!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place -keeping the old school house feel: old maps of the US, world, science maps with flower parts, old piano, and some books. Modern, comfy beds and couches. Totally recommend for a family reunion!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You will not find a better host than Linda! She was amazing! We had a great trip to North Dakota that was greatly enhance by Linda's warm hospitality. The property is quite unique and provides a great story!!!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Linda was such a kind and accomodating host! We loved getting a personal tour of the schoolhouse and learning about the incredible family history of her home. The schoolhouse itself is quaint and lovely. We especially enjoyed the personal touches (like the s'mores kit Linda left for us) and the super comfy recliners that we spent the evening reading in. It was also great to have access to a huge yard to walk our dog around in - he had a blast exploring the area.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The little school house one the prairie was a perfect fit for us. Our 4-year-old thoroughly enjoyed the school house with its chalkboards and plenty of space to play. I enjoyed taking in the stunning ND sunrise and peaceful mornings. We were hoping to safely visit family in the area and avoid hotels and were able to do so. After several months apart due to the pandemic, it was wonderful to see grandparents again and know that we were doing everything we could to keep them safe. I'd recommend The Prairie Cottage for anyone looking to get away from the city and enjoy some peace and quiet."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This frontier-era one-room schoolhouse is a beautiful, fun, and unique place to stay about an hour from Fargo, ND. Linda is an excellent, very responsive host. Highly recommended."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for 5 of us on a duck hunting trip. The home was clean and had all amenities that one could need. Linda was an absolutely amazing host and her hospitality can‚Äôt be beat. I highly recommend staying here.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being someone who enjoys history and the country, I knew I would love staying here. It was wonderful. Much of the original schoolhouse charm remains in addition to a lovely farmyard with apple trees and chickens. The nearby church and Wimbledon's depot/Peggy Lee museum were also great to visit.
Linda was very prompt, helpful, and gracious. A lot of thought and effort has been used to make this a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
I cannot wait to come back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Talk about a super host! Linda went above and beyond from meeting us at the street in the dark to find the right house to the fresh homemade poppyseed muffins with honey butter. Such a cute cottage on beautiful grounds to explore.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Linda's converted schoolhouse is a charming and very family friendly place. We were traveling with three children who were super excited about the spacious bunk bed, large grassy yard, and farm animals within view. My travel partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the walking path around the property, trees perfectly spaced for hammocks, and the historic church and schoolhouse features. Linda is very friendly and accommodating, and has organic apple trees that she graciously offered up for picking. Highly recommended for a rural, peaceful getaway!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My two young sons and I stayed here on our road trip back to Minneapolis from Seattle. We were greeted by Linda who gave us a tour and shared the history of the property with us. The cottage was clean, charming, quiet, and with everything we needed to have a restful stay outside the bustle of the city, yet still close enough to drive out to Jamestown to pick up some dinner. My boys loved sleeping together in the bunk bed! The place is very spacious and can very comfortably accommodate a larger group. Linda also very kindly gave us a bag full of delicious apples and homemade apple sauce for the ride home.
Thank you for a delightful stay, Linda! We hope to be back for another visit sometime!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a wedding and to see family. This place gave us the quality and room we are used to having in our own home. Some members of our family were able to come and visit at different times. This beautiful home is filled with craftsmanship. All the doors and trim are oak beautifully finished. The home is situated within three blocks of a major grocery store, and within two blocks of a beautiful park across the river. The host was very responsive about any minor issues we had."

2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"This was our second time staying here. The place is very spacious and clean, and the home has a lot of character with nice updates. We appreciate that this year there were a few thoughtful added touches such as shampoo and a Buffalo Days guide. I'm sure it will continue to improve as well, though it is already quite nice. Overall, we appreciate a place to stay that's not a hotel while we're in town visiting family who live here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the house, classic craftsman style with modern amenities, you opened up the interior but kept all the charm.

Beautiful updated lake home in small friendly peaceful community fully stocked with everything we could have needed. The local people were super friendly and everyone seemed so happy!
If available I would book this again in a heartbeat for our next family getaway!
Thank you Leslie for sharing your piece of paradise with us!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great, short stay in Sibley. The house was very clean and had lots of room. The public lake access right down the road was also great. There is no wifi and very spotty cell signal, so this is a truly off the grid stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had an absolute blast at Leslie's place! It was perfect for our little Labor day weekend family get away! Location was close to Lake Ashtabula where the fishing was awesome! The place had everything we needed to make our meals with plenty of fridge space! Communication with Leslie was great! Easy to get a hold of, checked in with us often and gave us good advice! We would defiantly stay here again! :) Highly Reccomend!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were traveling for what is typically a stressful week of youth sports. Leslie‚Äôs cottage was a breath of fresh air and provided the perfect peaceful, clean, and well kept environment to come back to after a long day. The area is gorgeous! The house was in immaculate shape and had more amenities than we could‚Äôve ever hoped for!!! Making ourselves at home was effortless. Leslie‚Äôs directions on how to fully enjoy this rental were flawless and extremely helpful; we felt very taken care of! We were so thankful for this experience and are GREATLY hoping to return next year. If you are deciding between Leslie‚Äôs cottage & another location‚Ä¶ choose this‚Ä¶ you will not be disappointed.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cosy vintage space with a great host
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stephanie was very thoughtful by including a welcome basket and messaging us to let us know that she turned on a light for us. There were signs around the house with where everything was. there were lots of entertainment available to keep the kids occupied. There were plenty of beds available as well. The shower and the carpet in the bathroom seemed a little odd. The outside smelled like dead cat. It was very cool to be staying next to a massive farm silo. It also was slightly creepy to be in the middle of nowhere with just a few houses nearby but that's just me. Overall, cozy, and one of our better Airbnb stays. I would definitely recommend."

The beds are pretty comfortable. There are laundry facilities on the premises. Stephanie was very responsive through messages and answered all our questions. Its an older home but like i said, has everything you need for a comfortable stay in ND."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It's on the side of a hill. The ""back yard"" starts at window height and goes up from there. The ""front yard"" has enough room for the hot tub, which puts you significantly above the road. The view out the front is of the valley and hills. It's pretty. It's an old house with character, but it has been remodelled to look nice. It suited our family of six just fine. I'd stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was perfect. Stephanie was very responsive, easy to communicate with, and really goes above and beyond. From snacks ready at check in to treats for the neighbor dogs. Everything you need to cook was available. Comfortable beds and the house was extremely clean.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family (2 adults and 4 young kids) enjoyed a short, one-night stay in this Time Capsule of a home. The kids got such a kick out of all the relics from days gone by, and Stephanie was such a kind host. Comfortable, cozy, no frills kind of place."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming country side house! Very peaceful place! Will stay there again!
2022-09-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house needs some renovating for it to show its charm. Some decluttering of items would also help. For the price and fees charged it was surprising to find a 70s era padded vinyl toilet seat and torn rollerblinds.
The kitchen was well-stocked with cookware and dishes, which would likely be very useful for a longer stay.
Check in was trouble-free even though we arrived very late at night, and we appreciated having a warm dry place that welcomes our doggy!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing. Stephanie was communicative, timely, and extremely nice! We had a bad experience with our other host and had to book this place last minute. She was incredibly understanding and the place was nice and clean. Not updated but for the price you can't beat it! If I could leave 10 stars I would ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stephanie was great at communicating . Bobs place was a perfect small little home. It was perfect for my family of 5 (2 newborns and an 11 year old) there was plenty of space and the area was absolutely GORGEOUS! If we are ever up in ND again we would definitely stay here :) only thing is def plan on grocery shopping before coming! It‚Äôs about 25 minutes away from the nearest town so plan some meals and snacks :)
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect set up and accommodating for our dogs
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay! It was perfect for our hunting trip would highly recommend staying super clean and in a small quite town. Stephanie was very helpful and easy to get ahold of. Will for sure stay again on our next trip!!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay at ""bobs house"" was great yes the house is older but we loved staying away from the city in a quiet neighborhood. The house had everything we needed and was easy to get in to and clean. The snack Stephanie left for us was awesome made it way easier so we didn't have to run 30 minutes away to the store. I highly recommend if you want a cheap quiet place to spend the night."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is what I have .
.
Feel free to add subtract or change...
Nice house. It reminded me of my grandparents place; out in the country. Lots of trees, neighborhood pets, no distractions (no wifi, no TV). Very clean and tidy. A place to sit and relax.
We went for a walk around town. It was so peaceful, we even saw a couple of deer grazing near the woods.
There was breakfast food in the fridge. A very nice touch. What a relief to have a nice breakfast before leaving in the morning."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful little spot. The whole neighborhood is filled with very sweet people. I enjoyed a little walk at sunset and went to the neighborhood bake sale in the morning. Stephanie left a little basket of snacks and breakfast supplies which was a gift from an angel after a long drive. I only used one bedroom since I was traveling alone, but this would be a great place for a family to stop through with how the space is set up!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Monte's place was everything the was promised to be. He was immediately on the phone with me when I had a small problem getting in. It was very comfortable and I felt right at home. I will definitely stay here again
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Monte‚Äôs place during the University of Jamestown graduation and it was perfect. There were 3 of us, so it was nice to have our own bedrooms, but there was definitely room for more.
It was only a 25 minute drive to campus, so super easy. There are no services in Cleveland, so definitely do your grocery shopping for whatever you need before arrival. The kitchen was well stocked with spices, oils, coffee (always top on our list), and a full kitchen of tools. We cooked a lovely family dinner and were so grateful for the large space to spread out.
Everything was clean and comfortable and we will be back again when in Jamestown. We even went for a walk and all the neighbors waved and smiled and were super nice even though I‚Äôm sure we stuck out like a sore thumb!
If you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful retreat to spend quality time with friends and family, this is it!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Monte's place was one of the most relaxing and peaceful stays I have experienced. His communications were excellent and extremely quick. I was amazed by his quick response; when there was a minor problem with the shower he had an experienced professional on site in less than an hour to take care of it. I was amazed. I stayed for several months and employed his housekeeper who did a great job as well. You cannot go wrong at this wonderful home located in a beautiful quiet locale. A five star experience.

The queen sized bed on the main floor was very comfortable. So peaceful and quite neighborhood."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We adored our stay at Monte's charming home. I've never seen so much wildlife and waterfowl! It was absolutely spectacular. The house is also super well equipped and the internet was fast enough for the two of us to be hosting Zoom calls at the same time. Can't wait to return next year!

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice, relaxing location. The town is tiny, so all shopping is 20 minutes away in Jamestown. The house is a good distance from neighbors, so it feels secluded. The only sounds are the birds, sometimes the neighbor's tractor, and the occasional train in the distance!
Two-story house with a large kitchen area and a large living room. Very comfortable and relaxing!"
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice hosts . 20 minutes away from any food place . Great internet . Check out instructions are a bit ridiculous given the cleaning fee .

Our family members had plenty of space for privacy and saved money and time by fixing meals at ""home"" instead of the local restaurants (which were crowded). The garage was so handy for loading and unloading during the rain, too. The whole house audio speaker system was also great for setting the mood for the day or evening. Everyone felt comfortable and ""at home."" Thank you!"

The place had everything one could possibly want or need from board games to outdoor games and even a beautiful pool table and an impressive sound system. The kitchen is well equipped with absolutely everything you would want to cook or bake. They really have thought of everything. The furniture was fabulous and the beds were incredibly comfortable. Three bathrooms were handy and I should mention the master bath was just plain awesome. The place was very clean upon arrival and the hosts made sure snow was cleared for all our guests. Check in was simple and flexible which was great for us because we ran a little late. I cannot speak highly enough of the hosts who were attentive and easy to deal with. The cabin was not too far from Jamestown. We did a couple supply runs, no problem. I don't think you are going to find a better place in the area. You will love it!"

2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Tara and Henry‚Äôs place was a fantastic choice for our family of 8 adults & 2 kiddos to get together! We enjoyed their deck games, Lilly pad, pool table, large garage, ample parking, and fire pits. We were able to easily dock the pontoon and the public access was really close. All the beds, bedding, and pillows were very comfortable. The central air kept the cabin temperature comfortable. The kitchen/dining area was large and open with enough plates, cups and silverware for all of us. The fridge was large and there was a great pantry. There was a Blackstone grill and utensils for us to use. The yard was small, but the deck and driveway were large enough to play games on. The cabin is beautiful and spacious with great windows that look out to the lake.
Henry stopped by when we arrived and gave us a little walk through which was very helpful. They were also very accommodating. We had a very memorable vacation!"

The flattop grill was awesome (and now my husband wants oneüòÑ). The location near the public boat launch is great and we loved being on the water (we brought a pontoon and fishing boat but also enjoyed the peddle boat provided). The view of the lake from the house is beautiful, maybe the best on the whole lake! We hope to come again and appreciate Tara and Henry‚Äôs kindness and accommodating personalities."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome place and would highly recommend. Definitely planning on coming back and staying again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay, definitely will be back on future hunting trips"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"From the moment we walked in, we knew we had a winner in our accommodation. It has a wonderful, quirky layout with spaces for 'me time' and rooms for private conversations. It is very spacious. The beds were so comfy, we wish we'd had more time to sleep in. The kitchen had everything we needed; plenty of glasses and plates....etc.
We were in a great location and we loved the yard and wished we'd had a bit warmer weather to sit out there.
Thank you for a wonderful place!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was in a central spot to get to the highway or North out of town. The restaurants in town were generally within a mile. The house was large and comfortable for a hunting party of six, each person getting their own bed. There is a nice seating area in the living room and outside on the deck. Beds were comfortable with nice pillows. Really appreciated the accommodations."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is so close to the University and perfectly held my family. We will definitely be booking again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Was a great place to stay and get away was very pleased with the house and how cozy it was made me feel right at home.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were there for a wedding and it was so much better then staying in a hotel. It was close distance to the venue. Also the master bed has got to be the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lyndell is always helpful and replies promptly. We feel like the Great Adventure is a perfect place for us to stay when we visit family in Jamestown.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The pictures posted online do not do this house justice! Beautiful home with so much space. Kitchen is fully stocked with everything you would need. Variety of coffee, tea and snacks which was a sweet surprise! I will definitely be staying here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Need an AirBnb in Jamestown? This is your spot! 5 large bedrooms, a gorgeous backyard, 2.5 baths, and even a fully-stocked PLAYROOM. This is the most child friendly Airbnb we've ever stayed in (and we've stayed in many!!). The hosts have thought of absolutely every detail to make your stay comfortable. 10/10"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Friendly and responsive host, great location for the town of Jamestown, and house was clean with plenty of room. Process of checking in and out was seamless. Trip could not have gone any smoother! Great place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place with lots of room for a family or any group of people. Nice big backyard to hang out in as well. Would recommend 100%.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect for us. The house had a ton of space, all the amenities, and was within walking distance to restaurants, the university and other attractions. It will definitely be at the top of our list for future visits."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lyndell's place was just as lovely as the pictures! She had many amenities, especially in the kitchen. It felt like home the minute you walked in!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Lyndell was an excellent host. Responses were quick and she was helpful with her information. The house was very nice and was located in a neighborhood that was nice,quiet and easy to find. Large house with enough bedrooms and bathroom to meet our needs. Highly recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing bang for your buck! Spacious place with 2 full bathrooms and 2 full living rooms. So close to downtown yet peaceful and quiet.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"SPACIOUS! We so enjoyed our 1 night stay in Jamestown. Lyndell‚Äôs place at so much room, and so many unique characteristics to the house we simply loved it! Comfy beds, very kid friendly, within a block to a school park, and all around charming. We only spent a night, but would stay again! Thank you!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lyndell‚Äôs place was wonderful! We had 6 adults and 1 toddler and had plenty of space. We were in town for a wedding and her place was central to everything. Inside of the house, our toddler loved playing with the toys and running around. It was perfect for her. I also appreciated all of the small details and items left for us to make our stay enjoyable. No central air and it was warm, but there were plenty of AC units and fans to cool everything down. We wish we could transport this place to a couple of other places our family travels. Thanks for being great hosts!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved this spacious, charming house. We spent a week in Jamestown getting to know the area since our son just finished his freshman year playing football at the University, and we loved everything about the property (and the town)! It really was a home away from home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lyndell is a great host. She understands customer service and customer satisfaction. She is a great person! I really enjoyed my stay at this beautiful place of hers.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very neat little house with an interesting layout and eclectic feel. You can tell that it is an older house, but it has had some loving enhancements.
A hospitalist feel, great beds, snacks available, water in the fridge, and soft blankets and towels. The place was very clean and was in a super location for us. If we had more time to explore downtown we would have been very accessible. It also has nice touches if you‚Äôre traveling with kiddos - like a playroom and also a Wii.
It was a really warm weekend and we struggled to cool the house - two window units and a wall unit, but we were creative with fans and shutting doors so the air could funnel appropriately. I feel this can also be managed a bit better by shutting shades and curtains - to keep it cooler during the day. The bathrooms were more than adequate and one has a really nice deep tub. Overall a nice stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such an interesting, clean house, close to downtown. It met all our needs.
Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a very nice place to stay in for the weekend! Our family truly enjoyed the home and it‚Äôs amenities. We drove out from California to celebrate my daughters graduation! Go Jimmie‚Äôs and thank you for your hospitality!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"This AirBnB was fabulous! Plenty of room for our family of 7. Was such a nice place to spend time together. The space was perfectly cozy with great areas for hanging out. Great coffee selection. The whole place was very clean, tidy and very cute decorating. Would absolutely recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures can't capture all the charm and cool amenities of this beautiful old house!! LOTS of upgrades and remodeling, it is obvious that the owners have put alot of time and care into making this house a welcoming home for their guests! Newer appliances, cupboards, counter tops, light fixtures, bathrooms, and furniture! Along side vintage desk, dressers, table, etc. Beautiful hardwood floors (so clean you could eat off of them!). The toy room, right off the kitchen, was incredible and keep the toddlers busy for hours (all new/like new toys). It was surprising how bright & cheery the rooms were upstairs, and throughout the kitchen and diningroom; the windows allow for alot of natural light! In the evenings we cuddled under warm blankets in the cozy livingroom, enjoying the popcorn & hot chocolate while watching movies. There couldn't have been a more perfect way (or more perfect place) to have spent a 3 day weekend during a snow storm!"
,,,I do not recommend this place. Host looks for ways to take advantage of renters and reasons to kick them out. Host is very nosy and videos you without consent. Host is unreasonable and has no compassion.
,,,"This place is a creepy, way out of the way, absolute dump. It would be the perfect setting for a movie about vacationers being murdered or a horror movie. We stay in a LOT of AirBNB‚Äôs and we know the difference between a place that is old and quaint and a place that is old, filthy, and creepy. This place is FILTHY. The host says she adhere‚Äôs to AirBNB‚Äôs ‚Äúenhanced clean‚Äù policy, but it is easy to see that no surface in this home has seen a cleaning product in decades. When we arrived, the toilet had urine and pubic hair all over the rim and seat. The sinks in the bathroom and kitchen were absolutely filthy. The ‚Äúlinens‚Äù, meaning hand towels and wash cloths, looked to be about 30 years old and looked like they had been used for that same length of time and never washed. The mattresses on the beds felt like they were 30 years old and had been scavenged from the local dump. There is a heating vent directly over the kitchen table that is covered in dust, hair, and lint. As you sit at the table, air blows this crap down all over you and your food-lovely. I guess you could say the place is ‚Äúmemorable‚Äù, but for all the wrong reasons, as in it will give you nightmares for weeks. There are visible bugs living inside the home. And a half eaten package of bacon, apparently for guests-who does this any time, especially in COVID times??? The only good part about our ‚Äústay‚Äù at this place was that we learned how to use AirBNB‚Äôs help desk and got to stay in a really nice hotel instead, for the same amount of money."
