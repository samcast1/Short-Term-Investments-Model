2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We really enjoyed our stay at Holly’s home! The decor was very inviting. There were clear directions throughout the home-even labels on the cabinets & drawers so it was easy to find things. Holly sent us friendly emails with information & answered my questions promptly. We especially liked the pool table & the large, open-concept kitchen where we baked some cookies as a family! Our stay there made for a lovely Christmas time together!"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,The house came with great amenities and provided everything we needed for a nice relaxing Thanksgiving vacation. It's central location makes it easy to get town to go out to eat or grab groceries. The neighborhood was quiet and relaxed. However the condition of the house was clean but not impressive.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay. It was incredibly clean and loved how everything was labeled and easy to find. I was visiting with a group of cheerleaders for the state football championships, and the spacious living room and kitchen was comfy and plenty of space to hang out in. Holly was very quick and helpful with her responses. I also appreciated that we didn’t have to do much for cleaning, it makes the cleaning fee very justified. The upstairs bathroom was a bit small for all 6 of us, but it helped that there were mirrors in most of the bedrooms! Great place to stay and would highly recommend"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,really good place for staying

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very nice house that was easy to find. Hot tub and pool table were both in great condition, and we enjoyed them both. Checking out was very easy and the list of things we had to do were very minimal- which validates the cleaning fee that was tacked onto this place."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a very comfortable place to stay. I would recommend to anyone.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Probably the most convenient and easy to deal with Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay,
Home was very spaciousand the extras for the kiddos and adults were GREAT!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Holly's house was perfect for our stay in Waterloo. The location was convenient, and the house was clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed, a fully stocked kitchen, grill, smart TV's pool table, and hot tub. We especially liked how well everything was labeled, it's a huge time saver at a place you aren't familiar with. Grocery and entertainment were close by and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. Holly was also very responsive and helpful. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to other travelers."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Holly was amazing at responding. The place is huge. Tons of space and games for children. And of course you can’t go wrong with a pool table, and hot tub. Which by the way. The hot was immaculate. You can tell they take care of it. Clear clean water. No signs of mildew or dirt."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very good Communication , wonderful house"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing experience here! Small town atmosphere, hardly saw anyone in the neighborhood but all well kept homes, and felt very safe. The house was exceptional! Floor plan was open and inviting, lots of room for many. Super clean, and the hot-tub was our main draw. It did not disappoint! Very clean and plenty of towels and all the things you would normally need. We really liked how things are clearly marked so finding a coffee mug, spoon or hot tub towel doesn't require opening every drawer and cabinet. Completely fenced in yard to let our dog run and investigate while we relaxed in the tub. Easy TV experience so we could log into our Amazon/Hulu, also has the ability for MANY other channels and good seating for many. Beds were very comfortable, and everything clean and tidy. Highly recommended particularly if you have a dog or want to relax in a hot tub. Would certainly return if in the area!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We very much enjoyed our stay in Waterloo. This home made it a nice relaxing place to come back too at night. Holly was a great host!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb was comfortable for our family of 8. The kitchen was large and the beds were comfortable. The 2 TV sets worked well so we could watch our College Football Teams and the kids could watch their cartoons. My family felt very at home during our 3 day stay. The neighborhood was very open and quiet.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,fantastic space for a family gathering. very responsive host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our stay at Austin's place was great. We came to go to the lost island water park so this location was great as it's only 5 minutes away. It was very easy to get into and we didn't have any problems. The place was super clean and decorated nicely. It was perfect for our group of 5 adults and 5 kids.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and nicely updated. Sitting in the hot tub in the morning was so nice. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. We would stay here again for sure.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Our family enjoyed our stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Perfect couple day get away for our small company trip. Lots of fun even for younger employees. Only a few minutes from lost island and close proximity to lots of other places. We all had a blast!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a perfect stay with room for family to hang out or stay over. Check in was a breeze and the host was very communicative.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Host was very easy to communicate with, and was very quick with her response time when I had questions. I loved the linens and the pillowcases and very comfortable beds. There were lots of games for my grandson to play and my son in law and daughter enjoyed the pool table. Everything in the kitchen was labeled so you didn’t have to hunt for utensils. Quiet neighborhood. If I had to pick one thing that could’ve been better, it would’ve been a bigger bathroom upstairs. It was about the size of mine at home, and it would’ve been nice to have a larger one on vacation but that by no means was a deal breaker. I would definitely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house worked perfect for our group. Fulled stocked with amenities. Quiet neighborhood, easy to get to, quiet patio to relax on. Highly recommend for your Waterloo Iowa stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are so happy with our stay. The house is beautiful, everything was clean and the neighborhood was lovely. I’m only disappointed that we only needed it for one night!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay! Easy/smooth check in and check out. Beautiful large backyard area was perfect for a summer hang out!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"HIghly recommend! Holly was quick and clear with communication. She was accommodating with some of our extra requests. The home is very inviting: clean, spacious and organized. We were there for a ladies' getaway and everyone of the six of us said we'd have been glad to stay even longer. We really enjoyed the hot tub. The beds were very comfortable; we all got a great night's sleep."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place had MORE than the amenities listed, which was a wonderful surprise. It’s so thoughtful how they tuck a small amount of baby wipes, makeup remover wipes, Q-tips, and feminine products in the bathroom. Holly was always incredibly responsive and I don’t think I ever waited more than a few minutes to get a response. Everything matched the description and exceeded expectations, especially for our very first Airbnb experience. Our main goal was to stay somewhere with enough space for a family of 5 but was also close to Lost Island theme/Waterpark. This was 100% a great choice."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! We had two families with 3 adults and 4 kids total. The house was spacious and allowed us to have separate spaces for both families. The furniture, beds and linens all seemed brand new. The kitchen is a good size with bar seating. There isn’t a dining table inside but we preferred to eat on the deck anyway where there is a table for 6. The kids loved the yard because it was absolutely huge. It is also fenced in so we didn’t worry about them going into other people’s spaces. The hosts let us know just before arrival that the hot tub was having problems and that some technicians were coming to look at it the following day. We appreciated the heads up but were very disappointed that it was not functional. The host said that a new one is being installed soon so I’m sure whoever stays there next will have a wonderful time. That was the only reason I gave them anything other than a 5 star rating in any category."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The group I was with felt right at home. We were in town for work, and the pool table, basketball hoop, grill, hot tub, and the home was a great place to kick back. Everything was well maintained and clean, as well. It's a great place and a great place for the size and amenities."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a great place to stay! It was close enough to everything yet far enough to be quiet and relaxing. The house was beautiful and large enough for the 6 of us who stayed. Holly was great at communicating and leaving instructions and expectations! Would definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic place, everything was labeled and had everything we looked for except garlic. Know going in that cleaning, service fees, and taxes total more then then adding another night, so you know that when your budgeting. That being said, I would definitely rent this place again. Really responsive, and felt comfortable the whole time we were there. Lots of room for the whole family to spread their wings. I don’t think there’s a thing they could add. Thanks Holly for a great time with my family"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Holly was very responsive to any concerns or issues we had. The toilet was running, & the hot tub seemed to have a leak but she responded to our concerns & we enjoyed our weekend with family & friends. Nice big back yard for outdoor games!!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great location for us to stay and visit family in the area. Holly is a superstar host. Very responsive. The instructions for everything at the house are thorough and we enjoyed our stay. The ability to bring our power was a clincher for us. The house is clean and there is plenty of room. The pool table provided us with some laughs and entertainment. We made some good memories here. 🙂
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our weekend away. we felt right at home and had lots of space for our 2 kids. We appreciated the cleanliness and ease of check-in. We enjoyed the friendly and quiet neighborhood. We ended up not using the basement, but the suite downstairs would be perfect for someone who loves a more private space. Holly was great at communicating and sent us clear instructions before check-in and checkout. This home was everything we were looking for. Highly recommend!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We so enjoyed being able to bring our dogs with us to this Airbnb, and loved the huge back yard for them.

We would absolutely stay here again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed this rental, the teenager loved the pool table and everyone loved the hot tub and beautiful back yard. We had the perfect weather to sit out back on the deck. All of the rooms were very comfortable, and everything was very clean.

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The stay was great. We had everything we needed!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This house was spectacular! Everything was clean and of high-quality. It was close enough to stores and restaurants if we wanted to go someplace while also being far enough “off the beaten path” that we felt secluded in the cozy neighborhood. The house was very spacious such that we could be together in a large group or we could spread out to have our own spaces. We highly enjoyed the hot tub and large deck outback. The backyard is huge! Austin and Holly were very quick to respond with answers to any questions we had. I would highly recommend staying there.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place! Great location and great communication!

Close to everything! Entertainment, Dining and Shopping of all kinds. This home is fantastic for a large family or group. This super host is communicative and prompt with replies. They have everything you’ll need from kitchen supplies to bathroom toiletries. There’s something for anyone in your group to enjoy here. Basketball in the extra large driveway. Both bball and football and pumps are provided, there’s a large backyard and fire pit for the family to gather and do s’mores, the back deck is great, but the hot tub was my favorite part. The guys all loved the pool table. The bedrooms were spacious with comfortable beds and bedding.
Austin home is exactly as described! It’s also in a family friendly Neighborhood. We will definitely keep this home on our list for this area!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Location was perfect for our plans. Plenty of room for our group of 8. House was very clean and had everything we needed.

Highly recommend!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great weekend! This home was prefect for our Girls Weekend. Everything you need and more in this house. The large kitchen was the meeting place for hanging out. Austin and Holly were the best hosts. Communication was very open. I didn't care for the no shoes in the house because it's not sanitary and socks are soooo hot but it was worth the inconvenience. This was our 1st annual Iowa Irishfest trip and if we can we will stay there every year.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place and prime location for Lost Island parks! Only 5 minutes away. Close to downtown too. The kids loved shooting some hoops, and playing pool. Communication and check in was great! We will be back!"

The 2nd bedroom was in the basement and it feels unfinished as you walk to the bedroom. Has all the amenities you need for a short stay. The listing said 2 bath but it was only one.

2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The House location is as described, we parked our car upfront without any problems. Plenty of places to walk the dog as there are some parks nearby. All the appliances in the house worked very well and the internet is fast, the smart TV’s in each room are the latest technology. It is an old house so the floors are noisy when moving about. Stairs to the basement are steep and only one light switch for the stairs. Plenty of towels and linens for everybody and the laundry facilities in the basement are roomy enough to do a few loads. Access to the house is by digital numerical entry code at the main entrance, no keys to fumble with. Be aware, there is only one bathroom in the apartment and it is tiny, the toilet is very close to the wall and the bathtub, I am 6’2” 230lbs with thick thighs and it was a tight fit for a comfortable experience. Overall, it was good and centrally located to the downtown area and for our needs. We showed up to the apartment one hour prior to check-in time and"

I always try to book one of Austin‘s places four my 4 sisters and parents because I know exactly what I’ll get. It’s an excellent purchase if you’re bringing in two or three hotel rooms worth, of family to stay in a very large house. Everything has been thought of and is in place for your visit.

The memory foam mattress was very comfortable in the main bedroom, and everything was clean and fresh. The bathrooms were the same, very clean and comfortable, and accommodating.

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was very nice and clean but as soon as we walked in it was very obvious that it had been smoked in. The hosts were very responsive to come over and try to get rid of the smell. It made it better but the smell was there all weekend. It was unfortunate because it was not the hosts fault that someone prior to us had smoked in it but it was also not our fault. There were signs up everywhere that said ""No smoking inside"".We were there for a wedding and our clothes ended up smelling and pillows we had brought also. The place was nice and the hosts as well but we were disappointed by the smell. Its sad that bad prior people were so disrespectful to the hosts and us. I hope that airbnb can help these hosts get some money to help get the smoke smell out.
Thank you to the hosts for all the effort to mitigate the problem."
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was great. Fit 12 people comfortably. The dart board was not up which we were looking forward to. The cleaning fee is $200ish which seemed a little steep relative to other comparable homes. Overall it was a nice stay.

Austin's place was clean, comfortable, spacious and provided awesome activities for the kids to keep them busy. There were added touches that made our stay convenient such as throw blankets, makeup remover wipes, shampoo, a great spice rack, etc.
The neighborhood was quiet and clean and the home situated close to an amusement park and a casino; fun for the entire family.
I can't wait to visit again in the warmer months to take full advantage of all this home as well as the location offer."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was very nice, and worked well for our family. It is a very nice location, and we would recommend staying there!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very responsive and friendly. Home was clean and just like the pictures on the site. Only stayed one night but would definitely be a great place to stay for several days.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location on a quiet street. Close to the highway and major attractions. The house was clean, cabinets had labels making necessary items easy to find. Comfortable beds and plenty of space for a large family.
If you’re looking for a great property in Waterloo this is it!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location, in a quiet neighborhood close to downtown and the amusement park."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We have stayed in an other property of these hosts. They are wonderful. Quickly respond and have been very flexible allowing us extra time for checkout. Houses are both awesome for families and pets. We will book again ! Thanks

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. The house was nicely decorated, the amenities we very nice. We had our dog with us, so the fenced back yard was great. The theater room was a great family space. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was fabulous! My college roommates and our girls stayed here for a girls weekend. Girls were busy with the movie room, game room and had their own rooms to hang out it! We ladies enjoyed the kitchen and living room - plenty of space! Very clean, off street parking - and the popcorn maker was a hit!
Definitely will see if we can stay again for the summer when we go to the Lost Island Waterpark!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay. Low price for very cool house.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Austin and Holly were flexible, friendly, and very responsive. It was the perfect size and location for our purposes. I would stay again."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We spent our family Christmas here and enjoyed ourselves.. hosts were incredibly nice and helpful.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"House was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for a great stay. The game room was a fun added bonus."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at Austin’s place in Iowa! Hosts communicate in a timely manner. We enjoyed foosball, darts, and the old school video games. It was a perfect stop for our family on our way back to WI from MO."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house and loved everything being clearly labeled making items easier to find quickly! Loved the theater room and my kids definitely want to come back in the summer time for the near by theme park!
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,I loved everything about my stay EVERYTHING WAS GREAT! EVERYTHING WAS CLEAN! EVERYTHING LOOKED EXACTLY HOW THE PICTURES SHOWS! I highly recommend this house
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,enjoyed ourselves very much!!! will definitely be back soon to stay with the same host!! great experience
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend this home!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great and fun for the guests.
I'd stay here again & would highly recommend it."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home with lots of room to gather. Arrived for the weekend to visit with family in Waterloo. We grilled out on Saturday and there was plenty of space for people to eat & visit. The pool table room was an absolute blast with the family and was so nice to have a social activity since it was too breezy for a fire that night. It was a short walk across the road to the river. Saw lots of snow geese and bald eagles. Morning coffee on the porch was so peaceful. The King size bed was very comfortable and everyone had a nice place to sleep. Would definitely book again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,The location and amenities were perfect for our trip! will rent again!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Home was bigger than expected and Scott was very quick at responding!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place to stay highly recommend
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay. It is a large home, more than I needed, but the home is very comfortable. The location was ideal."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I’ve stayed in many air bnbs and this was the best one in Iowa I’ve stayed in. So cozy, plenty of room, easy check in/ check out. The beds were very comfortable, plenty of blankets and lots of a good games. Scott was super responsive and kind. We all felt safe and comfortable. Will definitely be staying there again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Location was nice because a river walk was just across the street and there was lots of space on the property for our kids to entertain themselves and run around! There were a bunch of flies and fruit flies when we first arrived but probably because the previous guest kept the doors open too long or had food sitting out. Loved how peaceful the location was!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Scott and Brooke are great hosts, very responsive, and the house is perfect for a family gathering. Lots of room for kids to roam and plenty of room for family to congregate. Love the amenities (grill, fire pit, board games, lots of seating) and stay here whenever I’m in the area. Very convenient little park across the street as well."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was great. Scott was really flexible and super responsive to communication. The downstairs is renovated nicely, and I'm assuming he's working his way up. The kitchen had plenty of cookware to make a simple meal. There is no shortage on TVs which was nice for relaxing in the evenings before bed. We had teenagers and toddlers which obviously like different things. We didn't utilize the pool table area or outdoor spaces. We really just slept there. I will reiterate from other reviews that people with mobility issues may not be the best fit at this house unless they sleep on the couches downstairs. The footbed of the stairs is extremely narrow. We got used to it after a day or so, but it's unnerving at first feeling like you could easily fall down them. All that to say, we would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Scott’s place was in a great location and the house itself was perfect for our family of five. We had a great time playing pool, walking to the the Riverfront stadium for baseball games, and running on the beautiful path that starts just outside the house. Would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved easy access to bicycle path. Located just across the street We rode bicycles to both Waterloo and Cedar Falls attractions. The main floor had lots of comfortable lounging space with tons of windows. The kitchen and overall main floor had a modern comfy cabin feel. We also enjoyed grilling on the deck and sitting on the porch, which also had a nice ceiling fan. Plus we saw deer twice in the large backyard. We highly recommend a stay here!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and a nice place! Easy process!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We hosted a family reunion for 40 to 50 people. Plenty of room. The layout was perfect so different groups could have a place to sit and visit without shouting over everybody. Loved the outdoor area and the pool room was a bonus for a few people and the kids to have another space to go. The only thing that surprised me was dining table for 4 inside when I believe it can sleep 8. Six people stayed at the house it worked out fine for the 2 nights. Seemed to have everything needed except a drip coffee maker. Kuerig worked for one cup at a time. We made it work and the house was perfect for our event. It was a bonus surprise to find in Waterloo and it was the perfect place for that kind of event as everybody was from out of town.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay. Scott was very responsive to any concerns or questions we had. Nice, quiet and peaceful neighborhood. If we ever need a place to stay in Waterloo again we would definitely book it again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our 2nd time staying here and it was just as awesome as it was last time! Will absolutely be back!
2023-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you have asthma or allergies, you may want to avoid this home, or bring a powerful air purifier with you. We had to run out and by one, even though we have several at home.
The yard was nice and large and great for the dog to run and play and also for my child to play. Driveway was very larger and great for my child to ride her bike and just enjoy being outside. We were able to visit with old friends outside in the yard.
There was a wasp issue in the roof of the porch, but Scott was great at trying to alleviate this problem!
The stairs leave a lot to be desired, although we knew they would be an issue from the description. The house hadn’t been cleaned, but Scott refunded us the cleaning fee, which was quite appreciated.
Overall it was nice to have a large home and private large yard, and we spent most of our time outside. The boys loved having the pool table, as a bonus!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice location. Loved the space. The stairs upstairs are a bit steep and one uneven. It was ok, just be careful. We would definitely stay here again. Plenty of space for gathering indoors and outdoors."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house is very roomy & on a large property, we saw deer in the backyard and a fox,the grounds were pretty. I would definitely recommend Scott’s place especially if your a traveling professional"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a wonderful time at this beautiful home. It was a winter wonderland on the spacious property with the new snow and being able to use the wood stove was a nice touch! The individual heaters in the rooms allowed for each room to be at the guest comfort level. And the beds were sooo comfy. The kids enjoyed playing pool in the game room above the garage. We appreciated Scott's communication and would recommend this property to anyone!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Scott’s home was the perfect spot for us to host our family’s Secret Santa/gift exchange over the holidays, as many of us don’t live close by after moving out of state. Especially as most of us have pups (not kids) so to find a place in the Cedar Valley area that allowed dogs for this price was well worth it. Scott and Brooke were both super fast when it came to responding and made checking in and out super easy.
The open kitchen area and the connecting rooms on the main level were a game-changer. Lots of comfortable places to sit and hang. TVs in both rooms on the main level were great for our annual Mariokart tournament. And lastly, the wood-burning stove was incredible for the extra cold days we had during our stay too. Beds were comfortable and the upstairs shower had surprisingly good pressure, despite the age of the home.
All and all, we had a wonderful stay and can’t wait to return!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home - even better than the pictures! Scott was extremely responsive and flexible. There was a snow storm coming and he reached out a couple days in advance to make sure we were aware of the situation and make sure we were taken care of! We only had minor issues, but absolutely nothing worth removing a star. Will be back!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay & would return. Scott was very responsive and went above and beyond to make sure our stay went smoothly.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What an amazing home! Perfect for the family for the wedding weekend!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Scott’s place was great for our family weekend getaway. We loved it’s proximity to both Cedar Falls’s and Waterloo’s downtown as well as the Cedar Valley trails. The kitchen was well stocked and great for preparing several meals in and the beds were super comfy. Would recommend and stay again!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was beautiful and unique. It had plenty of room and everything you could possibly need. We will definitely be staying again if we are in the area. Without a doubt this is a great place to stay.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Big and well equipped house. Very comfortable. Great for family time. We really enjoyed the stay. We recommend it.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the house was everything we could have asked for. The beds were comfy, and there was plenty of room for our family of four to spread out. We had quality time in the large family room, baked a cake in the kitchen, played pool in the game room, and walked the trail by the river across the street. As others have mentioned, the stairs to the second floor are a bit steep, but nicely carpeted. Also, the pool table is above the detached garage, so you do have to go outside to access it. But there’s an effective space heater which warms the space up quickly. If we come back to Waterloo, we wouldn’t hesitate to revisit the house again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! Very spacious and very clean. Location was perfect and in a quiet neighborhood. Would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting the Cedar Valley area!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a great stay for my entire family. It was clean and spacious and close to Downtown Waterloo and Cedar Falls where there's lots of good restaurants and shops. It's super close to a wonderful walking path all along the river and there's a nice playground right across the street.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location. Host was great and responsive.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Everything was perfect!! The whole family had an amazing stay & absolutely found it to be awesome! Not 1 single negative thing was found or could be said. Lots of space, many options for rooms, kitchen was phenomenal, pool table room was fun! 100% would stay again."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This spot was perfect! The house was a great layout and had everything we needed. It made our time visiting for a wedding very enjoyable. The hosts were very attentive and responsive. Highly recommend staying here.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a perfect spot for my family. We had space to really relax and enjoy ourselves. We enjoyed eating on the deck and playing pool. We really liked how close it was to biking/walking trails and parks. We would definitely stay here again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,What a lovely home! I absolutely loved the large yard and didn’t even realize the park is right across the street. My child was very happy. We had family in town for a memorial and it was large enough for everyone to stop by and give their condolences and mill around. We will definitely be back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the location near the river! Great place to go back and relax after fun-filled days! We enjoyed the living room area A LOT!
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was perfect for our stay in Waterloo. Would be our first choice for any returning trips to the area. Thank you!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Scott responded quickly to us and helped us book it for that same day. Really appreciate him getting the air conditioning started on a hot day. Nice place!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When you here the cliche ""home away from home "", this is exactly what this was. Spacious, well stocked. Only thing I didn't like, no local TV to view, system glitched a lot. Grandson cried a couple of times because system kept logging in and out of the games.
Awesome area, quite, great walking trails. Very comfortable and conveniently located. Great kitchen. We loved our home away from home..."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Was a great stay for our family
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place was great! Very clean and has pretty much everything you need! Scott was very responsive. Definitely would recommend!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cool stay in the area. Lots of great spaces in the house. Nicely updated kitchen.
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We completely enjoyed our stay in the lovely home in Waterloo. We had everything we needed. The house was clean and comfortable. I really enjoyed reading on the porch as it always seemed to have a slight breeze.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Big place. Perfect for a group of friends. Highly recommend
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Scott’s place was great, truly a home away from home! Great neighborhood, the house has tons of space, and the covered porch with a ceiling fan was a great way to end the day!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect home for a weekend getaway! Quiet location with tons of space. We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area.
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used this Airbnb as a ""touch-down space"" for our wedding weekend. We had a lot of people in and out of the house and then we stayed there for two nights. For our purposes it was good - large community space, good seating, lots of natural light. The only thing I would change is that it was clearly being renovated, so there were some details that were overlooked (the paneling on the windows wasn't fully adhered, the faucets weren't completely bolted down, some open wiring). Plus we didn't have enough toilet paper or Kleenexes. The kitchen and tub were well-stocked though. Also be careful with the stairs...some are uneven and we had a couple people slip down them. While I wouldn't recommend this house for someone with mobility issues, it was fine and met all our needs as 20-somethings who just needed a living room and a bed!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful, clean home with great hosts that were attentive any time we needed anything. Would definitely recommend and would stay again if we are back in Waterloo. 10/10!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Large property and great home. Lots of privacy without being out of the way. Lots of room to sleep. Lots of parking. Pool table room was lots of fun. Great host is quick to respond to any questions. Very knowledgeable of the area if you need any recommendations. Highly recommend to all!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was/is great, and an incredible value. Way more space than expected in the living room/kitchen/dining areas. The upstairs hallway is a little snug, but the rooms are big enough, beds are comfortable, and there’s plenty of closet space. There was a slight miscommunication about the WiFi password which is now fixed. Back driveway area and yard is huge, but private. My kids loved it. If I’m ever back in the Waterloo area, I’ll definitely re-rent this place!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very spacious home located in a convenient and central location. Spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, and all the amenities of home. Huge yard and we got to see a family of deer wander thru one evening. We will definitely book here again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lots of room! Tons for windows! Very comfortable.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome house and amenities! Host are very responsive and striving to make stays be as homely as possible
10/10 recommendation!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place very spacious and modern we loved to be there ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice place to stay. Clean spacious and good location. TV’s were nice but we could not get any streaming apps to work. There are only like three tv channels. Perhaps this was a user error, but it was a bummer that it was not easy to navigate, especially because pretty much every tv these days has easily accessible streaming apps."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable. In a good location but traffic noise was quite loud.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had a nice stay. I had elderly people with me so I have specific observations. The beds are low but comfortable. I would recommend a taller elongated toilet. There are uneven planks of wood flooring in the hallway. While we love the character of the repurposed building, it is a potential tripping hazard to be aware of."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place, clean and modern with spacious living areas. Kitchen has the basics but if you plan to cook you might want to bring disposable items like foil, storage containers etc. We could not find a pitcher or ice cream scoop. These are not criticisms really, just notes for those who might want to cook a lot. Easy to check in and out."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"WOW, AWESOME, CARING, ACCOMODATING,
Kade is GREAT to work with. I needed to check in 2 hours early and he made it happen. His response time was 1 minute!! Please book with Kade, great area.
Rodney"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simple but comfortable place. Easy location! Convenient parking! Kade was super flexible and responsive! We will definitely stay here again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean, nice area.definitely booking again if I’m ever In Waterloo"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed with another couple to compete in the state darts tournament. It was basically half the price with twice the accommodations and space. We walked 2 blocks to the venue, so we didn’t have to drive. We cooked, instead of going out to eat. It’s a very nice place with secure entrance and off street parking. We would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We have stayed with Kade before, same building. Great, large space with everything we could want (photos are spot on). Across the street from Singlespeed Brewing- great local brewery and restaurant in an historic former Wonder Bread bakery, Sidecar Coffee a two-block walk, within a block from the Cedar Valley SportsPlex. Would stay again, again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Always great staying here.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was just as described, large and homey!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely, clean, well kept place to stay. Quiet and close to food and entertainment. I would recommend to anyone."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second time staying at Kade’s…love it! It’s super, clean, well-appointed. His communication is super and allowed us to stay past check-out to watch an IA women’s basketball game…much appreciated!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely love the place! such a home vibe and great view, location absolutely clutch! 10 out of 10!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place! Clean, spacious, and exactly what we were looking for! Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place was spot on with easy parking and for being in the middle of town it’s really quiet. When I’m in town for work I’ll definitely rebook.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and space.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kades place is located in an awesome old building. The shared areas in the old building are clean and updated. The apartment is lovely and updated. The old wood flooring is beautifully! It was cozy and so nice to have an elevator up to apartment. The beds were very comfortable and pillows were perfect. Bathroom was spotless and clean along with the kitchen. Kade was great at communicating and check-in was East peasy. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"excellent place, great host!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly like the photos, very clean, and beautiful space. Felt like you were right at home."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a really nice place in a great location. Communication was good. The apartment is spacious, clean, charming, and comfortable. The location is walkable to numerous restaurants and other amenities in Downtown Waterloo. We had some great food and beer right across the street at Single Speed brewery. We enjoyed walking along the waterfront and across the pedestrian bridge a couple blocks away. We also visited the John Deere Tractor Museum which is about a mile away and is really interesting and well done."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We’ve stayed here on multiple occasions when visiting family and it always works out well for us. Very clear directions for check in and easy parking on side of building.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The rental was extremely clean and loved the fact that the bedrooms were on opposite ends of the unit. The building was quiet and to our surprise we were actually able to walk to our venue. This rental was much better than staying in a hotel. Glad we decided to try out a airbnb.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect place to spend the night. The historic building is beautiful, and the apartment was very clean. It was easy to find the building and also to get into the apartment. I recommend staying here!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place! Very comfortable and large rooms. Great kitchen and huge bathroom. Loved this place--this is what Airbnbs are for.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures are accurate, the space was great for a family although in a commercial but quiet area. Kitchen was spotless and had enough equipment but I missed a kettle to make tea! Would recommend."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"clean and comfortable and in a great location. This was a work trip for a conference in Cedar Falls. I enjoyed being away from it all in Waterloo, but still so close. I also enjoyed being a block from the art center and a wonderful Saturday market. and the stop at Newton's before leaving the city!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. Clean, spacious and well equipped."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Couldn’t have found a better place. It felt like home for us… everything was great… We loved our stay..

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great newly renovated spacious apartment in good location. Quite for an apartment with share walls. Very clean with all the modern amenities you want but wrapped in a historic building. Highly recommended.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Return visit, thank you so much."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay, start to finish! Came to town for a family reunion and they were all just tickled to hear that this building is now apartments. Top level apartment, clean and clutter free, modern, with easy access to all things Waterloo. I’m a picky guest and this was a perfect stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place very centrally located and walkable to everything downtown
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Don't hesitate to make your reservation here with Kade. You won't be disappointed. We were impressed with the cleaniness of the flat which is our top priority. We also loved that it was within walking distance of Sidecar coffee which we highly recommend now that we've tried it, as great coffee is next on our list of priorities. :)"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Responsive host! The couch was broken and a piece of artwork fell off the wall, but those are easy to replace. The apartment was spotless and so cute!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! It was a really neat area. We have a one year old who needed to nap before a wedding and Kade made it to where we could check in a little early, which was so helpful and kind. Beds were very comfortable. Thank you!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very pleased with everything. Especially nice to have Single Speed Brewery right across the street. Big line up of their own brews and menu with something for everyone! Family friendly atmosphere.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much for being so accommodating, quick to respond to any questions we had and for providing an excellent and clean place for our stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect for a quick trip thru the area. very clean and updated
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This being our first Airbnb stay, we had no idea what to expect. There is off-street parking, and a secured door system. Kade walked us through all steps needed to get into the apartment, which was very large and accommodating. The kiddos were shocked to find not only one tv, but three. Plenty of room for sleeping and a large bathroom with shower. Clean, neat, and tidy.
Be aware, there are Iowa Hawkeye coasters on the end table. We flipped them over, but ended up having to use two of them for our sweaty drinks on night two.
Awesome for a family of four and about 10 minutes from the Lost Island Theme and Water Parks. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Just what we needed.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kade’s place was the perfect in town getaway. I made a last minute booking late at night and was able to get in touch with Kade and get in right away. We had easy access to restaurants and city events and the bedrooms were both huge. We liked that they were on opposite sides of the apartment, giving us privacy and space to be alone. The living room tv was huge, and each bedroom enjoyed its own large flat screen to.
I’d definitely recommend this place and will most likely be back in the near future."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,kade was an excellent host
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a very nice place to stay that was quiet at night and clean. I had a little trouble finding the room on the floor but only for a minute because the numbers for other units in the hall seemed numbered strangely ( not the hosts fault). I was surprised how big and clean it was. Would defiantly recommend it.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great host. Beautiful place.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay was one night. We were thrilled for the elevator. Views were fun city views.
One bathroom for two couples worked fine for one night. Large rooms. Looks just like the pics.
We had a question about what door to enter but Kade responded immediatley to our request and got us in the right door. Entrance is right at parking lot - so convenient.
QUIET neighborhood and apartment."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kade was great about communicating and then, allowed us an extra late check-out time…which was most appreciated. And, the property itself was lovely, very nicely decorated and clean. We enjoyed the dining accommodations at Single Speed across the way."

Kade allowed me to check in 3 hours early with no hesitation. As soon as I send an email with a question it seemed like he got back in touch with me when 30 seconds. The price was amazing for this area and for the unit. I'll be telling all of my friends and family about this unit especially when they come in to Waterloo, Iowa from out of town. Great job Kade!!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kade’s place is located in a great area of Waterloo with restaurants and great coffee nearby. Make sure to check out Gray Lane Yoga on the first level of the building!

Easy access to the building from parking lot. Unfortunately we did have items stolen from our vehicle either while we were unloading at night or loading up in the morning. Keep vehicles locked or attended to while unlocked no matter how short a period. The location was great and we felt safe otherwise. Kade responded to all messages in a timely manner."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The place had everything we needed and the photos accurately depict the unit. Very easy entry to building and unit. East facing big windows brought in great light. Convenient to downtown amenities. We would definitely stay here again.

Great parking and security. Lots of room in both bedrooms, bathroom, living room and kitchen. Wish we would have had more time to just hang out in the space and enjoy! Excellent location within short walking distance of Single Speed Brewery, who also serves food. Soooooo much better than staying in a boring 'ole hotel."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful home! It’s as described on the listing. All was very clean. Beds were comfortable. We loved sitting out on the deck. The view is beautiful.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Beautify home with gorgeous views of the river. Serene and perfect. We loved every moment we spent in here. Better than pictured. Chris has provided everything you might need and then added so many extras that made the stay special. Book this place and you will not regret it. The garage is on the ground floor with an air hockey table and an inviting outdoor space complete with a swing. Up one flight of stairs is the main living area (open concept living/dining/kitchen with high ceilings and tons of light, along with the master bedroom/en suite bathroom, and an extra bathroom) with a large wrap-around deck that is lovely at any time of the day. On the 3rd level are two additional bedrooms and a bathroom, along with a seating area."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is so beautifully done and was perfect for our family, especially with our toddler and infant. We were visiting for the holiday and the house was so cozy to come home to after a long day visiting with family. They had toys and baby supplies at the house, which helped entertain our son throughout the day and helped us feel right at home. The host is phenomenal and helped us out last minute when we accidentally forgot our passports at the house before catching our flight. I can’t say it enough how grateful we are for his generosity. We would love to stay here again in the future when visiting Iowa and highly recommend this home for all your travel needs!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great access to Cedar Fall and Waterloo, now that Waterloo has electric bird scooters they were conveniently near the park next the the house. Was able to ride all around to Sans Souci Island across from the house to downtown waterloo in 15 minutes. I would suggest riding the scooters down to the waterloo public library and going to the Waterloo Riverfront where they have a park for the kids. Great access to the Boat House in Waterloo as well. Walking distance! We had a fun time fishing and kayaking. The only darn thing was those darn Spanish lady bugs. Chris was responsive. The neighborhood was quite and fun. The fire pit out side was a great touch."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home overlooking The Cedar River. Very clean and well kept! Kids books and toys. Nicely equipped kitchen. Comfy couch. We (6 adults of all ages and a toddler) had a lovely time, there was plenty of room for all of us to be together and separate!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is beautiful and immaculately cared for. Everything was very clean and there are nice amenities provided in the home -- all of the basics that you could need during your stay. Check-in and check-out instructions were very clear and helpful. Do note that the neighborhood the home is in is not the greatest; however, the house is well secured and the second-story deck provides a nice outdoor space with a great view of the river and park on the opposite side. The open floorplan and large living room provided the perfect, comfortable space to socialize. The beds and pillows are comfortable; however, they are on the smaller side (there was some confusion as to whether or not they are queen or double/full size mattresses). If you have kids joining you, this would be the perfect home -- there are retractable safety gates already installed at the top and bottom of the stairs and all kinds of kid-friendly entertainment -- from books to toys, you won't need to bring anything with you!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely home and location! Chris’ place was pristinely clean, spacious, and had all that we needed to enjoy our visit. The house has plenty of gathering spaces, beautiful bathrooms, comfortable beds, and lots of kitchen equipment for cooking and dining. The views of the river are gorgeous, and the river bike trail is just outside the door. I highly recommend Chris’ place and would stay there again if back in the area."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed for a long weekend to celebrate our daughter's graduation from UNI. The place is absolutely beautiful. The finishes are high end. The views are incredible. There were 3 couples. Perfect area to be together and celebrate but private space to duck away and relax. We have stayed at rental homes all over the U.S. and Caribbean for years. This met or exceeded all of our expectations. Chris was a wonderful host.

It was in a great location especially if you are wanting to be able to walk to restaurants and bars. I also felt safe in the building. I was only in town for one night but if I am back in Waterloo I would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing place to stay. Spent 2 nights while in town visiting friends. Was a perfect spot to relax at the end of the day.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect spot!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute apartment. Love the old industrial feel. The balcony with full grill is a nice perk. Full appliances and large kitchen was nice to have to cook in. Could use a few more dishes so I don't have to wash every day out of convenience. But the dishwasher is a nice perk as well. Super close to Allen hospital and right in the midst of a few area restaurants. Kristina is Super responsive. Thanks for a great place to lay my tired head. ~kc

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would stay here again in a heartbeat, able to walk to different places and privacy at the same time while you at the loft. I booked this loft late but Kristina handled everything with professionalism and the next day I was booked with no problem.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I stayed here for three months! The place was in a great location downtown next to everything. Kristina was very responsive anything that I needed handled or anything that I needed fixed was literally fixed within 24 to 48 hours. The Airbnb is definitely better than the pictures, obsessed with the kitchen . mattress is really comfortable and I love the outdoor patio area. I felt safe my entire stay, book here you won’t regret it!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. Location was great. Place was clean.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We enjoyed the location and security of the space. The close proximity to the Cedar Valley Sports Complex and to the running paths next to the Cedar River were a plus. The loft is well appointed which was beneficial during our month long stay. I would highly recommend this rental.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was so great. I was speechless.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"easy checkin, good location, and a nice place to stay!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay in the loft. Great building with loads of character. Nicely renovated, better furniture than many places I've stayed, and the outdoor patio was a bonus. A/C worked well and plenty of fans and overhead lights. Appreciated the free parking in the back with direct access to the building and its elevator. Would recommend this loft to anyone looking for a place to stay downtown for a week or weekend."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful stay. I loved the location and cozy feel. Definitely will be back
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"I booked this Loft for 7 nights, in town to visit friends and family. Great location downtown. Beautiful Lincoln Park and numerous eateries. The bed was clean and comfortable. I enjoyed the modern kitchen & bath. Unfortunately I could only give it 3 stars, there were some BIG misses. I had asked about the cookware & patio weeks prior to my arrival. To my dismay the cookware was dirty and every piece was severely scratched Teflon. The patio was lovely except for a bunched up rug under the table, obviously not cleaned or moved for a very long time. Mold and mildew very present. When someone came to remove it, I helped move the table, when she moved the rug to heave over the balcony into the alley, a swarm of moth like bugs flew out. Unacceptable. No wash cloths or dish cloths/sponges, I had to purchase some. Cobwebs present in windows. Throw rugs and area rugs appear to need a cleaning. This is a great spot, with more attention to detail and cleanliness it could be a 5 star."
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed about a week,"I have stayed at the host's other apartment in the same building previously, and it was very clean and neat, wonderfully comfortable bed. I am not sure at all what happened this time or what was going on, but my stay at this apartment was absolutely my worst airbnb experience in the 6 years I've been using it. The bed was so old, it sagged horribly in the middle, had no support, and completely broken down on one side (to the point there was a huge broken hole in it, I'm not sure how whoever made up the bed could have missed the state of this). I ended up sleeping on the couch that night, both because the bed was unusable but also because it was unclean. The comforter and pillows smelled musty and not clean, and when I pulled back the sheets to take the top sheet to put down on the couch, I found someone's used socks stuffed at the bottom (which made me feel that the bed had just been made up after the last person stayed there, but the sheets hadn't been changed/cleaned). There were numerous other cleanliness concerns in multiple other places in the apartment, to the point where I had to leave and find another place to stay for the rest of my trip (which was very stressful). The host did absolutely support my getting a full refund back from airbnb (which I did get), and apologized. They would be doing a deep clean of the whole apartment and getting a new mattress in. Again, my experience with their other apartment was very positive, so I assumed it was a safe bet I would have the same experience this time. I don't know what was different, but I do hope it gets addressed for future guests, because they are both cute apartments in a nice historic building with an amazing location. But as I said, this was by far my worst airbnb experience and I was pretty horrified at it all."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Well appointed and easy access with the rear elevator! We had our small dogs and the park nearby provided a nice place to walk them.

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Great spacious loft with huge ceilings and good storage space. Modern and all amenities were functional and accurate.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Modern loft. Great space! I wish I had had time to enjoy the balcony and grill. The host responded quickly to my queries. Be sure to go by the address the host sends you. Do not click on the Airbnb link for directions. They reversed the building number with the unit number.
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This loft is in a great location. We brought our dog and there’s a park right across the street which was great. Kristina was very communicative and it was easy to check in and check out. Fast internet, quiet, and parking was easy. The only issue we had was the mattress. It was quite old and sagged in the middle quite a bit which made for a sore back in the morning. But other than that it’s a great spot!"

Highly recommend if you are staying anywhere in the Waterloo, Cedar Falls, Waverly, etc. area!"

2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kristina was incredibly helpful, super quick to reply, the net result being a trouble free stay. The place has soaring ceilings with what seem to be a lot of original finishes, tastefully brought forth into this century. It was centrally located to local establishments, but still quiet. It offered all of the amenities you'd want in a home away from home. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed here twice. Why? Residence accessibility is easy, from checking in/out, accessing local eats/drinks and commuting to neighboring towns whatever your business may be. Communication with Kristina is fluid, from the reservation request to checking out. When I'm in the Waterloo area for business this is where I stay."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is amazing. 14 foot ceilings, in a historic building. The loft was very clean and well appointed.

2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great loft close to everything! Kristina was very helpful and professional.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kristina was a great host, we couldn't have asked for more personal service. If we ever had any questions, she would answer almost immediately. In addition, the condo was just as it looked in Airbnb photos. Very comfortable and quiet. It was a great location for us as we left Waterloo in 1961 and it gave us a chance to spend some time downtown and see all the changes. Many restaurants and nightlife in the immediate vicinity. We will definitely use again when we are in town."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean lofts and quiet, felt like we were the only ones in the building. Great hidden jewel!"

2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed for one night while making a trip from Columbus, OH to Mt. Rushmore. This place is fantastic! Located in a beautiful old historic building in the heart of downtown Waterloo, the apartment is completely refurbished with all the best modern amenities. The full kitchen contains everything you need, the TV has cable TV and a DVD player, and the bed is super comfy! Check in and out was super easy, with the door locks using the August app to lock and unlock. But Kristina is just a call away should you need anything. I will definitely stay here again should I be in the area!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment has a perfect location in Waterloo. It is walking distance to great restaurants and the river. The apartment is beautiful!
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is a great location in Waterloo with assigned parking. Large patio to enjoy the evening. Location is adjacent to multi places to eat and drink and also enjoy great local music. My favorite is walking all around the city and by the river (would bring my bike next time). This is a beautiful building with renovation to update the kitchen and bath but retaining the historic charm of the building. I would definitely recommend.
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The lofts were a great location for my business trip. Communication was smooth, quick, and easy to understand.

A well kept building and a comfortable space. Kristina is friendly, helpful, and available as needed. I definitely recommend the loft for your visits/stays in Waterloo!"
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best experiences I've had on AirBNB to-date. I come to Waterloo quite a bit for business, and for personal, and this is by far a superior option to any hotel in the area. What a great location, the loft is incredible, and everything is perfect. I'd recommend it for those looking for one night, or even those on an extended stay - The pictures don't do it justice, and it's great!"
2017-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place in the heart of downtown Waterloo. Kristina's communication is second to none. Probably the best host I have ever had with travel services like airbnb etc. Do your self a favor, skip the crummy hotels and stay here, you will not regret it!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pamela's place is awesome and our guests could not have loved the accommodations more. I am not a victim of recency bias either but if you are reading this review, and are trying to decide if you want to stay, stop looking right now because this is the top of the line. Do not be nervous about her a bit lower rates either - I believe she should charge more and based on the experience, I would pay more during our next conference."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is worthy of all the raves. It looks just like the pictures. It was spotless, very well appointed, quiet, and comfortable. The hosts have gone above and beyond with the little extras like snacks, toiletries, books (for kids and adults), bikes, yard games, etc. I am looking forward to my next stay. Highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We feel very lucky to have found this rental! It is so roomy and clean, and has all the amenities we could want.

Many thanks to the hosts for providing such a lovely rental!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything about Pam and Lynn's place was perfect! We walked in after a long drive to warm scones waiting for us on the counter. The place is furnished with everything you would ever need and things you wouldn't have thought of. The neighborhood is in a great location and just a short run or drive to UNI campus. We look forward to staying there again. Thanks for everything Pam and Lynn!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Place is amazing has a nice home touch. Also having books for adults and kids and toddlers as well as toys would make it good for family’s. Was able to read to my son over FaceTime while away for work because there were some kids books.

I don’t have the words to describe just how amazing this place is!
Thank you so much."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for a few days because I was working in the area. It was nice to come back to a place that felt like home. Pam and Lynn are the best hosts I've ever had. The day of my check in, there was a big snow storm coming and Pam messaged me and said I could check in whenever I could to stay ahead of the storm. When I arrived there was a muffin on the counter, that was delicious, with a note from Pam wanting to know what time I planned on leaving in the morning so she could be sure to clear the driveway off so I could get out. Pam and Lynn you guys are awesome and you will be the first ones I look for the next time I come up for work."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pamela was a great hostess. The entrance for our apartment was around the back of the house and one night it was pouring down rain. Pamela kept an eye out for us and opened the garage door for us. She is very thoughtful and thinks of everything!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is perfect if you are visiting UNI. It is so thoughtfully decorated and outfitted for a very comfortable stay. It's a great value as well. I will always try to book either of Pamela's properties when I am in town.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A million times better than staying in a hotel when I visit my daughter and her family. I loved that the hostess checked in on us the morning after check in. She supplies everything you would need for a comfortable stay. Love the decor as well!

Check in was very easy and I met both Pam and Lynn. We had a problem with the TV and Lynn came over immediately and helped to get the TV up and running. Very nice people! The space is super clean and inviting. So many extras in case you forgot something. This is the best stocked place I have ever stayed. Easy to make meals if you choose to do so, we used the grill both nights and it was great to be able to stay in and eat. The kitchen is well stocked with anything you would need. Definitely one of our top 3 Airbnb stays! I highly recommend a stay at Pam's place if you are in the area. We had a wonderful stay and would not hesitate to stay again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best Airbnb properties we have ever stayed in. It is in the lower level of a ranch-style home with walk-out basement, but finished as nice or better than most homes! I mean it has top-grade finishes, was supremely clean, and beautifully appointed with everything one would need. We wish we had had more time just to enjoy the space. Pam is a very responsive, good host. I cannot recommend it highly enough."

Pamela was incredibly friendly and very responsive. We would definitely stay here again!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying here when visiting Iowa for a long weekend to check out Lost Island theme park. Pamela’s space was a great, comfortable, relaxing place to crash after a long day! Very clean, very welcoming and lots to do. Would definitely stay again!"

You really don't need to bring anything, the bathroom has all the things you need, there were plenty of coffee and tea choices, and milk in the fridge. It felt very welcoming, a home away from home."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second time staying at this Airbnb and it is one of our favorites! It has the look of a newly renovated boutique hotel with all the cozy comforts of your much cooler older sister's house who buys all the fun soaps, snacks, and cozy linens that you always wanted to try out.
Pamela was super helpful and responsive. She made sure the pack n play was set up for us and helped make biking back and forth to campus a breeze! I was grateful to use her bike, helmet, and bike lock.
The kitchen is perfectly appointed and made breakfasts a breeze before the family headed out for the day. We even enjoyed the cute outdoor patio with adorable lighting one evening while we enjoyed some ice cream from a local restaurant.
There is plenty of space in this Airbnb for our young family, and the puzzles and toys provided made it even better for the littles. They even had time to watch a movie on the fire stick one evening! The kids love staying here and so do we!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pamela was a friendly, thoughtful and responsive host. Her place was spotlessly clean, beautifully furnished and had toys for our kids. We had a great stay!"

The space is so well equipped for anything and everything and Pam and Lynn are extremely generous with the amenities including baked goods for that first breakfast, coffee, tea, and snacks galore.

Pam and Lynn, we’re absolutely lovely and amazing. Everything that we could have possibly asked for or required was provided for.
I stayed with my family of five as we were in town for a family matter. Pam accommodated our arrival as we we’re coming in from Canada and overall made a difficult trip extremely light and peaceful.
5-Stars isn’t enough to describe how great you have been to us.
I highly recommend staying with Pam and Lynn if you’re ever in the area."

When we contacted Pam about the grill, she was more the willing to get wheeled down from the garage. The backyard was perfect for playing catch and corn hole (which Pam provided for the place). Pam also was so kind to invite us to use her basketball goal to shoot some hoops. We enjoyed our stay, and will return again and again. Thank you Pam!!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of a kind. Most well-appointed BNB I have ever stayed in. If you needed something it was most likely there already. There were fresh muffins for us when we arrived and so many extras. We were there in the winter and our entrance was shoveled almost as quickly as it had snowed. I don't want to talk it up too much because we need a place to stay as well. 😁
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"From arrival and beyond, everything about our stay was wonderful! Pamela takes great effort to ensure her guests stay is just that way!! The living space was so comfortable and charming! Lots of extra towels, linens and throws available to make sure we were comfy, as well as a basket of toiletries just in case we forgot anything. My daughter was thrilled that there was a guitar she could play! There were muffins from a local coffee shop upon arrival, lots of breakfast options, as well as a fully stocked Keurig/coffee station to make our mornings so stress free! She checked in with us several times during our stay to ensure all was well, which was really sweet of her! We loved our home away from home visiting the Cedar Valley community and would definitely stay there again in the future should we return."

The pictures don't do justice as this space is amazing. Check in & out is very easy.

There is nothing that we could have wanted that wasn't already thought of and prepared for us.
Look no further, this is the place to stay!
Many thanks to Pam & Lynn!"

The space was exactly as pictured and described and impeccably clean. We would highly recommend this place!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pam will ruin your motivation to ever stay in a hotel ever again. Very clear instructions but insistent on making yourself at home and be their guests. Clean but cozy, welcome snacks, notes all around the house for the grill, sheets, comfy blankets, and insiting you use them, fully stocked with all the things you might have forgotten, the most comfortable beds.... I'm going to have to get a new one at home now! I only wish we could have spent more time there. We were gone most of the time. We will definitely be back ♡"

Very spacious, tons of helpful notes, massive amounts of kitchen, bathroom and other items that are nice to have on hand. I got the sense that Lynn and Pamela are the type of people who get genuine satisfaction out of caring for others. Book it! You won’t be disappointed."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Listing is very accurate and they really put the welcome into AirBnB. Very comfortable with everything you could think of needing--and then some. There were generous snacks and a Keurig and we really wanted for nothing.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! So welcoming and just what I needed. Pam and Lynn definitely know how to host guests because they have thought of seemingly everything! I wish I was staying longer so I could take in all the small details of this place.

Awesome location as well, only took 5-10 minutes to get really anywhere I wanted."

I will stay here whenever I return to Cedar Falls."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Everything we read about this listing proved to be true in the reality of our experience. This was our first AirB&B stay and the bar has been set at a high mark for comparison with our next stay.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"If you find yourself in the Cedar Falls area in need of a place to stay, look no further! I have stayed at a couple dozen Airbnbs in the last 4 years and this was the nicest one hands down. The space is great, neat, clean, roomy, and very well equipped. But the real game changer is how attentive Pam is to your needs. She definitely goes above and beyond to make your stay great. When she learned we were bringing a toddler, she baby proofed the whole place, offered a pack n play, and even left some toys for her to play with! Communication via text during the stay was easy. You can tell she really takes joy in having her guests comfortable and happy."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,5 star hosts with a great spot at a great location in Cedar Falls
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a female in my sixties, and I was visiting 2 friends in C.F. as a solo trip. The stay in the walk-out apartment was excellent in every way. The check-in was easy with the code access. The apartment is spacious and just like the pictures - contemporary and beautiful to be in. Also well thought out.

I really enjoyed getting my exercise walking here.
I definitely be staying again."

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We love this modern and updated space. Lots of space to use as you please. Loved the decoration and the cute patio to enjoy in cooler parts of the day. Loved the patio furniture and big grill for cooking on.

Neighborhood is very nice too, I walked around every day exploring. Hosts are very kind and inviting; place has many amenities ready for you when you arrive. Nice to have bikes available as well. Somewhat close to restaurants and about 15 minutes from town down Cedar Falls. Local coffee house, Sidecar Coffee, is definitely worth going too.
The hosts are quick to respond to messages if you need anything. Would definitely stay here again."

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pamela's place is exactly what we needed for a relaxing weekend! It is stylish with everything we could need and incredibly clean. Pamela even had pound cake from a local coffee shop waiting for us which was a thoughtful personal touch that we greatly appreciated.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pam and Lynn, Blake and Caitlin provided the best, hospitable, home-feeling environment I've ever experienced from an Air Bnb and I travel a lot. Totally beyond my expectations"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The special touches are 10x what I have seen at other Air bnbs. It is all new design. Amazing decor with hotel like towels and mattress.
2020-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was very well decorated and Pam was very caring to leave snacks and toiletries for guest to use. Very cozy place. I really appreciated the commitment to the Airbnb cleaning standards.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Pam and Lynn are the epitome of a superhost! The house was Exceptionally clean and well appointed with all modern touches. The hosts take the time and attention to detail to leave personalized notes and treats. It was a nice touch after a 15 hour trip from Georgia to the Cedar Valley.
The home is located in a quiet neighborhood just minutes to UNI, shopping, and a cute downtown with nice shops and restaurants that cater to almost any taste. Within minutes, you can be enjoying the hundred+ miles of bike and walking trails and wildlife views. There are even bunnies and fat squirrels just out the back door. If you want to explore the trails, they will let you borrow a bike.
There are a couple of noteworthy things if you are reading this review to decide on a place to stay. These are not complaints at all, just details.
There is a family upstairs with small children and a dog. You will hear them living life and being kids, so playing, crying, learning. they were never a bother to me, but if you aren't used to having kids around, it may be to you.
Laundry>the laundry is not en suite, it is upstairs and shared with the family that lives there. DUE TO COVID, they have (very understandably) stopped allowing access to the laundry. If laundry is back open when you book, just know you will need to coordinate laundry time with them. During my stay, we made other arrangements, and it worked fine for me. The hosts are doing all they can to make things work during a very difficult time.
Temperature: the thermostat is upstairs and controlled by the family there. They do have remote temp sensors in the area and keep an eye on the temp so they can make adjustments. It was within my comfort level the entire stay, and I did use the space heater to warm the bedroom for a few minutes before sinking into the comfy bed.
You can't go wrong with this location, and Pam will move earth to make sure your stay is wonderful."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second visit to Cedar Falls, and both times my family was blessed enough to stay in this beautiful space. Pamela is the queen of adding in the ""extra touches"" that make staying here so comfortable and welcoming. There are handwritten notes and treats waiting for you when you arrive. There are plenty of linens, toiletries and a kitchenette that is well stocked w/ what you need...you can't go wrong! The layout is open and inviting. If you need anything, Pamela and her family are there quickly and are very responsive to anything you would need. Although we didn't need anything...because it was already there! I'm happy we were able to spend a very special Thanksgiving in this wonderful space. Thank you Pamela and family!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is an amazing space. Pamela has created a welcoming and comfortable space that feels like home. There is plenty of room and the Amenities are fantastic. My son and I had an amazing time.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I strongly recommend the place for your stay in Cedar Falls.It’s safe, cozy and comfortable accommodation I ever found.

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were so grateful to have a beautiful retreat for our stay in Cedar Falls. Pamela has thought of everything to make guests feel at home.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pamela has spared no convenience in accommodating her guests. Everything from premium brand snacks to high-end bedding, to include the mattresses. These many subtle luxuries that are provided gives the experience the feeling that you are truly welcomed. Pamela's warm hosting is extended by everyone you encounter. The perfect amount of ""host contact"" to let you know she's there to accommodate your stay in any way possible. I could go on and on about how nice her Airbnb is but I'll leave that for you to experience."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This space is truly a great find! Nice quiet neighborhood, considerate hosts, plenty of space, and so many details that have been thought of. I didn't want for anything!
I stayed here on my own for a week while traveling for work, but I could easily see it being perfect for a couple of friends or small family anytime. It was spacious and very comfortable.
Highly recommend!!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Pamela was the best host and her place was the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at. She was incredibly accommodating for our two babies, and she was very helpful with sending us some items we forgot. The place was very clean, had all the cooking items you could need and was even better looking in person than in the photos. We will definitely try to stay here again in the future."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a lovely and roomy basement space in a nice neighborhood. It was very clean and had great amenities for our small family. Pam’s communication was great and we felt well taken care of for the weekend.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing stay in Cedar Falls! We stayed for two nights while visiting a friend who was staying downtown. The space is so thoughtfully designed and there are so many extra amenities and fun kitchen gadgets that we wished we spent more time there! The apartment comfortably fit the three of us, each working remotely during the day and creating our own office 'space' without being in each others way. Pam and her family are so thoughtful and kind, making our stay feel extra special. Thanks again!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Pam is really nice. Loved our stay

Super comfortable beds, extensive attention to Covid cleaning protocols and breakfast treats were very appreciated. We took advantage of the great patio space and grilled out. Would definitely stay here again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was such a pleasure to stay here for three weeks during my husband's business travel. What could have been a very uncomfortable travel experience due to the current circumstances with the pandemic has turned out to be a wonderful AirBnB experience that exceeded our expectations! Pam took the utmost care when preparing the apartment for our stay, as well as when she handled the laundry during our time here. We sincerely appreciate the conscientiousness! Everything that Pam did for us made us truly feel right at home. The food that was left for our first breakfast there, the welcoming notes, and the fact that she had thought of anything we might need made such an impact. In addition to all the kitchen and bath supplies we might need, Pam had gear and toys to keep our kids (ages 6 & 2) comfortable, too! While we spent most of our days out and about, it was always so great to come back here in the evening to rest our heads (on the most comfortable beds/pillows, too!).

Location: Community off leash dog park a block away. Five different restaurants within a two block radius. Lovely local coffee shop on the next block over and a bakery featuring gluten free options across the street. We’d definitely stay again."
