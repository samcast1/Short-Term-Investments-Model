2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,loved the experience!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Anne’s. Staying in a grain silo was so unique (especially for me, New Englander). Our suite was so clean. It had everything we needed for a perfect overnight. The furnishings were tasteful and the bed was so comfortable. The views from the living room and upstairs out to the Lake were beautiful, the grounds perfectly manicured and we loved our stay in Alexandria. I would go back in a heartbeat."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a weekend getaway! Experience exactly as described. Staying in the Luxury Grain Bin was great. Super clean, beautifully put together, great views. Highly recommended!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Great getaway! Extremely peaceful to spend a couple nights. Will definitely visit again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a cool place to stay the night! Great location, too!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anne has a beautiful clean place. We loved being able to just hang out and relax for the weekend. Located far enough out of the city to be quiet but close enough to shopping and dining if that’s more your thing too. We look forward to booking Anne’s place again and highly recommend it for a weekend getaway.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a great cozy experience! Everything was super clean and decorated with simplistic beauty!!!
We enjoyed an area restaurant eith great food for our anniversary. We both felt in tune with the uniqueness of the silos and wpuld definitely come agsin!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was absolutely beautiful and peaceful! We enjoyed our stay!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place just to get away!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay, wonderful place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place met our expectations, we were in the luxury suite 2 story grain bin, it was clean and easy to get into, we did not see anyone the entire time we were there expect for the people waiting to clean our room promptly at 11am when we checked out. The scenery was stunning and beautiful, we did not know it was a wedding venue, so it was fun walking around and exploring the property, swinging on the swings and walking down the aisle, it looks like a magical place for a wedding. No one was around so it felt as if we had the whole place to ourselves. If your looking for a place that is quiet, secluded, and beautiful, I would recommend this place, the novelty of sleeping in a grain bin was charming."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I had a great experience here. It was nice and cozy. We really enjoyed and loved our stay here. We definitely want to come back.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location! Close to the brewery/winery and just a short drive into town. Very cute and quaint space. Would definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a fun and different place to stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,What a peaceful and unique place to stay! We sure enjoyed staying in the grain bins along with two other couples. Don’t miss out on this one if you are coming to the Alexandria area. Thanks for everything! Kathy

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay was absolutely perfect! This air b’n’b was beautiful & exactly what we were looking for! Definitely recommend for a fun get away!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I have stayed here before & loved it but this experience didn’t live up to those expectations. Anne addressed the issues & we would definitely return!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place. Super quiet and peaceful. Great night of sleep. Close to a local winery/brewery. Close enough to town where restaurants are a quick drive. Great experience!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Only hiccup was lack of clear instructions on how to enter the room, but that was not really Anne's fault. She responded to a call right away and I was able to get in. Such a peaceful setting to roam around a bit and the property is so close to Carlos Creek winery- made a great night to celebrate my BFF's 40th. Our room was clean, simply and tastefully decorated and had lots of bright sunlight. I would definitely come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the cutest place for our anniversary getaway! The grain bins are so unique. The location was perfect-close to the winery and other restaurants for us to enjoy!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Silo was very unique! This was a comfortable and very quiet place.
We really enjoyed the experience and told all our friends about it!!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Really liked this place, unique, very well built"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cute place to stay!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, charming, relaxing, comfortable, super clean. Loved the Gathered Oaks venue and we arrived early to make sure we didn’t miss sunset! Beauty was delivered! Bed was so comfortable and so were the linens. We were hungry and hit the jackpot on Tuesday night there was wood fired pizza and included a delicious gluten free option with draft root beer at their bar plus live music! We will definitely be back! The bonus was meeting Anne, David, and grandkids who were adorable and delightful!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"A unique and charming spot, and a great experience overall. It was a seamless process getting checked in and very easy to get our bearings. The only downside was not having any cups for the coffee and tea provided, and a couple bottles of water wouldn't have been amiss given the water from the tap seemed hard, but I imagine we could have gotten them if we'd asked--we were just too busy enjoying the beautiful surroundings to want to bother anyone. :) Would definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay in the suite. Amazingly bright and comfortable Bring your own dishes if you plan on eating your own food. Only paper cups for coffee. Would have loved a small table and chairs upstairs to sit by the windows. Views are incredible
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and unique venue that is perfect for a getaway from the cities! The grain bins are further in the country, while still being close enough to the local shops and restaurants!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,So unique. It was clean and very well put together. We absolutely loved it. Thank you so much.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place has been on my bucket list ever since I read about it when it opened. We were so impressed at how creatively they remodeled the grain bins into such luxurious rooms! The whole area was so beautiful & peaceful. We also enjoyed hiking at Lake Carlos State Park & an afternoon at Carlos Creek Winery. We highly recommend this venue! The only thing we were disappointed by is the inability to open the windows at night (the hand cranks were removed). It was such gorgeous spring weather, & being by the lake, we really looked forward to enjoying the sounds of nature, & letting the cool evening breeze in. Instead we were closed in -- bummer."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,I can’t express how beautiful and unique this Grain Bin experience was. It exceeded our expectations. We celebrated our wedding anniversary and what an experience to remember. We will for sure stay there again. Don’t hesitate to book your next vacation there !! Thanks Anne - Gathered Oaks for truly a unique experience. We have spread the word to family and friends already!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a beautiful place to stay and very unique and unforgettable. Everything was perfect!! Highly recommend and would stay again if in the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay! The place was charming and clean. It was easy to find. The bed was very comfortable. We only regret that the weather prevented us from using the deck and walking around a bit....guess we'll have to do that next time!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I got married at gathered oaks a year ago. We were able to stay in the bins for our one year anniversary. Everything was perfect. Anne was a great host! The grain bins are very unique and a fun place to stay.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,What a unique and great location. We enjoyed the peace and privacy and the beginning of spring with the sunshine and geese calling!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"It was a unique experience staying in the converted silo! The setting was peaceful and gorgeous, even in winter. I would probably book just a regular room next time, though the comfy chairs were nice for watching the sunset."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a relaxing stay and enjoyed the uniqueness of the grain bin suite! Very nice interior and the view and surroundings are very peaceful.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved staying here! We cannot wait to book another trip here and visit the winery again! Beautiful place.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great location, we stayed one night for a quick getaway. Close to state park and other parks for winter hiking, skiing, and snowshoeing, lots of options for food and drink in the area and close enough to Alexandria to make a morning coffee run."
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is a beautifully refurbished grain silo turned Airbnb!
Check in was easy, we had a stunning view of sunset, everything was clean and cozy, and check out was also a breeze.
Our only complaint was that the shower head could not be well adjusted for the height of the person in the shower.
All in all, a lovely place to stay that we would definitely visit again."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,My farmer husband was excited to stay in a grain bin! A fun experience for the both of us. We woke up to a frosted winter landscape with their beautiful trees just outside our window. It was a clean place and easy to get to. Very friendly and helpful host.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place to stay to relax! Was very quiet and peaceful. Super cozy and beautiful scenery! Everything clean, just as the pictures, and free of clutter. Would recommended #8 for extra space and sitting chairs for sure."

2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Charming Midwest experience. Be sure to check out the Carlos Winery down the road.
2022-10-01,4,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful place to stay in Alexandria! I loved not only the uniqueness of the grain bins, but the proximity to one of my favorite places, Carlos Creek Winery and the 22 Northmen Brewery. The suite was clean, classy, and Anne's communication for check-in were on par. Guests should know that the grain bins sit on a property called Gathered Oaks and the owners do host events in their other attractive buildings. This means there may be traffic and other outdoor events happening when you stay. Guests should also know that the kitchenette includes only a microwave, refrigerator (no freezer section) and a sink. There were paper cups, coffee, a few snacks, and tea. There were not other utensils such as glasses, silverware, or dishes for use- so plan accordingly. Overall we enjoyed our stay and plan to be back again!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place for a nice getaway! the suite was so pretty and we enjoyed having the separate living space. such a cool place to stay! close to town with lots of options for dinner!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and very comfortable accomodations. Just down the road from the Arrow wood conference center so it's a good option if you want to stay offsite or if the hotel is booked.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's a creative use of space and has a great view. Bonus: it's super quiet!!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful venue. I stayed in the #8 bin and enjoyed the ambience.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved it!
My wife and I met our senior year of high school at church camp in Alexandria. This was a surprise for her birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. She loved it!

Thanks for the great stay Anne!
Looking forward to being back in the future!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay here!! So cute, cozy, and clean. Had a great time at Carlos Creek Winery nearby."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fun and unique getaway. The luxury suite was so comfortable and roomy. It is a 2 story unit. The main floor is living room/ kitchenette and sleeping/bathroom on the 2nd floor. The deck off #8 was a great place to sit and read, drink morning coffee, play games and listen to the live music on Tuesday nights.
If you are planning to eat there be sure and bring your own plates, utensils etc. There are paper coffee cups but that is it."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy and cute! We will be back!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the. Oaks was wonderful! We enjoyed our suite and private deck. We were there on Tuesday so pizza, cocktails and music were a bonus!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect getaway at a unique property! The grain bins were so fun, clean, and easy to get to. The whole property was beautiful and just a quick drive from winery/brewery, downtown Alexandria, and walking paths. 10/10 recommend for couples or friends looking for a quick escape!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at this location two years in a row and absolutely LOVE it. I love the unique design of the grain bins. The property is clean and quiet. It makes the perfect weekend getaway from our crazy lives. Anne is so amazing to work with and extremely accommodating. This is definitely a Minnesota must do!
2022-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place, clean and very fun to stay in. However, had to finally contact Airbnb late on the night before our reservation for door code information as did not receive the code and host did not respond to inquires. Since we were making a special trip just to stay at the bins, this made the trip stressful."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful and welcoming space for my partner and I. Loved the privacy of the space and the amazing evening views. Additionally, we forgot to pack snacks and the granola bars and tea prepped by the hosts was a life saver. I definitely recommend folks to wander towards the lake and grassy area to enjoy some nature. 10/10 recommend - the ambiance and amenities were beyond what I expected - especially since they had live music and delicious brick oven pizzas when we booked. The hosts were lovey and welcoming, didn’t make me or my partner feel uncomfortable, and were super responsive. A super hot spot that deserves so much more attention for the quality and price of the bnb."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here! We stayed in the honeymoon suite on our honeymoon and it was so cozy and comfy! Went to the brewery and winery up the road and relaxed on the deck outside! Would stay here again!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just as advertised. We only spent one night there, but it was perfect! Beautiful location, easy access to food in town. Unique stay, clean place. Good communication with Anne. Would definitely stay again!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bucket list item that probably is not on your list. So unique. Close to great restaurants, winery, and brewery. Anne was great host and the whole property was a gem. Stayed in #8 the two floor suite but each room was nice. Highly recommend!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is beautiful and our stay was wonderful! We celebrated our one year anniversary of getting married at Gathered Oaks by staying in the grain bins on-site. A perfect stay to reminisce our special day.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful place to stay and relax. Also, there is a vineyard, micro-brewery, wood fired pizza place just about a mile down the road. This was a great place to stay."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay here and the uniqueness of staying in the grain bin! Wonderful hosts!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful weekend and will likely come back. Highly recommended. It's hard to believe that they did this with grain bins. You get a warm and cozy feeling as soon as you walk inside. The wood and industrial feel is beautiful and there is a lot of attention to detail. They are truly unique and luxurious as stated. Anne (the host) was very responsive and kind and made us feel welcome before we even got there.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed in the suite. It was a wonderful spot for a weekend getaway - quiet & cozy, and close to restaurants & stores."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time! So cozy, relaxing and peaceful! Anne was a great host and so understanding when we had to reschedule due to the weather. We will definitely be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend & I thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay. Anne was an easy & wonderful person to communicate with. Even when the weather was unexpected we still enjoy the silo views & interior.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"There were many highlights to this stay, but the main mentions are: the bin was very easy to access, the granola and Nutri Grain bars were a nice feature, and the bed was very comfortable."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous place! The grain bins are so cozy and tastefully decorated. The bed and sheets were comfy and provided a perfect night’s sleep.
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I can't recommend this space enough! We stayed in the suite and it was decorated so cute. It was clean, she left us some snacks and it was the perfect winter getaway. The space is cozy and super unique. I'd also recommend checking out Carlos Creek Winery. It is super close and the winery is next to a brewery and pizza place!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place is a super cool stay! Unique aesthetic and very relaxing. A bad snowstorm moved in overnight and the luxury suite was the perfect place to hunker down. The host was extremely nice and let us know that she had a snow-clearing service coming, and when it would be there. We'll definitely be back again in the future. Recommend eating at both ""Pike and Pint"", and ""Lure Lakebar""."
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful aesthetic & cozy space. Highly suggest upgrading to the 2-floor suite (at least in the winter). The listing says there is a kitchen, but is missing basic kitchen amenities (plates, cups, mugs, utensils). Plan accordingly :)
We loved this spot & would love to return in summer to utilize the lake & fire pit!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,A super sweet little getaway that is still close to the amenities of Alexandria. Spotless and quaint.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Another great stay! Thank you
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful setting close to everything
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a very nice, clean, and unique place to stay. Anne was great with answering any and all questions I had prior to, during, and even after the reservation.
A perfect location for a relaxing little getaway."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Unique experience!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great and unique place to stay!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve been to quite a few unique AirBnB’s over the past few years, and this was one of our favorites. Space itself was even more impressive in person than it’s pictured, as was the entire grounds actually. Anne was wonderful to communicate with and even helped save the night of my 50th birthday by getting us in a night early after an unfortunate AirBnB check in experience earlier that day. Sometimes things work out for a reason. Spent the day at the Bold North Cellars grounds right down the road with a winery/brewery/pizza kitchen that was great too. Highly, highly recommend. We’ll definitely be back!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here, the place was clean, and beautiful. It was so amazing, would definitely recommend to others."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing suite that is perfect for a getaway from reality. Anne’s grain bins are the perfect location in Alexandria and we will be there again!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was even better than the pictures! We walked the grounds and there was just one cool thing after another! Really enjoyed our time here, was very peaceful!!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,If I could give them 100 stars I would. Amazing in every way. We’ll surely be back!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a beautiful, fun, peaceful place to stay! We were in Grain Bin 8 which had an amazing view and was decorated beautifully. Perfectly located in Alexandria. Would highly recommend!!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space and definitely worth paying for the suite otherwise the rooms aren’t very spacious. Microwave, shelves for prepping (no table), iron and board, wine opener, coffee maker, and mini fridge (no freezer section). Shower was a little hard to use since the shower head is aimed at the back wall and won’t adjust lower. A little pricey when it comes to the additional service charges (we stayed one night and it cost over $200). Air conditioning works extremely well. Anne did a great job communicating with us on what to do for check in. Would stay here again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our honeymoon stay here was perfect! It’s a lovely place and so unique.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome place to stay!!!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was extremely relaxing and enjoying. My wife and I said we should have gotten married there also :). We will definitely recommend to others. The lake was beautiful. Also there's a lot of good food in town. Thank you again. We will be back
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed in Grain Bin 8 and found it to be quite the gem. One of the most unique AirBNB rentals we have found. Anne was very attentive with anything we needed. We loved the luxury suite, with two levels of space. The windows provide wonderful natural light and the view of the property and pond was beautiful. The private deck was especially nice and spacious. Guests should know that the advertised amenity of a kitchenette for preparing your own meals is actually just a mini fridge and microwave, and you need to bring your own plates, silverware, etc. Overall, we were very pleased and will stay again."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We were able to enjoy the beautiful sunset right from room, it was gorgeous!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean! Cute as can be! Loved the big comfy bed and pretty views! Would love to go back sometime!

2021-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is the perfect getaway spot. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a night or some time away. Anne was a great communicator as well and gave thoughtful recommendations on restaurants. The bed was also very comfortable.
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,These are so unique and love the secluded lot the AirBnB sits on. Everything was perfect and was a great little retreat away for a couple of nights. I will definitely be back again!

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It's a very unique stay. We were impressed with the cleanliness and how beautifully decorated it was. We suggest Bin #8!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay in this place was amazing! It was freaking cold outside so being inside this cosy place was such a pleasure. It looks very modern and nice, and the fact that you live inside the bin feels unique! Anne is such a great host. She responded so quickly, I didn’t have unanswered questions. We will definitely come back in summer, when it’s not that cold."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is so neat! Anne was quick with responses to our questions and kept an open line of communication. The grain bin suite was really cozy and made our stay enjoyable. Would totally recommend!
2021-01-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place is adorable and unique. If you plan on using the little kitchenette, make sure you have silverware, paper too, etc. It'd be great if they provided some tips on places to eat, things to do, and places that deliver. It was very clean and the view was great!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Unique design and super comfortable, and Anne is a great host!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super fun, simple, and cute space. My husband and I really enjoyed this little get away just far enough away from the cities but not too much of a drive. I highly recommend this place for a fun, unique stay. Our bin had a great view of the lake and open fields."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent place to stay! Anne is awesome to work with and made our experience great! Would recommend
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anne was very punctual in her responses to all my questions. My husband is a farmer and really enjoyed my surprise grain bin/silo B&B. The space was very clean, modern, and cozy. It was the perfect oasis for our anniversary and would love to visit again in the summer/fall (instead of the cold winter). The area looks beautiful!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a cute little place for a couple day get away! Anne was very responsive and made check in and check out very easy! Definitely recommend staying here!!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It’s better than you think. More beautiful than you’re ready for and beds that made it way too hard to get up in the morning! We can’t wait to get back!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great spot! Wonderful touches will be back
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’ve stayed in so many places internationally and this was one of our favorites!! Check-in was super simple and the communication was perfect before, during, and after the stay. The apartment itself was immaculate and everything was simple, comfortable, and relaxing.

They had a really nice coffee bar with flavor syrups, French press, pour over and drip. Toiletry, shampoo conditioner and body wash items were available. We are from florida so the frozen lake was a nice surprise and we were able to enjoy the outside fire in the meantime. We also had never seen ‘fire starter’ which was readily available. We were also surprised by the intermittent train throughout the evening, it added to our ambiance. The internet and t.v worked great, no issues, and plenty of board games. There was laundry det and fab softener so we could run a load of laundry and plenty of spices and kitchen items to cook with as well! (Wine bottle opener (get alcohol ahead of time), can opener, dishes, plates, cups, pots/pans, knives and utensils, plenty of paper towers) Thanks for being great hosts! We will surely return!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a cute, relaxing, cozy cabin on the lake. The nice warm cabin and lovely lake views welcomed us upon our visit. Open family room is great for a small family or a couple getaway. Cabin was well decorated and appointed with basic needs or entertainment whims. It is close to road/train tracks but is tucked away/fenced so you feel far from it all while sitting around the fire pit looking at the stars over a crystal glass lake. We had a lovely stay."

Would love to visit again, thank you Richelle and Scott."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beautiful inside (although quite small).

Hopefully we can come back soon. Thank you for having us."

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,I have never stayed at an Air BNB before but I was shocked at how prepared the place was. The place was spacious and was close to town. We chose to stay here over the resort in the area and I'm so glad we did. Everything was great! Minimal clean up as well. Just a few instructions but they were honestly something I would normally do before leaving someone's place. I would def. stay again. I wish they allowed pets because I'd love to come back with my dog but I understand why they don't. Such a great place!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,So beautiful and relaxing! The porch is great and it was nice to have necessities available. Ample parking. Would definitely come back!

We spent one morning going to the spa right up the road and afternoon at the winery, which was less than a 10 minute drive. The house was clean, with all of the amenities we needed. I would highly recommend this Airbnb if you’re staying in the Alexandria area with a small group!"

Centrally located for our ladies weekend to downtown Alexandria for shopping and Carlos Creek winery. It's not on the water but we didn't intend for that and booked it knowing that. You could actually see the lake through the trees AND hear the loons, so that was a bonus. I definitely will book this place again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was so clean and well appointed, we loved it. Super fresh sheets and towels, good beds and a great kitchen. The hosts were flexible on check in and check out times which was helpful for us. Highly recommended!"

It’s clear to see that David genuinely cares that his guests have a nice stay and has put a ton of thought into having his home as welcoming as possible.

2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This home was great -- recently renovated, clean, well-stocked, near many Alexandria activities while still quiet and private. Very nice porch and fire pit area. David was very responsive and provided clear instructions. We should have looked at the photos more closely to acknowledge that there were quite a few stairs down to the lake level. The stairs could use the same love as the house - they were old and uneven concrete stairs without a railing. It would also be helpful to have a more sturdy dock and an easier way to put the kayaks and canoe in the water. Overall is was a good experience."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at David’s. Very helpful when asking questions.l and very clear instructions.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, has everything you need! Quiet, peaceful lake. Definitely worth the money, walking paths nearby."

Our kids and grandkids made wonderful memories on the lake and next to the bonfire making S’mores. The house is beautiful, clean and comfortable. Love the open updated layout including large kitchen island. Has a lot of space for sleeping 🛌, very comfortable beds. My granddaughter liked the big yards with plenty of space to play with her cousins. Dave responds right away to messages and is very helpful."

The backyard and lake access is separated from the other houses by position, trees and a fence, so you really have nice privacy. The outside space is just as nice as inside, with a lovely deck with seating and a swing, bbq grill and table, nice fire pit with seating and firewood provided, and of course the lake! David is super responsive and communicates well, not to mention that he’s very friendly. :) This is absolutely one of the top two airbnbs we’ve ever stayed at. We didn’t want to leave and we’ll definitely be back!!"
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"David's place was amazing for our girls' weekend in Alexandria. The place was very updated, clean, and welcoming. The only thing that could've made check-in better is to know that the place and garage are a little hidden and hard to see upon arrival. Once located, however, there is absolutely nothing to complain about! There were so many great additions, including a hangover kit, campfire and water stuff, and board games in the closet. I highly, highly, highly recommend staying at David's place!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this space! Nice little winter time, weekday stay with the family for work. Peaceful and right on the lake! Can’t wait to stay here in the summer!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was great! Everyone enjoyed it!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This BnB is the perfect place for a little getaway. This home is cozy and adorable and David was a great host. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to for a home away from home vacation.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"IF AVAILABLE, BOOK IT!!! Location is amazing - right on lake Henry. Gorgeous lake views. Private access to lake which was great for the kids. It is quiet private yet close to shops and services. We enjoyed the great fire pit with view of the lake. The house is set up very well. It has every appliance you need, all new. Towels and linens were clean and ready to use. We were there in the winter and while it was freezing outside the house was nice and warm. There are two main living areas (upstairs and downstairs) which allowed us to have the kids entertained while grownups were still sleeping. Also, there are two bathrooms which helped get everyone ready quicker. David was super friendly and accessible at all times. He made sure we got in easily, settled in and had everything we needed. Throughout our stay he made sure the parking and access to the house were cleared from snow. We had such a great time there and would definitely go there again. We strongly recommend this place!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay in Alexandria!

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Patrick's home is spectacular. A beautiful setting for a completely remodeled home. Very well thought out. Spacious kitchen for large groups, easy access to the home, lake and downtown Alexandria and surrounding area. I especially liked the two separate gathering areas. Even though it was only my mother and I, it was perfect. Master on main floor accommodates for an older person that does not do well with stairs. Thank you for sharing your home."

2022-09-01,5,Group trip,David’s property is beautiful! Every detail/design in the home is perfect ; modern but cozy. Kitchen was well stocked with utensils/cookware - there was even a “hangover recovery kit” in the closet which we thought was a cute touch. We really enjoyed our stay!!
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This place was the perfect spot for our group! The newly renovated house had comfortable beds, games, kayaks and canoes! The size and layout of the house was larger than we expected, even with our group of 8 we felt like we had more than enough room. David did an amazing job at communicating with us and also making us feel welcomed into his home. We hope we can come back again every summer!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for our group and all of our needs.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,David was an excellent host. Very accommodating and his place was great for our family. The extra pack and play and high chair were very handy and we loved the extra touches the place had.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing lake views from all over this tastefully remodeled house. The island is much bigger in person. Every detail thought of. The place was spotless! Comfortable beds with cozy comforters and pillows. We loved the covered porch that stepped down onto another large open deck. There’s a perfect spot for friends and family to make a big bonfire perfect for roasting S’mores! Definitely recommend and we will be back next summer for sure!!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow. This place has it all. Beautifully remodeled home with a craftsman’s touch. The vibe is immaculate. Great place to spend a relaxing weekend, week or even extended stay. The lake views are on point, water is warm and this home is close to all things the Birthplace of America has to offer. Can’t wait to book again and again - let’s ride!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"As a mother of 5 young children, staying at an air bnb can be stressful as you kind of go in without knowing how it will work with the kiddos. We were so in love with this rental and the accommodations for our family. The home is freshly remodeled and is absolutely beautiful. The kitchen was amazing and perfect for feeding an army full of kids. The bedrooms are all a good size and offer amazing views of the lake. Also, the beds are comfortable and decor is awesome. The bathrooms are all a really great size and nicely set up. Overall, and most importantly for me, all the surfaces were easy to keep clean and there was plenty of space to keep the family organized.
The whole family loved the quietness of the lot and the wonderful front yard that was private, beautiful, and safe for the littler ones. We gated off the exit from the deck to the yard and that made for an awesome play space. Overall, the whole house would be awesome for a group of adults or families.
David, the owner, was easy to work with and more than accommodating. We would definitely rent here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,The AirBnB was exactly what we were looking for and met all of our expectations. Would happily rent again!
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful home. The beds were comfortable and the house suited our needs perfectly!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect getaway for our family Christmas. There was more provided than we were even expecting. They had games and puzzles in the cupboard for us to use. They had two sets of washer/dryers available. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots/pans/dishes. We all had a blast playing the games in the garage, including two fooseball tournaments. Would highly recommend staying here with a large group."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,LOVED everything! It was perfect for our family Thanksgiving celebration!! Will definitely consider returning!

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Loved the stay for our wedding. Absolutely amazing how open the space is.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice place, very-well appointed, and superbly service-oriented. You don’t go to Alexandria for restaurants, but La Ferme was even a friendly and tasty bistro. It’s a little unfair to Michele, but a smoke detector began beeping “low battery” in the middle of our last night there —and it’s 18 feet up on the vaulted ceiling; so, we got to drive home under-rested and bleary-eyed."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"The place was beautiful and worked perfectly! I didn't realize the full sized bed in the bedroom with a king was actually in the tiny loft with the ladder stairs to get up and down, so we didn't utilize that sleeping area. The loft would have been great for kids, but not so much for an adult."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"The home was fantastic! It’s looks like it does in the pictures. The house is 1 level, very spacious and super comfortable to be in. Michelle was easy to work with!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, Michelle! Your home is beautiful and impeccable. We had a group of 11. We were very comfortable. The accommodations and amenities were perfect. Our grandchildren enjoyed the game room. The location was perfect for our activities, including a family wedding at Carlos Creek Winery! Thank you for helping us create a lifetime of memories as a family! Kelly"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Myself and a group of 11 other women stayed at Michele’s place for a long weekend this summer and we really enjoyed the house. It was beautiful, big, clean, private. All of us said we would definitely stay there again. It was also nice that it was so close to downtown Alexandria so that we could rent Uber’s to/from the house. It was very close to several lake accesses too. Overall great stay."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed the amenities. Lots to do for our family members. Very clean and spacious. Many good memories created here. I’m
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay at this property was fantastic! The decor and the privacy were just what we needed. Location was so convenient to Lake Victoria and Carlos Winery. We really felt comfortable and was so much more than what we thought (the little things like coffee, plenty of paper towels, laundry soad, etc.)!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice change of pace from hotels in town. Initially stayed when hotels sold out for night. Relaxing.
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This place was fantastic for our group! Beautiful house. Host was kind and willing to be flexible with our schedule and needs. Would recommend!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed at Michele’s place for a wedding at bold north cellars. Place was clean, good location, easy to check in and plenty of places for 5 families to stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Michele was very good about communication, we had a bit of an issue with leaking water in the kitchen due to a large ice dam and snow on the roof. Michele had a guy come out on a Friday night and shovel the roof and snow was removed Saturday morning. As a home and business owner I know things like this can happen and Michele was on top of it."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home with a wonderfully equipped kitchen. Spacious and clean. Perfect for our relaxing girls weekend!
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,Very organized and clean place. Worked great for a weekend away with a large group!

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay within 15 minutes of pretty much every activity in Alexandria. House was very clean and had plenty of space for all the guests to hang out and sleep. Michele is very responsive and polite. I would definitely stay at this location again.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"My first impression was the text I received from Scott with the check-in details: it was clear, warm & friendly, & he immediately responded when I replied to him.
Our 2nd impression - the first for my family members - was WOW! We arrived late, but the home was easy to find. Walking into the house was like walking into someone's home: beautifully furnished, well-appointed bedrooms, a huge deck with a large grill, a dining table big enough for 8 plus extra chairs, enough dishware for at least 12, plus spices, sugar, flour, oil...
Our exchange girls - Laura from Italy, Merjen from Turkmenistan and Munisa from Uzbekistan - loved the loft room. My mom loved having a main-floor bedroom close to the bathroom. My sister & I took the basement bedrooms with the large bathroom down there. It worked out great for us, with one bedroom left over for my aunt to use when she joined us!
We had one issue with a tripped breaker, which Scott immediately resolved for us.
Easily 10 out of 5 stars!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wedding at The Silos and this ho.e met all our needs. Fishing off the dock was so much fun. All the extras that was included in the house were so much fun. Scott was always available to answer questions. We will be staying again.
The Sittigs"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,I would totally recommend to my friends and stay again myself. Very clean and welcoming place!!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"This was one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed. What stood out were the quality pieces of furniture and equipments that were in the Airbnb; the beds, recliner sofas and chairs, dining table, dishwasher, refrigerator, etc were all high end, unlike your typical Airbnb.
Scott and team went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. When we sent them a message about the WiFi not working, Scott immediately called and walked us through resetting the breaker.
We really enjoyed using the kayaks on the lake, and appreciated the life vests that came in a variety of sizes for both children and adults.
We had a really wonderful stay, and would definitely come back."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,My group and I had such a great time last year that we came back again this year. The space works great for our group and we love the convenience of all that nearby Alexandria has to offer. Scott is super responsive and helpful. The place is great!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The property and the house were both phenomenal. Having 2 separate areas to congregate worked great for our family. Also, the kitchen was well stocked with spices and other cooking supplies. The host was very responsive to our messages and we would definitely stay there again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had an absolute fabulous time. The space was perfect. The location was perfect. It was very quaint cozy. It was a easy seamless process.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Awesome stay, loved it! Thank you!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A wonderful stay for our belated family of 10 Christmas holiday at the Lakeside getaway! Comfortable beds for all, plenty of linens, extra blankets for added warmth on a cool night, towels a plenty, kitchen supplied with pretty much everything. With two entertainment areas there was plenty of family gathering areas & thank you for the beautiful Christmas tree on the lower level. We also had a few beautiful walks down the peacefully quiet road along Charley Lake;)"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here with some friends for a wedding at Carlos Creek Winery and it was just down the road. The property is great, and the house is beautiful! Everything was clean and exactly as described, and the beds are so comfortable."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Scott’s place was fantastic. Lots to do both at the property itself and the surrounding area. Supplied activities and amenities rivaled nearly every airbnb we’ve been too. All instructions were clear and rules were basics that any adult would and should follow. Nothing weird and over the top like we’ve somewhat in the past. Scott was very responsive for our one question and very polite and friendly. It’s clear this property is well cared for and we’d certainly recommend to others!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect place for extended family and friends to gather. Beautiful property and house. Large deck for outside lounging and eating… although it rained most of our trip so we couldn’t make use of it as much as we would have otherwise. Would recommend to anyone interesting in staying here. Scott was friendly and quick to respond. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes for a crowd and lots of non-perishable pantry basics for cooking and baking which we made use of and appreciated!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent rental, it was our first Air B&B experience and it was great. Clean, great location for peace and quiet. great fishing and lake access. had everything we needed. Thanks you guys for a great experience!! Even the local family that visited commented on how nice and peaceful it was there."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home comfortably fit 6 adults, 2 kids and 3 dogs. There were lots of sleeping options and was stocked with everything we needed. Love the upper and lower deck on the house.
Took advantage of the outdoor games available. My family had a great time! Thanks"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"Great country setting. We utilized it for a fishing team. We had plenty of space to turn around and plenty of electric to charge boats. Home is in ""like new"" condition. All inclusive and stocked nicely with towels, good cooking kitchen items, spices , etc not always found at rentals."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"It was a beautiful and peaceful place to stay with plenty of room for our family of 11. Loved our time on the deck, outdoor games, kayaks, and paddle boat that was provided. Scott was very responsive to my questions. I would definitely recommend it to others!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Scott was extremely responsive. The house was great for our family of 12. Everyone had enough space. We made use of the lovely decks, fished off the dock and paddle boat, went kayaking, played bean bag toss, bocce ball, crochet, and enjoyed a bonfire every night. The kids loved the bikes and the games. We drove to Lake Brophy County Park to enjoy the wonderful playground and beach."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent stay, SO many fun things to do and close to the water!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our family vacation in Alexandria! Scott’s place was clean, comfortable, spacious, and had everything we needed. We enjoyed lots of hours on the deck surrounded by peaceful trees, spent time playing corn hole supplied by the host, and loved the movie theater set up in the basement for relaxing at the end of the day. It was a quick 10-15 min drive into town for pickleball, shopping, and dining. Would highly recommend staying here as a family or group as it worked well for us with 7 adults, plus a toddler! Thanks, Scott!!"
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"It was a beautiful and clean place to stay. Very spacious. I thought the lake was going to be a bit easier to access as it was down the hill and had a small access area on the road. It had a lot of fun activities to use in the garage. The two level deck/patio was great to hang out on. It is good to point out it is right next to a graveyard as I missed that in the description. Some people might not like that, but we thought it was cool. We felt like we had great privacy as we were in the trees, yet we felt like we were being watched with a video camera as there is a blinking light on the deck and they texted us the cleaners were waiting for us to leave even though they weren’t on the property."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice and updated place to stay. They really thought of all the amenities. Scott was very responsive with questions we had.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The stay at Scott's home was great for our children and grandchildren. The home is welcoming, clean and has lovely decor. The large yard was great for the golf disc game and badmitten. We all loved the large deck for evening gatherings. Scott was always available when we had a question.
My only suggestion would be to have cupboard space for groceries, as with the counter space full it made it hard to prepare meals .
It will be so nice when the dock is in .
I think everyone will be pleased staying in such a beautiful home.
Doug and Carol Stockdill"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved this place, can’t wait to stay again!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved this place!! Quiet, yet not to far from town. Walkable to fish on the lake. Lots of entertainment choices for inside and outside, rain or shine. Big deck and a grill. Nice firepit that can hold your snacks. Lots of kitchen amenities, silverware, spices, and utencils. Plenty of room for sleeping and entertaining. Close to the winery. Scott is very polite, he takes the time and care into making sure you have a great time here, and can enjoy your relaxing get away."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice and well-furnished house. Our dogs were welcome which was a big bonus. Weather was not great so we didn't get to use the lake as much as we would have liked but seems like a peaceful small lake. Would be nice to have easier access to the lake and a dock to throw a fishing line from.
We will definitely consider returning for another stay"
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,The listing was great and the owner was super responsive and accommodating. Everything was clean and as advertised. The wifi speed worked well for those in my group who needed to do some work. Beds were very comfortable. Best Airbnb I've stayed at yet.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,We've really enjoyed our stay so far and hope to continue.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice home for our family to stay at when we were in town for a funeral. The driveway is steep, so if coming in the winter months, take heed of the warning to have 4WD! The only thing that we found odd was we were asked to take all of the garbage and recycling with us when we vacated."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while fishing in the area. Well-kept and comfortable.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our business trip and made it feel like home still all while working. We loved the house and every thing in it. Very well kept! Hosts did exactly what they needed to to succeeded with this property very pretty place. Will be back!

We were very comfortable in this newly renovated home. Having two separate rooms with big screen tv’s worked out perfect for our group. And the gas fireplace was enjoyable.
Our Host
Scott and Patty are excellent hosts.
The Location
The Alex area is a great place to spend some downtime. If you love nature and the outdoors, you will find plenty to do here."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Relaxing and Beatiful!! Everything we could possibly need was right there! From warm, cozy towels and bed linens in the home to great shopping, spa, and winery very nearby. Can't wait to go back! Scott was an attentive host and could not ask any more from him or his home."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was a wonderful place to relax! It was very clean and quiet. Lovely to look out at the lake. The house was spacious for our group of 9. A perfect retreat and close to Lake Carlos State Park, Carlos Creek Winery, and downtown Alexandria."

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"We had an amazing time at the property. The leaves were at peak color and there was a refreshing chill in the air. The house was laid out nicely with two living rooms, one on the main floor and one downstairs, two bedrooms on either floor as well as a full bathroom. The loft would be perfect for kids with three beds. The kitchen was fully stocked with high end pots and pans, crockpot, blenders, and even a full spice rack and baking ingredients. The lake is just down a short driveway and the backyard is very large if you wanted to set up the badminton set or sit by a fire. Scott was very quick to answer questions and had helpful local tips. Highly recommend this property!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome home. Was just for my wife and I on a getaway so we had an abundant amount of space. Love the area and all the lake life culture in this area. Carlos Winery just a few miles away was a rave of a find.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is perfect and their is lots of space . The furniture is all high end and very comfortable . My kids had a great time fishing. The lake is a little weedy but if you go off the boat launch and follow the shore to the left you find a sandbar that you can stand in the water and fish from there you will catch fish constantly. And the whole time I was there I think I only seen one other boat on the lake which is really nice.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Even though we had to cancel due to a medical emergency and we weren't able to make our vacation, Scott's communication the entire booking time and thru cancelation was so great and helpful. We did even pay the first night hoping to possibly still make our vacation but it was just not meant to be this year.
we actually were hoping to book the trip for next year right away but the same dates aren't available next year so instead we are talking with family members about moving our vacation dates to utilize this location because we were so excited to stay here and the host made it so easy to communicate!!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was nothing short of wonderful! Amenities galore, they have everything you could think of in the kitchen, including baking supplies. All of the furniture, bedding, dishware, etc. are brand new. The beds are extremely plush and comfortable. USB ports are everywhere, in the couches, end tables, table lamps, etc., so no worries if you forget one yourself. WiFi is super snappy. I was able to work on the computer uploading photos while both TVs were streaming content. The location itself is tranquil and peaceful. One notation is that this is directly next to a cemetery, which may feel awkward for some people. It didn't bother us a bit! It made for very peaceful neighbors. 😄
The lake is beautiful and quaint There is a small bit of walking to do to get to the fishing spot and it's also on the opposite side of the road, so those with small children may want to keep that in mind. Games, puzzles, and a very spacious floor plan keeps entertaining easy to do. PLENTY of room for everyone to have their own little space. I had the pleasure of meeting Scott the day after check- out due to leaving some items behind. He was kind enough to reach out to me and waited at the cabin until I could get back to pick them up, above and beyond! I've stayed at several Air BNBs & VRBO's before. This was a 10/10 for us and we hope to stay again!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, well kept home on the lake. Great amenities available like kayaks, canoe, paddle board, and dock. Caught lots of fish right off the dock even while dog and kid playing in the water! All the bedrooms are on the upper level of home with ample space in each of them. Great experience and would definitely stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was my first time booking an AirBnB before, so I was a little nervous. Jennifer made it very easy and gave me a great experience. She was able to be flexible with check in time which helped our schedule. Jennifer let us use the paddle boards and kayaks which was super fun. This place was exactly what we were looking for."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a beautiful picture-perfect Minnesota lake vacation at Wickstrom Lodge. Thanks to Jennifer for sharing a home that must hold many beautiful memories for her. My family now too has some sweet memories of time spent there.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a great stay at the Wickstrom lodge. We enjoyed relaxing on the dock, walking through the trails, and seeing the dogs play in the water. The lodge is nearby downtown Alexandria and we enjoyed visiting the shops and the winery. Great stay, would definitely come back!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The pictures of this home do not do it proper justice. We stayed for 9 days in mid-September and the landscaping and property were absolutely stunning. We didn't realize the property was lake-front and that it would have so much to offer! We did everything we could - fishing, kayaking, canoeing, outdoor games, porch lazing, grilling, etc. We were here for a family wedding and we ended up being the house that everyone wanted to come over to every single day. The home itself is hands-down the BEST stocked home we've ever stayed in - the games, toys, TVs, cooking items, all of it. Amazing. You really only need your own clothes and that's it because this house has every other single thing you could possibly need. The host was extremely communicative and helped us with an issue immediately. She also provided the most thoughtful welcome basket - I couldn't get over it! We just really enjoyed our entire stay and can't wait to be back. Jennifer and her family have created such a special place to visit and our Minnesota lake experience was so much more than we expected. Come stay here!"

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you’re looking for a getaway on the lake Wickstrom Lodge is perfect!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,My family and I really enjoyed our stay at this cozy lake house. Jennifer was gracious enough to let us check in a little earlier (which we really appreciated). We also really enjoyed all the games and water activities that we could do together outside all day. The kitchen was exceptional as it came with everything we needed to cook and set our meals. Only down side was that the AC did not work the first day of our visit. But Jennifer was prompt on getting the issue fixed when she was aware of the issue.

There were paddle boards, kayaks, canoes, bikes, and yard games all for our use. The kitchen was stocked with just about anything you'd need. Plenty of towels (both beach and bath) to use throughout the weekend. We even asked Jennifer if they happened to have any marshmallow roasting sticks, which she said no, and then no more than 30 minutes later she went out and bought some and brought them over! The owners were around, as they share the same dock area, but we were not bothered by them at all, plus they helped us right away any time we had questions. The hill is pretty steep going down to the water, so be warned that it may not be well suited for elderly or anyone with physical disabilities.

We had a winter getaway and her yard leading up to the lake has a great sledding hill! With the back porch and side fire pit, this home would be great any time of year. The house was well stocked with spare linens and towels, air mattresses, comfortable beds and was all around the perfect space for generations young and old to enjoy. The seclusion of the ""no outlet"" road, was also very nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of busy little Alexandria. Will definitely be staying there again!"
2018-01-01,5,Group trip,So beautiful and really big! Stayed in the winter but going back in the summer to enjoy the lane! It was in a GREAT location that seemed like a wonderful neighborhood.
2018-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a flexible host and a laid back vacation on the lake--this is the place for you! I've had some VERY terrible experiences with hosts (late responses, ridiculous contracts and expectations, and inflexibility to the point of canceling our reservation on us because we were a few minutes late for check in!!!!) Jennifer is the PERFECT host! Her check in time was flexible (which was a relief as we traveled during inclement weather) and she was very casual/laid back. We even got to meet her since she was staying in the house next door that weekend.
As far as the house, it was exactly what we were looking for. Spacious and on the lake! It was a simple home, but came with everything we needed (kitchen appliances, wifi, and space for all of us!). There are 4 double/queen beds upstairs and tons of room for air mattresses, which is perfect for a large family. Price was VERY reasonable compared to other houses in the area--plus you get access to lake toys (paddle boards, kayak, etc.), a private dock, a golfing fareway, and beautiful walking trails on the property!
We have a family reunion on Lake Alexandria every year -- we're hoping this can be our new site!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loves the seating on the deck and the amazing views of lake from all corners of the house. Just a few minutes to Alexandria was also really convenient.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A top notch AirBnb! One of our very favorites. Beautiful location and home. Excellent host. Felt right at home and can't wait to come back!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie was a very welcoming and responsive host! Her home had everything we needed and more, and was absolutely gorgeous. it rained our whole stay, but I couldn't think of a prettier place to watch the drizzle from than cuddled up on the couch with the fire going! 10/10 recommend this place for your next Alexandria trip!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Location was perfect for us. Kitchen was well stocked with quality kitchen tools. Beds were comfy. We loved the big windows and the view, even with the clouds and rain. Host was available and responsive."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a really nice time at Julie's place.
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location and the cabin was very nice. One of the best kitchens we’ve ever had at an Air Bnb. Also access to multiple streaming services without having to log in is a plus. Close to lakes, Alex, etc. Check in/Check out instructions and communication was a bit vague and you could hear a little more general noise than desirable. Those were both fairly minor though so overall a good place."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Julie's. We especially love the fireplace on wintery evenings. Plenty of cookware and pantry items in the kitchen to use. Thanks again, Julie."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home. Very clean and well cared for. Super location and neighborhood. Fine host.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I found a hidden gem in Alexandria, MN - an Airbnb that felt like home! As a solo traveler attending a vendor show, having Julie, the welcoming host downstairs, made me feel secure. The house sits on a serene lake, adding to its charm.
Julie's attention to detail is incredible. The bedroom was comfy, and she had every possible convenience at hand, even a first aid kit, that I unexpectedly needed. The kitchen is a dream for cooks, fully equipped. The highlight? The wall of windows at the back with a stunning lake view. I visited in September, but I can only imagine the beauty in summer and winter.
I daydreamed about a snowy weekend getaway with my husband, enjoying chili and football by the fire. Julie's warmth and friendliness made the stay even better.
In summary, this charming lakeside Airbnb is perfect year-round. Julie's thoughtful hosting and the breathtaking location make it a must-visit. Can't wait to return! See you again Julie! :)"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at this place by the lake Louise.
Julie communicated very well with us prior our arrival and received us in person at check in providing relevant information. She was very communicative and explained we could use the kayaks, which was something we missed from our last rental.
The house with the views of the lake is wonderful, and we could relax perfectly in a comfortable place enjoying the lake.
The house has all you need and is very well decorated.
Roxie, the dog is very charming and friendly and just went around us. We experienced good company all together.
We definitely will consider to stay again in our future trips to Minnesota.

We were pleased with everything about this home. Again thank you Julie!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's place truly made us feel like a home away from home. On our visit, she not only greeted us with a warm smile but also gave us a brief tour about the cabin and the best places to eat in Alexandria which made our stay all the more cozy and comfy. The cabin and the lake view are truly mesmerizing, far more beautiful than the pictures uploaded. The entire vibe of the property is very homely yet luxurious. It has been tastefully decorated and meticulously maintained,which makes it all the memorable. The cozy fireplace, the gorgeous pool table, the faux fur blanket, the reclining couches, the antique decoratives, the popcorn machine; Julie's place has all sorts of luxuries to pamper you and give you a delightful experience. The property can be easily located. Cherry on top is the owner's super friendly dog, Roxie, who is an absolute sweetheart.

The only thing that could have been better was the weather, which was obviously out of everyone's control! :) We absolutely loved getting to know Roxy - she was such a wonderful bonus!

Thank you Julie for making it a great weekend for my mom’s birthday!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home with a lovely view of the lake. Equipped with everything you need and more. (Bonus - sheets and towels are fresh and smell amazing). Chess, pool table, puzzles, tv - lots to do inside if weather is not cooperating. The deck swing is so nice especially in the morning watching a sunrise with some coffee. There are kayak’s available to use as well as nearby parks, beaches, and hiking trails. There is a gorgeous upper level that unfortunately is reserved for the dog’s use only. Speaking of which, Roxie will visit you often if Julie is not home. She’s a sweetie, but can be a little noisy sneezing and coughing if her allergies are acting up. Julie is a gracious and generous host who is easy to communicate with and is very accommodating. It’s a great place to stay while exploring the Alexandria area!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Julie is so kind and gets back to you right away if you have any questions. If you like dogs you will love Roxie. She is such a sweet beagle. Julie and Roxie gave us a pontoon ride! Her home is gorgeous. She does an awesome job taking care of it and her lawn.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is awesome.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautifully designed home with tall ceilings and view of the Lake and sunrise from a back deck.
It was a perfect place for rest, relaxation and decompression.
Julie and Roxie were great hosts."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful and spacious home and lot, clean, lots of light, very comfortable bed. Beautiful view, quiet lake-- loved hearing a loon at dusk. (You can hear a little low grade highway traffic in the background when down by the lake, but not enough to detract from the experience.) Julie is welcoming, attentive, quick to help then disappears to offer privacy. I loved this place, I will be back!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent location on small lake near to Alexandria shops and restaurants. Kayaks available to use. Host took us on pontoon several times and very gracious to our grandson. Spacious accommodations, clean, well stocked, great views of lake from inside and deck. Appreciated all of the TV viewing options. The only thing standing between this being excellent and outstanding is having to share the place with the dog. Roxie was sweet and well behaved, but it would have been great to have full access to the upstairs master bedroom and facilities."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved my stay. everything went well except the weather did not cooperate 😊
Her little dog was sweet, but let Julie know if you don't want to be woke at 6am. Ask to control the time the door is open for him to come upstairs."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, clean, and inviting place to stay with Julie and Roxie!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this was my first time staying at an air b&b that I didn't have 100% all to myself. it was wonderful! the property was stunning, and Julie was super kind and helpful. we'll definitely be back!"

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space with an awesome deck and beautiful view. We would highly recommend for a relaxing time and having plenty of space!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Staying at Julie's place was a wonderful get-away. The lake view was beautiful and the home very comfortable and clean. I really enjoyed my little get-away. I was in need of some solitude and found it here. It's just a short drive into Alexandria where there are several amazing antique stores. It was the best of both worlds.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a gorgeous house on the beautiful lake. The kitchen is equipped with all possible utensils you might even not think about. All house is very clean, perfectly maintained and it's not possible to find a better place. Thanks to Julie for letting us using everything!
If you can wake up early enough you can enjoy a beautiful sunrise direct from the house or from the porch. The lake is clear and very quiet! And Roxy was visiting us a few times - he is a very friendly and smart dog. We would definitely come here again."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything in a stay you could ask for. Julie and Roxie were fantastic hosts. Everything was wonderful. 5 stars in every category - this place exceeded expectations and suited our needs perfectly. Highly recommend.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at Julie's place. Clean and spacious. If you like to cook your own meals, her kitchen was perfect! My husband was pleasantly surprised about the pool table. Roxie her dog was so nice and friendly. We would definitely stay here again!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie's place was spectacular. The space was large and clean with amazing views of a quiet lake. Julie was very helpful with lots of information and local tips. The location is great, it's in a quiet neighborhood but close to downtown Alex and other local attractions. I can't recommend this stay enough! We'll definitely be back"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,couldn't ask for a better location or host. looking forward to returning soon.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful home with stunning views. We got to see two amazing sunrises when we were there.
We found it to be very clean. The bed was very comfortable.
And then there was Roxie her dog. She's a great greeter.
We would definitely come back if the opportunity arises."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing stay!! Beautiful location! We enjoyed kayaking and daily visits from Roxie! Will definitely come back.
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Floor to ceiling windows overlooking a lake in a cathedral-like space, what more can you ask for? All amenities provided, plus a daily greeting from cheerful pooch. I will be returning."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This space is fabulous !
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful get away and outstanding house
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent and five stars
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet lakeside spot. Close to Alexandria, gorgeous interior."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The perfect place to stay that you won’t regret. Stunningly beautiful views especially in the morning. A clean and spacious get away. And a comfy soft bed. Plus a cute little pup that loves to be pet if you have time. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to relax or get away for the weekend. Has everything you’d need for a comfy stay and full kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, living room and more just for you. I’ve stayed two other places in the Alexandria area for about this same price but this was by far my favorite and plan to stay again if I’m in the area."
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay! We have only good things to say about Julie’s place. It was clean, quiet, private with beautiful scenery. Just what we wanted! Julie was a great communicator and even brought up some fun toddler books for my daughter to enjoy! We would love to come back again!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great place to stay. Right next to so much to do, but on a peaceful and gorgeous lake. Julie K. is a fantastic host, with a sweet pup mascot whom my daughter loved! Nicest house I've ever stayed in. Can't recommend it enough!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a relaxing weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful chalet! The windows and the view... wow! The popcorn machine and pool table were fun bonuses too :). Roxie was the perfect four legged hostess!
2021-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This place is so clean it sparkles, so warmly welcoming, and so well laid-out and equipped. This was our second time there, and it only gets better. We love the wall of windows in the main room (unparalleled sunrises), the view of the lake (complete with ice fishing village!), and the cosy, but clean and easy gas fire. A pair of bald eagles even showed up one morning!
And of course, we just LOVE having Roxie the beagle serve as an additional hostess. She is warm and friendly without ever being a nuisance. Julie's communication is clear, quick, and helpful, while always respecting our privacy. We ventured out to the local brewery, but truly preferred being ""home"" by the fire. We'd love to come back in the summer!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You are in for a delightful time if you stay at Jake!s on the Lake. It is spotless, private and plenty of room to spread out. The kitchen is so well stocked with everything one needs to fix meals. We brought food but the pans, dishes, and condiments made preparation easy. Lake Louise is only about 5 miles to Alexandria so very easy to visit but away from the hustle and bustle. The bed was comfortable. We look forward to returning in both the summer and fall. Thank you, Julie for being an outstanding host!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was probably the best value we’ve gotten for an Airbnb; beautiful house and view of the lake, great amenities, and Julie was a wonderful host. Would love to come back in the summer!"
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed the beautiful sun coming in through the spacious windows with our coffee every morning. Julie was very accommodating and responded quickly to any communication. Would love to see the back yard in the summer.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My girlfriend and I had a great stay at Julie's place. Very spacious and full of light. Julie lives downstairs and gave us a (masked up!) tour of the top half for our stay. Her dog was very kind and visited us when we were making breakfast in the amazing kitchen.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! Very cozy and relaxing. And quiet!!
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a beautiful house in a beautiful location. Would stay again in a heartbeat!
Bonus points go to Roxie the adorable dog!"

2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Julie's place! Everything was clean and the space was very welcoming. We stayed over Thanksgiving, so it was really nice to have a big kitchen to make meals. Also really enjoyed the fireplace and pool table! Overall a great experience, and great value. Highly recommend!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location on the lake is gorgeous! Julie is very prompt in responding and offered a great, spacious place to stay. The natural light from all the large windows was so welcome. Being able to prepare food in the roomy kitchen helped save us time and money as well instead of going out to eat each meal. You will enjoy your stay here."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great weekend at Julie’s place! It is so open and light, but still cozy by the fire. We were surprised snd delighted by the full kitchen, and enjoyed being able to cook full meals during these COVID-19 times. The place was sparking clean, the bed was super comfy, and getting to see Roxie a couple of times was a bonus! We hope to return for another weekend getaway!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie was a wonderful host, her home is spotless and beautiful.
Simply put, it will exceed your expectations.
We will be back!
Randy S"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place to get away. Gorgeous accommodations with lots of natural light. We thoroughly enjoyed curling up by the fireplace and watching the snow fall out the huge livingroom windows. Would highly recommend this spot.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Super clean and well stocked with essentials and even the things you never think of. Weber fired right up and kichten was ready for anything you could want to cook. Probably the sharpest knives set (hand wash only) I have seen!
Hoping to enjoy a little ""Country Haven"" again
in the future!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,x
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Brandon was very communicative and friendly! The house was exactly as described and just what we needed during our time working in Minnesota. Highly recommend!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fantastic place! Brandon went above and beyond to help us out with a few special requests for our baby. Great stay
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a little weekend getaway for a smaller group
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet, relaxing setting and space. Really enjoyed coffee on the screened in porch! Great spot to stay with easy access to Alex and surrounding lakes and communities. Glad we found it, and would love to come back and stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! We visited Alexandria and the surrounding area with friends for a weekend and this was the perfect place! Peaceful, quiet getaway with great amenities. Great, clear communication and was given local recommendations. We loved sitting in the screened in porch. Would definitely recommend this serene getaway!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay. Close enough to town, but secluded and private location."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for us to rest up and recharge while we were in the area supporting a weeklong bicycle tour. Brandon is a proactive communicator and the place was exactly as it appeared in the photos. It was clean, nice and cool in the summer heat, and had everything we needed. We would absolutely come back the next time we're in the area!"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"Fantastic place to stay! The parking is wonderful. The living space is a little smaller than anticipated but the outside areas, parking, etc are amazing. Had a great time!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the cleanest, homiest Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in! We enjoyed coffee in the screened in patio both mornings and we loved how quiet and peaceful the place was. I was worried we’d be hot sleeping in the loft but the ceiling fan kept us cool all night! We loved this place!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean & Comfortable. Well supplied with basic needs. Screened in porch was a plus. We sat out there in morning and listened to the birds while we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and again in the evening with a glass of wine. Brandon was responsive to questions. Beautiful landscape and quiet!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place! Nice folks. Definitely recommend.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon’s cabin was cute and cozy - perfect for a much needed break from the cities. Coffee on the porch was idyllic, and the location was peaceful and calm but close enough to Alexandria for a Target run or dinner."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place to stay with plenty of amenities like basketball and football and cornhole and a fire pit! Not too far out of town, but far enough to be out there! Overall great stay!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet setting, comfortable beds, rustic feel with modern comforts; this is a great place to get away! We loved being away from people but within 10 minutes of Alexandria! Would definitely stay here again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! The house itself was very clean, dishes were provided, games were there for our use, and a full coffee and tea bar!! The beds were very comfortable, and the house was able to stay very cool - even too cold at times! The only downside (which isn’t really anything we didn’t know going in) was there was only a single bathroom, and it was 10 minutes from town. Again, this is what we expected based on the listing so nothing that we didn’t know. We also asked very last minute if we could check out later and we were given a response in a timely manner (and granted it)! Contactless check-in and check-out as well!! I would highly recommend this house to anyone who asked!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My group and I enjoyed the outdoor space including the fire pit, basketball hoop, and spacious yard for yard games. Brandon was great and let us check in a little early on check in day and had the place super cleaned up for us. A great place to stay and spend the weekend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,nice quiet place. easy drive to Alex. I'll be reaching out if ever in Alex again

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks a lot, Brandon. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at your place. It was so clean and organized. We really enjoyed spending time in the screened in patio. And appreciated the Info book/instructions that really laid things out in a neat, readable way. We liked the design and simplicity of the place too."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for a week and enjoyed it thoroughly. The home is in a very quiet and peaceful location. No car noises. No loud neighbors. Brandon ( the host) was on top of everything. He immediately responded to every message and took care of the one minor issue we encountered (grill), which worked great after he looked at it. The furniture and bedding are quite comfortable. The home is stocked in an impressive manner. We didn't need to buy or ask for anything and the items are of high quality. We didn't watch much tv but noticed a lot of channels were included. The description and pictures are 100% accurate."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable & well-stocked, convenient to Alexandria. We enjoyed watching the summer sunset from the screened-in porch."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, very well put together and comfortable. Will definitely stay here again next time."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kris and Carrie’s place! The hosts were wonderful, responding quickly to our questions and even offering to run an item over to us during our stay.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We did a girls trip and the 4 bedrooms suited us. The living space was a great place to relax and visit. The coffee bar was a nice bonus feature.
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,The reasons for our stay was sad as a group of us were in town for a funeral. However the opportunity to stay at this place together between the services and after was an incredible home to be together. It was super close to a lot of the lovely restaurants Alexandria has to offer. I highly recommend staying here. Also the cozy movie room in the basement was a winner at night.
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"When arriving, my mom and I were greeted at the door. However, the room we stayed in had cob webs on ceiling and a spider along with a big hole in the wall. Bathroom was really dirty. The floor had strands of hair on floor and dirt. Shower also had hair on sides and hair catcher was all brown and rusty. Did not realize the only private space was only the bedroom and bathroom while the rest of the basement was a shared space. With being in the basement, any movement upstairs was very loud. For the price we paid, we expected to have a more private space."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Friendly hosts, quiet neighborhood, and a great place to stay for the night."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house and the bed was so comfortable

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Terilyn, James and Kaia are wonderful! Terilyn is very responsive to questions/ messages and accommodating to your needs!! I would return and recommend this AirBnB! Lastly, give Kaia time to warm up to you. She can be a little intimidating at first because she's a German Shepard, but she is very well trained and a doll once she warms up to you!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Thank you for having me. I had a great weekend

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn’t have been happier with Terilyn’s place. The location was central and easy to find. We just needed a place to sleep as we were busy during the day, and this was very reasonably priced. We had all the amenities we needed, including lots of charging options near the bed, and a nice, firm mattress! We would happily stay there again. A reading light on both sides of the bed would have been nice, but I can’t think of any other improvements I could recommend. Great choice!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fabulous place?

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Terilyn and her husband were super hostesses! Very flexible, very friendly, very helpful. Our accommodations were fabulous - it was like having your own apt! Terilyn has yummy, healthy breakfast items, coffee. She was there to meet our needs. Lovely house and our area was spacious. Thick towels for the shower and plenty of them. She provided shampoo, body wash, make-up remover wipes. They have a beautiful German Shepard that was so sweet, didn't jump on you, calm yet friendly.
If we are up in Alexandria, we will definitely want to stay there again. They were so warm and welcoming.
The price couldn't be beat. They were in a great area, only 13 minutes from the Carlos Winery.
We'd be delighted to have them as neighbors!"

Wish there was a simple desk such as one to replace the nightstand. Liked to have a chair or two in the room. There was a sofa and a pool table which I could use in the living area outside of the bedroom. Also, Jim fixed a handrail at the staircase to the lower level during my stay. That was nice."

Thanks for a great stay!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a very relaxing long weekend at the A-frame cabin! It was a weepy rain type of weather so we couldn’t do much outdoors, but it was a perfect stay indoors and enjoy the cabin weather, it was so nice because They had many board games, a beautiful fireplace, large modern bathrooms! And clean crisp linens! A large tv with all the streaming channels! Also the kitchen is well appointed with everything you need! Lots of beds! Views of the large lake, and lots of living room furniture to relax on! We just loved it! Our plan is to come back every year for this same long weekend!
Ps: the 3rd loft was fun for our 12 year old to climb to and watch everyone down below. There is also a small living room type from the master bedroom to read in or just enjoy your coffee in peace."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Everything about this stay was magical. The home itself was in exceptional condition and we all felt right at home. We are for sure going to book in the near future! Thank you for creating this masterpiece as it made for a perfect bachelorette weekend :)

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,So beautiful! This was the best and most CLEAN airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Very modern and stylish. We loved being able to visit the nearby brewery/winery/pizza place. It was so close!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,It was super awesome and memorable would love to go back
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cozy, yet spacious A-frame. Modern and simple. Lake was very shallow, but was perfect for our 3 year old to play. Water was crystal clear! Used paddle boards and bonfire pit. Enjoyed driving into Alexandria for activities and restaurants. Krysta was very responsive to messages! Thank you for having us!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a ""best of the best"" Airbnb! Really enjoyed our time here. Easy and comfortable. Super clean, super gorgeous. September was a great month to visit - fall colors but still perfect temps for being outside. Hope to be back next year!!"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed for a long weekend for a bachelorette getaway. The bride was looking for a more relaxed environment and this place had everything and more. With a group of 7 of us, there was plenty of room everywhere we hung out; kitchen, dining table, living room, outside (thanks for the additional lawn chairs!). We were comfortable wherever we were in the home. It is much bigger than the photo shows, and photos did not do justice of how beautiful the home actually is. We came extra prepared for the weekend but love that mostly everything we needed was already there. We even took the paddle boards out one afternoon. We had such a great time that most of us wish we stayed longer for the extra R&R. This is one of the best Airbnbs we've stayed at and will be back for sure! Thank you, Krysta, for being a great host and having this space available for us! It was PERFECT."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such an amazing time at this beautiful lake place. Super clean and beautifully decorated. We have no complaints after our stay, just great memories! Would recommend for families. We had 9 total (4 adults and 5 kids.) and got creative with sleeping arrangements, but weren’t able to be inside (the firepit was the perfect solution) after kids bedtime or we would have woken them up. If we were to stay again we would bring a few sleeping bags or air mattresses and have all the kids sleep in the triple bed room.
The lake is beautiful. The only issue we had was water level of the lake, but that isn’t a reflection on this amazing space. We had to walk our boat out and “beach” it to dock as the water level was less than 2’ at the dock. The good part of the lower water level was we could let our kids play without worrying."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful stay. Great locations, beautiful lake and close to many activities. The cabin was spacious, with plenty of room for 6 adults for a week stay. Bedroom layout was great.
Would recommend this cabin to others and hope to return again in the future"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The Lake Place was not only beautiful, but everything was thoughtfully done. From the bedroom configurations, to what the kitchen was stocked with, it was one of the best AirBNB's any of us had been to. Perfect for a small family getaway or girls weekend!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"My cousins (some of whom I hadn’t seen in over 25 years) and I were grateful beyond words to have had this space to reconnect and enjoy. It comfortably slept nine of us, and the open kitchen/family room was so spacious and welcoming as we ate, drank, talked, sang, danced, and laughed until we cried. The beach was beautiful, perfect for floating and playing. The fire pit and paddle boards ensured that we weren’t bored, day or night. We couldn’t believe how lucky we were to have spent this time together, inside and outside, in such a gorgeous setting. Thank you, Krysta, for your attention to detail building such an amazing space for us to make memories!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Krista's home was exactly as described. Our family had an amazing time at Lake Miltona and would definitely recommend to others.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The photos of this home on the website don't do it justice! This is a gorgeous, modern, but cozy home full of light!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had such a wonderful time! The place was fantastic! It had all the amenities and more! We felt right at home when we got there. We can’t wait to come up again in the future!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Had the best time celebrating a bachelorette party up at this cabin. The beautiful outside captures exactly what to expect on the inside- more beauty! From the cabinets to the hardware to the furniture everything was so nice. It felt like so much space with all of the big windows and natural light. I love that paddle boards were provided w/ easy access to the lake from a dock on the property. Honestly thinking about planning another girls weekend at this cabin! Couldn’t recommend it enough!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Plenty of space. Would definitely recommend this place to others!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful fishing getaway! Being able to dock our boat at the end of the day instead of trailering it made things so much easier. Coming back to a beautiful A frame with everything we need and views of the lake made our stay very relaxing!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The property was just as described and the water in front of the property was clear with a sandy bottom that stayed shallow for hundreds of feet. Property was highly functional and beautiful - situated on a dead-end road (little to no auto traffic) with mature trees and amazing views of sunrise. We just loved it. Krysta was very responsive, helpful, and gracious throughout our stay. Such a great time!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Lake Place was the perfect place for a quick weekend getaway! It was spacious with a well stocked kitchen for cooking, very clean and great water views from the wall of windows. We enjoyed our stay and can’t wait to come back for a longer visit next time. Thank you for sharing your cabin with us!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at the a-frame. Very clean, very spacious, and made me feel at home.

I absolutely loved this place and would love to return if I ever come back to Minnesota!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home and great host
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin is stunning! I stayed here with 6 friends and we all comfortably had beds to sleep in.

2023-04-01,5,Group trip,Had a girls’ weekend in at Krysta’s place and it was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! The house is stunning and bright and beautiful. It had everything we needed for our stay! Would definitely recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,We had a wonderful stay at the Lake Place A-frame! Such a beautiful home with intentional design. Everything felt luxurious while still being functional and livable. The windows are gorgeous and we loved all of the natural light filling the home. Watching the sunrise from the main living space was so peaceful. We already looking forward to staying again!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is a dream! The design is stunning and the view is gorgeous. Krysta was very accommodating and responsive. She made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy a long weekend. I would highly recommend this lake home!
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Cozy A-frame cabin on a peaceful lake. Great space for hosting a bachelorette party. Very clean. Great communication. Would love to go back someday!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had the best time here! I used it for a photography content retreat and it was the perfect backdrop for all of our photos.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,What a beautiful place you have! Our family enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to visiting again.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"I am so grateful for the most incredible stay!! we were able to have so much fun and relax! Such an incredible host, she was so responsive and welcoming! Will definitely be renting again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Place was great! Beautiful and clean.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could tell it was going to be a great stay as soon as we walked in. Krysta was a great communicator and assisted us in handling unforeseen circumstances. She was very accommodating in letting us check in early. It was the peaceful gateway we needed to relax and unwind. Even in the Minnesota cold, we enjoyed taking morning walks and watching the sunset. A wonderful place to stay!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When I first found the Lake House on Lake Miltona on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. But everything was spot on as described.
Krysta is a thoughtful, gracious host and the space is amazing—even in December. Great lake views, spacious—yet warm—home with all necessary amenities (kitchen is awesome). The setting is quiet and somewhat secluded but you are close to restaurants, shops, etc.
Definitely worth a reservation and visit any time of year!"
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Had the most wonderful girls weekend! Beautiful house and great location.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Krysta's place is way better in person; pictures don't do it justice. The area is good for those looking for a place to relax but town/shopping is just 20 min away. The place is spacious, very modern, and well equipped. This place was perfect for our girl's weekend; can't wait to go back next time we need a gateway."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, brand new, great space for a fun weekend away! A perfect stay!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,great place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The A-frame cabin was perfection! Krysta and her partner literally thought of everything to ensure families and groups have an meaningful and comfortable stay. Check in process was smooth and easy as we only needed to enter with a code. Host was very responsive and made sure our needs were met. My family can’t wait to revisit in the summer!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I'm not sure where to start with this place because it was absolutely amazing. If you're from Minnesota this is your dream cabin. If you're not from MN this is the best place to experience the northern lake life. Not only is this the best cabin I've ever stayed in, it also had every amenity you could ask for. If we had gone grocery shopping before our trip I don't think we would have left. We didn't have a boat but definitely going to book again so we can come back with and get out on the lake!
Alexandria is also 15 minutes away which has tons of really cool shops. We ended up getting coffee and breakfast one morning at a place called the Edge co. which was really good. I think our favorite was Carlos Creek Winery (which was literally 4 minutes from the cabin). Not only is it a massive winery but it also has a brewery and a pizza place. They had live music and plenty of room for my son to run around while we could watch him and enjoy some drinks!
I almost don't want people to find out how great this place is so I can book again without others trying to take prime weekends. Can't wait to come back."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My 10-year-old daughter wanted to review the stay and she said, “not only was the place esthetically beautiful to the eyes, the comfort of the home was just as relaxing, I didn’t want to leave the home at all.” Thank you for sharing your place with us. Our kids and in-laws enjoyed the comfort of your home. Our favorite part was seeing the deers from the balcony in the early mornings, and watching the black squirrels run around in the backyard. The water was very clear and shallow enough to swim with little ones. We enjoyed the winery and country blossom while there. We cooked all of our meals there, as you had everything available for us to do so. We hope to visit again, especially during the summer to jump in the lake."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"This little A Frame cabin is as adorable as they come. Great place for a ladies weekend getaway! The space was perfect for relaxing & the the open concept allowed us to hang out with entire group with plenty of room to socialize & sit. The kitchen has everything a person could need to entertain and cook. Wineries, restaurants, and shopping is a quick car-ride away. Definitely an Airbnb gem in the Alexandria area!
Thank you for sharing your lovely place with us to relax and recharge. 🥰"
