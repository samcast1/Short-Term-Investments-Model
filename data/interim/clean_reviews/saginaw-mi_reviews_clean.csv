2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for providing us with a place to stay while visiting family. The place was comfortable and roomy. They had everything we needed to be comfortable. We will choose this place from now on when I visit my Saginaw family.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Place was very nice and quiet. I couldn't tell from the photos, but there is a TV near the bed, and then one in the cabinet downstairs. Bed is firm, so recommend using the extra blanket if didn't bring an extra one yourself. Was able to set the temperature to what I like. Everything you need to cook is there. Not so much for baking, or I might be blind lol. couldn't find measurement cups and/or spoons. I packed light for this trip, was visiting family in the area. The location was easy to find and get to. Very much enjoyed my stay."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a nice place to stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This was a great place for a long term stay. Hosts were very helpful when check-in plans changed last minute. I really appreciated their flexibility. Quiet and private. I would stay again!

2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for our needs - close to Gratiot and State Street, shopping, drug store, restaurants and family."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great space to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a quick getaway. Only downside is that the only tv and bathroom were upstairs.
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"I booked this place based on the rating. What I walked into was not what I expected, was far below my expectations, and my 3-night reservation turned into a 1-night stay. The stairs leading to the decking for the entrance to the side door are broken and the decking in the back is spongy in some spots. Overall, the decking is neglected and unsafe in some spots. The floors were not clean, specifically in the kitchen area. The A/C unit and/or the thermostat were broken. It was disturbing to see the thermostat had been modified with a toggle switch on the side, and packing tape was wrapped around the thermostat to keep it somewhat in place. It took more time to wire up the toggle switch and tape it to the thermostat than it would have to purchase and install a new unit. The hot water side of the kitchen faucet was not functioning properly. Slats in the blinds were broken. The toilet seat was loose in the bathroom and there was hair in the sink.
In addition, If you like to sleep in the dark, this place is not a good fit. Directly over the bed is a skylight and a majority of the windows located on the upper part of the walls (which cast light into the bedroom) don't have any type of covering on them. In the late spring/summer this presents a problem since it's light by 6:00 a.m.
On the plus side, once the owners responded to my concerns, they agreed to refund the remainder of my stay. I do hope the owners address the issues that caused me to leave early, it could be a nice place and it's in a good location."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"For my first time using Airbnb, I could not have picked a better place to stay. The hosts were amazing and the house was even better."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Mike & Cindi were great to work with on any small issues that arose. The security door lock needed batteries and the wifi became disconnected. Mike took care of these issues immediately. Love this private location in Saginaw Township.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A large, spacious and clean loft style with LOTS of space -- I really liked it. Safe area. Location is really good. No washing machine/dryer so keep that in mind for long stays. The hosts were very welcoming and responsive via the app. Lots of amenities. There is a small size glass opening in the cieling above the bed that didn't bother me at all as I am an early riser anywyas.

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This is a nice space overall. The furnishing and bed are comfortable. There are three skylights, one right over the bed, that bathe the space in light, what light is to be had in a Michigan winter. This was a bit of a challenge for me, as I was there on business, working night and sleeping during the days, but a sleep mask worked fine. In the afternoons, when I woke up, the space was always bright and cheery. The location is great, about 10 minutes from downtown. The hosts were responsive and made sure my needs were met."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Paul was AWESOME. Not only was this place an emergency respite for my family when we needed it most, Paul went 1000% above and beyond to make sure my disabled mom had everything she needed. He was incredibly attentive, respectful, and helpful. The duplex is what you'd expect for that area of Saginaw but you can tell time, effort, and care is taken to make it as comfortable and home-like as possible. 10/10 would and will recommend :)"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very responsive & reasonably priced. Older duplex, adequate accommodation ."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Paul was so accommodating! I booked last minute and he had the place ready early. It’s an older duplex but it was very clean. The bed was comfortable. Nice big tv in the living room. The sectional could use one of those mats so the cushions don’t sink in but it was just me so I used the chaise. It was easy check in and check out. I would definitely stay there again.

But fix the fireplace as it’s chilly down there…"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The stay was good for our family plus dogs. There was plenty of room and the fenced in yard was nice. A few issues we encountered... the coffee maker was useless. It stated it needed descaled and we had no idea how to do this, we in turn found a Tim Horntons near by and they have divine coffee. also, note there are quite a few low lying areas in the back yard making for standing water and muddy doggies. Other than that the stay was as expected."

2023-11-01,4.0,Group trip,"Wonderful place to stay in Saginaw. Close enough to Frankenmuth that if that’s your destination the drive is easy peasy. Beds were comfortable with lots of linens available. Kitchen had everything you need. Clean up expectations were very kind, doable, and appreciated."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I stayed in Saginaw for work and the house was perfect for my great dane and I. The fenced yard was great and the neighborhood was quiet. I felt very comfortable. James was also very responsive to messages. I would definitely stay there again!
2023-10-01,4.0,Group trip,We had 7 people in our group and this provided just enough space for all of us to sleep for one night. The place was clean and comfortable. It was great for staying one night and being able to be all together instead of separate hotel rooms.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was just fine - was gone most of the time.. Driveway was tight
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. The house was so cute and quaint. We thought the neighborhood was adorable. Our fur babies loved the fenced in yard. However, due to previous guest and their fur babies, there was a scent of pets. But because our ""little girls"" are part of our family, it would not keep us from coming back for another stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an awesome home. We really enjoyed it. The fenced in back yard was great for my dogs. The TV was easy to work. We found some great movies. The kitchen was clean and well equipped. The bathroom was clean and had everything you needed. The beds were comfortable. All in all this was a great place to stay and we would rent it again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was my first time staying at an AirBNB and I had a wonderful experience. As a host, James was very friendly and extremely responsive. For check in, getting into the house was a breeze.
The house and neighborhood were exactly as described. The house was clean and well kept. It is charmingly decorated and very comfortable. Everything works as it should. The neighborhood was lovely - on a quiet street surrounded by many other quiet streets where I could easily and safely take my dogs for a walk. And all the neighbors we passed were very friendly as we walked by.
I was traveling with my dogs and this was a truly dog friendly house. There were bowls for water in the kitchen and many other little signs that dogs were welcome. And the spacious fenced in back yard was a real treat! I almost never have that when I travel with my dogs!
The dogs and I had a wonderful stay and I would absolutely stay at this home again should my travels take my dogs and me back to the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It’s difficult to find a nice yet affordable place for our family. We have 6 kids, baby to 13 and this home was simple and perfect for our stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect for what my crew and I needed
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house is as described in the listing. The fenced-in backyard has more than enough space for dogs to run around making it very pet friendly. Not far from Frankenmuth and Birch Run. The actual neighborhood the house is in is a nice, quite neighborhood. It is 100% worth the listed nightly price. If I needed a place to stay in the area in the future, I would definitely stay there again. Especially if traveling with my dogs."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was nice and very clean. Everything worked well. It was a wonderful stay and I would stay again if I was in the area. Thanks James.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can not describe how happy we were with this awesome house! It was as cozy as my own home and I slept just as good there as my own bed. I fell in love with this house! My family fell in love with this house! I highly recommend anyone staying here. If I could give 20 stars, I would! Thanks Jim, we enjoyed your house!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place. Perfect for our group of 7. Clean and homey.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I’m sure the home would have been lovely. Unfortunately our truck broke down and we never made it there.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,James was great with all communication anytime we had questions. This was a perfect place to stay for our family while we went fishing on Lake Heron. Our family would stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,James is a great host. Very responsive and friendly. Couldn’t ask for a better first time Airbnb experience. Place looks just like the pics. Loved that he had an air purifier for the living room. Lots of sleeping space and great location.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I was able to reserve last minute for a family funeral. Reserving was easy enough; however there was an additional rental agreement we had to sign after reserving through Airbnb that we did not know about until after paying.
We always stay in pet-friendly Airbnbs and know what comes with them. I was disappointed upon first entering to notice a very distinct pet urine smell throughout the house. The house was decently clean but there was dirt and leaves and pet hair.
With a $100 cleaning fee I definitely was mostly disappointed by the smell.
In the end it was still a decent place for us to stay. The house was nicely decorated, the beds were comfy, and our dogs enjoyed the fenced in backyard!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time! Felt right at home and can’t wait to be in the area again
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was perfect for what we needed!
I was very pleasantly surprised by how quiet the neighborhood was and how safe it felt. Our dogs loved the fenced in back yard and I appreciated that the host stocked the house with lots of basics! It sounds simple but it was refreshing to stay at an airbnb that had a spice cabinet and bottled waters in the fridge for example:)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"A great, very pet friendly place! Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Jim was a great host and his house is in a great location! Quiet and close to many stores, restaurants, and nearby attractions like Frankenmuth."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"James was a great host. The house we stayed in was in a quiet older neighborhood. We were visiting the Saginaw Vally State University, and it was a 13 minute easy drive back and forth.
Krogers was right across the street from the house and lovely little mom and pop places to eat like Fuzzy’s were great as well as more formal dining like Coty’s were within 7minutes.
James had a book with all of the nearby restaurants, attractions, and house instructions in a nice easy to read notebook. He even left goodies for us.
The home is in need of some updating, but it is easy to see that James’ goal is to provide his guest with a comfortable, safe, and quiet stay. We experienced just that.
Thanks James!"

The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe coming and going, even with little ones in tow. The hosts were very responsive leading up to our stay and accommodating. When visiting Saginaw, this location is a solid option. This stay was a reminder to carefully examine all amenities and not make any assumptions about what is/ isn't included. I didn't realize the home didn't have AC until I checked in. Upon review of amenities, I realized AC was excluded therefore I couldn't complain. The temperature wasn't always awful and they provided fans, however, the internal temp didn't drop below 77 during waking hours. Just be mindful to not assume anything about a house. I would stay here again but would be better prepared to ensure personal comfortability ."

Everything was simply wonderful. Emily and Perry and such kind hearted and positive people.
They have been running this AirBnB for quite a while now so everything has been worked out to the smallest detail.
Room was spacious and clean, tasty vitamin water and snacks were waiting for me when I arrived. Private bathroom was perfect.
Kitchen has everything you need, another big thank you to the hosts for letting us use everything from coffee mugs to baking pans and the oven.
It was always nice running into Emily while cooking in the kitchen or pulling up in the driveway, we’d always find an interesting topic to talk about.
If you need a place to stay and want it to feel like your home away from home, this is the place to rent! Highly highly recommended!
Wishing them all the best, thank you again for everything from the muffins to winter coats and the little present.
Love,
Maddie (and Edgar)."

2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first experience booking a 'private room,' and was expecting it to be a little awkward. My experience was quite the opposite!

2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We arrived at the house later than expected, so that Emily was not present. Her step-father Perry, however, was wonderful in hospitality, warm welcome, and orientation.
Our room was luxurious, parking easy, and all the amenities in a quiet, safe, convenient neighborhood were perfect: a great find."

She offered coffee, use of the kitchen, snacks, and many other accommodations to really make you feel at home."
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"At the last moment I had to be in Michigan for a next day meeting, so I had to take my dog along. The hotel fees for a pet were costly. My daughter insisted I use Airbnb. She signed me up and quickly found the most charming room and host imaginable in a quaint little community. Although I didn't meet Emily, who by the way responded immediately to my request and questions, her mother was very welcoming, charming and a wonderful host. I would recommend staying here if you're in Saginaw."
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emily's house was an absolute oasis for this weary traveller, located deep in a quiet neighborhood, with a large inviting deck and swing facing a natural green yard full of trees. I drank coffee, and did emails outside, and left totally recharged.
The guest rooms are on the opposite side from the family quarters so any interaction you choose to have is up to you. the room is oversized and immaculate. The large driveway ensures all cars are off the street. I used my kitchen privilege to enjoy a real dinner.
Thanks, Emily, for a fantastic stay."
2016-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is in a quiet neighborhood. The place is 20 minutes away from Saginaw Valley State University. Resraunts and shopping that I found are also about 20 minute drive away.
The listing does not entirely live up to the description.
During my three day stay the living room was off limits. Lots of packed up boxes, messy and unwelcoming. When I arrived bathroom was unclean. Same deal with the kitchen. The listing does not mention that the room is right next to another room, which is being used as a separate listing for other renters. During my stay the adjescent room was continuosly occupied.
I was met at the door, but not by the listing's host. I arrived after 11 p. m., and could still get in, which is great. There was a parking spot. In general, the place left an impression of not quite having lived up to the description."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Emily is a very nice person. I was truly amazed by the property. It was very clean, very nice, very comfortable. It was a great experience. I would strongly recommend staying there."

2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Emily made us feel very welcomed. She checked to see when we would arrive and let us know how to best find her house. She came to the door to greet us before we even got to the door. She gave us the tour and asked if we needed anything. She offered to help carry items in. She had some snack items available for us to have in the room. The place matched well to the description online. The room was very spaceious as we had a baby with us as well. The neighborhood was quiet and calm.
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emily's mom, Jenny was a delightful host! She was so friendly and made me feel comfortable in her home as soon as I got there. In the evening, we had great conversation along with another AirBnB guest. Jenny offered snacks and drinks too... I couldn't pass up her delicious cookies! She also connected me with other people that will be helpful as I continue traveling. I appreciated her hospitality so much! The house was clean and inviting in a quiet residential neighborhood. Anything you need to eat or buy is just a short drive away."
2016-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The room we stayed in is spacious. There were several nice touches such as towels laid out and snacks if needed. We had only a brief stay but had use of the kitchen for coffee and tea in the morning.We did not get to meet Emily but her mom was there to greet us.
2016-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect stay. Location is quiet residential street. Encouraged access to kitchen and living area.
Space was exceptionally clean, and room was spacious with desk and cable t.v.

Emily was away, however, her mom was quite engaging, and shared her stellar baked cookies."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The stay at James’ home was great. The home was just as described and perfect for our stay. We had a question while we were there and he was quick to respond. Also, when we left a friend realized she was missing something and James went above and beyond looking for it to ensure it was not left there. I would highly recommend staying here."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,James was amazing to work with. Answered all questions right away and his place was great. We would definitely work with James and stay in his home again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Alvin St. house was a really wonderful stay. We knew we did not want to stay in a hotel for two nights with our kids, that we wanted them to have more space and have some quiet time in the evenings. The kitchen was very nice and we made a couple of meals while we were there, which is such a perk to an Air BNB. We went to college in this area so we are very familiar with the location but it is super close to everything, centrally located.
The rooms were clutter free and spacious.
The bathrooms were very clean and the towels were really nice, which is a perk as well.
The only feedback I have for someone looking to stay here, is that this is a pet friendly home and we could smell the smell of dog when we arrived. We do not have pets so it was noticeable to us, but not so terrible that we were upset.
Overall a nice stay in a cute house."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another great stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time with our friends and 2 kids! It was the perfect amount of space, and had everything we needed and then some! Highly recommend!"

2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location but needs new carpeting and updates. There were pet odors and we sprayed 2 cans of Febreze. There were also notable stains on the rugs. I would rate this a 3star. Location was good but a noticeable pet smell. Because it was a work trip, we did not notify the host, just did what we could to make it bearable. It was disappointing. Needs better cleaner. The cleaning fee we were charged was not worth it."

I was trying to book a cab for almost 3 hours (4:30-7:30am) but nothing seemed to work and I had a flight to catch at 10. I asked Rebecca for help and she took this upon her and decided to come all the way to Detroit to drop me at the airport. I was running out of time and it’s takes around 2 hours to reach the DTW airport from Saginaw. Rebecca was bang on, she got me exactly at 9:30 to the airport and my flight was around 10 pm. Although I missed the flight by a whisker but I was amazed at Rebecca’s kind behaviour. Although I felt bad for causing all the trouble, but Rebecca didn’t mind helping.
May god bless her. I ll surely stay here again whenever m in Saginaw."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Although we did not have a chance to meet Rebecca, she was very helpful and nice. Her instruction was accurate so we had no problem spending the overnight and catching an early flight next morning. Recommended!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Rebecca's place was perfect for me. It was close to where I was attending a conference. Rebecca was great about my mistake in booking her place. I recommend her place for a woman needing a place close to SVSU.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I was very happy with my stay. Rebecca is a wonderful hist. She helped me out with my booking mistake. I would recommend her place for any single lady looking for a place near SVSU. I was in the area for a conference and her place was quiet and convenient. I highly recommend Boho Airbnb

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place,Rebecca welcomed us warmly.

The people that wanted to go to bed a little early had no trouble with conversation or noise traveling upstairs. The beds are comfortable, the linens are quality, the decor is minimal but very nice and the kitchen is well stocked. There were lots of live plants around, which was nice.
The only (and I mean only) downside is that the door knobs are loud when you turn them, so anyone sneaking in or out of a room during the night can be heard. Otherwise with a little bathroom logistical planning and consideration with the door knobs we had a fabulous stay and would definitely consider coming back in the future!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful home which made great for our shortnstay as we bid farewell to a dear friend who passed unexpectedly. The home is centrally located to nearly EVERYTHING. We traveled no more than 5 minutes from the home to reach our destinations of choice. The home is immaculately clean and spacious. I absolutely love the greenery/plants scattered about the home. Plant life makes the hkme feel like home and connected to nature. Id definitely book this home again if ever in Saginaw area. Carrie definitely gets a 10 out of 10 from me!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at Carrie’s while we visited a friend in Saginaw. She was very accommodating when we had to change the reservation the week before and the house was very lovely. I would definitely stay there again.

Of note, we enjoyed the large dining room, the relaxing family room, and even the large backyard.
We would certainly stay here again. Thank you, Carrie!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful home!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The inside of house is really nice and very well decorated. Big kitchen with all the things you would need to cook and so glad there was coffee in the pantry! Plenty of room in bedrooms with comfortable beds. Big backyard for dog to run around, we would stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Carrie's lovely home! We lacked for nothing, and the modern, updated decor mixed with the original woodwork and floors made us feel like we were in a luxury hotel. The first day of our stay it rained all day, but we had plenty of room to visit in the living area and dining area. The next evening we enjoyed sitting on the front porch as the weather was just perfect. We arrived a little early, and since the house was ready, Carrie let us check in a little early, which was greatly appreciated.
Everything was perfect! I hope to stay there again when we get back to MI, and I know my brother and sister in law will recommend the home to others when they visit. The best part was the affordable price! Can't beat it!"

Carrie communicates well and place is a lovely historic home."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was my longest AirBnB booking by far, and I would stay at Earnie's Place again in a heartbeat. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook exactly what I wanted. The market two blocks away had a great selection of good quality produce, and almost everything else I would buy at much larger supermarkets near my hone. I appreciated that I was within 15 minutes of any place I might want to go in Saginaw, and just as close to my dad's homestead in Albee. It will be a real treat when the construction is done on Sheridan.
The host's communication during my stay was perfect: quite attentive without being intrusive. The decor felt very homey and welcoming, and there were gorgeous linens galore. I liked that there was hard flooring throughout--no carpet--making it easy to quickly clean the floor with just a broom and Swiffer on my long stay. I appreciated the selection of books and other reading material, including local themed cookbooks.
I felt so at home, and I can't wait to return!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay. The host was extremely accommodating and the house was cozy and very comfy and entertaining.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cozy home was very clean, nice furniture and comfortable beds. It’s located around 20 minutes to Frankenmuth, MI and that’s one of the reasons I chose this place. The price was right and I was pleased to find it at the last minute. My sister, my husband and I enjoyed the place and will consider it for a future visit.
One sweet touch that I never experienced from other Airbnb was that the host asked me if I wanted things to drink and provided waters, sodas, chips and mint candies. That made us special!
It was very thoughtful of asking and the bottles of water was what we needed after a long drive.
Also, the Christmas lights were inviting and a great surprise. Thank you so much for making our time out of home like it was our home."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,They was very nice I love the place I appreciate them so much. I will be back to stay there

Small and cozy, in a transitional neighborhood, easy to get to downtown Saginaw and local attractions. Everything in the house felt like it was curated especially for us. Instructions throughout made everything easy to use, and we felt quite welcome. We were in town to visit our daughter, and with the current surge in Covid rates, I was concerned about being able to stay safe, so the extra steps they took to stay sanitary were well appreciated! Thanks so much!"

Appliances are new and perfect for cooking meals.
The neighborhood while quiet is very run down. Homes surrounding the Airbnb are ran down and it’s clear the neighborhood is not the greatest:
Downtown Saginaw is a bit better with some cute stores and museums.
If you are a coffee lover you must try Biggsby coffee !"

Their attention to detail makes me believe that this Airbnb is not just a source of income for the owners, hospitality must be their hobby. I took notes on the construction for my own future residence but building to this level is too nice for me to feel humble."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed on a Friday night. We were able to view the bedrooms that weren't rented. The house was full of antiques, comfortable upholstered furniture, and wool rugs. We stayed in the Hulda Rm which was cozy but still comfortable and lots of nice touches. We walked around the grounds and then went into Old Town , just 5 minutes away, to have dinner and a drink. We felt safe and enjoyed the ambiance. Room temp was fine but the room included a fan, which we used, just because we both like to have white noise at night but we slept very well and never heard a peep. In the morning there was a full breakfast made from scratch: scrambled eggs, sausage patties, fruit, mini pancakes, breakfast potatoes, along with cereal and milk. We had checked out and were pulling out of the driveway when I got a call about a top that I had left in the room. They ran out and handed it to me before we even had a chance to go back in. Would highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When we arrived at the Montague Inn we were taken aback. My mom & I were staying here for a concert in downtown which was only a 5 minutes drive away. Not only was it full of history but the scenes around were gorgeous. One of our favorite moments was looking through the books located on the bottom floor & finding so many guest comment books from so many different decades! 💘 we would 100% recommend staying here for your wedding, a cozy weekend or just a night to get away from home! It was exquisite!
Our hot breakfast was delicious, as they had a variety of many different things offered. Waffles, pancakes, sausage, hashbrowns, bagels, coffee, fruit, yogurt! You name it, they were serving!
A huge thank you to the groundskeepers!"

2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Everything was great except one issue. First the good: The place itself is beautiful and wonderfully preserved back to its origins. Loved walking around and seeing all the different rooms. The place was clean, and did not have that ""old house"" smell.
Check in was easy and pleasant
Now the bad. And it's the only bad thing. We knew we were going to be spending minimal time in the room for one night so we reserved the small room, the original maids quarters. When we came in to the room that night, the room was warm with the heater going full blast. There is no individual thermostat in the room. We closed the vent but it was blowing so hard, heat was still coming out. We opened a window but it didn't help. It ran all night long. By morning we were sweating like crazy. At checkout we overheard other guest mentioning how warm it was. So I'm assuming it was a furnace issue.

Other than that we loved the place and do plan on returning this summer."
,,,The house was as it was described in the listing. Large and lots of space. Our issue was the smell and animal hair and dust in piles around and under the furniture. We knew going in this was a pet friendly home but the smell was terrible. It smelt like cats and dogs had urinated on all surfaces and it hadn’t been properly clean. As soon as we got there we had to open all windows and still that did not help. There were air fresheners placed all around the house that made the smell worse. We would not recommended this home to anyone. As soon as we checked in we checks out.
,,,My stay was unsatisfactory wen u 1st approached it said nice neighborhood and it wasn’t I had strange people knocking on the front door continuously which was spooky to me And the property was a smoking home but the smoke detectors went off every time I smoked a cigarette also when I tried to use the bathroom I had to clean it again due to the pubic hairs under the toilet seat also .. it was a mess!!
