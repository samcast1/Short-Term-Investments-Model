2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Overall, our stay at this container home was 5-stars. Absolutely no complaints. This place is a hidden gem in Stockton! It was so quiet and peaceful, that I could hear the crickets chirping during the day.
I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the home felt! There was a door that sectioned off the bedroom from the bathroom and another door from the bathroom to the kitchen, so there was privacy amongst other guests. The windows were mirror tinted, so we were able to enjoy the view of the large oak trees and pond without having to worry about anyone looking in.
During the day, we hung out by the pond and sandy beach-like area. The pond was so massive, it seemed more like a lake! At night, we lit a fire pit, put the lights on to the pond waterfall and enjoyed the quiet sounds of nature and water. It was quite the experience.
Shelly and Brian were an amazing host. He was very communicative with us with when we had any questions. I will definitely be renting from them again!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, I felt safe and accommodated for our 3 night stay. A friend got married at River Mills in French Camp and it was an easy 15 min drive down the 5.
This cottage is detached from the main home but you are on the same property. It's an adorable one bedroom place, well designed and simply styled.
Check-in and out was easy, Kate showed us the ropes, then left us to our own until we messaged her we were leaving.
We are tall and the bed sunk in the middle, slightly. Everything was super clean and easy to operate. I like scalding hot showers and this one definitely got hot, but not that one notch above where I like it. I likely could have adjusted the water heater since it's in the unit but it didn't bother me enough to bother."

(I kid you not!) Everything is high quality - bed and bedding, towels, amenities etc. I would make a special trip out to stay here anytime, and am already looking at my calendar.

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My 13-year old daughter and I needed a place to stay for a softball tournament. The previous time we were in Stockton, we stayed at the Extended Stay America. That particular hotel was noisy, the freezer didn't work, and the long-term guests had shouting arguments in the parking lot. We decided to try an airbnb in a safe neighborhood, figuring next to the Stockton Country Club should be safe. Our assumption was correct. The unit was in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Moreover, the unit was very clean and well stocked with toiletries and coffee. We'll be back the next time we're in Stockton. Thanks for a great stay!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This got to be one of the best suite I‚Äôve stayed. Place is clean and seems to be a really safe area. The only downside of this is that the road is right next to the rental so you‚Äôll hear a lot of cars go by constantly. Also, there‚Äôs these weird knocks at times I couldn‚Äôt figure out where this knock coming from but it kept waking me up at night.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed a night to break up a 16-hour drive from Eugene to San Diego and glad I chose this place. The AirBNB is attached to the main house but had its own private entrance that requires a code (in addition to the suite). As a solo female traveler, I felt very safe and had a restful night.
It was super clean and well decorated. It had its own dedicated thermostat and not some wall unit that barely cools the room in the summer time. The neighborhood was quiete, safe, and peaceful.
The bed was super comfy with crisp, clean linens. A note (for my vertically challenged friends) that it‚Äôs a bit high üòÖ.
The hosts were very responsive, proactive, and welcoming. I hope to book again next time I‚Äôm in town."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent place to stay in Lodi and a great private place that is in a lovely neighborhood. Even though it was a part of Daniel‚Äôs house it was completely separate and we never saw or heard anyone. Only 10 minutes to the charming downtown of Lodi and also

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The sunflower suite was absolutely amazing. The place was so clean and so welcoming. Being that this was our first time to Lodi coming from Los Angeles I was a little nervous on the drive up to see that there were just fields of corn , orchards and grapes, which was amazing to see but a little nerve-racking lol. But once you get into the neighborhood where this place is it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. The people are so nice and kind it‚Äôs very clean and very safe. Daniels directions were so clear and he was very good about answering back to any questions that we had. Ultimately, we loved this place and we will definitely come back again."

The suite is clean & beautifully decorated, and the landscaped courtyard next to it is lovely. The kitchen area had everything I needed.
I recommend this Air Bnb to travelers looking for a pleasant & peaceful place to stay while visiting Lodi, CA.

Host was notified and was willing to send maintenance over fix the issue, but we didn‚Äôt have time to stick around and wait for someone to come, so decided to leave.

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Well maintained, very roomy house. Large kitchen, living area, and master bedroom. Huge walk in closet. The beds are very comfortable and Isaac responds quickly if you have any questions. Many extra amenities - like phone chargers in several rooms."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife & I had to travel to Stockton due to an unfortunate family emergency. I grew up in Stockton and know the town well (I graduated from the university behind Isaac‚Äôs home). With all the difficulties associated with our trip, Issac‚Äôs home was a complete blessing. It is quiet, peaceful, comfortable, welcoming, great location, great neighborhood‚Ä¶..truly made us feel at home (Isaac even went to the trouble to get a grill there before we arrived- on a day‚Äôs notice). It‚Äôs hard to express my appreciation during such a challenging time. I anticipate many more trips to Stockton and will definitely stay at Isaac‚Äôs place again.
Sincerely,
Michael and Janet"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this home for a cozy & stylish stay in Stockton. The home is beautiful and perfectly styled.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Issac is a great host! Everything was to our satisfaction.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Isaac was a very responsive host. The kitchen truly felt like home and had everything we needed. The master bedroom was roomy and cozy. I appreciated the clean sheets and the extra bath towels. I have been to Stockton many times, but Isaacs location and home made me enjoy it a lot more. The neighborhood is beautiful. I loved being a walking distance from the university and Pacific Ave which is close to everything! My dogs had a great time walking the neighborhood and so did i! I felt safe and appreciated all the effort Isaac puts into hosting. My only complaint is the key pad to unlock the front door. It was glitchy and that was a bit stressful, however Isaac resolved the issue right away. I would stay here again. The key pad is definitely not a deal breaker for me! I was very happy with my stay. Excited to be back again next year! Thank you, Isaac!"

It is walkable.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I are from NV, and were in town for school purposes. Our one-month stay at Debbie's and Jose's AirBnB was exceptional. Despite other family members living with them, noise level was minimal and it is quiet at night, thanks to a thoughtful curfew. Their dog, Loki, added charm. Make sure to shut the red fence gate and check again!
The place has vibrant design with all essentials needed and even a workspace for Zoom meetings. Dedicated parking spot eased logistics.
Debbie and Jose's constant communication and kindness made the stay memorable. The location is ideal - near coffee shops, food places, and 10 minutes from St. Joseph's Hospital. Plus, it's a gateway to exciting weekend trips to cities like San Francisco, San Jose, and Sacramento, all within 1-2 hours. I wish I can write more about this place (character limit 1000).
Overall, whether you are visiting for work, school, or leisure, this is an ideal place for long-term stays and experiences. We'd happily return!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed here to be close to some friends that live in Stockton. And then we made day trips from there to see all over the place so this was a nice place to come back to. Very cute comfortable little place. Very comfortable queen bed and linens. Great air conditioner. Hosts are friendly and kind.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,They were great hosts. They checked in on me to make sure my plane landed. They were responsive to messages. If we needed to borrow something they let us. The place was as beautiful as the pictures. I will be looking in to staying there again the next time I am out there.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra/Jose‚Äôs place was hands down the best airbnb I have ever stayed at. There was nothing that this place did not have. It was in the perfect location for our trip and the hosts were so responsive and made us feel right at home. AND THE PLACE- wow it is just so cute. Beyond it being decorated so nicely, it was equipped with every single thing you need. At one point I realized I forgot my straightener and wouldn‚Äôt you know there was one under the sink! Such a great place, I really recommend. If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts were amazing. I would absolutely stay there again. It was a lovely little spot. I could make three minor recommendations and I'd have asked them and done it myself if my girlfriend would have let me. 1. Hand towel bar mounted next to the mirror but a minor inconvenience at best. 2. Shower is lovely but it does get slick, a nonslip mat would work wonders. 3. A brevel/air fryer. I don't want to turn on the full oven, waste of energy. Air fryer? l think it would be the perfect middle. They were lovely, the neighbors were nice and quiet. It was exactly what I wanted.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed a couple of days and host was very helpful and made my first Airbnb experience a great one
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Take notes other hosts! This is exactly how Air BnBs should be! The kitchen had anything you needed with a perfect size fridge. There were extra towels, and blankets. Drawers and storage areas for your stuff! W/D. Big newer TV. A little patio area to sit at. Your own parking spot. Perfectly stocked, furnished, decorated, and priced fairly! Perfect for our work trip. Thank you Debra and Jose!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The listing was 100% clean and accurate. The host are very responsive to any questions and requests you may have.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Debra and Jose are always easy to communicate, they have a good taste. They have prepared a beautiful Airbnb for their guests. But l don‚Äôt like Stockton in general and l don‚Äôt like the neighborhood so much. In that street people leave their dogs free and unleashed generally, so five six dogs are wandering around free in that street and l was scared a few times because they barked at me a lot and pulled my clothes so many times so l have stressed out a lot a few times. In the pictures it seems like they have a beautiful garden but it‚Äôs currently not usable there are so many unused stuff stocked almost half of the garden.. the reason l chose the place was the garden itself but l think because of the other unit in the house the garden is not usable much. I am thinking the price is expensive for the location and the unit could be larger too because it looks larger on the pictures. Overall, l can say the Airbnb was fine, but l didn‚Äôt enjoy a lot and got bored in general."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Debra was super nice the entire time and also very responsive. We had a leaky shower that she got fixed within 24 hours!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The hosts were super accommodating! The place was super clean with a very convenient spot for us to take our pups to go potty outside. The decorating was lovely and it had everything you could need to feel at home. Would stay here again if in the area.

Cannot recommend enough."

I loved how cold it got with the air conditioner I loved wrapping up in blankets. My wife and I stayed there because we were getting Married in Manteca and Debra was so sweet and even gave us a little gift. I have to say I did want to take her 2 little dogs back home with me. They were so cute and lovable. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks again Debra and Jose. 5 stars ü§©ü§©ü§© y'all are the best.....
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"The hosts were friendly and responded quickly to messages, and provided plenty of extra towels for our stay. The kitchen was well appointed with cooking equipment (rare for an airbnb). The shower was a great temperature with good water pressure. The bed is comfortable. The wifi was very fast and they have a roku for the TV. There is NO air conditioning which is listed, just a fan. Also it is street parking only, no private parking. A couple of times we had to park a block away, though generally there was a spot right in front. Lastly there is a train nearby that makes a lot of noise early in the morning. Overall it was great value for the stay."

I was at the tail end of a long motorcycle ride when I arrived and very hungry/tired, and her husband had just made dinner so they gave me some so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go back out and find food after checking in. They‚Äôre wonderful hosts in general and very attentive to any questions/requests. The decor is just as charming as it looks in the pictures and I slept very comfortably both nights that I stayed there."

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Debra is very nice and so helpful and accommodating. She left us plenty of snacks, drinks and even eggs and toast for breakfast. The place is small but nicely decorated and the kitchen is well equipped. We only needed a quick over night stop so didn‚Äôt need to take advantage of everything that was there. A well stocked Keurig was a treat as well.
The bed is only a full size if that‚Äôs important to you. The bathroom has a nice shower and everything was clean. Debra gave us advice on where to eat dinner and we went to Garlic Brothers. I wish we would have ordered a pizza but my chicken was pretty good anyway.
A large TV with streaming was great and there were books to read during your stay. Loki, Debra‚Äôs friendly French Bulldog popped in to greet us when we arrived. üòÄ"

We were able to have coffee out on the back patio in the sun.
Our dog was welcome- thank you, Nhi!!

It is a couple of blocks off Hammer Ln which is a busy thoroughfare but minimal noise on the street.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, loved it very comfortable. Apart from small things it was worth the price"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Easy to get inside, safe location, comfortable space."
2024-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"The door was left ajar for check-in and didn't feel safe. There is a loud, barking dog. There was only 1 towel for 2 of us for the 2 day stay. Bare bones. No kettle for heating water for coffee. Only 2 plates and 2 spoons. Overall, not great."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Easy check out, nice shower + tv with Netflix"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent, creative use of small space. Clean, simple, with the basics. Teresa was responsive and gave clear instructions of how to get in, internet use and Expectations for check-out."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay at very good price. Enjoyed my stay at this place:)
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,nice stay! thank you teresa.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location was good for me for my purposes.
Place could of had a couple more necessities : paper towels for kitchenette, kleenex box,extra tp.
maybe a comfy chair in the room.
nicer warmer bedding, bedding had sheets and a very thin comforter for this time of year.
Teresa was responsive to my request for a blanket and a full roll of tp.& extra towels. I did not have the opportunity to meet Teresa.
Over all place was okay, probably more suited for male guests."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall I was pretty satisfied for a single night of sleep for a relatively cheap spot but I wanted to point out some simply things, first the bed‚Ä¶very creaky and uncomfortable plus the bedding was very thin so I wish there was an extra blanket (easy fix). Next the gate, this room is RIGHT past the gate yet it was near impossible to close due to its scraping the ground. I personally wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable sleeping with it open knowing anyone could walk in and see a door right there and try and break in. The bathroom door as well is very hard to open if you‚Äôre standing at the sink, simple design flaw but with the tight space be cautious if you‚Äôre not extremely petite. My last note although out of the host control but I wish I knew, I got ZERO sleep due to two dogs constant barking throughout the night, I left at 6am because I‚Äôd given up on trying to sleep any later."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank You Teresa for being such a gracious host

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always great :)
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Teresa was a great host. I had to check in at an earlier time and she was quick to respond.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing place, organized, clean, Teresa is available all time."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was ok, but a little disappointing. The things were not really put in place for cooking food (missing cutting board, bowls). The cutting board I eventually received were the cheapest quality, whereas I feel like something better would be an investment worth making since it's something that would be used by other guests. There was an odd design with the bathroom where the mirror is positioned in a way that you see yourself in clear view when you are taking a #2 on the toilet (I don't imagine the host putting something like that in their own home lol). The location seems lacking as well (15 minutes to go to downtown or a decent grocery store, neighbor's dog barks whole day, sometimes during bedtime hours). Overall, feel like there could have been more to make the place more comfortable."
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Not a bad stay for a single night for a solo traveler but overall the space was too tiny, the carpet was dirty, found hair, and also a wormy bug. The space heater took some time to heat up as well. Not sure I will
Necessarily stay here again but if they make it more clean might be worth it again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always great!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,amazing! very fast communication. this was a private room in a quiet neighborhood. The room had everything I needed and was very clean and up to date. thank you so much

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will definitely stay here again!!
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Several good points about this place and the owner. Excellent.
BUT, sad to note:
1. A coffee maker is a standard, typical item to have at 99% of Airbnbs I've stayed at over the years.
It was missing here....plus NO way to heat up water except for the microwave.
Hmmm.....$20 is the cost for a basic coffee maker.
Before I arrived, I queried about a coffee maker, but no response occurred, despite my query of 24+ hours before I arrived. Hmmmm.
2. Few dishes to cook with at the place. Hmmmm.....
3. No chair to sit in, though plenty of room to add one.
4. Desk? Not easy to sit in a bar chair and work on a computer to do work. Adding a lower, portable card table would be appropriate, please.
Otherwise, most important: safe neighborhood....."

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Teresa's place was affordable since we landed and checked in to sleep for one night. Nice neighborhood and close to major highways and airport.
Cons: low quality tv, hazardous stairs leading to the bathroom w/out railing or slip-resistance mats.
Pros: good location, price, bed to sleep."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa was very friendly and responsive! Clean and nice place!! Will definitely stay here again when I work too many consecutive shifts!!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Existing listings, the bathroom without a bathtub is my favorite, clean and perfect"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,I had a very nice time
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We got in late the first night, felt uneasy. Hard to get around vehicles and mattress in the driveway. There was an overgrown palm type plant, covered in webs/bugs which made it hard to get in the door with luggage. I had to use my phone flashlight . It looked like the pictures, but dirty & dusty. Blocked the door, secured the curtains shut with bobby pins. Stairs leading to bathroom are tile and slippery, HUGE HAZARD. My granddaughter fell and also slipped in the shower. Amazing potential, but big disappointment."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, there are stairs to the bathroom, there is a patio accessible to the unit. It does have a private entrance. The decor is pretty mundane but it‚Äôs the essentials and bare minimum. Overall, it‚Äôs a great space because it‚Äôs private with a private bathroom, for not too high of a price. Teresa was kind enough to bring a replacement iron when the one in the room didn‚Äôt work. But there was no ironing board just the iron which was disappointing obviously."

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"A very great host! Had a bit of trouble with the key to the place, and she was very communicative and helpful.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice and quiet place!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,such a cute place! in a very nice location just off the freeway!
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Teresa's Private Room in Guest Suite is perfect for a quick, no frills overnight spot and for those who do not want to interact in person with the AirBnB host. Privacy for her guests seemed high on Teresa's list.
The place matches its photos and is tucked away in a residential area. One would need a car to get around the area. A quick jump, onto the 5 and back off again, had us in downtown Stockton. Street parking at her place was abundant.
Teresa is quick to respond if you have any needs or requests. If you are looking for a host who is eager to interact with you in person; she is not that person. We never met her."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely amazing host. She handled us with care and through a difficult situation that arose during our stay. Teresa went above and beyond in every aspect and deserves her flowers now. Check in was smooth and effortless, check out was the same."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great, private, clean, comfortable! It is in a decent area, no complaints"
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Was not impressed with this room, glad I was only here for a quick over night stay. There were an excessive amount of flies, including dead ones, which I found throughout the room. I also found change on the floor (and crumbs). All this leads me to believe the place wasn't properly cleaned before my arrival. The AC wall unit was filthy, there were spider webs in the corners of the walls, the ""kitchenette"" was very poorly stocked- no silverware at all, only one very small pan, no salt, pepper, oil, etc. When we arrived we noticed we only had one towel, no wash rags and no dish towels. I messaged Teresa but didn't hear back from her until the next morning after I had already left. To be fair I didn't bother informing Teresa of the issues with the cleanliness because it was already a little late when I arrived and I knew I would be leaving in the morning but considering how long it took her to respond to my towel request I doubt that there was much she could have done to fix my complaints for this stay."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Easy to find and very comfortable and quiet! I will be staying here again üëçüèº
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good value for the price, you get a comfortable space in a safe neighborhood in Stockton. The host is very responsive through the app and is very kind. There were only a few hooks on the wall to hold clothes, but no closet, dresser or clothes rack- so I had limited space when hanging my scrubs/business clothes as I was there for work. There is a tall window with thin curtains facing the bed which could be an issue for a guest there for work especially working overnight shift and sleeping during the day. Bed could be more comfortable, but the basics are taken care of- such as street parking, private bathroom, tv, wifi, microwave, sink and mini fridge. A great place for a couple days stay, but might be a bit of a challenge for a long term stay. Again, good value for the price, you get what you pay for."
2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was very comfortable, clean and quiet. I felt safe. There is no cable channels on the TV just apps like Netflix and Prime. There was some dishes there which was very convenient!"

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little studio for quick stays. I stayed a month and it was great! but next time I will need a place with a kitchen for that period of time. But that is my own fault as I knew that it was just a small studio. Place was clean! Quiet neighborhood overall. Not much near it but close to the highway. Teresa is great and very receptive. Also very quick to respond!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Private room was so cozy and great. Cute little walk way to get to the private entrance. Bathroom does have stairs just like in photos. a little steep but it made the room and bathroom pop! üòä

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place is as exactly as described. Clean, quiet and safe place to rest. Teresa communicates well and quickly. Thumbs up."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had an amazing stay. Would definitely stay there again on my next trip. Place was clean and well kept. Great experience overall.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very nice host. If you see them that is. they try to make your stay very private and secure. The neighborhood was relatively quiet and it was Halloween. Nice Landscaping and houses around. Perfect little kitchenette for one or two people. I fell in love with the shower it's amazing. The only thing that I would have to say is maybe a different bed but I'm a little spoiled when it comes to beds. LOL. I'm definitely going to refer people and stay again
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Very well cared for.
Very comfortable.
Comfortable bed.
It has everything you need to decans."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great communication. A beautiful place in a very nice neighborhood, just south of downtown Stockton. Had no problems finding the place or parking.
The AirBNB is in a separate unit attached to the main house. It has a microwave, a fridge, an Amazon Fire TV, a *VERY* comfortable bed, and a private bathroom that is part of the unit. Everything was spotless, and there was plenty of room. The Wi-Fi was blazingly fast. There were also plenty of plugs to recharge my electronics.
The only things I could say, is that the bathroom does have a couple of medium steps that you have to navigate to go in or out. If you are a person with mobility issues, that could possibly be a problem. It was fine for me. Also, as mentioned in the listing, the unit does not have a smoke/Carbon Monoxide detector. That was not an issue to me, as I travel with my own just for situations like this.
It was a wonderful stay. I would gladly stay here again. Thank you."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a nice, quiet, clean, private place close to shops and freeways, this is the place for you. Easy check in and out. The unit has its own entrance, separate from the main house, through a wooden gate on the side of the garage. Parking was no issue at all. Will definitely stay here again, and for the price, no comparison to a room in someone's house where you may run into other guests or owners."
2021-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Excellent location.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great for a couple!

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very clean, quiet, nice room with easy private access. The home is in a good neighborhood. I had no worries about my vehicle being parked on the street in front of the house. Though I never spoke with the host, she did communicate with me quickly by text."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was my first time using an Airbnb and it was an amazing experience! The instructions were clear and easy to follow! Communication with Teresa was open as well. The room was extremely clean and convenient. The location was perfect too!~

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is pretty nice and spacious. The only down side I would say is that the bed is really uncomfortable but I know that‚Äôs also a matter of personal preference. Other than that it was clean and a good private spot to stay in Stockton.

She was flexible with changes i had to my reservation which was a great help while traveling for work. Anyone passing through town would be comfortable here."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great Host,
Very communicative, you will definitely enjoy your stay !"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Will definitely return & recommend when looking for just an overall, simply pleasant experience!! Room, and location, were exactly as detailed/ pictured, very quiet, and enhanced privacy with being given our own key for the room.
Literally no complaints, other than wishing we could have booked for more than one night, at once. I stayed during a really hot week, so it came as a relief to find the AC was quick, and blew nothing but cold air. All basic amenities are there and provided for. Teresa did a great job in creating an overall, welcoming and cozy feel to the space!
Thanks!
[P.S.] for any future guests, the oranges in the decorative jar, atop the counter, look deliciously good enough to eat.....but canNOT be eaten..... They just look that good LOL!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Warm decor, clean, cozy, and quiet.
I definitely would book it again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Teresa‚Äôs home was a perfect place to land for my son‚Äôs summer apprenticeship in Stockton. He had everything he needed for a comfortable stay and felt safe in her neighborhood. He was close to the job and reasonable proximity to restaurants and shopping.

2021-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed overnight, Room did resemble pictures on listing. However, the room and bed smelled uncleaned. Also, had to ask multiple times for clarification regarding parking after the listing stated ‚Äúparking on premises‚Äù."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice place! Will stay here next time.
2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would highly recommend this studio. The trail along the river bank is just 1/2 block down, and great for jogging or a walk. This is an ideal location to stay if working off of Arch Road or the South part of Stockton. Out of hotels and 6 other AirB&B that I stayed at, Teresa's studio is number one."

Overall, my experience at this Airbnb was exceptional and I would definitely choose to stay here again in the future."
2024-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Host was great at responding to our needs. The home was beautiful as listed. There were many amenities to use but due to the weather, we couldn't use them. Would love to have the chance to try the sauna and the outdoor firepit. There were some problems with the sinks. They were all leaking and the main kitchen sink didn't work. They sent someone to take a look at it but it looked like it didn't get fixed. But we manage to be ok without it because they're two other sinks to use.
May look into more seating in the living space because there just wasn't enough seats to go around so we had to move chairs from all over the house to accommodate everyone.
Adolfo and Stevie were great. They were very responsive. As long as you communicated to them what was going on, it was fine.
Thanks for offering up your home. We look forward to next time."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great ,comfortable beds ,Great shower and amazing back yard. Thanks for sharing your space would gladly stay again if I‚Äôm back in Stockton."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adolfo & Stevie were easy to communicate with. They were flexible and accommodating for my family ‚Äòs particular needs regarding checking in and out.
My family especially enjoyed the spa-like toiletries and health conscious gummy vites during our ‚Äústaycation‚Äù.
The indoor and outdoor areas were spacious, clean and had a zen vibe.
The only negative was the weak WIFI signal in the master bedroom. Perhaps this would be a positive if you wanted to completely unplug from your devices. :)"

I absolutely loved the beautiful restroom and in particular the shower head and will be replacing mine at my own home lol The bed was super comfy and cozy. If we ever travel to the area again, we will definitely pick Chad‚Äôs place üëèüèºüôåüèº While visiting the area I had a few work meetings and it was nice having reliable Wi-Fi that worked whenever I needed it. Stockton can be an interesting area but this neighborhood was classy, quiet, and safe."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit to this wonderful AirBnb and I'm already looking forward to my next stay. The property continues to offer everything one could need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
From the moment you arrive, you'll be taken by the thoughtfully curated space. It's clear that the hosts have put a lot of effort into ensuring that the property is not just aesthetically pleasing, but also functional and welcoming.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything was great. Couple of nuances but not a deterrent. Very proactive, professional, and accommodating. Definitely recommend it. The hotels in Stockton are horrible. I can say this 1st hand. My teen also said, ""It was really good!""
Comparatively, I paid $100 over what I would at Hilton because of AirBnb fees, not the base house rental fee. On this trip, traveling with my son, it was worth it for the extra comfort and safety. I know Stockton well, I grew up 3 miles from this location."

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great tiny house, very functional. The only thing to keep in mind is that walls are thin and you‚Äôll be right next to the wall by the neighbors which are very loud. I woke up freaking out the first night of my stay because there was very loud screams coming from the neighbors. I thought someone was breaking in, it‚Äôs Stockton so I didn‚Äôt expect much different but it did freak me out."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful home

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying at Chase‚Äôs place! They‚Äôre personal touches like the welcome back sign was so sweet. We timed our vacation to when there was an opening at Chase and Brooks place. We will only stay here. We‚Äôve stayed at multiple air bnbs in the area and nothing compares to the cleanliness and modern look of this place. I especially love the Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom!
Location is win! Our reason for going to Stockton is to move in our college kid. The home is convenient to UOP and the stores we need to ensure our college student has all her necessities.
Chase and Brooke are superb hosts! They are very responsive to their messages!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a repeat guest at Chase‚Äôs Airbnb. This gem is very accessible for my husband who uses a rollator to support his mobility.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chase, is an amazing host. He was very responsive and made the place so comfortable. I would recommend staying here for anyone looking for an air bnb in Stockton."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chase‚Äôs place was ideal for my trip to Stockton. The neighborhood is quite nice, and it felt safe. The place, itself, was modern, spotless, well-appointed, and fully-functional. Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We came to Stockton for 9 days visiting family and this place worked very well for us. It was cozy had all the amenities we needed and more. It was easy to access and, even though it is next to the host‚Äôs house, still felt very private. We did experience minor issues while there, but after contacting chase it was fixed in five minutes (what more can you ask for). The bathroom is beautiful and so is the kitchen. The only pitfall might have been the furniture/bed which you kind of sink into. The price was affordable and well worth it. My in-laws opted for a hotel, but this air b&b was nicer, had more amenities, closer to bars. And even though we stayed for two more nights than the in-laws did, we still payed less. Excellent experience overall; highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chase and Brooke provided the perfect stay for my boyfriend and I to attend my best friends wedding in one of Lodi‚Äôs gorgeous vineyards. Stockton had everything we needed (that we admittedly forgot at homeü§£) and the drive to Lodi was so short and easy it made the entire trip a breeze. I especially loved the abundance of water and water filters for two reasons. One- I am not accustom to the taste of the city water and two- we were coming from out of state 40‚Ä¢ weather to sunny California‚Äôs 80‚Ä¢ weather. The closet was spacious enough to hang both my huge bridesmaid dress and my boyfriends suit so we were able to go wrinkle free! I loved the guest mode on the roku tv that would automatically sign out of all my streaming services once I checked out, I‚Äôm always forgetting that. Chase and Brooke had put so much thought into every detail, they took what could have been a high stress situation for me and gave me every comfort I needed."

Thanks for the clean and trendy lodgings. We recommend your place to others.
Sincerely

Not only did they let us drop off our trailer, but they also told us we could check in earlier, with no extra cost. I was so happy, I almost cried. I had been up since 3 am. and could use some sleep. These are the most kindest people. I will rent from them any time.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location was good and had accurate pictures. What you see is what you get. There was only 1 towel for two guests, and we came in super late but did not want to bother the host. She was communicative so I‚Äôm sure she would have given us one if we asked. The bed was ok, but it sunk in the middle, so not ideal for two people."

2022-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Teresa is very petty and money hungry obviously she doesn‚Äôt respond back with in a hour I smoked outside of the house in the car the aroma still lingered on our clothes and she‚Äôs making a bigger deal out of it than what it really is I am sure they rented the room the same day with no complaints of smell if the smell is that bad the room will not be ready are you would not want to rent it out as the owner so stop trying to overcharge me life goes on you don‚Äôt have to worry about me coming to your property anymore I refuse to rent from anyone like you you‚Äôre prejudice and racist because when I reached out you never responded back and made up excuse about how you was sorry you just noticed the message your spot is cool but you arent Been there 3 times all of a sudden this last time she complained the other two times I have two guest with one towel that doesn‚Äôt make sense common sense would tell you if it‚Äôs two guest have two towels right ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è still I never complained to air b n b about it I message you I rather wait for your reply if I was you I keep the money coming not run it off specially if people are willing to pay what I want even though I don‚Äôt provide everything they want or Need?

2022-04-01,2.0,Stayed one night,The walls are really thin. We could hear all of their conversations and were woken up by it at one point. Otherwise it was clean and as described.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay. at Teresa's absolutely fit my needs. I was there for 4 days with my dog while I attended a dog show in the area. This Airbnb was ideal for me. It was a very safe and accessible area right off the freeway. (N0 freeway noise.) The shower was great. The bed very comfortable for me. I found the room and bathroom very spacious with great hooks on the wall to hang things since there was no closet. I put the microwave and small frig to good use. I had to go out and purchase toilet paper and paper towels as the only paper product in the room was a partial roll of toilet paper. There are also no plates or silverware in the room so I was glad I brought a few things from home. The walls are very thin and I could hear a tv and people talking when I was home during the day, but never at night. My communication with Teresa during my stay could not have been better. The internet went down ....fixed in 10 minutes and she was not even home when I called. The electrical outlet in the bathroom was not working and she dropped off an electrical cord so I could use my hairdryer in the morning. This is far better than a hotel stay in price. I will visit again .....hands down. Thanks Teresa."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I chose this place as an alternative to a hotel room. It was just what I needed for one night while traveling through town. Simple, easy, minimalist style. Check in was super easy. My only issue was the many artificial scents. There was an air freshener plugged in, and the sheets smelled extremely perfumey which made it hard to sleep. So if you‚Äôre sensitive to chemicals, be aware. The neighborhood was full of families and kids playing which made me feel safe. There‚Äôs a gorgeous green belt and path that runs through town so you can walk for miles and enjoy the perfect Cali weather."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The room was simple but did just fine for a quick overnight in Stockton. Check-in was easy and communication was great.
There was not any additional blankets available in the room and I happened to stay on a chilly night. If it was earlier, I would have contacted the host for assistance but it was pretty late when I noticed."

Had a nice outdoor sitting area that could be used in nicer weather. Unfortunately coffee making equipment was removed though there was a photo of it and listed as amenity on their site. Owner believed she was keeping up with airbnb covid protocols but I haven't found this problem in any other airbnb recently. Heat is controlled in main house. Got cold and there were no extra blankets. Had trouble with Smart TV connection. Owner said to get it on bluetooth on my phone! Fortunately their wifi connection kicked in."

2021-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really like the way the room had a private entrance, the fridge and microwave were nice bathroom was clean only thing I say is that being it's a two story and the wall are pretty thin you can hear all the activities and voices . I have a pretty sensitive nose therefore I could smell that dogs have been in the room."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Nice bedroom and bathroom. There‚Äôs a desk in the room, the hanging hooks worked well for hanging my scrubs on and there‚Äôs two shelves above desk you can use for clothes. There is a fan and it does get warm in the summer months but it‚Äôs manageable with the fan. I was there for almost 4 months for a contract and have no issues, the sliding door lock broke once and Theresa was quick to get it fixed.
The house is located in Stockton but it‚Äôs in a safe neighborhood and I never felt threatened or worried going out to my car at night or having the sliding door open to let air in. Overall wonderful stay and if I ever go back to the area I would definitely look into this again."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The room was clean and pretty much as listed. I think they must've been experiencing hotter than normal temperatures and the room was a littler warmer than we like. But all-in-all, we were just looking for a quick place to lay our heads for a night as we traveled through Stockton on a California road trip and this space provided a good value for us. Thanks, Teresa!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Used this space as a sleep stop on my journey. Communication was clear & timely, self check-in was easy, and all was clean!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Private and easy access.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can't wait to come stay again
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,it was perfect!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sooo much better than staying at a Motel 6 off of the freeway for a night while traveling! Smelled better, felt better, slept better. Very happy to have found it and I will definitely look to book it to stay again."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you for a lovely room. The room and the bath room were very clean and had all stated equipment in it. Wifi worked almost perfectly . aircondition is internal ( but does the job of cooling) . The neighborhood is nice and quiet, a commercial centre is very close.
I think i didn't meet Teresa , the 2 young people i met were very kind and helpful."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a place to spend the night after a long weekend in Tahoe and this was a great option! Teresa is very quick with communication. Lots of street parking, private entrance with easy check-in, and soft fresh linens. The AC was an oscillating tower fan. Appreciated the fridge and freezer!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Most comfortable place and very nice owners
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Good place to sleep only. There is no AC or fan as listed. The room was very hot, even at night. Getting ready was a hassle as the room was very hot even with the door wide open. There was also not towels (or extra towels) to use so make sure you bring some. You may also want to make sure you bring a fan. This room is better for just one person to rest your head at night. The lock was very wobbly and didn‚Äôt feel very secure. The walls are thin and you can hear people on nearly every side of you"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay and really comforting and welcoming
2021-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,ok place for a quick night's rest.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy room with private entrace & shower. Great neighborhood. Felt safe & secure.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome rate and an awesome space. Thank you.

2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, very clean, definitely I will be there again"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"a great, private place to crash for the night! thank you ‚ó°Ãà"
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Teresa‚Äôs place was fine for a short stay. It‚Äôs much smaller than expected & it did get cold at night. Would not recommend for more than 1 person & more than 3 nights.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host, will definitely stay again sometime"
2021-02-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,IF you don't want to hook your phone up to the TV in order to watch something ( and don't expect any help with that either) make sure to but coffee for the next day to warm in microwave ( picture is deceiving- no coffee pot) or need to cook anything not microwaved then you would be fine. The work area does not have good lighting either. This is more of a just sleep and leave kind of place.
2021-02-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Pros: Friendly neighborhood, close to I5, powerful shower
Cons: No off street parking, no coffee maker, no blankets, no independent heat controls. There is only one chair, and a nice patio but no furniture to relax outside, so made do with our cooler and the one chair provided."
2021-01-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very tiny, the lock was loose.. Great place if you were to stay by yourself for a short period of time."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place and nice host.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa's space is a real find for those with a quick trip to Stockton in their plans. I stayed at a hotel in town for a few days and it was not so great for the money. Found this spot, and enjoyed a couple of quiet days in a cool space for less than half the hotel cost, and no noisy neighbors! The suite has a sliding glass door that opens onto a little patio. It's a safe neighborhood for walking and there is a nice park with a walking trail nearby. The space is comfy and relaxing. And Teresa was super nice about making it possible to extend an extra couple of days when I needed more time. Bookmark this one!"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was exactly what I needed - comfortable, quiet, clean, parking, and a nice place to rest at night."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A cute and nice place to stay.
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Loved the Privacy! Private Entrance and Private Bathroom was Golden.
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Teresa was very prompt with communication. Her place is a great value and easy to reach from the freeway--perfect stopover for a road trip.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wish it was on Zillow or hatpads cause it feel like it's a studio apt you can stay for months even years
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Clean and quiet.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you Teresa for letting me book you‚Äôre place. The room was very clean and really neat, the home we easy to find and the neighbor hood was very quite. I would defiantly book with you again thanks !!"
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,I would have appreciated knowing before I booked the place that they didn‚Äôt offer blankets since COVID-19. There were several flies in our room which was annoying. I appreciated that there is a private entry so we could arrive late without disturbing you. The room is completely sealed off from the main house so it is private.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great value. Awesome shower.
2020-10-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"This place is very affordable and the neighborhood is pretty good, especially for Stockton. Other than that, I don't recommend staying here. No blanket provided (host said due to covid), no towels or rags provided, no wifi (host said there would be but never provided password, when we were able to access the wifi with the saved password on the TV there wasnt any internet access on the network), floor was dirty, excessive flies in the room, lock on sliding glass door doesn't operate properly & host was totally unresponsive. Don't expect to find any extras that you might need during your stay. It's literally a place to sleep & shower (bring your own blanket & towel)."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,üëç
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, has everything you need."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was nice to be in its own space. Room can range somewhat drastically from hot to cold. Fan was nice touch. Safe neighborhood. Prompt responses!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and clean. I like how private it is
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is really nice! It's private and easy to get in and out of. Definitely recommend.
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very good for a quick stay. Could use a tv but other than that it‚Äôs worth every penny!
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place and host..
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place was perfect for our short stay. Its in a great safe area. The room was sparkling clean, modern, cozy and with a patio that made it even more at home. This was my 1st experience with Airbnb and I'm so glad Teresa was my 1st experience; she set the tone for me going forward. Teresa was very responsive with communication. If you're ever in Stockton, I'd highly recommend staying at this spot for short stays."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was a clean, quiet, and pleasant place to stay. Amenities are accommodating. Value surpasses the price."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome host and will stay again
2020-10-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"I usually like to check-in when it is still light outside, but I ended up getting here fairly late in the evening. That said, I felt totally safe in Teresa's neighborhood and really appreciated that the walkway to the sliding door of the room was well lit, and the side gate was propped open. This place has all of the basics in terms of a bed, lights, desk area, computer chair, outlets, bathroom and even a microwave and mini fridge. I used the microwave, but not the mini fridge. Some of the outlets were non functioning, but it wasn't a huge problem because I always had enough working ones to plug in my laptop and cell phone. There's no closet space or hangers, but there are hooks near the bed and over the bathroom door that made hangers unnecessary. Teresa was a great host and messaged me about where to find the key on my first day. She also messaged me to ask if it was too hot and if I needed air conditioning which was very thoughtful of her. Even with the hot weather, I never felt uncomfortable. This was a much better experience than what I would have gotten with any of the hotels in/around Stockton - definitely recommended."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for this studio suite. The street leads right to the gates of University of the Pacific which makes for great walks starting from the suite. Also close to St. Joseph hospital which was our main destination. Fidel is proactive in communication and let us check-in a couple of hours early which was helpful to us.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angel and Sandra were both exceptional hosts. Our room was beautiful, comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the attention to details they put into our space. We‚Äôre excited to return again! We highly recommend staying at this gem of a home away from home!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would stay here again! Everything was very clean and comfortable. Check out was simple. I would recommend adding or bringing a dark hand towel for washing make up off as everything is WHITE! Such a great place otherwise!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely space with good natural light. One block from beautiful walkable campus. Comfy bed/bedding. Recommended.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay, it was clean and the bed was very comfy! It was a super short stay(less than 24hrs) but great! Our host was friendly and helpful! We would definitely stay again if we are back in this area for something. Thank You!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was an enjoyable stay and the perfect location for me as I had business at the University of the Pacific. The only down side of the property was the bathroom. While functional, it's very outdated and the shower head is quite low."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will definitely be back! Perfect location for activities at UOP and the private entrance was great to come and go without disturbing the main house.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great host. Would definitely stay with them again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had a great time staying here. This house was just beautiful and in a GREAT area just down the street from the University of the Pacific. I loved the privacy but also how close I was to EVERYTHING in town. The room was adorable and well designed. Very convenient and even offered a mini fridge and kurig. I plan to stay here again the next time I come to Stockton. Well worth the cost and just loved this space.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We felt very safe and taken care of during our stay here. It was very clean, comfortable, and the area is beautiful as well. Definitely recommend to others if they need a place to stay in Stockton!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Angel is a fantastic host, very communicative and helps make the stay as comfortable as possible. Incredible hospitality."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Suuuuper clean. I like the counter space in the bathroom. Felt very private even though it's attached to the main house. VERY comfy pillow and bed! Space heater was a nice touch, although we felt warm enough with the bedding overnight so we didnt need to run it overnight. Very clear instructions and easy entry/exit. Nice host. Would definitely stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hosts were friendly asked if we need anything and were attentive. Recommend for anyone looking for a place to stay at .
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the best sleep ever- super comfy bedding, quiet grounded peaceful room. It‚Äôs actually a separate studio attached via only a hallway with separate entry doors at the back of the house . Fantastic neighborhood - So great to hear the clocktower at UOP and see the beautiful campus right down the street. Angel was super communicative and friendly, flexible on our arrival time, and made an effort to connect. The room has lovely light with a big picture winds overlooking their pool and patio but with various curtain options for privacy and light. Bathroom was spotless and a nice shower. Would totally stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location. Close to UOP. You really have your own space. I did appreciate the shoe closet not being in plain sight.
I would stay here in the future."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"it was my very first try at an air bnb and I Ihad worries that I might regret my choice. On the contrary, everything was perfect. The host was kind and accomodating. The place was clean and comfortable. The location was exactly where I needed to be. The host always tried to help me. I have plans to visit Stockton again in a few month. I am certain I will book my stay here again."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"It was wonderful to stay in Fidel Angel's house for my son during his winter holidays. The place is excellent for my son, just about 2 minutes to University of the Pacific where my son studies. Room was extremely clean with enough stuff for the stay, including a heater. Fidel Angel and his partner are so good host with their wonderful hospitality. They took care for my son with their warm heart during his stay as if he is their son but not the temporary guest. I paid a visit to Fidel Angel twice during my son's stay and really appreciate what he and his partner takes care for my son. For sure we will come back with all of our best regards to Fidel Angel and his partner!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful Airbnb. Absolutely shocked when we walked in and realized we got more than what we were expecting. Such a huge spacious room, absolutely stunning in terms of decor and thoughtful touches. It was winter season, so there was a heater in the room and in the bathroom that was incredibly helpful. Coffee and water available for us. Literally, this private entry and the set up of the room made it feel like we rented a private studio. On top of that, the host was incredibly thoughtful and kind. Could not have asked for a better stay."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was amazing and clean!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fidel was very helpful accomodating our request for early check in the place is clean easy to find and clean no issues whatsoever ty highly recommended

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a great stay at Angel & Sandra‚Äôs place! The check-in instructions with visuals made everything SO smooth. Impeccably clean space and comfy bed. The location was perfect for seeing my friend in a show at the Stockton Civic Theatre just 5 minutes away. The tree-lined neighborhood is beautiful and felt very safe. Angel was so kind and communicative. I will definitely stay again if I‚Äôm back in Stockton!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"NICE PLACE, GOOD SERVICE"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I booked this location and we couldn‚Äôt be more pleased! It exceeded expectations as it was really easy to find, parking available on the street, easy access with the lockbox. No need to scavenge for a key. Clear instructions on leaving outside shoes out and providing slippers for indoors. Lovely side notes through the room. It wasn‚Äôt overwhelming. There was fresh filtered water provided, beautiful quiet area and super clean sheets and bathroom. Tea and coffee provided which was much needed. Communication was easy through this app. Angel is an incredible host. I‚Äôm glad I was able to meet him face to face as soon as I was checking out. Thank you to his partner as well for the attention to details. Everything provided was simply amazing and I wouldn‚Äôt add anything else to everything provided. It was all essential and exactly what anyone needs."

2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Easy location for a quick night‚Äôs stay driving through the I-5 corridor. We were able to heat up dinner after our drive and make breakfast before we left in the morning. Having an outdoor patio area was enjoyable. Be aware though that host uses fragrances inside the rental. Wish this was something AirBnB notes now. We probably won‚Äôt be back due to that as I am highly sensitive.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing place.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Will never get tired of coming here üôå Flormaria is for sure the best host I‚Äôve met. Most of the Airbnb I‚Äôve gone to are controlled by an agency so you can‚Äôt interact with the owner of the property.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One thing I would like to say is I know it‚Äôs not her fault that I came across her path but flormarias is grown just like I am and there Consequences that come with the choices that we make in life if we don‚Äôt deal with them accordingly by the book now with that being said GOD sees everything. I wish her the best of luck you have a bless day.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was nice and peaceful until the Government started to invade my space but as Flormaria she seems like a sweetheart
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"i stayed here for one night and it was wonderful! very accurate pictures, bed was comfy, and i felt safe. it was a bit cold, but the heater warmed things up nicely!"

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice clean place with off street parking behind a gate, which I appreciated.
Close to I-5, but in a quiet residential neighborhood with a park across the street.
Clean and comfortable."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Flormaria was super responsive and very respectful! The place was amazing and cute exactly what we needed for a quick stay. The walls are definitely thin and so i would highly recommend keeping it down by 9-10pm. We had a bit of a noise situation but Flormaria was quick to address it and was super accommodating to the situation of noise from a neighbor at 12am. There is ample street parking in addition to parking infront of the garage/side of your unit. Clear instructions and i would definitely book again!
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice studio with a great host. The walls are a little thin letting noise in from the studio next door. the curb to the driveway is very abrupt and may damage a low vehicle.

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Needed to book a place last minute. Flormarias was fast and responsive. I was checked in, in no time. The room is magnificent and I felt she undercharged for the room but hey ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was spectacular. I would highly recommend anyone to stay there. I liked that I was able to park my work vehicle in the driveway and able to shut the gate.

2022-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Stay was good, AC was leaking a lot every time we would turn it on there would be a huge pile of water, we had to put a bucket underneath of it. She was communicative and would come drain the water out. But if your over the age of 21 and you have marijauna make sure to keep it put away. I didn‚Äôt smoke in the room but flormaria thought I was because of the smell it left from being out, and was wrote a bad review on my page because of it."

,,,"BUYER BEWARE!
The Airbnb itself was fine, but upon departure the host claimed I damaged the faucet in the bathtub and sent me a request for $240. The faucet was slightly separated from the wall in the bathtub when I arrived but I didn‚Äôt report it because it worked perfectly.
She sent the request for more money stating the faucet was leaking.
I‚Äôve been using Airbnb for years and never had any issues. As a mater of fact, I am very conscious about leaving the place clean and in perfect condition.
I would not choose this Airbnb again. Period."
,,,"Context: we were traveling along the beautiful West coast on a 3000-mile roadtrip. We needed a simple place to warm up our hearts and souls after a long day of driving and hiking. We are simple people and expect a clean place, a warm bed and a shower, that's all. Nothing complicated.
To our unpleasant surprise, Teresa's place did not meet our basic expectations. The studio was very cold. We were at the end of December (the 31st to be specific) and, at night, the temperatures were close to freezing. When booking any Airbnb in winter, one would expect blankets and heating to be provided. While there was no blanket in sight, there was indeed a small electric heater. However, this was a crappy heater, worth at most $25 and bought at the local supermarket. Nobody should ever expect their guests to stay warm which such a heating situation. It was not suitable to heat a studio in the middle of winter.
So, we didn't not get a warm bed, but maybe we'd have more luck with the cleanliness of the place? Again, huge disappointment. The studio was not clean. The sheets smelled like they had come out of a cabin from the 60s. Some unusual objects were spread out throughout the studio. Under the bed, which we discovered after winning a battle against a huge spider (the biggest we've seen in California), there was a lot of dust, hairpins and food packagins, signs that the place had not been cleaned in a while.
To top it all off, the water coming out of the pipes tasted like it had rotten. I had never tasted rotten water before but, I swear to god, this water smelled and tasted like the pipes were rotten.
For the rest, do not expect anything more than what's in the description. The microwave is there, but we could not get our hands on even a glass or a spoon, or actually anything else that a traveller would need.
Overall, unless you're looking for a spartiate experience with cold and dusty sheets, like in the Ancient Greece, do not book this place. You'd honestly be better off staying at the closest motel."
,,,Had a great time with my whore!!
,,,The bed is bending no toilet paper no coffee machine like show on the picture ac is to hot never going back
,,,Teresa‚Äôs house was dirty and smelled of dog urine/feces including her ‚Äúclean‚Äù towels she had left to use. Her place was okay sized but she was having a party and it was extremely noisy for many hours into the evening. There was also a plumbing issue where we saw someone else‚Äôs business not flushed down properly. We were willing to look past all of these things because we just needed a place to sleep in the middle of our trip but at the end of our trip when we left she tried to charge us $100 for ‚Äúdirty linens‚Äù which was absolutely ridiculous but thankfully airbnb stepped in and closed her request. Also the bed is extremely uncomfortable it has a valley going in to both sides from the middle. It would be okay for a night but not worth the cost of the room
,,,"WARNING!!!! SELECTIVE to allow early check in. Rude.
And did NOT want to cancel to let me reserve a room allowing early check in! WOULD NOT let me reschedule the date further out! Most controlling and rude host I have ever met! Scammer! Wants to keep ur money."
,,,"As a business traveler, driving on the road through 8 states, I stay at a lot of Airbnbs. When I arrived at this one the first thing I noticed was the bed looked caved in in the middle. When I went to sleep, I sunk deep into it, and indeed it was dented in. I was okay after the first night but after 2 more nights my back was hurting. The side of the bed was dented in, too. I've NEVER seen a bed like this at any Airbnb. I let the hostess know 2 times about the bed and she did not respond. The room was on the cold side during the heavy winter storms. It was nice to have a refrigerator freezer and microwave. The first night I stayed there on a Friday night, there was a big loud party celebration that went till after midnight. I put ear plugs in and I was able to sleep"
,,,This room was terrible as heck ! Not worth the stay at all. There is no early check in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The bed wasn‚Äôt even fuck able üíØüòÇ lol. Waste of money don‚Äôt go here then the b!tch tried charging me $200 for smoking in a room.. first off I paid for my night so ima smoke if I want too. It was cold as heck outside less then 50 degrees she had no heater in the room!!!! We where cold all night An heard loud foot steps up stairs all night we could hear everyone‚Äôs voices that where in that house. If this b!tch was refundable I wouldn‚Äôt have stayed at all. üíØ
,,,"Contemplated about sleeping in my car, but I was tired after 10 hour drive and already paid‚Ä¶
Pros:
-Clear instructions.
-Not far from freeway.
-Private and easy access.
Cons:
-Room had a weird smell like cigarettes mixed with something.
-Wall pictures had visible dust.
-Turquoise towel seemed old and had white spots (bleach spots?).
-Shower head was cheap and not what was shown in the pictures.
-Bed was springy and not that comfortable."
,,,"This was by far one of the WORST experiences I‚Äôve ever had with an Airbnb. There is NO AIR CONDITIONING in this unit. There is NO CLOSET as the ad stated The bed sinks down wherever you lay and I‚Äôm a 4‚Äô11 139 pound person. I imagine it would be worse for anyone bigger. Checking in was not easy. First it said there was a lockbox and to message host for further instruction. when I reached out to the host for further instruction, I got nothing. No response. This lady was disrespectful and handled my things after I asked her to please stop touching my stuff when she started throwing my stuff out of the room. She threatened to call the police because I got my dates mixed up. And instead of offering the option to add nights, she lied and said the room needed to be ready for other guests. Well I haven‚Äôt seen this place booked since I left. She stays in the room above the unit and is very loud when she‚Äôs sexually active up there (which is a lot) and you can hear everything she and her male partner are talking about unless you turn up the tv. It is very obvious they are watching your every move! She is not a friendly or helpful host at all. I imagine she just isn‚Äôt a friendly or helpful human being to begin with, I guess. But it was very difficult for me to keep my hands to myself after she started touching my things. Way out of pocket!!!!!!!!"
,,,Make sure you get the room by the garage. The one in the back has no heater or AC and a non working tv
,,,Host was arguing at check in with people in her house. Guest Room no seem to me attached to family room where Slovene arguing was taking place. I left immediately. I had no idea how long or how often it would occur. I advised host I was uncomfortable with the noise and arguing and was deprived quiet enjoyment. Host refused to understand my reason for leaving and chose to adhere to a written policy regarding cancellation refunds despite my reason for leaving was due to her. I‚Äôm very disappointed in her.
,,,I've stayed here before a couple of times and I've never had a bad experience. everything is as described and And I normally have a great stay. this time not so much. whoever was staying next door to us was extremely extremely loud and the walls are paper thin. even at a whisper you could hear the people next to us. I did not make a complaint to the host but I did leave within about 3 hours of being there because I felt that uncomfortable. give him the fact that the tenants were already there I couldn't necessarily ask them to be quiet cuz it was only like 8:30 or 9 but it was just not my cup of tea. normally again it isn't like that but this time it was bad enough to where I was only there about 4 hours max and then I left shortly after sundown and didn't come back till the morning together my things
,,,She could of made the situation right but chose to keep our belongings!
,,,"Not a good place to stay, she‚Äôll lie on you and complain to Airbnb on some bs"
