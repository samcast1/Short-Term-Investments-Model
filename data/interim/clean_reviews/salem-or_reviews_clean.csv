2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Easy and delightful walking distance to Willamette Univ. Allowed me to check in in early aftrrnoon. All worked for me.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay close to the University and everyone was super quiet. Jennifer was very responsive when I had questions and I would highly recommend this rental.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice and clean, location is peacefulüôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jennifer is an awesome host who makes sure you have everything you need! I booked with her last minute and she still had everything ready for me long before I got to her place. She is an excellent communicator and is readily available if you have any questions or need anything.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was so perfect we had everything we needed including our own mini fridge inside the room. I was a little scared about the shared bathroom but it was so clean and worked out so well because you only share it with one other room. Like the other reviews said, the bed was so comfy. Also the location is perfect as it is so close to downtown where all the restaurants and stuff are! This room was a steal!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Needed a convenient place while visiting our daughter. Perfectly fit the bill. Very private, quiet and peaceful. Comfortable bed, slept great. Would stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The photos in the listing don't do justice to the charming room I stayed in. Jennifer has added some furnishings, such as a vintage dresser at the foot of the bed, that really make the space more cozy and comfortable. There is now a little desk in the nook that features a window overlooking the street. In early March, the tall camellias were already blooming outside the other window. One morning, I was able to enjoy a walk in the park that's only a couple blocks away. All in all, it was a great stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Jennifer was an excellent host and place was great!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What I really appreciated about Jennifer's place was the comfortable bed. I have never stayed in an Airbnb with a bed that was actually great, but this one was amazing. Also, the other guests and the neighborhood itself were extremely quiet. Jennifer was very communicative and friendly. Something to note-- if you have a bigger vehicle (I don't), be aware that the street is narrow and twisty right where the house is. I chose this listing simply because it was close to my workplace and reasonably priced. I would say this setup might be best suited for those who don't mind interacting with other guests, though Jennifer honored my wishes and informed the other guests that I wanted to keep to myself. Overall this was an excellent value, super clean, and very comfortable."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great! And within walking distance of the train station and Willamette University
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place and other housemates were very friendly
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the very beginning, Jennifer was the ultimate host. She was very communicative and kind.
The room was very clean and welcoming. When I arrived the other occupants in the home we‚Äôre also very welcoming, and they knew that I was there for my race and asked me how it was going. It was nice to feel expected and to have the other occupants know who I was and why I was there.
I would highly recommend this state, anybody who is visiting the local Salem area."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer rents out 4 bedrooms and has a lovely living and dining room and a nice sized kitchen. There are 2 bedrooms per floor that share a bathroom. We stayed upstairs with a Craig who was very welcoming and his adorable 2 year old.
The mattress is extremely soft so if you have any back problems, this may be an issue.
Her house is located in a quiet neighborhood."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thanks so much for this beautiful play
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer really is a superhost!! This is an excellent listing! I give it a 10 star rating!
you get so much for the value of what you get for what you're spending. I love the room I was staying in the bed is very comfortable, I truly enjoyed having my privacy. And even though I shared a bathroom with another Airbnb guest it didn't feel like I was sharing it with anyone at all. Beautiful house, with a whole lot of amenities at your fingertips! my room is very private and I needed a two-day rest from a long work week as many hours and that's exactly what I got! Thank you so much Jennifer! I will stay here again and again. Very clean & Tidy and Wonderful host!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,really great place to rest my head
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer and her family have a great place to stay, particularity if you are looking for a convenient location close to the State hospital or state offices. The house setup itself is exactly the right mix of privacy and shared space."

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding value! A very nice room that was comfy and super clean. It was close to the convention center and saved my business considerable dollars. Jennifer is a wonderful host and made my check-in and stay very easy.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Just what I needed.....I had been living in Salem for 3 months while working at Salem Health and had one more month to go. While the initial hosts (not an airbnb) were nice the living conditions were not. I rented from these airbnb hosts for the last month I was in Salem and it was wonderful. The hosts are super nice, quick to respond, and always available for any needs. As my month was ending, I felt more like I was staying with friends and in their warm welcoming home. Highly recommend if you are visiting Salem or if working at Salem Health as it's a very close and in walking distance."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Miranda's home was wonderful! Great in terms of communication and providing all the information I need to find my space in their home. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was so clean and set up perfectly. The gravel parking spot was a little difficult to maneuver so something to be mindful of, but other than that I had a great stay and appreciated the hospitality!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was such a great little place to stay! I was only in town overnight and wasn‚Äôt present much due to my engagements, but the time I was in the space was very pleasant. Miranda communicated very well and was incredibly nice when I arrived (she also gets bonus points for being in the middle of assembling a Lego set when I arrived). The home was clean, modern and my room felt very private even though it was shared with the owners. Also, both of their dogs were so sweet and were always happy to see me when I walked through their space. Would for sure stay here again if the need arises."

The attention to detail in the decor and amenities was impressive. The bedroom was comfortable, and the entire space was spotless. Miranda clearly takes great pride in maintaining a clean and inviting environment for guests.
Communication with Miranda was smooth and efficient. They were quick to respond to any questions I had and provided clear instructions for check-in and check-out. It made the entire process stress-free. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Salem, and without a doubt, I'll be choosing Miranda's Airbnb again!!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Starting with at Miranda‚Äôs place was exactly what I was looking for and ended up being so much more. I come to Salem for work and this place was perfect for me. I like renting rooms in houses because it feels a little less lonely than a private space. This was the perfect combination of having my own space and friendly hellos when we crossed paths. Miranda and her husband went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and at home and their two dogs were a joy to come home to after work. Great location, wonderful amenities, very clean, quiet as well. I will definitely stay here again üòÄ."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really great stay, super fun, super clean, very nice hosts, cute dogs. Bed wasn‚Äôt quite big enough for me and my husband but in all fairness we‚Äôre used to a king. Also the internet was giving us issues but, again in fairness, we didn‚Äôt ask for help fixing it."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I‚Äôve seen the Taj Mahal and crossed the Grand Canyon, but neither of those experiences come close to how great it was to be their guest.
Miranda and Kyle were the best hosts we‚Äôve ever experienced! They were welcoming and made us feel right at home. They were flexible with our check out time and we are beyond grateful for their generosity!
The bed was extremely comfortable. Their bonus room was super fun with video games and TV and a really comfy couch and we enjoyed watching a movie in.
We have our two month old with us, and they were so kind and generous to us and adjusted the heat for our baby to feel cozy. The whole house is really well taken care of, and very clean. They gave us great recommendations of things to do in the area. Their home is the perfect layout to spend time with my little family, it‚Äôs roomy and spacious and extremely well taken care of!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"""Enjoyed a cozy, comfortable, and private stay at this Airbnb. Highly recommended!"""
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"This place's a good stay. It's a nice location with a nice bedroom and bathroom. Feel like it could be better, mostly things like hosts being more mindful of the shared space.
Some things to note:
- Hosts took a while (few days?) to clean dishes in the sink (some smell with the food left behind) and there's clutter I have to often move out to do my own cooking.
- I had to tell them to not run the laundry late at night (it was around midnight) or shut the door to suppress noise
- The parking can be really bad if you had to park in the spot mentioned in the airbnb. There had to be some back and forth for me to park on an easier spot near the garage, but I feel like it should have been the spot to start out with
- There are few times the dog can bark for a really long time if the hosts are not around. Fortunately it did not happen all the time, but one time it happened for 45 minutes
- I recall the host's husband was shirtless in the kitchen once lol"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, thank you very much. Awesome hosts and loved the dogs!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just a cute spot! My best friend and I came here for a quick getaway! And let me just say we were both so satisfied with this place! I will definitely be coming and staying here! Leanne‚Äôs spot provided everything within a household that you may need! 100/100
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hard to find a place at this price with a hot tub. Was working perfectly and looks out to a copse of trees, so that side is very secluded. Place was as described and very clean. Don't plan on cooking other than a microwave, there was a place BBQ placw just 8 min drive away that fixed that problem. If you have ANY mobility problems it might not be a good fit. The spiral stair is very tight fit and a bit wobbly. At the very affordable price I knew there would be trade offs though and overall was very happy with the stay."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay at Leanne‚Äôs the house it was very comfortable with a great welcome basket of goodies. We really enjoyed the country views and how quiet it was. Town is only minutes away with some great restaurants.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"So I am not sure why anyone rated this anything other than 5. LOVED this. Beautiful surroundings, very quiet and a gorgeous view. You could stay there for 3 days and not leave. The place is immaculately clean and the whole design is extremely tasteful. The hot tub looks over a gorgeous forest and you can sit in it at night and watch the stars and occasional owl that flies by. The kitchen is minimalistic, do not plan to do a lot of cooking but has everything and LeAnne leaves you with a box of goodies and treats and water bottles (even though the tap water is perfect since it comes from an aquafer). Consider bringing some simple meals. Because it is in the middle of nature you have to drive a few minutes to get to for restaurants and stores but all very doable. If you are looking for a weekend of R and R and be close to a few natural parks and hikes (Silverfalls is 40 minutes drive) this is THE place to stay. LeAnne herself is amazing, kind and helpful."
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"I'm honestly unsure how to rate our stay as we only stayed for one night. We really enjoyed the balcony view while sitting in the jacuzzi, and the first floor was very spacious. However, the spiral staircase upstairs will haunt my nightmares. Also, the handrails on the main staircase are broken, so I nearly fell. When I met the host in the morning, she said she was aware of the handrail issue and had informed her husband. However, he seems to be procrastinating, putting tenants at risk by neglecting the problem. She also mentioned reminding her husband. Well, that's that... nice."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quaint, country location. Perfect for our needs this weekend."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying here, it‚Äôs a peaceful area and very relaxing."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was great very beautiful.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay! It was so peaceful and not to mention absolutely beautiful! LeAnne was awesome and helped us with anything we needed. We only would suggest sharpening the knives and putting some kind of grip tape on the spiral staircase it was very slick, steep, and not very wide (about 2.5 feet). Not safe for anyone with limited mobility. We would love to stay here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"LeAnne‚Äôs place was just what my friend and I needed - beautiful, relaxing and peaceful. Would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thanks, LeAnne!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My best friend and I had a lovely stay here. It was so clean and welcoming. The most relaxed trip iv had in forever. Will definitely be coming back to this place. 5/5 stars
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was perfect for our overnight trip to the area. We could enjoy local restaurants and a great show and also stay in a lovely peaceful place in the country. The hot tub on the deck with the tress and peace/quiet was amazing. Very simple and exactly what we needed. I slept very deep (not always the case!) I really appreciated the 12 pm checkout. It is more realistic with the amount of time needed in the morning to relax, gather your things and still stay in vacation mode with out having to rush. The land surrounding the area is beautiful. I will def stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden little gem! This place was one of our top favorite stays! It was super clean and the host made it so welcoming. The fire place, the hot tub, the cozy bedding, and the thoughtful samples in the bathroom made this place wonderful. I would love to stay here again!
Getting there, you drive through the country and get to see all the beautiful wineries that surround the area. It‚Äôs 10 -15 minutes from town which was great for us!
The view from the deck where the hot tub is beautiful . It‚Äôs private and relaxing."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely get away for my husband and I. There was complete privacy. The porch looking over the trees and fields, just beautiful. Hot tub was easy to use. Would stay here again. Clean, comfortable, and refreshing. Thank you. ."

Worth every penny spent! Loved waking up to the forest in the backyard! It‚Äôs a legit dream stay I can‚Äôt wait till I come back! ^_^
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place as described fresh smelling and many condiments included
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! I am so happy I booked Leanne's place for 3 days of nothing, but eating, sleeping, soaking, and renergizing the soul. We were not disappointed. On the last night we sat in the hot tub and stargazed while an owl flew over a few times. As a full-time caregiver, mother, sister, partner, friend, etc. I was reminded in order to be and do all these things for others, I must first take time for myself. Thank you for sharing your little slice of heaven with us and we hope to come back very soon!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute place, close enough to our event venue but far enough out that we didn‚Äôt feel like we were in Salem. Loved the quiet country feel!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A lovely spot to stay! Peaceful and felt right at home.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing getaway. The barn was so cute and cozy. The private jacuzzi was amazing. The strains up stairs were unique. We really enjoyed it. Would definitely come back again. LeAnne would always respond and had all the equipment you need.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs hard to stay in a stuffy hotel, when there is a beautiful AirBNB available. And this one was perfect.
The hot tub was spotless and toasty. We soaked a few times during our short stay. I loved the high vaulted ceiling and the loft was very cozy. The kitchen literally had everything you need and more. Coffee, creamer, sugar, steel cut oats, chocolate, popcorn and water. There was even a toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom. I have never seen that at any place we have stayed.
Place was spotless and smelled amazing, the bed was ultra soft and cozy. I could have nuzzled up in there for much longer than we had time for.
Thank you for the last minute availability and the cozy place. Highly recommended."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very beautiful Airbnb spot. It‚Äôs very quiet and private even though the owners home is close by. The hot tub is perfect and all the considerate items in the kitchen really made it feel like the host cares. The narrow stairs up to the loft can be a little intimidating for someone with height and/or falling fears, but just take it slow! üòÅ
Bed is very soft, too soft for us, which I know isn‚Äôt the most controllable aspect."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful property very private and well maintained.

The barn style loft is well appointed and between the full kitchen, which has snacks and coffee makings, the fireplace, and the hottub you feel cozy and at home. Everything is very clean and you have a good degree of privacy. The perfect place to cozy up in the winter or spread out and picnic on the deck in the summer."

Off the back deck right before we left was perfect. Would highly recommend"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We visited Salem to see our daughter who is at college in Salem . LeAnne‚Äôs place was a great getaway for us , out of town in a semi rural area . The loft was well equipped with everything we needed and LeAnne supplied lots of yummy snacks. The hot tub was a hit and great to come home to . The stairs to the loft bedroom are quite steep so if one has mobility problems they may prove to be a bit tricky . LeAnne‚Äôs communication was great the place had a lovely homely feel and was very comfortable."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,THE most beautiful space I‚Äôve ever stayed at! LeAnne thought of every detail!!

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LeAnne‚Äôs Airbnb was just what we needed for a relaxing overnight stay before our next destination! Check in was easy, the barn was immaculate and the hot tub under shooting stars was the cherry on top! It‚Äôs privately surrounded by stunning scenery and close enough to town for a quick bite to eat. This stay features a grand living and dining room for visiting and watching T.V, a comfortable bed, bathroom amenities and kitchen utensils that would be good for cooking a small meal.
We would recommend the Red Barn to anyone looking for hiking trails or wineries with a welcoming place to unwind when you return.
We will definitely keep this place in mind when we return to the area. Thank you LeAnne!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a special beautiful place this is. Everything was sparkling clean and attractively decorated! We completely came to completely relax.

As shown in the photos, there is not a full kitchen but the host did provide an electric cooktop and griddle!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a lovely time staying at LeAnne's Barn Loft!
The peacefulness outside on the deck and the hot tub were our favorite parts!
We were even able to make our own steak dinner on the electric skillet and use the air fryer for our sides.
The recommendation to go up the hill to the winery was spot on! Gorgeous view and incredible wine.
It took about 40 minutes to Silver Falls, but it was such a fun hike.
This is a great location to get some relaxation in, but not far from stores and fun things to do."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved staying here. What really drew us in was the barn look! It was so cute on the inside too, the spiral staircase fit the aesthetic perfectly. Little did we know that we would be staying in such a beautiful area. It‚Äôs located near vineyards which is an amazing plus if you like wine. The space was clean and had everything we could‚Äôve possibly needed. We are completely satisfied and would love to stay again if ever in Oregon again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place in a beautiful location! The barn was very clean, beautifully renovated and both the bed and the couch were extremely comfortable!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space and stay! The loft was cooled for our arrival, which was much appreciated! Kitchenette is well equipped for most needs‚Ä¶nice coffee pod options. Bathroom is generously sized, bed is suuper comfy and luxurious.
The water supply tastes great and I am quite particular.
The hot tub is a total bonus! Enjoyed it very much!
Spiral stairs took me some careful negotiation but were interesting!
You can walk to Coria winery for a splendid view, and a flight, if you don‚Äôt mind uphill.
Happy to stay again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely quasi-rural spot in a revamped red barn, amidst pines and vineyards.
Easy to get to, just a short drive from the I-5. Also just 10 minutes to Salem downtown.
So quiet at night and in the mornings. Spacious interior. Great to relax in the hot tub.
LeAnne was a splendid and helpful host."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The home is beautiful! You can tell it was either just built or very well kept up with. The house is very comfortable. It does say refrigerator and mini fridge but there is only a mini fridge. The electric stove is a mini portable electric stove but if you travel light the house is amazing. Prior to check in we went to the winery up the road, it was one of the best winery‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever been too. I had a great time couldn‚Äôt be more appreciative of the opportunity to stay !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Super cozy, clean and relaxing home. We felt like at home. We are definitely recommending to stay here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,now THIS is a super host! such an amazing spot! the hot tub and the spacious home was more than we imagined. by far our best stay yet! gorgeous scenery as well!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Red Barn in the countryside just south of Salem is a delight. Spacious and light-filled, this clean and quiet place is a relaxing and comfortable option for this area. We were able to easily scoot into town during our visit to access multiple stores, restaurants and places to visit. There‚Äôs designated parking right out front and a hot tub on a private deck for further relaxation. And, you can even walk just up the road to a local winery! We were so comfortable here."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time staying at LeAnne‚Äôs AirBnB. The location felt ‚Äúoff the beaten path,‚Äù but was a relatively short drive from Silver Falls State Park where we hiked during our stay, as well as downtown Salem where we went for dinner both nights of our stay (thanks to our host for the restaurant recommendations). It was clean, cozy, and private, and the hot tub was fantastic with a great view from the deck. A/C worked great, WiFi was easy to access, parking was simple, location was not hard to find, water quality was perfectly fine, and we had pretty much everything we needed in terms of amenities and then some (see the hot tub). And while there are many wineries in the area, the one just down the road has a really fantastic view."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"LeAnne‚Äôs is a rare find in the trees and by a few vineyards! Centrally located to our Son‚Äôs wedding festivities.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at LeAnne‚Äôs place. I traveled with my mom and two daughters. My youngest daughter is autistic and doesn‚Äôt do well in hotels due to sensory issues with loud sounds. We didn‚Äôt think twice to book LeAnne‚Äôs place because we knew it was on private property and the area was quiet. The atmosphere was exactly what we needed to decompress after a long day. The hot tub was perfect, the view at night was beautiful. She was attentive with us and check in was very easy. The coffee was perfect, bathroom was clean and the the beds were comfortable. If you‚Äôre looking for a nice quiet place and you run into her place don‚Äôt think twice, just book it. We‚Äôre so grateful she was our host."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and secluded. Plenty of privacy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Red Barn was the perfect getaway! Wish I had stayed longer to enjoy the beautiful view from the hottub for more than just a day! Had a binder filled with information for your stay and the bed was insanely comfortable!!! The 2 things I would comment on is that the spiral staircase isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart haha and there‚Äôs only a small refrigerator which may be difficult if staying for more than a day.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a cute stay! Loved the vibe of this place and the hottub was magical. Would definitely stay again!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I were blessed to find this Iast minute get away for our 10th anniversary. Upon entering the airbnb it had a clean fresh smell, not cleanser clean, but new house clean. The listing didn't describe how remote and private it was. But I was overjoyed to see that we would have our privacy. It was a quick drive from the freeway under 10 min. And a short drive to our favorite ice cream place in Lake Oswego Salt n Straw about 15 min. The only noise we heard was birds chirping. So peaceful!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A stunning, modern taste of culture and comfort! Lillian provided us with easy check in, tasteful decor, spacious floor plan and many worthwhile suggestions for activities and restaurants! We stayed one night, but the moment we walked in, we wished we had booked longer. We tried some of the local recommendations for restaurants and sights to see and highly recommend the next guests do the same. The home was private and cozy in the vineyard. I cannot speak more highly of this. We loved waking up to see the beautiful valley and vineyard before you! Not only that, but the place itself was fully stocked with every amenity you could think of - and I‚Äôm high maintenance! Everything a guest could want and more! I always go into these places expecting I‚Äôll need to buy extra shampoo or bring my own snacks, but Lillian went above and beyond with this listing and I‚Äôll be honest, it‚Äôs those little thoughtful gestures that made this feel like home. It quickly became our dream home away from home!"

This little house is gorgeous - the setting is peaceful and quiet in a little vineyard, the decor is beautiful, the kitchen is well appointed, the beds are comfy, the book selection is fun, and everything feels brand new. It‚Äôs out of a design magazine. Lillian‚Äôs guidebook had a huge list of great recommendations for eateries and things to do. It‚Äôs secluded up on a hillside but just 8 minutes from restaurants downtown. One of my absolute favorite Airbnb stays. Lillian was super responsive and helpful. We will definitely be back!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a beautiful stay on the Vineyard. We were disappointed in a couple of things though that we mentioned to Lillian and weren‚Äôt resolved during our stay. Happy to have a Nespresso with ample amount of pods for coffee in the morning but the machine was extremely dirty. In the queen bedroom, both of my bedside lights ran out of battery power-I like to read in bed at night. Other than those two small things everything was great and the space is really beautiful. The sofa and TV are great for a movie night and the beds were very comfortable."

Checkin was easy and Lillian was available right away to help us with a door locking issue. The beds were super comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything you may need. They do have a washer/dryer on site - however it is a steam dryer, so don't wait until the last minute to do laundry before leaving. Short drive into town for coffee and restaurants and located not far from many local wineries. The little patio in the front has 2 rocking chairs, perfect for an early afternoon glass of wine and a visit from their dog Scooter.

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Adorable little house (with everything you need) in a beautiful setting. We stayed a week and I loved being able to look out at the vineyards while I was working. Even saw them get snow-covered on our last day : ) House is well-equipped. Loved the temp control in every room plus the wood stove. Bed was really comfortable. Note for those needing wifi, the place comes with a mofi but it's not quite as strong as you might need for internet work/video calls. I hotspotted to my own phone for the week and cell service is absolutely fine so it did the trick. Would definitely recommend this spot for anyone wanting to explore the area from a relaxing home base."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great spot a little south of Salem. We loved how quiet it was and clean the check in process was also seamless.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a delightful place to stay! We enjoyed sitting on the porch in the midst of vineyards! The house was beautifully decorated, new and clean. Wonderful bed and shower, well-equipped kitchen, many amenities. It was nice to have cozy fires in the gas stove. We will definitely try to stay here again if we get the chance!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful home, hospitality and setting.
Looking forward to a return visit."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful location and accommodations. A true getaway and slice of paradise in Willamette Valley!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, beautiful villa!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hard to describe our stay as anything other than ""perfect."" Lillian was such an excellent communicator and check-in was a breeze. The house itself is filled with natural light, impeccably designed, extremely comfortable, and located in the most relaxing setting among the vines on a very private property. The kitchen is well-equipped and we cooked ourselves the majority of the meals during our four night stay (just a heads-up that there is a stove-top but no oven). The shower was excellent and the bed very comfortable. It didn't effect us because we were there with the purpose of wine tasting and unplugging but the wifi was a little spotty at times.
I'm not kidding when I say that this is the only place we'll ever stay when we visit the Willamette Valley."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing, it was clean and this tiny home had so many wonderful features. Reverse osmosis filtered water, cell phone chargers, it was clean and the setting was beautiful. It was minutes from down town Salem. I would definitely stay here again."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a top-notch sanctuary for two. The house was very well-appointed, even down to the various items in the bathroom and shower. Simple, elegant, modern, comfortable. The bed and pillows were awesome. We kept all the doors and windows open when we were there, loving the inside/outside feeling. We cooked in and had cocktails on the porch in the rocking chairs. The house is on a short dead-end street, so it's quiet and peaceful. About five minutes away is a huge park along the Willamette River that is great for longer and more strenuous walking. Our host was so kind and attentive and we absolutely loved their dog, Scooter, who we coaxed into visiting us whenever possible. We will definitely stay here again when we are in the area."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! The location is so unique, literally right in the vineyard. The kitchen is well stocked, even the pans are a dream to cook with. Everything is modern, new, and truly there was nothing that wasn‚Äôt provided‚Ä¶.bath products, kitchen supplies, everything was great! Really enjoyed our breakfasts in the front porch rockers :)"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely villa set in the grounds of a small vineyard . Great to have the extra space set up as an office while in the area working. All mod cons , perfect for short and the longer stay. Hosts Josh and Lillian made me feel so welcome ‚Ä¶ will be back !"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house looked just like the pictures for sure. If I needed anything cleaned that I wasn‚Äôt able to do Felix the co host made sure to come by and clean.
Felix came by every 2 days to help clean and take trash out which was very helpful. By far the best stay wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for an annual convention and the place was awesome! I‚Äôd say the only downfall is there are no bathtubs. I have two toddlers who scream at the sight of showers lol. Of course, that is no fault of the owners, just my lack of reading. Otherwise, backyard was amazing for our kids to run around, fully fenced. There was a toddler bed provided and some toys in the house and outside. The house also has child locks on the cabinets! Besides the no baths, it is very toddler friendly, as there is not a lot of clutter for kids to get into. The hosts were very friendly and proactive in making sure we arrived and got in okay. As well as very responsive when I messaged them. House was clean and very spacious. And the neighborhood was nice! Definitely would recommend this place!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The Art Loft was a wonderful place to stay. Mary Lou was so gracious and helpful every step of the way. The location was perfect for restaurants and shopping. She had a whole book of places to eat, shop, and for sightseeing. It was very clean and she provided us with a few essentials to get started. We‚Äôll definitely return!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Lous was an absolute wonderful host and the loft itself is/was very charming and in a beautiful, quiet, and safe neighborhood. The loft was SO much nicer than staying in a hotel - and the artwork was an added bonus. I plan to stay here from now on when I visit my daughter at Willamette University (as long as it's available - maybe I shouldn't be posting such a positive review). Thank you Mary Lou - I'll see you again soon!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"If you get the chance, stay here! The pictures show how appealing the space is, but can‚Äôt convey the sense of staying in the best tree-house, ever! And the artwork goes beyond what you see in the listing‚Äîthe whole setting is enchanting, and yet it‚Äôs right in a lovely historic neighborhood, and close to town. The host, Mary Lou, was lovely, and so thoughtful, and a real gem, for giving the rest of us the opportunity to spend time in this tiny art gallery. If you‚Äôve ever fantasized (as I have) about spending the night in an art museum, this may be as close as we‚Äôll ever get!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Light filled and spacious yet cozy, beautiful artwork (not an IKEA print to be found!!), the small kitchenette and bathroom are stocked with the usual AIRBNB amenities and then some, very quiet but not far from restaurants and stores, graceful and helpful hosts."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My experience was incredible. Several things really stood out. The studio itself is even more beautiful in person, and its location ""above the trees"" made it the perfect, peaceful hideaway. I've never had a bad host, but Mary Lou and her husband were different. There was a warmth in the way they communicated that truly made me feel at home. I'm already planning to return there in September and again in another year. Such special people. Such a special place."

Will stay again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever stayed in a nicer place. Surrounded by art on a hill in the trees with every amenity provided. The yard surrounding is stunning. The neighborhood is charming, friendly and walkable. I stayed here two weeks after my daughter and son in law who live a block away had their baby. I took care of them all day. This little bungalow took care of me each night and morning. Mary Lou was so helpful. Her positive energy is an important part of it all."

Loft is very centrally located with easy access to interstate and only about 30 minures away from Silver Falls State Park. Bed was comfortable, and loft had a smaill kitchenette if needed.

I was helping my son move into his apartment and wasn‚Äôt able to spend much time at the Airbnb but I would have liked to. It‚Äôs a light and airy space, shower is great and she has great amenities.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The art loft is an inspirational space. I always request this space when I come to Salem to visit family. It is beautifully appointed, perfectly located in the prettiest neighborhood in Salem and hosted by two very special people - Mary Lou and Alan."

2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôm starting this review on my first day arriving for a 5 day stay because I already know I‚Äôm going to have a lot to say, and I don‚Äôt want to write a rushed review. I arrived on Easter Sunday. Mary Lou let me check in 2 hours before check in, even though they were totally doing family Easter in the main house. She walked me through the BEAUTIFUL garden to the guest house, and made sure I had everything I needed (including a plate of Easter Sunday lunch <3). I spent the next two hours walking around the neighborhood. I cannot express in words how gorgeous the neighborhood is. I took MANY photos :) I finished the evening on my personal patio, which conveniently sits perfectly in the sun all afternoon until practically sunset. Prefer the shade in the afternoon? Don‚Äôt worry, the garden bellow is filled with beautiful shrubs and flowers and comfortable seating. Not to mention the welded metal sculptures and other charming original pieces of art perfectly scatter throughout the foliage. Needless to say, I ended my first night in absolute heaven.
The following days were more of the same. Mary Lou periodically checked on me to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. As days passed, I discovered more tasteful and entertaining special touches. For example, I loved the small jar of color pencils and hardback sketch book for guests to fill with notes and sketches. Of course, I also took many more walks around the neighborhood and neighboring parks (yes multiple. And they‚Äôre ALL beautiful).
The apartment was stocked with complimentary snacks and breakfast items. Coffee and tea were also provided. I know this is going to sound strange...but the soap and shampoo was sooooooo nice. The bathroom is also stocked with soft fluffy towels and an array of personal hygiene items. This requires a great deal of attention to detail, but it makes a WORLD of a difference.
I could go on and on about how perfect this experience was for me, but I think I‚Äôve made my point. Stop looking. Book this space. It‚Äôs comfortable, beautiful, and unforgettable. <3"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely little hideaway in a beautiful neighborhood in Salem. Mary Lou provides thoughtful touches like fresh flowers, delicious snacks and drinks, comfortable bedding, hints for exploring Salem and surrounding areas, and all the dishes, glassware, etc. you need to serve simple meals. The loft is superbly furnished, and beautiful works of art decorate the space. This was our second stay, and we were just as happy with it as the first time."
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is the perfect combination of cozy and stylish. The neighborhood is quiet, beautiful, and great for walks. It‚Äôs also just a hop, skip, and a jump from downtown which made is very convenient for my work trip. Mary Lou and Alan could not have been nicer - they are wonderful hosts. The bed is uber comfortable and I will definitely look to stay here again if I‚Äôm back in the area."

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Lou and Gramps were great! She greeted us when we arrived, gave us a tour of the space and made sure we knew where everything was. The loft is a gem and has everything you'd ever need, complete with snacks, coffee, tea, extra toiletry items, books, drawing pads and pencils, tv, radio, and a nice view. Her local recommendations for restaurants were spot on and her place is so conveniently located to every store we needed to go. Highly recommend!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love Mary Lou‚Äôs place. I think this is my fourth or fifth time staying here and I always look for it first when traveling to Salem. It is cozy, clean, and private."

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When we checked in, Mary Lou gave us a very informative tour. We really thought it was great. The dishes were all handmade and so stylish. There were free family passes to a local museum, to name a few things.
This art loft is a beautiful compilation of art and style. The personality of this space is so unique! We loved looking at all the art work. The magazines and books were fun! We had coffee, yogurt, granola and snacks which were so appreciated.
I really loved the quick responses and all the communication. It was so helpful. This place is definitely worth the stay."
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The loft was exactly as depicted with ample room for 2 and lots of bright outside light. Mary Lou offered many tips for meals and walking. We were within a 5 minute drive to restaurants. Our stay was lovely.
2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This marvelous place is like having your own private overnight in an art gallery. Indeed it doubles as one, but the personal comforts abound to at once give it a very comfortable homey feel. I highly recommend."

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our daughter goes to Willamette in Salem and in the past we have stayed in one of the few hotels Salem offers. Never again. The loft exceeded our expectations and was less expensive than most hotel rooms in the area. It is well appointed and comfortable. The bedding was incredibly comfortable and the loft is filled with beautiful paintings. We found ourselves admiring the art often (it feels like a quaint gallery). The loft sits above their detached garage and is accessible from the alley behind their main house. It is private yet you have the benefit of having access to the beautiful backyard. This will be our go to place until our daughter graduates and we will certainly tell other parents about it.
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Mary Lou and Alan take great care and pride in their home. The art work was wonderful, the creativity shows, the backyard was a a great place to hang out. Great advise given for eateries, galleries, shops, and general getting around. They give attention to details and will definitely stay here again!!!"

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What you see in the photographs is just a hint of just how stunning this unique loft is. Wake up surrounded by beautiful artwork in you own private gallery. Not only is it pleasing on the eye ,
but practical as well. Sliding panels mean that you can move the canvas on display to reveal a fully functional, well stocked kitchenette. Loads of local information on file too."

Mornings: soft light, art-filled walls, wood floors, immaculate little kitchen with coffee and scones, compliments of Mary Lou and Alan. I think I may have dreamed of a loft just like this one. I walked in through the french doors and all my cares just melted away. Stay here whenever you can."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful sanctuary! I can‚Äôt see any reason to stay anywhere else. Truly a lovely experience and lovely hosts! Mary Lou‚Äôs loft is a beautiful and thoughtfully appointed space.

It is equipped with everything you need and even things you didn‚Äôt know you needed...like a picnic basket fully stocked with paper products just waiting to be filled with your favorite picnic foods. I cannot begin to express just how enchanting and inviting their backyard is...the perfect place to sit and unwind at the end of the day and chill with a glass of wine from one of the local vineyards. Hosts, Mary Lou and Alan are so genuine and gracious...we enjoyed sitting and chatting about Oregon with them. The neighborhood is absolutely perfect for morning or evening strolls...such beautiful houses and yards. The hosts, the loft, the art, the yard, the surrounding neighborhood...perfection!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A comfortable, restful, peaceful space. Extremely comfortable bed. It is convenient to downtown and an easy place to stay for business, but I hope to be able to come back sometime when I have more time to just enjoy relaxing there. Very friendly hosts with prompt clear communication. Highly recommended."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space is very unique and comfortable. The location is close to downtown and many amenities. It was a great choice for us while visiting family in the area.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is the best I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Bed is super comfy, bathroom was small but perfect for my needs with great amenities.

And the hosts are just the nicest people ever! I hope to stay again on my next work trip to Salem!!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tremendously unique art loft in a prime location of Salem Oregon. Mary Lou is a wonderful hostess, and maintains a clean and orderly Art filled unit. I‚Äôm sure will use it again in the future. Jim and Brooks"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best Air BnB I've ever stayed in. It was beautiful (used to be an art gallery!) and so thoughtfully prepared - Mary Lou left out detailed lists of recommended restaurants and things to do in Salem (including a free pass to a local art museum), snacks, and everything. Definitely check out the restaurants, they were So Good. There was also a cute little logbook where guests could leave notes and drawings for future guests to read. The loft was spotlessly clean, private, and air conditioned! The bed was comfy, there was a TV with Netflix, wifi, and extra of anything we might need. And to top it all off, Mary Lou and her husband were the nicest people ever! 10/10 would recommend staying here, it was the highlight of our trip."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful space and close to downtown restaurants. Lovely neighborhood. Amazing hosts!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The very special opportunity to spend our evening in Mary Lou's art gallery made for a unique and joyful experience during our one-night stay in Salem. We highly recommend.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We‚Äôd love to keep this wonderful spot a secret but it‚Äôs not fair to other travelers.
We have made a second visit and hope for more. This loft is perfect, cozy and filled with artistic charm. The hosts always look for ways to welcome and spoil their guests with little extras in the frig, wine, coffee and essentials that are well stocked and available.
One of our very best and favorite air b&b experiences. But shhhhhh, don‚Äôt tell everyone."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Lou‚Äôs place was exceptional and exceeded our expectations. What a fun place with all of amenities and more. We especially enjoyed the art! The neighborhood was beautiful, peaceful, and close to activities. Our only regret is not being to stay longer! Her place comes highly recommended!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really lucked out finding Mary Lou and Alan‚Äôs beautiful loft! They provided wonderful amenities, made us feel very much at home, and it couldn‚Äôt have been a more perfect location for our hiking trip. We would love to stay there again!"
2018-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Lou was a great host! She's put so much thought into her lovely space. It's beautiful, and just what i needed for my short stay."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Lou‚Äôs place is my favorite place to stay in Salem. Great views, cute neighborhood, close to restaurants, and she has coffee, yogurt and granola stocked in the kitchen. The little art studio is comfortable and quiet. I always look for her place first!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a great stay! Located in a quiet & lovely neighborhood just a few minutes from all the restaurants, we enjoyed our short stop in Salem. Mary Lou and Alan were excellent hosts and very accommodating. We would definitely stay again!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved this space! Mary Lou and Alan were great hosts - incredibly welcoming, communicative, and hospitable.
The space feels like you're staying in an art gallery and the windows provide excellent morning light. We kept the windows open at night which was the perfect temperature.
The town of Salem was really fun. We only stayed for one night, but would love to be back someday!"
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had high hopes, but it was truly even better than I had expected. It was such a unique and interesting space-- something I always look for in an AirBnB. And nothing was sacrificed in terms of amenities and conveniences. We had our own separate parking area right at the loft. The way that the space fully functions as an art gallery and a comfortable living space, using these cool sliding walls, reminds me of some of the grand finales of those home makeover shows. It's just fun.
Mary Lou couldn't be a warmer host. And one night she and her husband happened to be having marionberry pie-- an Oregon specialty that we had never heard of. She warmed up two pieces and brought it over to us. We are not particularly fond of pies in general, but I'm telling you that this was the most amazing pie we had ever had. Not only that, but it introduced us to a cool local Oregon fruit that we wouldn't have gotten in any other state, but would likely have missed out on if not for Mary Lou!
The neighborhood is so beautiful-- every house different and so cool-looking. And located just a a few minutes from Willamette University.
I couldn't recommend more highly!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Mary Lou‚Äôs was fantastic. The loft was decorated with some amazing pieces of art and its layout was perfect. After each day‚Äôs adventures, it was so relaxing to come back and catch our breath. And it wasn‚Äôt just the loft, it was the entire neighborhood. Downstairs from the loft, there was a cozy outdoor ‚Äúroom‚Äù with a firepit, were we could sit and have a drink and go through the pictures of the day. Art was everywhere, from paintings to statues to mobiles‚Ä¶.it was so comfortable and welcoming. Even looking out the windows, everyone in the area had these beautiful gardens and landscapes to brighten everything up. We were surrounded by gardens full of everything from roses to wildflowers. Every night, after coming back from our adventures, we would take time to simply walk around the block. The entire neighborhood had lots of little corner gardens with mixes of full blooms or bushes of blueberries and blackberries, huge trees, hidden pathways‚Ä¶. the neighborhood itself was almost a huge public park, where a walk down the sidewalk was one picture perfect setting after another.
Mary Lou is a fantastic host. She made sure we had coffee, snacks, sundries, and every other little thing that made the experience so wonderful. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, on our last day, as we were packing our car to head out, she came out to say goodbye and give us a bag full of chocolate chip cookies she had made the night before.
I highly recommend if you are visiting Salem, check out Mary Lou‚Äôs wonderful place. It was a perfect launchpad for our visit to Oregon (where we travelled from the Coast to Silver Falls State Park to the Downtown Salem Saturday Farmers Market) with truly gracious hosts."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Lou and Alan are exceptional hosts! Their home is outstanding. It‚Äôs close to downtown yet hidden in this gorgeous neighborhood. The house is located in back of the property. It almost feels like staying in a treehouse but a very luxurious and tastefully decorated one! So many little touches such as coffee with cream and sugar, granola, yogurt and snacks. They both gave us wonderful suggestions on places to go and bings to do. We absolutely loved our stay!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Do not pass up an opportunity to stay in Mary Lou's loft. The space is filled with inspring art, and the thoughtful touches of breakfast snacks for the morning, the clean and comfortable environment made for a restful stay.

The neighborhood was also beautiful and we enjoyed an evening stroll to downtown and watching the sunset!"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Lou was such a great host! She made sure that we had all the details we needed when traveling to the house and she had tons of information about local sights.

2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Lou and Alan greeted and welcomed us. They steered us too. Their Art Loft is a unique treat in every way. Don‚Äôt miss it!
As a lover of beautiful things, this loft will sweep you in. We stayed two nights and were still admiring/noticing new touches. ML & A are a terrific team - she‚Äôs an artist and he‚Äôs an articulate carpenter/builder/teacher.
If we lived near, we‚Äôd probably be friends.
Cheers to this beautiful area from the East Coast!!!
Enjoy,
MB & Allan"
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was all the things that make AirBNB superior to hotels: gracious hosts interested in meeting new people, unique accommodations, privacy, gorgeous setting, delicious breakfast and snacks and great value. The spring flowers were in bloom and put on a magnificent show. The art was lovely and there was a binder where the artist explains their approach which I found helpful. One of the best places we have stayed with AirBNB."
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful space, with original artwork and lots of windows to let in the sun. It is very comfortably appointed, and the hosts went above and beyond by providing excellent coffee, granola, yogurt and snacks. We hung out for hours in this lovely space, reading and relaxing in the rain. Lots to do in Salem and surrounding country as well, Silver Falls state park was especially nice."

2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an amazing find! Mary Lou and Alan are genuinely warm hosts. If you love art and creativity, you will absolutely love this place. The backyard is beautifully landscaped with a sprinkling of fun, eclectic art. Besides lovely hosts and wonderful art, you will have a comfortable bed and a very clean place. Unfortunately, this was a very rushed trip so we didn‚Äôt have nearly enough time to enjoy this beautiful, artsy space. We plan to book here our next trip!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Artist‚Äôs Loft is gorgeous space in a lovely neighborhood, and the property has an amazing, beautiful garden. Everything we needed was provided and much more!

2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Lou's place is truly amazing. Adorned with amazing art from local artists, and stylishly furnished.

2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As always, another good stay at the artist's loft in what turned out to be one of the coldest couple of days I've experienced in Salem. All was cozy and warm, however, and the atmosphere more than made up for the weather!"
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The art loft was incredible! We were visiting to compete at a local running race and could not have asked for a better place to stay. Mary Lou was a welcoming and responsive host and was willing to let us check in early.

Enjoyed walking in the neighborhood."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Bottom line is a lot of the airbnb experience is the hosts, and Mary Lou and Alan are the best. They made themselves available anytime we might need them, but also allowed us as much privacy as we wanted. They've taken a lot of time to make the loft unique, and it certainly was. If we travel again to Salem and need to be in the particular area, this place will be the first on our list."
2018-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super host, great communication, awesome artsy abode, and a comfortable bed in a quiet residential neighborhood. I didn‚Äôt stay long enough to enjoy it all but I will be back."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Lou and Alan are wonderful hosts and their place is beautiful and very comfortable. This time there were cozy flannel sheets on the bed and fresh raisin English muffins and fruit waiting for breakfast. Of all the Airbnb places I've stayed, this is, by far, my favorite. The bed is comfortable and there is a nice desk and sitting area in addition to a well stocked kitchenette. I'm looking forward to my next stay here when I'm in Salem."
2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Lou was wonderfully hospitable and warm. The place was comfortable, cozy, inviting, and so much more interesting than boring business hotels! It was a lovely respite after busy workdays."

2018-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another amazing stay at Mary Lou‚Äôs place. I am able to bring my own food to prep or go to the local organic grocery store up the road. The bed was extra cozy with winter blankets and sheets. I love staying here!!

2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Allan and Mary Lou were the best hosts! Parking space right next to the unit. Check in was easy and smooth and Allan pointed out everything we needed to know about the apartment and the area which was helpful for us to find places to eat. The apartment itself was super clean and stylish with the beautiful artwork surrounding us. Everything in the apartment was easy to find and self explanatory to use. We will definitely stay here again.
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful loft and the hosts created special touches for the stay including a bottle of wine for the guests, breakfast food, and beautiful art on the walls. As an example of the hosts' attention to detail, they include a fan in the room in case a guest would like white noise in the background as they sleep. I appreciated that the hosts were also fine with me having my sister stay with me throughout my stay. The only thing that could be improved is the wifi - it was spotty in various places in the loft. I imagine this is because the loft is streaming from the house. That said, the still worked fairly well and the art on the walls and beauty of the loft itself made up for spotty wifi. I'd highly recommend this spot to other folks."
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved Mary lou‚Äôs Place in all respects
2017-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet loft with amazing art everywhere. Comfortable and just the spot for a couple or single to settle in for a cozy stay.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Diane and Tom‚Äôs. We love the location and the accommodations are very comfortable. Diane is very attentive and a charming hostess. We have family in the area and this was the perfect place to stay for us. We look forward to returning!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing views, super private and peaceful. Accurate listing, no complaints! Note for allergy sufferers, it is a daylight basement, nice and clean, but has the expected old/musty smell. They run a HEPA purifier which helps. It wasn't bad, just wanted people with sensitivities to know."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane and Tom were so friendly and gracious hosts. They have a beautiful place that was very peaceful and what we needed as we both work in mental health! Had everything we needed, a few snacks and Diane always available. We don't have a negative thing to say! Oh, maybe one thing.....It is a huge living room which is awesome and spacious, however, we are getting older and pretty hard to see or read what was on the TV as it is super small for the room, but that is it!!! Thanks again you two!!!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great personable experience. Enjoyed the little extras.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a warm welcome from Diane and Tom. They showed us through the apartment, made sure we were comfortable, and were very attentive to our needs.

We certainly hope to stay with them again in the future."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really spacious, private space with a great view and outdoor space to relax with a book. I was only passing through, but it would have been nice to be able to stay longer. Diane and Tom are friendly and gracious hosts."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane is a wonderful hostess with a great space for her guests. The location works for visiting vineyards as well as taking in all Salem and the surrounding area has to offer. She adds personal touches with coffee, cereal, seltzers and snacks. The common space is large and nice to hang out in on a rainy day. You‚Äôll love staying here!"

If you have the chance to stay here, you'll have found a real treasure. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you so much, Diane!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were visiting friends nearby and needed a place to lay our heads. This place was perfect. Even without a kitchen, a coffee maker, microwave and a fridge was good for the basics needed to start our day or end our day. Diane gave us a nice send off in the morning as well. Thank you!"

It is very spacious and so comfortable, we would always stay here on our visits to family in Salem, if we could."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane is one of the most thoughtful, personal, and friendly hosts out there. Her place is clean and they included amenities that made for a very comfortable stay. Comfy bed and quiet, beautiful surroundings. There is a heater that will go off briefly at night, so ear plugs may be useful during the winter. I would stay again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great 2-night stay at Diane and Tom‚Äôs place. The location was perfect for our hike at Silver Falls State Park. And the drive there was beautiful too.

Make sure you check it out! Thanks for sharing your place, Diane."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tom and Diane were awesome! They had everything we needed and were very hospitable and friendly. This location was perfect for us to attend our daughters beach volleyball games at Corban University.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Diane's place several times visiting our daughter. We keep coming back because it works so well for us. It is clean and comfortable, on a quiet street right by Corban University and only a few minutes from stores and restaurants. We appreciate the little homey touches like juice and yogurt in the fridge, and the hosts are always very welcoming."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My only regret is that I wish I had more time to truly enjoy Diane‚Äôs home. It was very spacious and comfortable and she adds little details that make you feel at home. I would definitely stay here again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We are return customers! We first chose Diane's place because of the proximity to Corban University, where we have a student. We found it to be clean, quiet, and comfortable. The hosts are very friendly and responsive to questions. It is ideal for a couple; a third person can stay on an airbed they have. There is not an actual kitchen, but it has a microwave, coffee pot, toaster, and small fridge. Not really set up for lots of meal prep, but we were able to toast bagels, reheat food, etc. Being right next to the college makes it so easy for us to stay there, and I'm sure we will be back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't remember how many times I have stayed at this point, but each visit is great. I am thankful that you continue to host. The place is convenient, close to everything, and still so quiet. Thank you again for having me!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for us. Absolutely everything was five star. We have been recommending it to friends as well. Super value!!! We will definitely stay here whenever we visit the area.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our hosts were incredibly thoughtful and welcoming. Very kind and genuine people. We felt especially safe here, and the location is quite charming and quiet, but with easy access into town if you need to pick anything up or grab food. Check-in was easy and communication timely and helpful. The space was much larger than we had anticipated and very comfortable and ""homey."" The accommodations were comfortable, and our hosts were even extra thoughtful by turning a lamp on in the space for us before we came home in the evening after it was dark.
Bonus perk: My hair was softer after washing it in the shower there than it has been in years with our over-treated, extra-hard water back at home. I didn't even know my hair was capable of being that soft and shiny. It was a nice vacation for my hair as well as the rest me."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very private entrance, clean room, comfortable bed and loved the snacks available in the room. Every AirBnB should have snacks and a small selection of food to go! Would stay again if I needed to."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane'splace is awesome! Diane is a great host and so welcoming! The space is clean, tidy and has so much space! We also loved sitting on the patio, drinking coffee and looking at the view! We highly recommend this place!"

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great piece of country in the city. The area is spacious and Diane offers an enormous amount of energy to keep her guests happy. A great place to stay when you are in the area either for work or vacation.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Diane is a lovely host. Her home is very clean. The living room was very spacious and had a great view. The location has a quiet country feel but only a 10 min drive to get food/coffee.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location if you are looking to have a quiet and peaceful visit but also not far from downtown and only about an hour drive to Portland! plenty of hiking spots and lakes nearby and everything you could reasonably ask for while staying in someone‚Äôs home! Will most definitely consider staying again next time I visit Salem!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, home and hosts."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We only had a 2 night stay but it was super cute & easy to get to. Very spacious. The welcome snacks were most appreciated :D And it was a GREAT value!!! Diane came down daily to empty out the dirty dishes & garbage for us, and refill the most delicious well water... while we were out. You MUST drink the water lol All the basics were there. Mini fridge & microwave... toaster & coffee pot (with coffee!!). Overall, very good stay while visiting Salem!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I had a wonderful time staying at Diane's house. She is an amazing host who is kind, helpful and excellent with communication. The house is in a beautiful location, and it is so relaxing and enjoyable staying there. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a peaceful and comfortable stay in the Salem area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great accommodation outside Salem. Great hosts in Diane and Tom and in a beautiful setting and well-stocked accommodation.
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little garden apartment, great proximity to Corban University. Very scenic back yard."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane and Tom are the epitome of the Perfect Airbnb hosts! After a week on the road, their place was a peaceful haven to relax, refresh and reboot! Diane reached out ahead of our arrival to make sure we knew how to get there, where we could park and how to get inside. Upon our arrival, Diane greeted us to ensure everything was to our liking, ask us if we wanted wood for the outside fire pit and if there was anything she could do to make our stay more comfortable. She even left some snacks for us and cool water from their well. After that she disappeared, giving us our privacy. The place is more spacious than it looks in the pictures and it is SUPER clean! The bed is comfortable, the water pressure in the shower is strong, and the inside and outside are charming. I HIGHLY recommend staying at the Country Garden Retreat!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for four days while visiting family in the Salem area. We loved the location and the accommodations are spacious and very comfortable. Diane and Tom are wonderful people, attentive hosts, and we enjoyed meeting them. We will absolutely try to stay here again in the future!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane is the most gracious host! We were treated as guests in her house and felt very welcome. If you're looking for a quiet spot to rest and not be far from downtown, this is it. Highly recommended!"
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane was flexible with my late checkout request. Nice view, but due to the floor level we could hear a lot of floor creaking and water activity from upstairs. If you don't mind host interaction (like at the door when you arrive to meet and explain the rules, in the living room to get dishes and garbage when you go out to eat, etc.), then it is a nice clean place with a good view and country feel, yet close enough to town to get dinner."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Diane is a wonderful and kind Host. We enjoyed our 2 day stay so muchWe felt so welcomed that we really wished we were staying a little longer. It was so peaceful and quiet in that part of town we felt totally relaxed and happy. I will definitely recommend Diane's AirBNB to all my friends and we hope to return next year.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit is a clean and taken care of place. I was a little hesitant when I saw it was in the daylight basement of their home, but as soon as I got there I felt so much better. Diane was very welcoming and had everything set up to make you feel right at home. Not to mention you look out the slider to a beautiful country view! It was an adorable place to stay!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Diane‚Äôs home is really beautiful and she and her husband Tom are wonderful hosts. My time in Oregon was amazing and having them host me made it even a more pleasurable experience. I recommend their home to anyone who wants to have a gorgeous scenery and a very well kept and wonderful place to live in. A warm and cozy home. This is definitely the place to beü•∞
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time staying at Diane and Tom's place - It was cozy and comfortable with a beautiful backyard. We loved their warmth and hospitality. The space had everything you would need :)
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane and Tom were the perfect hosts! They were very welcoming and accommodating, with quick communication and great advice on local activities. The space was pristinely clean and so comfortable. I loved sitting in the cozy chair and looking out the windows over the berry garden and fields and trees. This was just the idyllic retreat I needed to soothe my soul. <3"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful location and great hospitality by Diane and Tom. So relaxing and comfortable! Highly recommend it as a great get away place.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane's place is perfect. It is clean, roomy and has so many thoughtful touches! We loved having dinner on the patio with rhe beautiful view. We will definitely be staying again!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and spacious place. We enjoyed the deer visiting in the evening and the hospitality of the host. Lovely place.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely hosts, great stay :)"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tom& Diane are such great host ! They were both so welcoming and inviting. The location was perfect for us. It was the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve had so far !
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, quiet location but still conveniently close to Salem. Communication is quick and clear. Diane and Tom are wonderful hosts!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Diane and Tom were friendly and accommodating. The space is very clean and well maintained. The bed and bedding are comfortable.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,In a few words: we had a wonderful stay! Definitely choose staying here. It was perfect.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stay here whenever we visit our daughter at college. The location is quiet and beautiful while still being close to town. Clean and comfortable, great hosts!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, convenient location, nice amenities and all around just a feeling of being home away from home."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location for visiting Salem. We had a very comfortable stay at Diane‚Äôs place and appreciated her hospitality. Would definitely stay there again.!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love staying here whenever I come to town, it feels like home. Just the right amount of amenities and super clean. A little retreat that feels more country than the city of Salem."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Diane and Tom were both so wonderful and welcoming. The space they provided was clean, comfortable, and in just a perfect spot. They were both very sweet and accommodating, and not once did I feel out of place or uncomfortable!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a weekend at Diane's place while visiting our daughter who attends Corban. It was a perfect location for that purpose, right by the campus. We have stayed at various hotels in Salem, and this was so much more convenient and comfortable. The rooms were clean and quiet; the view out the windows onto a garden and wooded area, with a bit of a view of the valley, was beautiful and peaceful. The hosts were very kind and welcoming, and we enjoyed chatting with them, but they also left us alone. There were many hospitable touches such as little muffins, yogurt and juice in the fridge, paper cups by the sink, coffee and cereal available, and a water dispenser that Diane kept filled for us. The kitchenette area consists of a small fridge, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, and a few supplies. There is no kitchen sink or counters, nor freezer to speak of (although I've no doubt Diane would have put something in her freezer for us if we'd asked --- she was very accommodating). An extra table somewhere to provide more ""counter"" space would be helpful. But in general, if you are planning on eating in, keep it simple, with items that don't require a lot of prep or freezer space, and you‚Äôll do great. All in all, a very nice stay and we will definitely be back!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful Airbnb property. Nice space, great accommodations and lovely hosts. And, great value."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an absolute gem in the AirBnB world. Guests have the whole bottom floor of the house - a HUGE living area, large bedroom and large bathroom (shower, not tub). Everything is very clean and feels well cared for. As the description indicates, there is no real 'kitchen' - in particular, no sink, and you do not do dishes in the bathroom sink (the house is on septic). BUT, Diane does provide a way to have the basic dishes (glasses, plates, bowls, silverware) washed upstairs. So heating things in the microwave, or having other foods that don't require a full-on kitchen are fine. In addition to the incredible comfort, cleanliness and spaciousness of this lodging, the outdoor space is amazing - you have your own patio, with seating and fire pit, and a truly gorgeous view - a hilly oak tree savannah landscape. It's quiet, peaceful and beautiful. It's about a 10-15 minute drive to 'downtown' Salem, but there are lots of restaurants, shops etc, even closer. We had a great stay at Diane's (and Tom's), and would definitely stay again."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very attentive hosts who make sure you have everything you need but give you your space to relax. The space is exactly as listed.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My second stay was as delightful as the first. This is such a lovely spot, with a great view of the lights of Salem. The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kind and attentive host ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home is delightful in almost too many ways to list. Sparkling clean, very comfortable, lots of space. My favorite parts: the rural setting and great view of Salem; the wonderful color coordination of interior spaces (love the dark accent wall behind the TV, the painted bureau in the bedroom that plays off the color in the picture above, and small decorative pieces in the bathroom); and the very comfortable bed. Diane was very welcoming but not in the least intrusive. I wasn't expecting to find a gem like this at such a low cost, but am very happy I found Diane's wonderful place. I plan to stay here again and again -- if she isn't already booked, as I believe her place is quite popular!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was great! Diane is very commutative she said hello to us when we arrived she went over everything with us. We had a nice stay it was very quiet which sometimes that‚Äôs what you need.

Diane also had a mini continental breakfast set up for us, which was such a nice touch since we were getting back on the road for another long drive the next morning!

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Diane and Tom's place is a wonderful getaway just outside of Salem. The space was much larger than I expected and had everything need (and more) for the short time I was in town. Both Diane and Tom were incredibly welcoming and I enjoyed my interactions with them. I'll definitely look to stay here again next time I'm in town.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tom and Diane were both wonderful!
The house is conveniently located close to the city, but the tranquility and peacefulness is countryside living at its best. There is also a nice view of some city lights in the evening and if the weathers just right a beautiful sunset too!
Their home was the perfect retreat and respite I needed while spending time with my father during his recovery at Salem hospital.
Tom sent me some supportive text messages to help keep my spirits up, and Diane kept the little refrigerator well stocked and I was able to enjoy a little breakfast each morning. I really did feel spoiled and didn‚Äôt even have to do the dishes!
I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. Tom also gave me a departing gift of some rhubarb from his garden.
Thank you both for everything!
Susie"

They have a great garden too. We felt well-provider for: among plenty of other things, we were given in-season fruit, a delicious scone, and high-quality well water. The place is located at the edge of town in a beautiful, extremely quiet country environment. The final morning, we were pleasantly surprised to find that a protective kitty was lounging on our doormat at the glass door. It disappeared before we could greet it."
