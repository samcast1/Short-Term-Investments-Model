Excellent experience all around."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Lots of extra touches like the small folding table under the stairs. We learned we are not loft bedroom people but that was not the fault of the description...we are just too creaky. Good location with easy access to all parts of town. very efficient kitchen and cute! this is perfect for 1 or 2 people...when the hydrangeas bloom at the window it will be magical.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I went on a brewery tour in Centralia and this was our first time staying in a tiny house. Directions to the house were clear and it was easy to find. Although the place sits on the property with the the main home, it feels private as the entrance is facing away from the home. It was super clean and very cute, the bathroom was bigger than I expected and we had plenty of room to move around downstairs. As it was mentioned, the bedroom/loft is for sleeping not walking around. Outside of the home is another space with a few pinball machines that are free to play.
Trevor and Lisa's place is located close to shopping and restaurants. They are super communicative and we'd recommend their space if you're visiting the area."

Me, my husband and my 12-year-old daughter were in town for a tournament that my daughter's softball team was playing in at the HUB. My daughter slept in the pullout bed downstairs and my husband and I were in the loft. Everything was so clean and cozy, the drive to the HUB was short, and the neighborhood seemed quiet and peaceful. We ""oohed and ahhed"" over the pinball machines and yard flamingos. Definitely will stay here again the next time we are in town."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked this place very last minute (within 30 mins from check in) as we were driving to Oregon from Seattle. My husband and I were traveling with our 6 year old and needed a place to sleep for the night. We were so glad we booked this tiny home instead of a hotel in downtown Portland. We checked in after 9pm and the home was cute, clean, cozy, had free parking, and had so many thoughtful touches. We got Pizza Hut for dinner that was a short drive away and we bought some groceries at Safeway to make breakfast in the morning. The kitchen in the tiny home had everything we needed to cook bacon and eggs for breakfast. Bathroom had a great shower with clean white towels! There were only 2 towels when we arrived so I texted the host for another and she delivered one right away. The bed was comfy and the sofa sleeper had a topper. The portable AC was strong and kept the room cool. The pinball room was a plus and my son had a lot of fun! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

The house was easy to find because they gave excellent directions. There's a parking spot is right next to the BnB which was great for unloading groceries so we could cook dinner in the well-equipped kitchen. The loft bed was very comfortable and we didn't have any issues with the overhead clearance. Trevor and Lisa have great attention to detail and were able to provide everything a guest could possibly need."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,By Far One of the best places I’ve stayed very Quiet An Comfortable an has so much to offer in a small Package. Place was great!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny home was small but impressively well stocked. They provided all the basic conveniences you might want, which made our travels easier.

A hidden gem in a cute neighborhood became the perfect place for our family to put another check mark on our summer bucket list. Our stay happened to coincide with a heatwave but the host was thoughtful and considerate in starting the AC before we arrived. I appreciate the clear instructions, self check-in, and privacy during our stay. The pinball room was really cool and my boys also enjoyed the selection of board games and movies. We took the hosts recommendation and went to Insert Coin and had a blast! This has to be the coolest place to stay in the area, so much better than a hotel!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We visited Centralia for a wedding that was taking place in Onalaska and reached out about 2 weeks prior. We where driving from Seattle and needed to check in early to get ready for the wedding. Trevor and Lisa informed me they would let me know that day how soon I could arrive since the previous gusts didn’t need to check out till 11 and there was a cleaning time. They messaged me day of and let me know I could check in after 12. That was a life saver! So grateful. The place is cute, clean, cozy and had everything you need. They even had one of those chargers with all USB connectors. We only stayed the night but wish we could of stayed longer. The kids enjoyed the pinball room before we checked out. The pictures don’t do justice on how cute the actual place is."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Mom, son and I stayed overnight enroute to the Oregon Coast. After a long day of travel we found the Tiny Home suited all of our needs from the AC to the specialty teas and board games.

Thank you Trevor and Lisa!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our time here! The place I think exceeded the photos as the pictures didn’t do it justice to how nice it was. Spacious for two of us and have everything we needed. 10000% recommend this place

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"No detail was skipped in this tiny house to make everything work in this tiny 'stage'. From comfort, design, and even amenities, it's been well thought out, and at length. Too many little extra touches to list. We'll definitely be back.
Thanks for your wonderful little place and amazing customer service and the pinball... how could I forget that pinball room!!! This place is so cool!!!
Thanks so much,
Vinny"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a true tiny house, like you read about. Truly adorable too, with every clever modern convenience and decor. Trevor and Lisa offer a very clean and tidy lodging to their guests, and promptly respond to any inquiries. The stairs to the loft are steep, and the loft area ceiling low, but neither kept us from enjoying a good night’s rest. And then the added benefit of the fine pinball machines. So nice to share your collection with your guests. Had a great stay here and wouldn’t hesitate to stay again while visiting the area.
Mary and Art"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed at Trevor and Lisa’s place on our way to Canada. The place was furnished with cute and functional furniture and the bed was comfortable. If you are very tall watch your head upstairs! The pinball room was so fun and we had a good stay.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A darn-near new Tiny House all to ourselves, very friendly and communicative hosts — and a whole separate outbuilding with pinball machines to play!!! Seriously, why do the reviews only go up to 5 stars?"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don’t miss out on staying at Trevor and Lisa’s house! I had to spend a few days in Centralia working at the local hospital and this was the perfect place to rest and relax. The bed was super comfortable and I slept great every night. I loved walking around in the evenings and seeing all the beautiful houses in the surrounding neighborhoods. Trevor and Lisa were also super responsive and helpful when I messed up my reservation and I was able to get it rebooked quickly with their help. I highly recommend staying here!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This tiny house is adorable and feels very spacious despite being a tiny home. The flamingo theme was amazing as well! Every aspect of the house was extremely well kept with modern and brand new appliances. Trevor and Lisa provided everything we could’ve asked for and then some. We were in town for a wedding and they were even kind enough to offer an iron and ironing board. The pinball room is a blast and the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful which made for a great place to walk. Be sure to check out the Juice Box for great beer on top and live music/shows. The Centerville Cafe is fantastic for breakfast. We will definitely stay here again if we’re in Centralia or anywhere nearby! Thank you Trevor and Lisa!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Super cute place. Easy check in. Clean and comfortable. Would definitly stay again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I am able to go back to Centralia to continue the yearly activity I was there for, I will definitely attempt to book the Tiny House. It is located perfectly for whatever you want or need to do, and everything in the house is well-planned and so functional. You don't feel like you are in a tiny place. All the amenities are awesome. The loft is easy to get to and my sleep was very sound! The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. I made the mistake (sarcasm here!) of getting into the pinball room.....I was pretty hardcore at pinball in 8th grade. I am now almost 67 years old. Those machines brought back so many memories from the late 60s---It made me so happy to play these machines! You also have to dig on the flamingo farm. I sent pics to my wife and she loved it! Anyway, this is a place that I would have no hesitation returning to. Much, much better than any hotel room you may find in Centralia! Also...go to O'Blarneys about 3/4 mile away. Great food and brew."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely rent from Trevor and Lisa again. My family rented 4 different Airbnb's in Centralia for a family event and this tiny house was voted best in all categories: communication, cleanliness, amenities, comfort of bed, shower, rate and location!

Would definitely stay again when in Centralia!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny house was so perfect!! It was easy to find and cozy, clean and fun for the first two nights of our honeymoon. Easy access with self check in, parking right next to the house & everything we needed. It’s well kept and the pinball room was a fun addition to the whole experience! Trevor and Lisa sent us a few helpful messages and let us know we could park out back by the tiny house after the first night. Very comfy bed and we appreciated the stairs because so many tiny homes have ladders lol"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing hosts! Great communication, nice place and I would for sure stay there again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved this little place and would absolutely stay again. Only stayed for one night and wish we had more time to stay longer.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful tiny house! We visited Mount Rainier and Mount St Helens during our stay and the location was very good. Also the small town is nice. Trevor was a very good host and gave us some good recommendations. Would come back any time.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So fun to stay here! I recommend it after a day at Mt St Helens.
Make sure you leave time for the pinball room!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very detailed, scrupulously clean , quiet, and restful...AC was a big bonus...and the pinball was a super plus too . very clean and very easy to manuver!
Thank You!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I can't say enough great things about this spot. Downtown Centralia impressed me in general and this place is conveniently located to enjoy it. This tiny home will make you romanticize living simply and lushly. The pinball room should not be overlooked either. My husband and I would love to stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying in Trevor's tiny house. The layout feels so roomy and the bed was extremely comfortable. Even the bathroom had plenty of room. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,what a great tiny home. The pinball room was awesome!! Definitely would come back
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved this tiny space. So thoughtfully laid out to maximize the space. The bedroom loft is low, but very doable. Bed is so comfy. Kitchen has all you need. Love the rain shower in the bathroom."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very fun stay! Pinball room was a fun amenity.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cool little place, and was really fun to see how the’ve fixed up the property around this mini-home. Slept great!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super clean and quaint! Loved the pinball machines, and the host were very friendly and welcoming. We will be back again!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute tiny house to stay in! A lot of thought was put into this place to make it comfy down to the little things like having an adapter for every type of phone charger. Communication was excellent all the way through our stay. Easy to find with the directions they provide with safe parking right outside the airbnb. Easy access with the provided code. Wish we could have stayed longer than a night so we could play in the pinball room, looks like it would be a lot of fun! Great location as well! Highly suggest staying here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Place is super nice and the hosts are great
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Spectacular stay! Above and beyond.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great little place
loved our stay"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Centralia Square is a clean, cute, boutique hotel. We chose the hostel style room, knowing we would be getting in late and leaving early. It was such a great option for a one night stay! The place and the people were njce. All matched the description. The restaurant downstairs was also fantastic."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Old Centralia offers much nostalgia sweet little town
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful spot if you love historic places! The building is beautifully renovated and you can see the original charm in the entire space. Bed was very comfortable and room was clean and cute. The breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was phenomenal!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy and clean room. It was very quiet in the building, and having a way to enter after hours was accommodating. Beautiful building, very well maintained and such a fun history."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I love staying here. Right in downtown, clean and cozy, great vintage feel. I don't need fancy, just simple and timeless. This spot fills the bill!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really wonderful renovations. Peeked in at one of the ballrooms and they really did a nice job with the renovation.
Nice simple room that was clean."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My favorite please to stay in Lewis county.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome place!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at Centralia Square, four nights each time. Clean, quaint. I've only stayed in small rooms w/ shared restroom and shower facilities. It's always worked out very well. I was traveling solo. The rooms don't offer much if you're trying to get any work done. Not much room to stretch out. No desk or work chair. But the WIFI was stronger this time around. The rooms I've stayed in are on the same side of the building as the RR tracks, and trains run through pretty frequently throughout the night. But ear plugs are provided if you need. Good coffee in the lobby each morning. I'll stay again next time I'm in the area."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed the space. I came after hours and so it was a bit hard to figure out how to enter. The place is beautiful and enjoyable. The room was a bit smaller than I had thought, but got the job done. I love the feel to the 1920s so that makes sense why the room was smaller. Definitely stay again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Centralia Square was a fun spot for any history buff that wants to spend a night in the past. The whole building was beautifully restored to a 1920’s era feeling, with some modern amenities. The location was convenient to the event we were going to and had plenty of food options within walking distance. Berry Fields downstairs had a delicious breakfast menu."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here for a night while passing through for a work trip, wonderful experience! Reception was kind, quick, and informative about places and hotel features. Room was very cozy and fit the style, felt like a vintage hotel with modern amenities! The communal bathroom was clean and easily accessible, and the shower room was private with good water pressure and temperature. WiFi was good. You can hear the trains and cars passing outside, as well as other guests in the hallway but they provided earplugs if you need them! Not much else they can do and I’m a heavy sleeper so it didn’t bother me much. I didn’t stay during an event so I’m not sure how that would affect guests but they have a really good handle on things and care about their guests and the hotel. The aesthetics and decor were cool and parking was easy. Lastly, the cafe downstairs serves great breakfast for good price. Overall an awesome experience, hope to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are looking for a beautiful, unique and cozy space to stay this is for you! They perfectly capture the glory of the 1920s while blending just enough amenities from this era for you to fell right at home. The linens are divine and the shared bathroom area is very clean and accessible.
We really loved the room and all the little touches; the sinks and fixtures are stunning!
The cafe downstairs is exceptional, a must try!
Thank you so much for a wonderful experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great vintage hotel with lots of charm. The roof patio is a wonderful place to unwind.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cool building. Very comfy bed. Fair value. Would stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Has old-time charm, responsive host, and a nice terrace overlooking the park. Headed out early but the cafe looked very appealing."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was beautiful and quaint boutique hotel. Loved that it had modern amenities in such a historical place.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Centralia is not a hot bed of tourism but it is a nice small town in America. We were attending a wedding and asked if we could check in early to get dressed - the hostess was very gracious and helped us out. The the restaurant serves a great breakfast ( I like hash browns and these were the best I ever had). Very cool old hotel
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a vintage hotel with separate, shared bathroom and shower. Everything was spotless. Check in was very smooth. Very responsive host. Good bar/restaurant attached."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay - nice historic hotel across from a beautiful park - we'll definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love the vision of restoring the old building. It was really neat to stay in a place with history and charm. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. The facilities were spotless and clean.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Everything was as advertised. No issues with the shared bathroom and shower. Very clean. Beautiful old building.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The accommodations were exactly as described. I would stay there again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I've stayed here several times to visit family. It's always great!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were just passing through town and didn't get to enjoy all of the amenities that were offered but the room was great, great communication, and an overall awesome place to stay! The hotel has a very nostalgic feel for me and is very rich in history. Everything was clean and orderly, I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I decided last minute to take a weekend trip and Centralia Square seemed affordable and charming. We weren’t completely sure what to expect when we got there, but it absolutely delivered! It was very cute and we never ran into anyone in or near the shared restroom.
We had a lovely time at this charming, unique hotel!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a great place to stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The coolest thing about this place:
It's a short distance from the train station making for a memorable trip by train.
I was surprised to find the biggest pot belly stove in the world at McMenamins also a block from the train"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely hotel! Very nice staff. It was peaceful. I love the vintage charm.
Don't forget your slippers!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great walkable, convenient location. We were able to walk to dinner at a nearby restaurant and a performance at Corbet Theater in the evening and then to breakfast at another nearby restaurant in the morning. You share the bathroom and shower with the other guests, but they were very clean and had locking doors so we still had plenty of privacy. The hallways and bathroom didn’t seem to be heated so they were chilly, but our room was warm and there was an extra blanket. Comfy bed - we both slept great!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you're thinking about staying in Centralia, Centralia Square is the absolute best hotel. Their hospitality is out of this world! I've never seen better care from any other hotel. The hotel itself is very unique and a rare lifetime experience. It really transports you back in time."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Exactly what is listed! Very nice staff and location. Defiantly loud so if you’re a light sleeper I can’t recommend. Bathroom plumbing/cleaning definitely needs a bit of an upgrade though. Overall good for the price.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Boutique Hotel is perfectly located downtown Centralia. It is walking distance to eateries, bars, and shopping. The building has a lot of history and the preservation is appreciated by folks who want a chance to walk in the past.
This room is located next to the shower room and is very close to the bathroom. May not be suitable for the light sleeper, but they intuitively provide earplugs.
I will keep this place in mind for future visits to the area."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun little piece of history
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and super clean. Staff where very helpful. Loved the history and attention to detail. Bed are comfy.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing historic property with so much charm and character. Highly recommend a stay at this hotel - staff was accommodating and friendly, room was adorable, and the historic restoration was mind-boggling. Walking distance to super cute downtown and delicious breakfast spot right in the same building. Get there!"
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice accommodations, good price, very near trains which run much of the night. Hotel provides little earplugs but sleeping medication works best for some!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great room and historical building.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My stay was simple and easy. The room was clean and accurately described. Self check-in was super easy.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay! Beautiful hotel!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a charming hotel! If you appreciate authentic historic, with all its quirks, you'll love this wonderful 1920's hotel. It has a perfect blend of modern conveniences (air conditioning, wi-fi) with old fashioned (old wood floors, separate hot and cold taps, funky light switches). They have a lovely terrace that looks out on a central square park. I can't wait to stay there again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A little gem! Centralia was a fun, safe, clean, and exceptionally quaint stay for my partner and I during a 1 night overnight to breakup a long drive. We stayed in a room without a toilet or shower and had no issues at all. The room was clean and had very comfortable bedding. There was a powerful AC unit and a beautiful big window. This boutique hotel is unique and a great stay! There are also two highly rated restaurants attached to the building so everything was really convenient."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is my 4th stay here as I have family living in the area. I so appreciate this place as it is in my budget. The rooms are extremely comfy and the staff is very helpful. Their smallest rooms only have a sink you have to go down the hall to shower and use the toilet. They're very up front about it. That being said, they provide you a bathrobe to walk down the hall in and everything has always been clean every time I've stayed here. I also have never had to wait to use the facilities and I rarely have seen anyone. For being an old building the rooms are very comfortable temperature wise. Each room has it's own thermostat. I stayed here in super hot weather last summer and the room was perfectly cool. I totally recommend this place!! There are also fun restaurants and shops within walking distance. I plan to keep staying here when i visit!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A must stay if you enjoy history. Lots of old charm and pictures.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great hotel! Noise was light during our stay but the amenities provided were more than enough for a comfortable stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great vintage place to stay. Hosts were great.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Very walkable to the historic downtown. We really enjoyed the local businesses!
There’s a restaurant on the first floor with excellent food! Great value and a beautiful place!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You can expect to feel comfortable and cared for. Historic luxury at an affordable rate!!! Sharing the bathroom shower was a non issue and I never needed the earplugs provided. Very clean.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You can expected a clean, comfortable, cozy, and safe location to relax, unwind, and rest….."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a pleasant stay. As other reviewers mention, and the hosts warned me, it can be loud. There was a wedding on site the night we stayed, but the hosts kindly provide ear plugs. I put some white noise on my phone and had no issue going to sleep while the party roared on downstairs."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My partner and I enjoyed our stay at Centralia Square! We really appreciated its historical character and proximity to downtown. We’d stay again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fun piece of history to stay at! Sharing a restroom and shower was not bad at all. There was no waiting. Would definitely stay here again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I was unable to stay at Centralia Square due to getting sick the day that I was supposed to check in. I let them know and they were super understanding and gracious about it. I'm giving them 5 stars based on their communication and service. I feel to take any stars away from any categories that I wasn't able to actually experience, such as cleanliness, accuracy, location, etc, would do a disservice to their communication and understanding of my situation. I will definitely keep them in mind for my next trip."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Amazing value, always clean and great communication. I have stayed here multiple times on my travels for work and will continue to do so."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We booked a room not knowing what to expect with a shared bathroom. The hotel was quiet and the bathrooms were close so we did not mind. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. I will stay there again.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will stay here again! A lovely retreat while visiting my family during a difficult time. The history of the property is worth your time. This room is exactly as described. A very spacious room with a sink, mirror and conveniently located outlet. The large closet held my luggage and other items, so they were out of the way. I really appreciated the cozy robe and excellent towels. Sheets on the bed were soft, and an extra blanket was available. The in-room air conditioner kept me comfortable. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Halls were quiet and calm regardless of the shared bath and shower. The shower room was right-sized with a handy bench. I live in an urban area so the trains did not disturb me, but ear plugs were available for use. I highly recommend a stay at Centralia Square. And, while there check out the Berry Cafe conveniently located on the main level."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great value and friendly staff
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice clean room and friendly staff. Great value.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A small individual room with a sink and closet. Shared bathroom and shower room. It was clean and accommodating, really enjoyed my stay!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so cute! A great place to unwind. We went to mcmenamins a few blocks down for dinner and that was awesome as well. In the morning, the antique mall was a cute place to look at."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you like trains, you'll be very happy. Otherwise quiet and relaxing."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Fine place for a stop over. The room was much smaller than it looked in pictures but it was okay for a night. The stalls in the shared bathroom are extremely small- like bang your knees on the door type small. Found myself wishing there had been more evidence of extra cleaning in a shared space like that. AC and Wifi worked well.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful place to stay in that offers such a unique accommodation experience
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a random stopover for my partner and I and it was such an awesome experience. We loved all the unique historic touches but felt the comfort of modern amenities (like A/C which is a treat for us!). The staff is kind enough to provide earplugs because it does get a bit noisy, but for a Saturday night, we had no problem and other guests in the hotel were quiet as well. You can tell a lot of work was put into this place and the staff was so kind as well."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I found this little hotel to be completely charming. First of all you can’t beat the price for a clean and well-appointed room. The front desk staff were super friendly and accommodating. My room had a lovely view of the hillside (I did have to overlook the neon auto parts sign below -easy enough). Yes there is a nearby train but I routinely use earplugs so it wasn’t a big issue. I think it woke me twice but not in an alarming way, more like an “oh yes, that’s the train” way. Worse than the train, for me, was the too-intense laundry soap smell on the sheets.
The shared bathroom was never occupied when I went in, and other guests were very quiet.
In all, the place is charming, clean, and it suit my needs.I will definitely stay here again when I’m in the area."
2021-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,the area was a very nice area for a hotel botique
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming and elegant vintage appeal in a centrally located spot. I loved staying here. Super friendly staff and delicious food options.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nicely renovated place to stay, that has a lot of history to share and experience. You need to understand what to expect when staying here. The halls can be noisy when loud people and kids come through. The management does their best with the signs and carpet runners. It is all part of the nuisance of the place, which is very much appreciated and valued at the Square. Nice Terrace and view to the park across the street on one side.
The ball room is beautiful and well appointed. Very impressive place to rent for events and get togethers , great potential.
The shower and restroom down the hall is just fine, bring your foot wear and enjoy the privacy once in the facilities. I did not see anyone else use the bathroom or shower. Bed was comfortable and the street noise was nothing bad. Train is soothing to me and did not even notice it. I did not need the ear plugs they offer. Its an old place with creaks and squeaks on the stairs and floors through out the place.
Nice bar attached and the staff at the hotel are all very nice it seems.
I look forward to my next stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to stay, very clean, felt safe. Convenient location. Restaurant downstairs with good food. No TV but there is WiFi. Room was small but bed was very comfortable. I would stay here again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent location within walking distance of several antique shops and restaurants. Gorgeous historical building. Great weekend getaway!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Centralia square has been beautifully remodeled. Would stay again
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely perfect location and an amazing place, beautifully restored. Great communication and an easy check in process."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,pretty sure its haunted!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room was perfect for what I needed. The train was my only complaint and I didn't wear the earplugs out of stubbornness, so that was my fault. The staff were so friendly. I really liked the soft large robe! I don't know if there were other guests, as I didn't hear anyone but me.
I actually booked next week already!!!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would not stay anywhere else the best!!!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent location in downtown Chehalis. The staff is very welcoming and kind. Clean, quite, and comfortable. Berry Fields restaurant downstairs is delicious and so convenient and now open later until 7pm.- Perfect to order dinner to take to your room."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect!
2020-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value and love the historic aspect of this hotel. Not overly crazy about sharing a bathroom, but there was never a conflict with other guests and you cannot beat the price. Chari was wonderfully accommodating."
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, no frills Euro style room (shared bathroom) in a beautiful old building walking distance to everything downtown. We enjoyed our stay, especially the cold AC :) Great service and responsiveness from our host and solid dining options in the building. I would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed staying here. It was relaxing and most places are within walking distance, like Mcmenamin's etc. There are a few things to consider: there is a shared restroom and shower, train noise, and cruising on Saturday nights. Overall it was worth it. I hope the rest of the restoration goes well."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best hotel experience in the area
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean rooms. I had a unit with the bathroom down the hall and the facilities were always spotless, plus there was a great shower."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Centralia Square was a wonderful place to stay the night. Classic European charm.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another pleasant night's stay at Centralia Square. A major reason I choose this place is that it is not a cookie cutter motel. Built about a hundred years ago but updated. Don't expect a TV but the wireless is great. High cleanliness standard and comfortable bed. Great value.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a really cool place to stay. Great value. It has been updated tastefully and is not haunted. Would highly recommend to anyone.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed for one-night on a west coast road trip. Perfect stay! Great value. Good location with plenty of nearby food options available and close to the highway. On-site restaurant and Antique Mall downstairs!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a good place for cheap
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Great location, value and friendly and helpful staff."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This truly was a wonderful place to stay. Right downtown, close to cafes and all the great Antique shops. Very clean and well maintained. They did a lovely job maintaining the vintage feel as if you'd just stepped into a 1930's movie."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I love the location in downtown Centralia. The staff was incredible. I was late checking in and the host was so kind and pleasant. Check in was super easy. The bed is very comfortable!!
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Good place in a charming historic building, in the center of town."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Good value, surprisingly quiet and good location."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I did not stay here personally, I booked this hotel for my cousin who was participating in my wedding. She reported that her stay was pleasant! Would recommend to a friend looking for an affordable and comfortable place to stay."
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Nice place with bars and restaurants all around.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful experience. The room is small but it's all a couple needs. The access to the terrace for having our own breakfast and dinner was awesome. There is a bit of noise from your neighbors if they are inconsiderate, but it was never a problem for sleeping. Everything was sparkling clean. We wished wifi reached the terrace and also suggested the closet have a rod instead of hooks - minor inconveniences."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely recommend staying here
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a splendid adventure weekend exploring Centralia and this charming historic boutique hotel is at the center of it all! I spent a long holiday weekend here and loved everything about it. It inspired me to write, read, relax and transcend to another place in time. Some nights I felt like I had the place all to myself. On Saturday there were two events and the whole place came alive with music and festivities. A truly unique offering that I will definitely be making my way back to soon!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a unique place to stay and inexpensive. It was fun to stay in one of the three rooms our family reserved.
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"At first, I thought the bathroom/shower situation would not be ideal, but it turned out to be just fine. This place is definitely the best bang for your buck!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely the best value in the business! Wonderful location, close to the main drag with all the restaurants, bars, and theatre."
2019-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay.
2019-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Very much a historical hotel, smells and all. Very close to the train trucks, with multiple passing trains several times a night. Wondering if a free breakfast would make the place a little more appealing. I probably wouldn’t recommend this place again. It’s a little creepy."
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A true historically significant location. Great touches and two wonderful restaurants on site for morning and evening meals. The hotel is kept very clean, love the monogram towels! Wonderful location for events."
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,If you love some history it is a great step into the past. Outstanding location and hospitality. Two of the beat restaurants in town right in the building!
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are into old art 1920's style decor, def check this place out! Staff was super friendly!!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great price, quirky atmosphere, cool building. A fun place to stay in Centralia!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Fun vintage building right in the best part of Centrailia. Super cool!
2018-08-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"If you are a history or architecture buff you will love this old timey hotel. If you are attending an event at the Ballroom there you might like to sleep over too. However if you think hotel and imagine a nice room with a bathroom, TV, fridge, microwave and maybe even coffeemaker you will be disappointed like I was. Up many flights of steps you will get a comfortable bed, a sink and a chair. Like those eat it and beat it diners this is a go to sleep get up and go type of hotel with no frills whatsoever. And the $15 cleaning fee seemed oddly tacked on."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great old world hotel. Transport yourself to an era long gone. Love cool old places and this hotel is one. Would stay again.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming hotel and town!
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Centralia Square Hotel is much like McMenamin's nearby but a block further from the train tracks, which is important knowledge in that the trains roll through Centralia in the middle of the night. I slept better here than at Olympic Club. Another perk: Amazing A/C. The Pac NW doesn't get hot but so many weeks of the year, but it was 91 the day I stayed here and I was very glad the room was nice and cool when I arrived. The room was spotless, I got in late and left before breakfast, so no experience of those options."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was attending a conference at the great wolf lodge but decided to go with this more affordable option and I couldn't be happier with my decision! The great wolf was only a 15 minute drive away and my stay in centralia afforded me many more dining and drinking options! The hotel is in a wonderful location in the heart of downtown centralia. Parking was a breeze every day. The hotel itself was very quiet and peaceful but there is a train track nearby and trains come by frequently if you are a light sleeper. The hotel did provide ear plugs to combat that noise, however. The room is basic with just a sink. You will have to shower and use the restroom down the hall, but this room is conveniently right next door to both. Both the toilets and the shower were always clean and I never had to compete for the shower in the morning. They provide robes which was handy when getting from the shower back to the room. This is a great place to stay off you want to unplug and enjoy other things in life (no tv in the room). I particularly enjoyed the wonderful terrace where I read my book and sipped some wine one night and ate my dinner the next. I would absolutely stay again and recommend!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"wonderful stay, like taking a step back in time! The only thing to be aware of is that the train tracks are a block and a half away, but ear plugs are provided, and I never really noticed them during the night. :)"
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a charming hotel with a cute cafe and antique mall in the same building! Everyone we encountered were friendly and helpful. Note that there are shared bathrooms (which did not bother us - but still good to know) and the train can be heard from the hotel.
We would definitely come stay again if we find ourselves in Centralia in the future."
2018-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We loved our stay and the 5 star dining at The Branch Cafe. Exploring the antique stores was great fun
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic Historical Hotel! The hosts were very responsive with communication and the check in couldn’t have been easier. We were even able to have an early check in. The bed in our room was very comfortable and the sheets extremely soft. The room also had an individually controlled ductless heating and AC unit with user guide inside room. The shared bathroom and shower were in separate rooms, so no wait in the morning. Call me an old soul but it is refreshing to have the simpler life style when enjoying the architectural marvels of the past. Would definitely stay here again!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful old hotel with clean room and friendly check in. I’m not sure how many other guests were there but my room was really quiet except for the trains-which they provided earplugs for! My room was spacious, the bed was comfortable.On the first floor is an old style diner with the most amazing looking desserts. The breakfast there was delicious."
2017-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location in downtown. Room was clean and the shared bathrooms were too
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Funky rooms and super comfy bed 👍
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"You have to make sure you understand the bathrooms and showers are shared, I loved it! Great place. Only downfall is all the trains..."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful historic building. The rooms are really, really clean. The breakfast is NOT included with the room lol but the room was a fair price so no complaints. Great location and a good experience staying in a bit of history :) Thank You"
2017-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,This is a very good bargain if you are in the area. I was so happy to find this Historic Gem right in the middle of town. Friendly staff and comfortable rooms.
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay! The room was as expected and the sheets/towels all smelled amazing! We loved hearing about the history of the building!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a wonderful place to stay! We really liked all the windows at the cabin, you can easily enjoy the scene of forest no matter where you are (even at the bathroom!). It was also great to read “the cabin’s story” in the guest book, it’s very interesting to see how the place connects to the local community.
Looking forward to stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Staying in Janet’s cabin was perfect, exactly what we needed! It was so peaceful, clean, and the perfect amount of space for two. Thank you for sharing your amazing cabin. We will definitely be back to stay next time we are in the area."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were looking for a tree house but the this cabin gave us amazing time which we were completely unexpecting. We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary and beautiful star gazing from the upper deck of the cabin left us in awe. We extend our thanks to Janet and Christian for letting us stay and making our special day even more memorable with their incredible creation of THE CABIN. ❤️
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Most incredible little cabin I’ve ever seen. Highly recommend, it’s beautiful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gosh - I can't say enough good about this place! The hosts went above and beyond to make us feel so welcome! I let her know it would be late in evening when we arrived and she strung lights along the walking path to guide our way! I'll stay here again someday - Wonderful experience!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wish we had more time to walk around on the trails surrounding the cabin. Will definitely come back and stay again. Loved the sketch book that guests have shared about their stay. Janet was so kind to let us check in early. Lovely memory
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was an amazing experience. I had last minute plans change due to car troubles and was able to book and stay within an hour! This is a great little cabin with lots of space. Extremely peaceful! I saw a dear on my morning hike in the woods!
This prairie North Dakota girl was pleased!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a lovely cozy cabin retreat! Just being there in the quiet, breathing in the fresh forest scent, listening to the birds sing, was so refreshing. We felt a million miles away though just 10 minutes from town. Others noted the few steps outside down to the spa-like bathroom and the ladder up to the loft bed— both touches made this a delightful place to stay. I loved gazing out the window from the loft bed at the bright stars. I loved stepping out of the bathroom to the balcony surrounded by trees. Thank you Janet and Christian for sharing your beautifully crafted cabin with us."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,So peaceful and beautiful scenery! Janet was a lovely host and very responsive. Would love to come again!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location to unwind . No wifi and no tv is a nice perk to disconnect.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Whole new experience and great place to stay!!!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time visiting this beautiful location. I ended up having car issues and not being able to leave. The hosts towed me back to my house and really made me feel like I was family. I will be back several more times. Thank you for having me.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great cozy place; the path with the lights to a peaceful spot nestled in the trees. We were lucky that the clouds had cleared for some stargazing. Would absolutely recommend for a place to go to escape the hustle and bustle.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My friend and I booked this place for a little getaway from the city and LOVED it ! Janet and her husband were very friendly and kind. It truly was so beautiful from the drive in to THE BATHROOM ! My friend and I are in love with this airbnb.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for sharing your space with us! We loved it and will keep this place in mind next time we want a weekend without the kiddo!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful location and view. Felt like being in the middle of a fairytale. Would highly recommend for a peaceful getaway.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and very whimsical, loved the area and how quiet it was! The hosts are very friendly and make you feel at home 🩵"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Incredibly peaceful weekend staying in this cabin. Could have laid in bed all day just listening to the rain on the tin roof.
Note: More bed pillows have been added, so no need to bring your own, as other reviewers have mentioned."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing stay, straight out of a fairytale.
Thank you to the owners for this amazing last minute stay!!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place seemed like it was straight out of a travel magazine, it was a wonderful stay and centrally located.
Some things to note: the bed is in a loft, which is up a ladder. I could see it being precarious for older or larger folks.
Bring your own pillows- we read the reviews that said this and we’re glad we did. The bed and pillows were comfy but we used the extra pillows to cover the two windows that are next to the bed. It was a moonlit night and made the bed very bright.
Other than those things, it was marvelous. And the host was very accommodating. We will definitely be coming back."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This has to be one of our new favorite getaway spots!! Janet and her husband were very friendly and the cabin was breathtaking! My husband and I couldn't get over how peaceful and perfect the cabin was. There are tons of beautiful trails to explore. The loft bed, accessible by a rolling ladder (nice that we could slide it to the side when we didn't need the loft) was beyond soft and we slept amazing. We knew there was no stove so we prepared for microwave cooking, no big deal at all. The deck overlooking the trails below was fun to read a book on while listening to nuthatches talk amongst the branches. The bathroom is a character itself when it greets you with a fresh cedar scent that comes from the shower planks, instantly added some luxury. The 400' walk to the cabin was lovely, lit by little lights. We seriously felt so relaxed and rested after our one night stay. We will be returning in the future, guaranteed!! Book this place if you find an opening, you won't regret it."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing! We will be back!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Worth every penny!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,As always loved being there.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome as it always is. Loved my stay. Can’t wait until the next trip!
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great location,last minute getaway from Kent.Same exit as Centralia outlet,so of course we did a little shopping & had lunch @Country Cousin before checking in at 3p.The location is easy to get to.The trail from the parking spot to the cabin can feel long when carrying baggage,but super nice when empty handed.
CABIN.The exterior & interior of cabin looks just like the pictures. It is super important to note,which isn’t stated on the Airbnb description, is that you have to walk outside to use the bathroom downstairs. The walk isn’t bad,but would total suck in the rain.The bathroom is nice, almost spa like & smells “piney”.For those staying a long period of time, you would have to pre-plan meals.I did note the appliances @ the cabin,so I brought my butan stove&pan.We were able to cook steak,salmon & potatoes.The bed was comfy. My husband was glad we brought our own pillows as someone suggested in the reviews.Also,maybe add a coat hook.
LOVED OUR STAY"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 Amazing! I was looking for a romantic, secluded cabin for an anniversary weekend. Upon arrival, Janet kindly offered a cart for our luggage. We arrived at sundown and the 1min trail walk to the cabin was lit by string lights. Microwave, toaster, and crockpot is offered so plan your meals. We enjoyed breakfast on the deck, and stargazing at night (even heard some coyotes!) There are tons of deer throughout the area too. The cabin has a comfy couch and blankets, a table perfect for two and playing board games/cards :) The bed is nice but I would bring your own pillows; The bathroom smells amazing (pine) and feels almost like a spa. We spent some time walking through the trails and exploring. Tip: Shoes left outside the cabin helps keep it clean! Connecting with nature was so healing. Reading through the ""Cabin Comments"" and seeing everyone's stories was so fun. This experience changed our lives and we can't wait to return! Thank you for sharing this space with us! Love from PDX!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was one of the coolest little places I've ever been to. The property is amazingly beautiful and peaceful. The host was extremely friendly and accommodating and the price was very reasonable. The bathroom was awesome; it was huge and very warm! Great experience!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything we wanted and more. The cabin was beautiful and perfect for our quick over night stay!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot recommend this stay enough! Not only were the hosts so friendly and personable, they were also very flexible with a work snafu I had that came up requiring a last minute change to my reservations that was much appreciated. I can tell they are hard working people who just want to make a lovely stay for their guests. The place itself was great and just what I needed to relax. It was very private and in a safe area in the middle of a tree farm and the bed was so comfy. There are plenty of heating and cooling options so temp was always perfect. Small, but everything you need for one-two people comfortably. Do keep in mind to go to the bathroom (an oasis, and it smells so good, like real trees) you must first go outside and downstairs to access it, and also the only way to the bed is through a ladder leading to the loft. Worth it, but something to note I’d you decide to stay in case you struggling with frequent stairs/climbing."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a gorgeous little cabin in the woods! We couldn’t believe we paid so little for such a fairytale lodging. Our host was kind and welcoming and it’s easy to recommend them to anybody.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our second time here, as always Janet is a great host and the property is so quiet and peaceful for a weekend getaway."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin was amazing! And Janet was so wonderful, she more than willingly allowed me to decorate it to surprise my brother for his wedding night. She was super helpful and kind. It is a beautiful and clean place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet cabin. Beautiful woods to walk around!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing a great getaway from life.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my 2nd time staying at the little cabin, it’s my favorite Airbnb I’ve booked. It’s secluded in the woods, cozy and has so many trails to explore! Will definitely be coming back again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It really was a magical place! Janet and Christian were the kindest folks, and the little cabin was just perfect. My partner and I had an amazing time there, just what we needed to unwind and smell the trees, hear the rain, sleep in. I actually really enjoyed the bathroom being where it was; it gives you a little privacy that's unexpected in such close quarters. The bathroom was super comfortable and roomy, and the little deck off the back was delightful. I seldom repeat bookings but I think we will come back to this sweet little cabin!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such an amazing stay. I will definitely be going back anytime I need to get away from the buzz of the city
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice space!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot! The hosts were super helpful and turned on the lights so it was easy for us to find the path when we arrived late in the evening. The cabin is very private and quiet. We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Best kept secret in Washington. Very Magical and surreal. Super relax,calm, and peaceful place. Janet is the best! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hands down one of the best places I've ever stayed. I chatted with Christian on my arrival and departure and he was kind, funny, knowledgeable, and really down to earth which made it feel really homey. Other than that, I experienced solitude during my stay, which is what I wanted. Highly recommend Janet and Christian's cabin if you need a break from the world to be alone in nature. It's the perfect place :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is a fabulous cabin in the woods. It is quite clean peaceful and the hosts are great!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most coziest tiny cabin I ever stayed in, filled with wildlife to enjoy. Parking was easy to find and we were well accommodated by the host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet and Christian were wonderful hosts. I mentioned we were there for the meteor shower and when we arrived they had housed their livestock and placed comfortable outdoor chairs in the pasture for us to watch the sky! So thoughtful! The cabin in the forest was a delightful cozy tiny house and the pictures accurately portrayed that. There is a lovely back porch for reading and coffee sipping in the morning. Centralia has a lot of fun activities too. We visited the barcade Insert Coin and the toy store Let’s Play Something. O’blarney’s was great if you like sports pubs.
The Cabin In the Forest is a great place if you are seeking a private stop in the woods or some fun activities in town. It’s perfect if you’re seeking both!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janets cabin was a wonderful place to stay for 2! So comfortable and beautiful! She and her husband were very friendly, the cabin was very clean, the view from the porch was peaceful, and the bed was very comfortable!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a sweet experience-- the cabin is cozy and welcoming, and the surrounding forest and walking trails were such a peaceful addition to fill out my short, solitary stay. Hosts were very sweet and helpful. A beautiful spot!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janet was a friendly responsive host in her place was amazing! I would definitely go back there completely unplug and relax
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Janet and Christian are such lovely people! Their land is beautiful and the cabin is private off to the side down a short path. We loved the bathroom and style of cozy through out the whole cabin. The greenery is gorgeous! We had a rainy day during our stay and it was the patio being covered that made for a relaxing morning with coffee. Recommend going to Judy’s for breakfast. Taking a day to see Mount Rainier and hike. Would stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great time in this lovely cabin in the forest , thank you Janet & Christian !"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was awesome!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janet's cabin in the woods and was as expected. I stayed here one night for the STP ride and was worth the stay for a soft bed and shower post day one of the STP.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome magical place. I really enjoyed the the space they created. Looking forward to book another stay when the dates a available. Truely a Washington secret.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed one night at the little cabin in the forest and absolutely loved it! So peaceful and cozy. Highly recommend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for sharing your beautiful wood cabin and green woods trails. I slept wonderfully and enjoyed the birdsong.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A magical cabin in the forest. Peaceful, cozy, cabin in the forest. Lit short walkway thru the enchanted forest to the cabin. This is as close to camping as I expect to get. Great get away from it all."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Magical place to visit, really relaxing and calm atmosphere. Janet and Christian created something truly amazing and special. I love this place a lot it really gave me a true magical Washington experience."

We will most definitely be returning and recommending to all our friends. Thank you for such a peaceful, private and perfect getaway!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! If you’re thinking of booking it, just stop thinking and do it! The little cabin itself is beautifully built and decorated. The bathroom is on the lower level, you have to go outside to reach it but it’s not a problem, and there is another deck area down there to enjoy the beautiful surroundings! Speaking of which, the area is gorgeous!There are several trails you can take blissful walks through and even pretend to be in a Jane Austen novel (seriously I wish I would’ve brought a flowery flowing dress). There are daisies all over that make the place so picturesque (again a good opportunity for a Jane Austen moment). Janet and her husband were a delight, very welcoming when we arrived but then left us to do our thing which we appreciated. They did mention some people can’t believe how dark it gets but come on you’re in the middle of a tree farm close to a small town. I myself found it to be exactly what I needed. No wifi, no tv, no cell signal. A true getaway."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you looking for a ""living in the forest experience"" this is perfect house for you."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Definitely recommend, peaceful!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This secluded, peaceful slice of serenity in the woods was absolutely magical! There was a lot of care and love put into this space, and I especially loved the lighting choices. It was very private and peaceful. My partner and I wished we had planned to spend more time hanging out there because it was sublime. We would definitely book it again. Absolutely perfect for a romantic getaway."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a peaceful place! The cabin was cozy and warm. The various trails were great to explore. Only stayed one night but it was a much needed reset!!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to stay! We especially enjoyed exploring the paths through the trees. Such bouncy, rarely-trodden soil! We saw some great birds too. A very unique and fun experience with great hosts."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful little cabin, with thought put into every piece of decor, and a lovely bathroom setup. It’s nestled in the woods away from the main house and feels both private and fairytale-esque. I stayed there alone and only when night fell did I notice that there are many windows with no curtains and got a little spooked. 😅 But aside from my own paranoia it was a very peaceful weekend away!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,was an excellent get awayespecially gor the price 10/10 wuld recommended!

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous and secluded for and outdoor lover like myself.
I booked it as a place to sleep while visiting family but next time it will be the event. You can see and feel the love put into the cabin, trails and lands around it.
I saw deer, rabbits, racoons and an owl while there. The sounds of the forest both morning and night were awesome."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had an absolute blast and everything was perfect :)
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I love finding random cabins and tiny homes in the woods for getaways, since we live close to cities. This was the perfect spot for a lovely Valentine's overnight. The cabin is beautiful and you have to walk through the woods on a lovely lighted path in order to get to it, the stargazing was second to none, and we just hung out and ""balconized"" as we put it. You don't need internet, they provided plenty of thoughtful touches like joke books and a cribbage board which is actually one of our favorite board games. Thank you for a peaceful retreat!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay, so cozy and peaceful. We can't wait to go back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was exactly what myself and my girlfriend were looking for for a local night away. This is a perfect spot, just a short walk from the parking area, surrounded by trees and completely private. The cabin was very cozy and warm, furnished with all one would need for days away to disconnect from the hussle and bustle of a busy life. And the bathroom on the bottom floor was our of this world, clean and spacious! For the price this is nicer than any hotel you will ever stay in. Lastly, I really felt the love that went into creating this tiny cabin along with the love of sharing the experience of the cabin. Janet has made sure if you have forgotten anything one could need that its already in the cabin. I will for sure be having more getaways to this little gem!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is magical. An hour and a half from the city, a short drive for a wonderful, serene getaway.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely spot. Check in couldn't have been easier. Location was beautiful, in the middle of the forest. I enjoyed the patio chairs to sit and watch the wildlife. Cute and cozy. Many small joyful details. Not much to do in Centralia but a wonderful spot to stay when passing through."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a quiet place in the woods. The forest is so thick, and the trails are well maintained if you want to take one of them.
The couple that runs this are the kindest people and you can talk to them about anything.
You will not be disappointed here if you are looking for peace."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My spouse and I went on a little weekend getaway before the birth of our first kid. All we wanted was some peace and quiet and a real cabin feel. This place exceeded our expectations. Janet and Christian were so nice and welcoming, the walk down to the cabin was so cute, the cabin itself was warm and so cozy, and it was the most quiet place I’ve ever been. The bathroom smelled lovely with all the natural cedar, like walking into a warm sauna. We could not have asked for a more perfect weekend and hope to be back soon! Mahalo Janet and Christian!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved this cabin!! Very cozy in a beautiful setting, and the hosts were super friendly and helpful."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a magical and fun spot in the middle of a forest, only 10 minutes from the convenience of all that is Centralia and Chehelis. From the walk down the wooded lane between the fairy lights, to climbing the ladder to the bed loft, I felt like a kid again. It's clearly been created with love and care, and it feels like sneaking away from, you know, everything."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peaceful, clean, and a wonderful affordable place to get unplugged with your loved one. We also appreciated how comfortable the bed was, as well as the AC and heating option."

Amazing trails all around the property, beautiful and calming woods, amazing little home that is super clean and accommodating. If you need decompression, this is the spot. Janet and Christian were super kind and sweet. Just book it already!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Janet’s cabin was very peaceful and secluded. The bed was comfortable and it was lovely to sit outside on the balcony for morning coffee. We stayed during a hot day and the air conditioning kept the cabin comfortable. Janet was very accommodating to us having a late check-in. The bathroom is located on the first floor/basement of the cabin and you do need to walk outside the cabin to access it.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Awesome cabin!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had a great stay. The cabin is nestled in the middle of the woods so it feels very private and there are several walking trails around the cabin as well. We were worried that it might get a little warm but the AC in the cabin helped us stay very cool! The only downside is that there are A LOT of bugs outside (huge flies and moths) which is of course out of the hosts’ control so be sure to bring some bug spray.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing!! Such a beautiful place. We loved the seclusion.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin away from the city. Love the privacy and the little trail system for walking around. Janet and Christian were friendly and communicative. We loved our stay and we're wanting to book a stay again soon.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was the perfect place for a weekend getaway for my husband and I. The bed is quite comfortable, the kitchen and living area feel so spacious. The shower is really big, with a lovely rain shower head, and they provide lots of fluffy towels. The trails in woods are so beautiful and peaceful, and we were able to get some cell signal just down one of the trails so we could make a phone call. We loved the opportunity to be totally disconnected otherwise."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Janet and Christian's place---the photos don't do it justice. The cabin is a short walk from the parking spot, down a beautiful wooded trail (well-lit with string lights). The room itself is quite cozy, and the windows have beautiful views of the surrounding forest. Furthermore, Janet and Christian were wonderful, communicative hosts. We really enjoyed our stay, and look forward to coming back soon!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place out of the way in the forest, still close enough to town that you can step out for some food or shopping.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet’s amazing cabin is likely the best Airbnb I’ve stayed it. Amazing living space, gorgeous bathroom, and wonderful people. Couldn’t ask for a better space or host!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely, quiet, and peaceful little cabin! It was perfect for my husband and I for a little getaway.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A sweet, cozy little getaway from the city. Well worth the drive up from Portland, even just for a night. The walk to the cabin through the forest is magical. We already want to go back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tranquil, small, cozy, comfortable, quiet, private, secluded… all the words one wants to hear when overwhelmed by the bustle and noise of everyday life. This little cabin is a welcome step back into time with beauty, functionality and simplicity at its best. The forest is as far as the eye can see in any direction, the birds are right at arms length & the back patio offers a view of it all jutting out over a small meadow of tall grass & ferns - it gives the eyes a place to wander between the dense stands of evergreens & conifers. The loft bed was lovely and the ladder made me smile and think of younger years and tree houses. We left a drawing and note in the guest book alongside other blessed discoverers & cannot wait to return again."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a magical time in Janet's cabin this weekend! The cabin is so so so cute and beautifully constructed - it's obvious there was a lot of love and thought put in to creating the space for guests. The little details, like sliding the ladder to get to the loft which was fun haha or seeing an extra toothbrush in the bathroom in case anyone forgot, really made the experience unique and wonderful. Don't hesitate on this place! Also pro-tip! If the bathroom feels too chilly when you go to take a shower, there's a little heater next to the toilet you could turn on for a bit to heat the space to your liking :). Thanks again for the stay Janet!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay!! Lovely cabin, my husband and I had such a relaxing stay. We really enjoyed the little trails by the house, as well as a cup of tea on the porch while watching the sunrise. Definitely recommend staying here!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Janet and her husband were absolutely lovely hosts. The little cabin is hidden in a beautiful forest with the most magical walking trail. This place feels a world away from the city lights. Unwind among the trees and listen to raindrops over a board game or glass of wine and snuggle up in an extremely comfy, cozy and romantic loft bed .This place was exactly what our mind and body needed. No internet, no work stress, no outside world. I am definitely coming back for a longer vacation. "
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem. This space is sweet, cozy and quiet. It’s a great way to turn off the phone and Tv and reconnect with nature. The bed is super comfy. come prepared to not cook but has all the things needed to fix small bites. Plus Janet and Christian are some of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. I’ll be going back for sure"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute treasure. I read the reviews saying that the photos don't do it justice - that's the truth. Our trip was peaceful, surrounded by big trees and not another human in sight. I have never been more obsessed with a bathroom - the cedar is so fragrant, I could have slept in there. The bed was comfy and we had so much fun. Would love to return someday."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely 100% recommend this stay! Arriving to the cabin was very simple with signs and lights guiding the way!

I hope to return soon and explore the hiking trails for summer meditation with the trees."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Magical. Peaceful. Clearing of the mind. Breathtaking- And just a wonderful get away place. The mini cabin was truly built so perfect and so cute. The ONE heater made it nice and cozy. The dog jokes book was a hoot. The balcony truly lets your mind open up and just wander. I truly wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want a get away - You MUST take a light stroll as well in the night to see the light up string pathway back to your vehicle because it’s truly magical! Thank you so much Janet and Christian!

There is a ladder to the loft that was a little wobbly but we were able to get up and down from the bed pretty easily. The bathroom isn't on the main floor, but everything was very clean and cozy."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Don't have much to say that hasn't already been said in other reviews. Nice private cabin in the woods with everything you need and nothing that you don't. Hosts were great to talk to and even got to swap some work stories with Christian since we work in similar industries. The cedar bathroom does smell as nice as everyone else has said in their reviews.
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Really cute cabin - perfect getaway for a weekend. Cabin was clean and there were enough heaters to keep us warm on a cold night

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is an absolute gem, a cozy, secluded getaway. The perfect location for the solo escape i was looking for. Quiet, warm, and sprinkled with inexplicable magic. You can feel the love and attention put into this tiny cabin, made of lumber from the property and salvaged from somewhere nearby. Pack some slip ons for the trip to the bathroom just down the stairs and prepare to have the sweetest night and a blissful sleep on the dreamy foam mattress. A wander through the property is highly recommended!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A beautiful cabin on a tree farm. Cabin had great amenities too! You have to go outside to get to the bathroom but it's a very nice bathroom.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a little GEM!
You feel like you're deep in the woods, but you're close to town. I was in town for a conference so didn't get as much time to relax and enjoy the trees as much as I'd have liked, but this sweet spot sure helped me relax after a long day of meetings."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Adorable place. So peaceful and very unique. Would definitely stay here again!

2021-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Great little stay with kind hosts. The location was a mixed of totally tucked away and close to town that made it a quick and rejuvenating getaway. if you're from out of town or a western Washington resident, this is a super enjoyable place to stay."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this cabin! It’s clean, picturesque and has everything you need for a romantic or relaxing getaway. Janet was a wonderful host. The cabin is tucked away and very private. Surrounded by walking trails through the forest."

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Charming little cabin tucked away in the woods. Great location for a little getaway - feels isolated and remote without being a long trek from civilization.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is very special. I came across this unexpected and the reviews don’t do it justice. Very much looking forward to coming back!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a little slice of heaven! Such a cute little cabin, so thoughtfully designed. Felt amazing to be away from it all, even for a night. Hope we can stay again one day!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A true delight! This quaint cabin in the woods is perfect for a nice getaway from town. This cabin is remote, private, and cozy! The hosts do a great job of keeping up the palce, it was clean and ready for my arrival. Easy check in process. Met the hosts in passing and they are nice people. It was a real treat this palce and has the amenities pictured, and something I was wondering was the heat (since it was colder out during my visit) and this cabin keeps warm quite well. There are two space heaters and even a heater in the downstairs bathroom. I also was thinking I would be taking a cold shower (based on other cabins) but this has hot water! These small features really make it a great well-rounded palce. This is perfect for camping without all the hassle of lugging gear and setting up camp. It is quite quiet at night and the bed is really comfortable. Things to note about this palce for others: the ladder (you have to be able to get up and down to the bed), bugs (there will be bugs -- didn't bother me), and the bathroom is not connected. I would definitely stay here again, and would have loved to have stayed another night (regretting not booking another night now). I am definitely planning to come back if in the area agin. It is definitely a trip worth taking. Oh, and the trails as well I explored are nice and well marked just adds to the overall allure too."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,More than I could have imagined.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is a very comfortable and well laid out apartment. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return there for another stay.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was exactly what our family needed for a quick/easy spot to be close to our volleyball tournament. The home was clean and comfortable and the inside is nicely updated. Do be aware that the house is a duplex (upstair's unit). We had zero issues with our downstairs neighbor, didn't even hear them, but I was wanting to be particularly careful of our noise level for them."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Was a nice quiet place to rest and relax during a loud busy weekend of volleyball.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to stay. The place was clean and had everything we needed. Hosts were great. We had no problem finding their place. Good location as we had a tournament in Ford's Prairie and access was easy.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It great nice place to stay at i felt like i was at home thanks
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was adorable and very well decorated. The little touches made it feel homey. We were there for a short period and didn't get to use the laundry but nice to have it. Check-in and out were easy and the checkout requirements were minimal. Parking was easy on the street and they had one designated spot (though didn't need with the ample street parking). There was an empty lot next to the house which was a bit odd but no issues at all. The cute downtown was walkable and we easily got to our venue as well. Cancellation policy was a bit tight and they do have minimum stay requirements but its all outlined in the listing so none of it was a surprise.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable beds. Just off Main Street. Easy access to I5, restaurants and outlet malls."

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Couch was not all that comfortable for older people,kept wanting to separate and to low. Otherwise it was ok."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Dana and Wyatt were quick to respond and very helpful when we needed assistance mid stay. The home is set up very nicely including toys for young kids and is a lovely place to stay. Will definitely stay again when we visit the area.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,"Apartment was as described, clean and comfortable host was very accommodating and responsive with communications would stay there again definitely"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The hosts were very kind, the place had all the needed amenities, its was clean, the location was great. I would definitely recommend staying here, I frequent Chehalis and will be renting again given the opportunity.☺️"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable and pleasant, with excellent beds and very responsive, flexible hosts. Some details would make it extra special, including gentler lighting. Watch out for the sloped ceiling!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here and it was as amazing as the first time! They’re very responsive and always make sure your stay is the best.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place in a wonderful area. Hosts were quick to respond with any questions we had during our stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot for our family of 5. Upstairs rooms are divided by a curtain so it doesn’t have the best privacy for those who need it, but we had our kids sleep up there and it was perfect for them! The house was very clean and well stocked with supplies(dishes, linens, extra blankets, noise machine, hairdryer etc). The washer and dryer were an added bonus! We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive. Good location for a weekend basketball tournament.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a cute place to stay for our daughter’s basketball tournament at NW Sports Hub! Would stay again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,everything was as described
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall this was a really good space - tastefully decorated, great and comfortable common areas (living room, dining room & kitchen) and super clean - and worked fine as our homebase while we were in town for a volleyball tournament. The only call out really is around the bedroom configuration. It's listed as a 3 bedroom rental, but felt more like a 2 bedroom to our group. There is one bedroom on the main floor with two doors that is a pass through between the living room and the bathroom. And there are two beds upstairs, but one is on the landing at the top of the stairs with no doors to close it off and only a curtain between it and the other bedroom. So really more of an open mezzanine. It was fine for sleeping, but didn't provide the private space we were expecting. But again, a really nicely cared for home and we would stay again with a smaller group."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,worked well for a week of work in the area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Darling house in a central location for our needs. Easy on/off interstate for us.
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"There are some thoughtful touches in the place and it is pretty cute. Very nice kitchen. If you're just looking for a decent bed and shower and you're going to be otherwise occupied this would be a fine place to stay. but if you are looking for a warm, comfy house to snuggle up in... this isn't quite it.
We just weren't very comfortable during our stay. We couldn't get the mini split heater to do enough. The back door was so drafty we shoved some towels in the space to try and conserve some heat. The couch in the living room was definitely broken. We ended up snuggling in the bed and watching movies on my laptop, which was not super ideal when there is a nice TV in the living room.
Also if you're not really really comfortable with the people you are vacationing with, this might not be the house for you. The only bathroom has a rickety door that doesn't latch leading into the main bedroom. The sliding barn door and no doors upstairs lead to you being able to hear any and all sounds."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a pleasant stay!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for the great stay!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoy staying at Savannah’s place when we’re in town. We made all of our meals in home this time, and we had everything we needed."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute home!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just as described. It was very clean, private, and peaceful. It met the needs for our stay for my family. The downside is that we could never get the place to a warm & comfortable temperature. There is a wall heater & a portable heater, but overall, my girls just never got cozy warm as you would expect in a house. With that being said, the bed needed thicker or heavier comforters or blankets. It was not very cold outside either. The living room sofa was rock hard. It was fine, but not overly comfortable. Quite honestly, minor items, but I believe worth noting since we stay at a lot of rentals and pay extra for what they offer over hotels, so you expect warm & comfortable accommodations at a minimum. I would definitely stay here again. It was a very nice and clean place. There was coffee and a coffee maker, which always was very nice."
2023-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"This rental was exactly as described, and quite comfortable. It was clean, attractive and I would stay here again. Mary"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Savannas place was perfect for our get away. It is an older home in an older neighborhood but well kept up, clean and comfortable."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay while we were visiting family in the area. This was our second visit, and it works really well for our group of 5 adults!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable for all of us. We had 4 adults and one child. All were comfortable. It’s a small house with only one bathroom, but we were able to make it work for all of us."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,perfect place to stay..had the best time of my life..
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful stay 😊
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Savannah was great to work with! She communicated very well ahead of time and was very responsive if I had any questions. The house is quaint and cute. Just be mindful of the doorways if you are tall. A lock from the bathroom door was missing when we got there but otherwise it was amazing. My bridal party got ready here and my husband and I stayed here after our wedding. It was a great experience!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Savannah’s cottage was inviting and comfortable. Easy access to I-5 located in a quiet neighborhood.
The downstairs has been nicely updated with a charming and fully stocked kitchen. The living room could use additional seating and the couch cushions need replacing.
As other reviewers have noted, it would be nice to have locks on the jack and Jill bathroom doors.
The day we were arrived was very warm however, the downstairs has a mini split unit to heat and cool the downstairs. Upstairs was considerably warmer, fortunately, one of the bedrooms had a ceiling fan and the other bedroom, had a window AC unit that quickly cooled things down. The upstairs bedrooms are sparsely furnished and decorated. I would recommend the owner add dressers and table lamps to each of the bedrooms. The beds we’re comfortable. Overall a pleasant stay in the cottage."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"My wife, two young kids and I came down to Centralia for my sister's wedding and stayed at Savannah's place. Overall we enjoyed our stay, although we should have read the listing and past reviews a little more carefully. It's not that Savannah's place is bad in any way, more that it wasn't ideal for our family. The stairs are very narrow and steep, and there's no way to close them off. We constantly had to rush over to prevent our 1-year-old from climbing them, and had to sit on the top step to block access every time the kids were upstairs.
We also really would have appreciated having three actual bedrooms. The listing says there are 3, but that's a bit misleading. The two rooms upstairs are separated only by a thin curtain. We initially tried to have both kids sleep upstairs, but they kept waking each other up. The whole setup is sort of bizarre, because the curtain hangs over a doorframe that clearly used to contain a door.
Overall the place met our needs though, thank you!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had originally booked this place, but was notified in a timely manner that she needed us to relocate to a different property (this review is for the other property)
It was small, and simple but worked well for our group. There was some clutter of things that where in the kitchen that suggested they were maybe working on the house, and a cleaning lady or previous guest left a bag full of damp towels in one of the bedroom closets. Beds were not very comfortable and didn't have any extra blankets. The neighborhood was a bit sketchy but overall it was a decent place and it fit our family and the majority of our needs just fine."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and comfortable, and exactly what we hoped for. Many tasteful updates throughout the house with new appliances. It was record heat during our stay and the house was able to stay comfortable with the air conditioner on the main floor. Upstairs was also easy to turn on AC when needed in the evening.
Would easily recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location - stayed here for a wedding and was 10 minutes from everywhere we needed to be around chehalis and Centralia. Cute little home!
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was comfy and we had everything we needed! The hosts were super accommodating and we were able to bring our dog! They have a great enclosed backyard for doggos to play in. The only thing that wasn’t super clear from the posting (but the other comments describe this) is that there aren’t any real doors inside. For the bathroom there were doors but they didn’t latch so you just had to be sure you didn’t walk in on someone using the restroom (wasn’t an issue for us since we were there for a wedding and didn’t spend much time at the Airbnb). Also, the bedroom downstairs had doors that slide and the one upstairs had a curtain and the other sleeping area was wide open from the stairs. There was five of us staying and there was plenty of space. Overall, we loved the place, it was comfy and cute inside!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Savannahs place was basically as described, but much smaller than expected. will it is listed as for 7 people, it is really mor suited for a family of 4 or 5 max. the one bathroom had to entries, one being in to the master bedroom with no way to lock the door from either side.
I did like the rustic feel both inside and out. the house was sufficient for our stay as there were only 4 of us and we only used it to sleep and shower. the kitchen appliances are brand new as described. the HVAC works very well. we were there with temps in the 80s."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Savannah's place was perfect for our needs! It was cute, clean, comfortable, and was a good location for us. We appreciated how many beds were available (we were a group of 6), and that it was dog-friendly with a secure backyard area. It also was close to amenities we needed, including a fantastic coffee spot (Fiddlers) only a few blocks away. Would definitely recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place. Used as homebase for my Ranier and st Helen’s.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Quiet neighborhood. Close to shopping.
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were disappointed in the home and neighborhood. House was smaller than expected, while they did a nice job renovating the kitchen, the upstairs is small and very hot. The yard is not kept up well. Plantings overgrown, debris (old cigar butt, streetlamp toppled over in front yard). No instructions on what to do about the garbage cans left on street.
No dishwasher.
The neighborhood was the most surprising - It's close to the highway so you'll have a lot of road noise and major road construction- closing streets around the house. One night we came home from dinner to find police activity (4 police cars). Strange comings and goings by people on the street. We left a day early as soon as our reason for being in Centralia was completed.
Positive - close to old town Centralia and baseball facility - reason for trip."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was quaint, clean, an well appointed. There was enough room for our family of 3 to have a comfortable stay. Thank you so much!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Savannah’s place was comfortable and clean!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Wishing to host family from out of town and entertain after a college graduation, it worked out perfectly.
I live local and did not want my family to find hotels, and also didn’t want to go to a restaurant after the events."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Well-updated interior, location is very convenient right off the freeway. Reviews are accurate that upstairs rooms are not fully separated (just a curtain), so make sure you’re friendly with everyone staying. Bathroom is attached to main floor bedroom, so that takes some coordination to not walk in on someone, as there wasn’t a way to lock one of the bathroom doors.
No usable outside space so this is an inside-only rental."
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"We wanted to find a place close to the sports hub for my daughter's volleyball tournament and this adorable old cottage fit the bill. Stylishly updated and very cute open main floor. Note there's no dishwasher, if you're cooking in, otherwise the kitchen is great. The fold-down sofa wasn't the best to sleep on, and the two sleeping spaces upstairs are separated by a curtain (no door)."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice stay at Savanna's house. It was really conveniently close to the NW Sports Hub as we were there for a a volleyball competition.
It was quiet and the beds were comfortable although on the harder spectrum so beware if you like soft beds.
The sleeper sofa in the living is well worn out and not the most comfortable to sit on so probably not great for sleeping.
One important aspect was that everyone staying there needs to be very comfortable sharing the space. The bedrooms are not real bedrooms with privacy. The 2 upstairs ""bedrooms"" are just separated by a curtain and then the downstairs bedroom has a sliding door that doesn't shut completely and a shared bathroom door with no handle. The staircase is also very steep and narrow.
It was fine for our group as it was just me downstairs and 3 teenage girls (2 of my daughters and their friend) sharing the upstairs space but I had originally offered another mom and her daughter to stay with us and it would not have worked."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Old house with cute cosmetic upgrades done to the inside. There is a large gap under the back door which lets a lot of bugs in. That was the biggest issue. We did a lot of bug killing and met some pretty big spiders. I think if they could seal gap and maintain some of the overgrown shrubs around the entrances it would make a big difference. Yard is overgrown so can’t use. Weather was hot. The upstairs bedroom has ceiling fan however we could not get it to work. Messaged the host but never got a response. Made for a very hot sleep in that room. The rest of the house stayed pretty cool. Otherwise it was very cute and comfortable for our family to stay for regional volleyball. It’s a great location close to town. Close to the sports hub. Really central to anything you might need to get to. Walking distance to a coffee shop and subway. Had well stocked kitchen for cooking. Netflix. Loved finishes. Good shampoo. Comfortable master bed. Appreciated having washer with soap. Would stay again
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I was glad to find this place in such close proximity to the sports complex my son’s volleyball tournament was at…..cute, remodeled 1920’s home….living space was very comfortable, kitchen was well stocked….would stay here again if ever in the area."

2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Had all the comforts of home. The house was cold because we happen to stay at a very cold time of year. We used every blanket and she provided extra which was very helpful. There was a drafty back door, that could use some help."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tastefully remodeled home with everything one would need when traveling. A quiet place situated near the heart of Centralia, with easy access to shopping. As an EV owner, having the charging station 1.5 miles away was a huge plus."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Savannah is our go-to for staying in Centralia, as we are there several times a year for tournaments at the Hub!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Exactly as described. Not near much of anything but we knew that when we rented the place. we used it as a great midpoint between Seattle and Portland.
A very nice little house, the heater/Ac unit worked amazingly well."

2022-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"An adorable place to stay. Appliances new and everything was very clean. Lovely plush blankets and super fluffy towels.
Appreciated the coffee and essential spices and sugar. Back yard is a private oasis. Was early spring and rainy so we didn’t get a chance to enjoy it.
This house is so charming, BUT not ideal for people over 6’1”. We had boys volleyball players cracking heads on light fixture in living space and the low door frames."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful trip and the beds were SO comfortable! Great communication with the host- Savannah was incredibly accommodating.

2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very clean and suitable for our purposes. The kitchen was very nice although I could not find the toaster. Excellent refrigerator stove and microwave. The privacy aspect between bedrooms was not super but in general satisfactory. The television was not easy to find the regular public channels, but did have other features such as Netflix and so on. Much better than staying at a motel!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! So many personal touches, and centrally located. Comfy bed, and a really terrific kitchen. Very quiet neighborhood, too. Thank you, Savanah, for easy communication, and being a true super host. Will return soon!"

2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was clean with new kitchen amenities. Definitely needs more space heaters, there was only one and some of the wall heaters did not work at all. Our family was freezing at night and there was only one roll of toilet paper between 7 people for 3 days. We had to buy our own which was an inconvenience since we came for a wedding and we’re already super busy. Over all a cute space."
2021-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This was my first visit to Washington and it was great. The house was perfect. Everything from the decorations to the amenities it offered made you feel right at home. The house is also centrally located and i recommended this rental.

It was not difficult to find or check into :) Thank you!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An easy location to navigate and a comfy, cozy house. Very much worth the money! The location can hear a local train, so if you have a light sleeper in the party make sure to bring some ear plugs (it's not super noisy, but if you are not used to hearing a train and are a light sleeper, they could be helpful)."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great host.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was beautiful and just what my family needed on our road trip to feel at home and have some restful days. Really quick to stores and Great Wolf Lodge.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Back to back volleyball weekends at the Hub and back to back great stays at this Airbnb.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Another great stay here, our go to for when in town for sports at the hub."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Had an amazing time!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time staying here to enjoy Great Wolf Lodge, the outlets and some of the local restaurants!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was very nice. Super clean and looked as expected based advertising. We felt very comfortable and at home.
My only feedback is details. Hand soap was empty or almost empty in two bathrooms and kitchen. Body soap also empty in master.
Coffee maker worked first 2 mornings, however went to use in the afternoon and couldn't get it to work??? Not sure what happened.
That said, Savannah and Kacey were very responsive when I contacted them and dropped off needed items.
Overall, great stay. I would stay again and recommend to others."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect stay for us to visit Great Wolf Lodge. Really close to fast food restaurants and a Safeway if needed. The place is really clean and the rooms are super spacious!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Newer house that was easy to get to and close to everything in the area. It was comfortable and felt great to get away for a bit!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,worked very well for us this work week! thanks again
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice quiet neighborhood and only 5 min from the freeway and the outlet stores. I liked the fact that there where baby and child items at the house as I had 2 grand kids with me. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a stay in that area. The house was a lot less expensive (and nicer) then the local hotels were.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed in Savannah’s home last year and looked forward to staying again. The house is adorable and super comfortable. The beds are comfy and there is plenty of room for our two families. The house is stocked with anything you might need and we look forward to coming back!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a very clean and comfortable home. It's a great home for kids. There is a fenced in back yard and lots of toys and infant/toddler amenities. There are 4 bedrooms and all the beds were comfortable. The pillows were too flat for my taste so you might bring you own pillows if you are sensitive to that. The kitchen was well equipped. The home felt relaxing right away. Nicely decorated but not fussy. The check in process was easy; and there were very few chores required at check out. The only minor issues were we couldn't find a cutting board or soap for the dishwasher. We emailed Savannah twice about this and never heard back. Other than that her communications were clear and friendly (regarding check in, check out). I would most definitely stay in this home again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was perfect. The place was super clean and perfect location for why we were visiting Centralia.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We were so pleased with our stay at the Modern Farmhouse. We were in town for a wedding and needed a pet friendly place to stay. The home was just as described and pictured and was very clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed and it was nice to be able to have a fenced yard to let the pups out to play and run in. Savannah was a very responsive host. I felt I could have reached out to her if we would have needed anything. Thank you Savannah!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed this beautiful and clean home very much. We were in the area for our daughters wedding and coming back to this home when we were tired at the end of the day was so peaceful and relaxing. Definitely recommend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was a great stay! Nice bedrooms and decorated in a cute way. There were some leftover Thanksgiving and Christmas decorations well past the holidays that would have made it seem less clutter free, but it wasn't an issue. Would definitely stay there again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Savannah and Kacey have a clean and comfortable property and were great hosts who are easy to communicate with. The listing is not far from plenty of shops and restaurants and check in/out was very simple. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at their property and would definitely recommend booking a stay with them!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This place was nice. It was very clean and spacious. Fit our group of 6 very comfortably.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The property itself is awesome and that is why this is a 4 star review, instead of less. The negatives we experienced are all the same negatives mentioned in other reviews dating all the way back to May, 2022. Lights, curtains, water knobs reversed, the washing machine doesn't have hot water and when I opened it I was smacked with the smell of mold and then saw the standing black mold in the washer. VERY limited dishes and utensils that I suspect that we were lucky to have from other guests leaving them behind. They're random, sparce, dirty. The skillet is bowed so bad, it's very difficult to use. A pizza pan we had to use for a baking pan was covered in caked on grease. The coffee machine brews the worst coffee ever. I waited a while after my stay to leave a review to think about how I could nicely say these things. After reading reviews from a year and a half ago and having the same issues, I decided to spill the beans because it's apparent there's no plans of correcting."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a wonderful time!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Savannah was fantastic and her place was perfect for my crew!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Stayed here with 5 other friends for a wedding in the area. So spacious and didn’t feel cramped at all! Very cozy as well and everyone raved about the couch (it was like a cloud). The perfect place to stay with a group!
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,This place was great to stay at. The house itself was beautiful and everything that was listed was given. Close to everywhere we needed to go and had no trouble finding it!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home was extremely clean and had lots of space. The home was very welcoming and warm and the host was easy to communicate with and very helpful. We would definitely stay here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once you got to the where the duplex was it looked like all newer construction, place was super clean and new feel, fenced back yard. Host didn't leave any recommendations of things to do or places to eat just house instructions. Not the hosts fault but we couldn't find many ""good"" restaurants nearby.
The only thing I would give thumbs down to would be the lighting was very poor in most of the rooms... used cool and warm lighting which didn't work well.... however, there are lamps in the room which helped so you could see better at night."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Savannah’s place was perfect for our family to stay while in town for my brother’s wedding. It was close to the venue, had tons of space for all seven of us, and had everything we needed for a great stay. We especially appreciated the toys that were there for my niece to play with. Communication and information provided from the host was perfect, we never needed to ask for anything. We would definitely stay here again if we’re ever in town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent place to stay. Very clean and lots of parking. Worked perfectly for our family to enjoy our daughters wedding weekend. Lots of space and comfortable. Host was very responsive! We will stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in town for business and it was a perfect location for our stay. Our visit was short however I would recommend. Savannah was very responsive and the house is nice. If you are traveling with babies this house is equipped for you, as a mother I can appreciate that add!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great time at Savannah's place. Everything was as advertised (looked just like the photos) so there were no surprises. It was comfortable and Savannah was very accommodating and responsive to our requests. I would stay there again and would recommend it to others.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Exactly as described. Cozy and felt at home even with 6 of us staying at the place. 2 full baths and a 3rd half downstairs never had any issues with people using the bathroom or felt like we had to rush. Would definitely recommend and will hopefully be staying again in a couple months during our next business visit in the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Savannah’s was great for our family. It was absolutely spotless. Very well kept. She was so responsive and proactive. Would highly recommend!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This rental was really good. Small issue with the portable air conditioners coming loose from the window and the rental was extremely hot the first day due to high temperatures for the area. The water pressure for the showers weren’t great and the beds, while they were clean, were very uncomfortable. Overall the rental was nice and affordable. Would rent again."
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home for a family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family enjoyed the clean, well appointed home during our vacation. Thank you!"

2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean, cute and perfect size for our group! We planned on cooking breakfast each morning before going out but found the pots/pans weren’t ideal but they worked.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great location for sports events in Centralia, lots of room to spread out."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This was one of the best places I've rented in the Airbnb 'system' and I've rented a good many. Very quiet neighborhood with many amenities and an all around beautiful home. It is also close to Centralia downtown quaint shops (I walked 2 miles) and to I5 freeway.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My group of friends and family travels frequently for horse shows. This listing was exactly as described and was very comfortable for the 4 of us (3 adults and 1 toddler). We always cook our own meals so having a decent kitchen is a must. I usually pack most of my own pans, spices, utensils, etc just in case, but didn't really need anything other than olive oil.
The rooms were comfortable and each had their own individual heater, which was great considering it was terribly rainy and cold while we were there. Linens were soft and cozy.
The toddler appreciated the age-appropriate assortment of toys.
Very happy with this rental and will definitely book again if we head back this way."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was perfect for our families! House was adorably decorated and felt very cozy and homey. There was plenty of room for the kids and adults to have some space. We could not have asked for a better location. 7 minutes to the NW Sports Hub and outlets. Savannah was responsive and a great host. We’ll definitely book again for our next tournament!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great house and responsive host! Would stay here again.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great stay for my wedding. Beautiful house!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We booked this home with another family. Our boys had a baseball tournament at the nearby NW Sports Complex. The home had enough space for the kids to hang out and for the adults to hang out and it was pretty quiet for the most part. We appreciated being so close to the sports venue so that we didn't have to rush out the door or wake the kids up too early.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean. Good location for a wedding we attended.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,We were thankful to have the opportunity to stay at Savannah's place. We came from Los Angeles for a wedding in Chahalis on New Year's Eve. The location of her place made our weekend much easier. It also made for a nicer time visiting with family between all the various events related to the wedding. The beds were comfortable. The place was super clean. We used the kitchen for breakfast and snacking and found it so much nicer than eating out all weekend. The local town looked like a fun place to visit but we we were too busy to explore it. Savannah made everything easy for us and was very quick to respond to our questions!
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, very clean and inviting."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This airbnb was exactly what we needed to accomodate our large family. It was comfortable, clean and adequately spacious. And the festive Christmas decorations were a fun surprise. The area looks a little sketchy driving in, but we found everything to be quiet and had no problems through the entire stay. Plus theres a great coffee hut within walking distance for a morning pick me up! Would recommend without reservation and stay again ourselves. Book it!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Savannahs bnb was a great stay and a beautiful home that had absolutely everything we could have needed inside. She was very responsive with any questions we had and was happy to help! Would recommend to anyone looking in the area.

2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Rating
Perfect in every way
Great Place- we were there for a wedding.
Located in town and very peaceful street. Easy to get to the freeway.
Outlet Mall, lots of shopping near buy and great restaurants.
The house had everything you could ask for: 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, kitchen with all of the appliances and living space. We had 6 people and it was very family oriented.
Savannah was on top of all the communication and very welcoming."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Property was amazing! Worked perfect for our family, super comfortable and nicely decorated."
2022-05-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"We aren't typically negative reviewers but this place is so highly rated that we thought it important to share our experience. The host was gracious enough to allow us to bring our pets (for a fee, which we gladly paid). When we got to the rental, the yard was a jungle. Grass so high (over one foot) we could lose our smaller dog in it. It looked nothing like the perfectly manicured yard in the photos. The neighbors yards were all mowed so I know it wasn't a question of weather. We reached out to the host about this and she showed no sense of urgency in getting it resolved, in fact after she told us she was waiting from a response from her landscaper on day two of our stay we never heard another word from her until checkout three days later. It was clear that she didn't have any intention of getting the lawn taken care of during our visit. We finally just went and bought a weed eater and cut back a patch of grass for the dogs to use. There were a few safety concerns: many light bulbs were out including all lights in the hallway upstairs making it very dark at night when going up stairs. Also, one of the sinks in the master bath has the hot/cold water reversed. *** Our three year old burned herself brushing her teeth. Not sure how this home was properly permitted with this issue. None of the bedroom windows have blinds, only sheer curtains so the bright sun comes through blindingly in the mornings. Two of the mattresses are luxurious memory foam and two are absolute trash. But the biggest ""ew"" for us was realizing (at the end of our trip) that there is no hot water going into the washing machine. Which means the hosts dark, unbleachable towels and bed linens are being washed in cold water...rather disgusting! 🤢 Overall, the house looked very nice but we cannot recommend, we will not be renting from this host in the future. It's a solid no from us."
2022-05-01,4.0,Group trip,Great home & location. Perfect for a weekend with the girls

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for our wedding night! Only 5 minutes from the venue. I had no issues.
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to stay forever
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is new construction so everything was nice, new, and very clean. We enjoyed the extra tv in the master bedroom, coffee that was provided and they even had a bottle of wine waiting. There was a railroad track somewhere off in the distance but not uncomfortably close. The hot water heater is either really small or turned down low so as not to burn someone. We ran out of hot water frequently but other than that minor inconvenience, we enjoyed our stay."
2022-03-01,5.0,Group trip,Feels like home !

Would recommend this home to a family or families looking for a great place to stay in Centralia!! Will stay again if we return for another baseball tournament......"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house! Very clean, well equipped, and quiet neighborhood. It was perfect for 2 families. We were in town for a tournament at the NW Sports Hub. It’s about an 8 minute drive over there and so much more comfortable than a hotel. Clear and prompt communication from the hosts. Our schedule changed a few times due to tournament times, and they were very nice and accommodating. Highly recommend!"

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked Savannah's place for our wedding night and I'm so glad we did! We chose to do the wedding night package and it was absolutely amazing! Every detail was so thoughtful and personal. There was breakfast food in the fridge and snacks on the counter waiting for us. We came home after our long day at the wedding venue to find rose petals and champagne on our bed. There were two luxurious robes and slippers waiting for us. There were also banners hung that said ""Mr. & Mrs."" and ""Cheers to love"". And as if that wasn't enough, they had made us personalized monogram champagne flutes with a matching plate and two coffee mugs that we got to take home as a gift! They even made them our wedding colors. It was so touching and made us feel so special. The house is gorgeous and very well kept, but if you're also looking for a place to spend your wedding night, I couldn't recommend them enough!! 😊❤"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The area isn't as accessible as I thought it would be but the place was nice and clean. They needed more linens and we found some in the washer but they were damp and smelled sour. Savannah is really great about communicating and was a good host.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"When I first stumbled upon this flat on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Savannah is the most thoughtful, gracious host.
She provided us with all the information we needed. The home is just perfect! Accommodated an early check-in without any hesitation. Kitchen is spacious and contains everything one needs.
The bed is comfortable, bathroom and front porch are excellent. Location is incredible. Will keep this home in mind again when visiting my son at the local college."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at one of Savannah’s homes in Centralia and we enjoyed our time. This house was in a good location for walking downtown and was in a quiet neighborhood. It is fairly close to the train station so bring a white noise machine if that will bother you at night! It is underneath another rental unit, so you may hear noise from upstairs, which we didn’t realize, but overall it was pretty quiet in the neighborhood."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our son’s wedding. The house was only 9 minutes away from the venue which was nice. There was plenty of room for me, my wife and sister. The lighting in the bathrooms were not all that great, but otherwise we had no problems."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great Space! Very comfortable! Excellent location - 2 blocks to downtown - 8 minutes to sports complex. More than 4 guests check to see if upstairs is available. Savannah and team very responsive. Definitely will stay again. Thank you!
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Savannah’s place was a great location for us. Additionally, the house was clean and we never felt unsafe in any way. However, the yard was extremely overgrown and with it starting to warm up outside, it was getting warm in the house. Luckily there is a fan for the main bedroom, but we could not figure out to work the ceiling fan in the living room. Overall, it was a great space for us."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was just as described in the pictures. It made us feel right at home and our children felt comfortable to even notice it was not their home.I would definitely stay here again in the future.
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were happy with our stay. Savannah communicated with us about a few questions beforehand that were helpful in making plans. It was a heat wave weekend so it would have been good to have a fan in every room and since it gets so light at 5AM or so, adding curtains where there are already curtain rods would greatly improve the sleeping experience.
Since pets are allowed, it would be very nice to have the lawn(s) mowed- especially the back yard. Our dog is small and it was really difficult for her to walk around in grass and weeds that was a lot higher than her.
I was impressed with the cleanliness and special details like the lego wall in the game room and the connect four on the wall. We will likely stay again if it is in winter where we don't have to worry about curtains. Thank you for accommodating a late check out so we could get to a morning volleyball game at the hub."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place, matched the description. Good location. Easy check-in / checkout."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Savannah saved the weekend!! My daughter and I needed a last minute place to stay. We had a hotel reservation but the hotel room was really dirty. I got onto the app and found this listing. Savannah was extremely quick on communication (answered my call on the first ring!) and super helpful. We packed up from the hotel and were on our way to the Southwest house! This house is ADORABLE, comfortable, clean, and just simply a home away from home.

Obviously there is a loft for some to sleep in, be prepared for a ladder and no bathroom up there . If you're fine with that, which we were, its a great place to stay!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Most important: it was absolutely pristine in every way. One of the cleanest places I've ever stayed. For being a small home, it easily fit 6 people very comfortably. Beds and furniture are comfortable and clean. Home is gorgeous but with no breakable furniture/knick knack junk. Washer/dryer fabulous since we were in town for a baseball tournament. House was very well insulated so very quiet, cozy, and restful. We had a very minor house glitch that couldn't have been foreseen or prevented by the homeowner but the homeowner corrected it in a very timely fashion and made sure we were not inconvenienced by it. HIGHLY recommend. We will stay again next time we're playing in town!"

Easy check in and check out process!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing and beautiful place to stay. The shower heads in the bathroom had high pressure which is an A+ for our favorite; the first for us in which many previous air bnbs that we had stayed in did not have have.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. The house was clean and ver well appointed. The only downside is the house next door, unsightly with broken down cars in backyard, it definitely gives you pause when you check-in. It would be nice if neighbor’s had some pride in ownership. However, Savannah’s place is very nice and we enjoyed staying there., I would stay here again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really super nice place, very clean, well appointed. Centralia isn't the nicest town in the world but the place was fantastic"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this property. Listing is very accurate and a great base for a weekend exploring the area.
While the appearance was very clean and attractive (white, modern, minimal clutter), we had concerns about the actual cleanliness of the property.
Unfortunately, upon stripping the beds, there were bugs under the sheets (not bed bugs). The comforters on the bed did not have removable covers, which makes me question if they’re cleaned between sessions. Further, the lack of kitchen supplies like sponges concerned me how clean kitchenware was upon arrival.
Tips for others’ stays here:
- bring camping chairs with you to enjoy the front porch
- bring a hairdryer
- bring or buy sponges for the kitchen
- I’d recommend two adults at maximum, and kids use of loft only (low clearance)
Comfortable couch for enjoying a movie. Large supply of towels and blankets for comfort.
I appreciate that there’s a security camera facing the street. It makes street parking feel more secure."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was exactly as pictured! We absolutely enjoyed our stay. Spacious, clean, and so cute. We would stay here again if we are ever back in the area and it’s available!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Savanna's home was pleasant. A few things made the stay less inviting, including both of the queen beds being in the loft (challenging to get to, not much head room, needed to the beds from the ladder,)the ladder lading to the loft being extremely unstable and unsafe, and there being an outlet in the bathroom hanging out of the wall. I appreciatedthe moder decorations and the cleanliness however."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Gorgeous little tiny house! It was perfect everything and more of what I expected.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice tiny house. Enjoyed our time and felt comfortable. I think there's a plan to fix the water heating for the bathroom. The fridge didn't seem to get cold, but perhaps there's a plan for fixing that too. Savannah was responsive and offered $30 off each day for water heater inconvenience. reasonable"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed two separate weekends. Clear communication & easy to follow directions for check-in & check-out. We had a little bit of a hard time finding the place our first night, but once we located it, we were golden. Important to note we were trying to find the house late at night, I think it would have been easier during daylight hours.
The house is adorable, modern and well decorated. Cozy and it fit our needs perfectly. The location was great; we were in town for a sports tournament and were 5 minutes from the facility!
Only complication was the water heater for the shower did not work correctly for either of our trips, so showers were not an option during our stay, brrr!!! We did communicate with the host and she attempt to help us correct the situation but sadly no luck.
Would love to come back whenever we are in this area as it is a great location and a comfortable/cute home, just hopefully with a warm shower at the next stay ☺️"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Savannah was an excellent host, the property was just as she described and worked well for our needs. We came for a softball tournament and the location was close enough to the hub, stores and restaurants but still had a neighborhood feel. The neighbors were friendly and the coffee shop around the corner was a nice bonus. The hot water was lacking but I feel confident that Savannah is working to correct this. We will definitely be staying here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First time renting an AirBNB, I'll never stay in a hotel again! This place had everything we needed."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The cottage is a cute, warm, and new space where my partner and I enjoyed staying over the holidays. The well outfitted kitchen and full size washer and dryer are especially nice during longer stays."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great little house. Perfect location as we were there for a softball tournament and it was super close to the sports hub. Very clean. Lots of restaurants around. Just be aware that the map app on your phone sometimes will have you turn on the little gravel road behind the house. Make sure to arrive on the main road matching the address. Thanks for a great stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We spend 10 days in Savanna’s adorable little home. It was clean, comfortable, close to shopping, restaurants, and the freeway (but not too close!). Her creative decorations made it feel like you were at home, not in a rental! We will stay there again if the need arises!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for attending events at the NW Sports Hub. Cute, clean space."
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a good moms’ weekend away here! The space is cozy and made for a good launch pad for visiting around the area. Just note that the “driveway” isn’t really for parking in but there is space alongside the road for a car and then another space behind the house if you take the alleyway.
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute little house! Nicer than most in the area. Overall the stay was good but heat was turned off and the house was uncomfortably cold when I arrived and took a few hours to warm up. I did book last minute (the night before) so that may have been part of the reason. Otherwise nice stay.
One recommendation would be a curtain/blind on the kitchen window so that you can avoid the view of the neighbors not so appealing back yard."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, affordable, comfortable home. We’ve already reserved a second stay! Thank you for the lovely time."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very happy to have stayed in this cute tiny home! It has a lot of charm and is very cozy. Check in and out was a breeze. This place was very accomadating for our extended stay. The ladder was really the only thing that was a little shifty. Overall very happy to have stayed here.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place to stay. thanks!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house looks exactly as pictured. Everything was very clean & tidy. No complaints just a couple suggestions on how our stay could have been better, a curtain over the kitchen sink for a bit more privacy & a small fan to help with air circulation in the bedroom. We made due just fine without those things and really enjoyed our stay."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a cute and cozy house. Was perfect for our two night stay. Just wish there was a fire pit out side to enjoy the beautiful nights. Close to the freeway and the downtown area.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Suited all our needs during our stay. Super quiet neighborhood.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,great stay and location!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A total gem. This is hands down the best accommodation in the area.
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Savannah's cozy tiny home was such a great stay. Place was really clean and had plenty of amenities. If you're looking for a smaller and cozier place to stay then you can't go wrong here.
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"It's a cute tinyish house, very bright and open. The house was on the cleaner side but honestly could've been cleaner for the price you pay, we found some hair on the pillows (not ours) and anything that was white had stains (rug in living room, and door trim). Driveway does have a big dip in it that a car wouldnt make it over. The decorations and atmosphere were perfect and very cozy, the shower was amazing, location was perfect close to everything and kitechen was beautiful. I did had trouble checking in due to the host not checking messages because I booked less 24 hours in advance and relied on auto messages ( that were never sent) but the host never check to make sure the code sent to check in I contacted 3 times. I would say over all a decent stay but with the cleaning problem I wouldn't stay again."
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location! Right off of I-5 and just a short drive to downtown.
The space was comfortable and clean. This newly built tiny home doesn't seem tiny at all!
Our only concern was that the ladder to the loft did not have a way to lock in place so it would not be safe for small children or unsteady adults."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful place to stay, just out of view of town but never more than a few minutes from anything you need! Everything I needed was there!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was very clean and private. I enjoyed making my coffee in the morning and enjoying the view. Very close to town and easy to get in and out of. I enjoyed my stay
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,perfect location.. stayed 5 days...
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I had a quiet and peaceful class which included zoom meetings. We were looking forward to hiking but the weather did not cooperate and we were busier with our class than we thought. Thanks for a beautiful, artistic area for our meditation retreat."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The only regret was that I only had time for an overnight visit. When I return I am hoping for a longer stay. The basement accommodations are charming, to say the least. Downtown Centralia (a few minutes away) needs a bit more exploring too."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had such a peaceful stay! Gretchen's place was homey, cozy, and comfortable. The home made granola and muffins were such a sweet touch, and her garden was blooming right outside my window. It was beautiful. Thank you!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved Gretchen’s place!! I love that you could access trails from her property. The breakfast treats were amazing. The bed is comfy. This is a wonderful find and would definitely stay here again. Great, thoughtful host! We ate at The Branch, highly recommended! Make reservations."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen’s place is not only comfortable, but also spacious. Very clean, well kempt - with unique decor and heritage furniture. Also - she provides breakfast with homemade granola, applesauce, and muffins:)
Super responsive and clear instructions
Beautiful property that is perfect distance outside of town to create separation but still be close to conduct business or hop back onto the I-5
Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little gem on the hill was far better than I imagined, more homey than I pictured, and more what I needed than I had even realized. Thank you for a very peaceful, quiet, and relaxing stay."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen’s was the perfect place for us couple of days exploring and attending a family wedding. It was quiet and peaceful.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a lovely and peaceful place to stay when in the Twin Cities.
Gretchen is a gracious host and the home made muffins she provides are yummy.
Nestled in the forest, with a beautiful view, I highly recommend this Airbnb."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Gretchen is a great host.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A few minutes from town with a beautiful view of the valley. Lots of fun, bright playful artwork. The continental breakfast was delicious."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gretchen is an amazing host! Everything she did+ to make our stay wonderful - was thoughtful, kind and very tasty. We hope to get the chance to stay again!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A cozy retreat in a beautiful setting. Comfortable, private and quiet with nearby hiking trails. Close to restaurants and shops. Gretchen is a friendly and gracious host. Her homemade muffins and applesauce were a perfect start to the morning."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I will always give 5 stars to my host for opening up their home to me especially when they are as kind as this host. Had a great view and it’s so quiet.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Wow, we were not prepared for how gorgeous Gretchen's place was! Lots of hiking trails and a short drive from the downtown area. We loved the vintage shops in Centralia. With our trip we drove around a lot, we loved how centralized it was on the west side of Washington.
Also, the other reviews didn't lie, her muffins were fantastic. Enjoy your stay with her!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a relaxing weekend at Gretchen's place, tucked away in a forest yet close to town. Self check-in was easy but we did meet Gretchen who is an author and artist as well as an amiable host. The place is decked out in unique art and collectibles and had an ample supply of books and breakfast foods. If you're a light sleeper you may be bothered by the coyotes yipping in the distance at night or the long, lonely horns from trains passing through Centralia, but we loved it. Don't stay in a hotel if you can stay at Gretchen's place instead!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We totally enjoyed this peaceful place! it was a very relaxing stay. Gretchen was very helpful and friendly. We would stay again in a heartbeat!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We have stayed several times, and hope to stay again. The patio is a place I can go in my mind to find peace and quiet. ❤️"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and relaxing
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a lovely time at”Earth of Three Farm”. The muffins were delicious, the bed was super comfortable and the view was amazing. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"In the week stay the temperature during the day was in the 90’s and 2 days over 100. The place was cool and comfortable day and night. And the homemade muffins and yogurt were delicious. Gretchen was a wonderful, friendly host."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly a hidden gem in Centralia! Gretchen's hospitality and baked goods were delicious, and we had a great time exploring the nearby forest and shops (highly recommend Vicky's El Salvadorian food)!
The place is a convenient 1-2hr drive from St Helens and Rainier, both beautiful hiking areas.
Only con we noticed was some ambient noise (e.g., a freight train horn). But we otherwise had a peaceful and enjoyable stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great communication. Beautiful setting. Would not hesitate coming back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very beautiful and quiet setting. I loved the home made touches and unique decorations. I would definitely stay here again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for STP, very nice private location that’s up the hill away from all the train noise downtown. Gretchen is a great host, providing a delicious muffin and yogurt for breakfast in the morning and is responsive to messages. If you need a break from the big city, a weekend stay here is a good refresher 👍"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,All the praises and great responses you see here and other posts are accurate. This is what Airbnb was supposed to be about and she is the epitome of that. My words simply can’t do justice to what a wonderful place Gretchen has.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to unplug. Very quiet and serene. Continental breakfast a welcome bonus.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, secluded, peaceful getaway. Lovely mid century modern home artistically appointed. There was something that made me smile at every turn. Loved all the little whimsy all over the property. Loved sitting on the patio for coffee in the morning and in the evening after supper listening to the birds singing. Loved the view of Mt Adams and the ancient trees surrounding the house. Took a small hike into the nature area. Beautiful wilderness full of huge trees and tons of ferns. We absolutely loved our stay here and honestly hated to leave. Would come back in a heartbeat 💓"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Im glad i chose Gretchen's place out of all that was available. It was just outside of town, peaceful and comfortable. I spent most of my time during the day with my family, came back to relax for a bit and then go to sleep. So it was perfect!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As usual, Gretchen's property was exactly what I needed. Perfect, beautiful, quiet, comfortable. the perfect hidden gem in Chehalis"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Gretchen’s place was a treat mainly because of the beautiful surroundings! The space was so peaceful, largely in part due to the patio, trails, and access to the garden. Inside was cozy and welcoming."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"3 of Earth Farm’s special significance to Gretchen and her family is impossible to miss while staying there. Clearly willing to invite guests into their world, Gretchen’s book, “Mother Lode,” as well as the history of the location, are shared openly. The best part of the location are the trails leading directly into the Seminary Hill Natural Area, established in thanks to the effort’s of Gretchen’s family.
My daughter loved the hand made granola, exploring the forest, and playing frisbee in the meadow. Rustic and uniquely decorated, 3 of Earth is welcoming, and Gretchen was very accessible and communicative."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very rustic setting with a beautiful view of Mount St. Helens on a clear day. Even though it was hot and sunny outside over the weekend, there was A/C inside and with the breeze and shade in the basement unit, it was quite pleasant. Gretchen had a lot of her photographs and art work displayed which made it quite pleasant. I made the mistake of thinking that there was a sink in the kitchenette set up, so that was a small hiccup for me to cook an entire meal! Other than that, given that Gretchen provided yummy muffins, coffee/tea, yogurt for breakfast, and it was close enough to Centralia, we will eat out next time! Very peaceful surroundings and Gretchen is very communicative - great host."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,was only in town for a few days and this place was perfect! the view was amazing and the space felt so at home! so many books / magazines / pictures from all of washington. loved it would stay again
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very peaceful and relaxing.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful retreat perfect for my needs.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved Gretchen’s place. Everything was just as she said in her listing. The price was awesome. Honestly I think she should charge more. I highly recommend a stay here.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Eclectic and quiet space. Loved the homey touches, especially the muffins. :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second visit at Three of Earth Farm. Gretchen provides a retreat nestled in the peaceful countryside. She ensures easy access to property by effective and timely communication. She ensures comfort by providing thoughtful and unique touches throughout the suite. Adding to the experience was a wandering deer visiting in the morning, sweet birds sharing their music and a furry little guy burrowing under the sidewalk.
Thank you once again Gretchen, we had a wonderful time."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen’s place was such a sweet, warm, quiet, and comforting space. We enjoyed the beautiful trails, watching the wild birds and deer nearby, admiring her photography, writing, and artwork, sipping on hot tea, and enjoying scrumptious muffins and homemade vegan granola with yogurt. We felt right at home and loved all the personal touches and vibrant colors of the rooms and decor. My husband works nights so he really appreciated how dark the room was with the blinds and how cozy the bed was. Gretchen was very easy and friendly to communicate with and we highly recommend this well-preserved, quaint and peaceful retreat."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you need a quiet getaway in the woods, stay here. Just a lovely place with a lovely host."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The main reason why I booked Gretchen's guest house is because of the price.
I was planning to stay in a hotel for 2 nights in Chehalis, after looking at prices, the hotels in town would cost me $400 for 2 nights. I was in town to see friends, and I was not planning on spending much time in a hotel room. Gretchen's guest house cost me $190 total for 2 nights. Gretchen's directions to the property were easy to follow. I had to drive my Ford F150 pickup truck on this trip, I was not aware of how narrow the driveway is, and I was worried my truck was not going to fit. Turns out, there was plenty of room to maneuver my truck. The guest house was exactly what I needed. The bed was super comfortable. Gretchen provided some vegan granola, yogurt & and muffins, which I totally ate and were delicious. Inside the guest house is super cute. Lots of artwork and books. I enjoyed the patio in the evening and listened to the frogs. FYI, there's not a TV. so plan for that and bring a tablet. 10/10 ⭐️"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Gretchen's place. It was very cozy and had some amazing views. I really loved how we could walk to a wide array of hiking trails just from the backyard. The property is really beautiful and it's the perfect spot for a peaceful getaway. We really apreciated the thoughtful touches such as the muffins and granola. One of the best Airbnb's I've been to yet. We look forward to returning the next time we need a reset in nature!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You’ll love this space. Gretchen’s place is very livable and you’ll feel like you’re home. She helped me with so many other personal requests, which made me feel safe and thoroughly accommodated. You won’t regret your stay here"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's place was awesome! The location was beautiful, and she went out of her way to pick us up and drop us off at the train station. I highly recommend to anyone in the area."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I was thrilled with Gretchen's place. All I needed and then some was provided. Everywhere I looked (over seven days!) I would see another whimsical piece of art, or soul enriching book, or a new amazing view out the window. A magical place I am almost reluctant to share so effusively about out of shear selfishness!"
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,This stay was amazing! The decor of the place is beautiful and the atmosphere was cozy and warm! The view from the living room and bedroom of the suite is gorgeous. The breakfast was really good and it was overall a very quiet and pleasant experience.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Visited this Airbnb for a few nights to do a solo songwriting retreat. It was peaceful, not too far from town, and had everything I needed. Great for birdwatching (bring your binoculars), lots of books and magazines, really comfy bed with an excellent view. There was plenty of coffee and tea, and even fresh muffins. Yum! Hope to visit again! Thank you :)"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ferns, trees, birds, view of a peaceful valley. Whimsical décor. Sit in an armchair and take in the view. If you need a retreat, here's the spot."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to unplug. Fabulous hiking attached. Perfectly suited my needs.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I look forward to returning to Gretchen’s place during warmer weather. The location is great, but the rain and snow made for tricky steps from parking down to the front door. The decor is artsy and creative and the apartment was very well appointed."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. It is conveniently located between Portland and Seattle. Gretchen’s place has beautiful views and is perfect for a peaceful getaway to be away from the City life. It is extremely spacious and Gretchen made sure everything was clean and tidy. She is also super responsive and great communicator. I’m definitely coming back sometime in the summer!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen was great! Quick response, accommodating. Very cozy place. Amazing scenery and relaxing environment. Thank you."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful oasis hidden back away from the road! We LOVED the privacy, quiet, nature (birds, deer, vegetation), and peace of Gretchen’s place. The interior of her place is even more impressive in person and the view of the valley below outside is spectacular if it’s not covered by mist. It was the perfect place to spend a few days while visiting family and friends who lived in the area. We definitely recommend staying here and will try to book again when we’re in the area."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view, cozy atmosphere and all the comforts of home away from home. I will definitely be back!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place stay! The place was exactly what I wanted for my visit to Centralia. It is a cozy place close to town with everything you need. I will definitely be back again, hopefully for a longer time so I can fully enjoy the property and trails nearby."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's guest suite is very comfortable and well apportioned, and her lovely house is in a beautiful location! I would happily stay here again!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,charming place to stay with all the amenities needed!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommended. A beautiful, peaceful respite near a vibrant downtown. Centralia is packed with antique stores, shops and restaurants. We enjoyed the bustle during the day and quiet mornings and evenings at Gretchen's home. The continental breakfast was terrific. Very private. Trails nearby. Couldn't have asked for a better place to meet up with a friend for a weekend."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Gretchen's place is such a gem! Got to stay for a whole week and I had the most wonderful time. I unfortunately had to work and study during my stay, but the internet was fast and the scenery more than made up for my lack of free time. Gorgeous views of the valley and trees and, if the weather is favorable, a stunning view of St Helens (for the best view, walk a little way back along the path leading from the patio at dusk and dawn). The apartment is bright and cheerful and there are so many thoughtful touches. The space had everything I needed and then some - comfy furniture, lots of space, a small kitchen (with everything required to make simple meals), and delicious breakfast treats and coffee. My favorite thing may have been the adjacent Seminary Hill Natural Area. I walked the trails every day and it felt like I had the entire forest to myself. Thanks again for sharing your magical home, Gretchen!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"clean, comfy, and a cute place to stay! I'd stay again!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"3 of Earthfarm has a great view, a wonderful homemade continental breakfast, a comfortable bed, and if you come at the right time , the moon shines on your bed for about 4 hours."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful location- quiet and peaceful. Host is very quick to communicate and lots of great personal touches.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place in an amazing location. Peacefull and quiet but still close to restaurants, stores, etc. The breakfast and coffee were very nice touches. Recommended"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's home, grounds, and views are so lovely and welcoming. We had visits from the deer each morning as we breakfasted on the secluded patio overlooking the rural valley below. We thoroughly enjoyed the homemade granola and yummy applesauce that first morning. We've order Gretchen's forthcoming book (Oct. 2022) ""Mother Lode"" and look forward to learning more about her return to the Pacific NW after living 36 years in the Southeastern U.S."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Gretchen was wonderful! A quiet, spacious place, decorated with cheerful colors, filled with whimsical art, and over looking a valley from its perch on Seminary Hill awaits you! A family feeling permeates the place as you view Gretchen’s photographs of nature
that includes surrounding wooded paths. Seminary Hill park is very close by and offers beautiful forest trails to hike. This is a haven of peace to springboard your journey. Highly recommended."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing. clean place with great views and homemade muffins and granola for breakfast.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen is a great host! The accommodations were just what we were looking for and just as described. It is a beautiful house with lovely surrounding gardens and forest. Absolutely a retreat from the hustle and bustle of town and city!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and colorful space with a great view and a tasty complimentary breakfast.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely enjoyed every minute I was at Gretchen’s. Peaceful yet close to Centralia, I only regret that I was so busy with friends and family that I could not just spend a day soaking up the peace and beauty. I will be back"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was one our favorites to date. We do a lot of airbnb's, and this one is just so special. Especially for the nature lover and those that appreciate peace and quiet. Special touches like the homemade applesauce, muffins and granola just sent it over that perfect 10 mark. I personally loved all the beautiful books she has and so many about the mountains we visited. I think Gretchen is very special and selfless to share her beautiful home with people. Thank you so much for your beautiful heart!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an incredible oasis in the heart of Centralia! Gretchen's private guest suite felt like home away from home: from the homemade applesauce & granola that awaited us to the beautiful collection of books & eclectic photos all around, this place was truly fairyland come to life! Gretchen even went the extra mile (quite literally) by offering to drive us to nearby Centralia College when we couldn't find a ride share in the early morning hours for the Seattle to Portland ride. A whimsical retreat coupled with 100% genuine hospitality. We can't wait to stay again during our next Washington visit!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded expectations. Beautiful and spacious. The decor and little whimsical touches made me want to stay forever. And the view! Watched the moonrise from the very comfortable bed. Upon arrival, we found a fresh pitcher of filtered water, homemade muffins and apple sauce waiting for us, and a nice welcome note. Other little touches are too numerous to list, but the high quality bedding, robe, and writing utensils and space are just a few. This space is quiet and serene, just what we needed. Great location. Best Airbnb I’ve visited. Gretchen was super responsive and left clear directions. Great value too!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and home base for St. Helens and Ranier
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place! I loved my stay at Gretchen's peaceful gem. It was just what I needed to reconnect with myself and nature. My favorite thing was sitting and looking over the valley or into the trees and just soaking in the sounds and sights. It filled me up. It is also really comfortable, peaceful and well laid out. The bed and oversized chair were so plush and the muffins and granola so delicious! Thank you, Gretchen, for sharing your little pocket of peace with me!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay. Very spacious and extremely comfortable. Everything works great and although there is no full kitchen we found it easy to prepare simple meals. Great location as only 5 mins from I5 yet incredibly peaceful. Gretchen is a wonderful host.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second stay at Gretchen’s wonderful place. Such a nice peaceful stay.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Wonderful host!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first impression of walking through the entrance is that you are stepping into a Pedro Almodóvar inspired space: harmony based on simplicity and a symphony of bold colors. It is thoughtfully designed and artistic. The room is complementary to the breathtaking scenery. Gretchen placed freshly picked “forget-me-not” flowers next to our bed which was very touching and definitely unforgettable. Combined with utmost care, cleanliness, and heartwarming hospitality we had the perfect get away experience. Highly recommended!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great stay!! :) everything was absolutely perfect! Location was fantastic. We’d absolutely stay here again.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen’s place is amazing! Quiet and absolutely beautiful. We stayed 2 nights, and I was amazed that we were still finding little “happies” when we were packing up.
Thanks for such a great stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A charming place that makes it easy to relax, unwind and enjoy the beautiful views and surroundings. The unit is a creatively decorated one bedroom, very suitable for a single or a couple looking for a unique setting. Nothing corporate cookie cutter about Gretchen's place! And that is a good thing if you are open to a place that is an artistic expression (and a tasteful and whimsical one that at) of Gretchen's love of the outdoors. Found it refreshing to be somewhere with a tv and lots of electronics. There was adequate wifi and I did bring a small cd player for music. Even though the unit is on the lower level of a house (with separate entrance) there was lots of privacy and Gretchen was not an intrusive host. The place is only a mile from downtown Centralia, but it seems to be a whole way. Thanks Gretchen for making this such a pleasant stay!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a lovely place that is everything promised and more!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I passed on an evening meeting to get back to walk the trails and watch the valley below. Great place to chill. On my list of places to stay again.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a nice place and a beautiful location. We stayed here to ride in the Cascadia Super G gravel bike race.
Centralia is a really cool little town and we'll definitely visit again. There's a lot of great restaurants, historic buildings, and fun shops on the main strip.
There's also a bird sanctuary on a short walk through the woods that was quite enjoyable."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm pretty sure the birds love this place as much as I do. Everything was perfect, from the delicious breakfast to the cozy space, to the morning birdsong seranade. Always five star ☆☆☆☆☆"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb. Gretchen was wonderful to answer all my questions and ease my concerns before I made my reservation. Three of Earth Farm was a great choice. I had a wonderful 5-day stay, a sort of mini-retreat.
Some of the highlights:
* Sitting on the private patio and seeing eagles, hawks and vultures soar overhead
* Really enjoying the sense of space being above things by seeing the valley below, the hills in the distance... and Mt. St. Helens!
* Spending time every day in the Seminary Hill Natural Area - accessed by a great trail right from the property. Magnificent trees and woods, lush green colors, wonderful trails (some more challenging than others), beautiful sounds (especially all the different birds), benches along the way and more.
* Enjoying Gretchen's healthy, thoughtful and delicious breakfasts: homemade granola, applesauce and muffins with fresh yogurt. Yum! Plus, having a small kitchenette was great for meal flexibility.
* And so much more!
Gretchen's photos and descriptions on the Airbnb page do a great job giving an accurate sense of the place.
There were a few things that surprised me a bit. I share these with the hope I can help others not be surprised. There was a little musty smell when I walked in. After a few hours I didn't notice it anymore. I'm sensitive to noises and the place was noisier than I expected: trains in the valley randomly day and night, some road/highway noise in the valley, cattle mooing into the night (sometimes waking me up), the fridge and space heaters were pretty noisy. The place was colder than I expected. None of these things were bad and I adjusted to them.
Thank you, Gretchen, for a wonderful experience!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen’s home is a real gem. It is so peaceful & comfortable. She fulfills her desire to put the ‘B’ in AirB&B wonderfully with her special homemade treats. Communication was always good. Wish I could have stayed longer.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great spot! It was cozy and awesome after a long day out on the trails. Gretchen was a great communicator throughout our trip and was very helpful:) She even included a complimentary breakfast of yogurt, homemade granola, apple sauce and homemade muffins, I’d come back for the breakfast alone!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely hideaway, above the bustle of town, but close enough to get out and about easily. The rooms were filled with lovely furniture, charming art pieces, photos, plenty of books on the region, nature, art, and more. The breakfast was delightful, and made it so we could get out early for our adventures. Everything we needed for our short stay. And the view was stunning. Thanks for arranging those sunsets and sunrises!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this whimsical place. The view outside the window is gorgeous. Gretchen left delicious muffins, yogurt, granola and applesauce for our breakfast. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gretchen’s place is beautiful; wildlife abounds!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wish we could've have stayed longer! The location, view, décor, continental breakfast - all wonderful! So much color and art inside, and even more to see outside as well with a valley view, private patio, and grounds to explore. Great directions, easy check in, responsive host. This is easily one of my top airbnb faves!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely little gem!!! The location is perfect …just a short drive away from town. This little suite is a quiet little place with a beautiful view of the valley. Easy to find and very easy check in. The space is very colorful and neatly furnished. Gretchen is a very thoughtful and caring host!!! She took the time to create a cozy environment with many personal touches. I enjoyed the fun colors and all the art so tastefully arranged to make the place warm and welcoming. I worked at night and got home in the morning just in time to watch the sunrise. It was soooo quiet and peaceful. The bed was also comfy and had very soft bedding! The outside patio and garden area are very nicely set up. Good place to relax and read or just enjoy nature. I enjoyed the birds and the faint sound of chimes outside the window. The breakfast was amazing! Couldn’t ask for more! The homemade granola, muffins and yogurt were something to look forward to :). The kitchenette had everything one needs to cook simple meals. I had a very good experience and had everything I needed. I loved every minute of my stay!! Thank you for being a wonderful hostess of such a cozy little place!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a beautiful stay in the lower level of a home, with a gorgeous view from every room. There are spaces to read, to lounge, to write, and to create art. The homemade granola and muffins provided made for a perfect morning snack. The kitchenette (hot plate, microwave, refrigerator) was just enough to make simple meals, and Gretchen provided a dish tub for doing the dishes. There were lovely trails to walk, and birds to watch every morning. Gretchen was communicative, and it was very obvious how much she cared about our experience."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful experience! This is quite possibly my favorite AirBnb I’ve visited. A previous review called it a “balm for the soul” and I couldn’t agree more. Gretchen was so kind and considerate in every aspect of my stay. The space itself is absolutely delightful, cozy, and full of thoughtful touches. The natural beauty on/around the property cannot be overstated— getting to watch the fog roll through the valley was just magic. Not to mention the continental breakfast! Oh my word. I left feeling nourished, inspired, and well rested. Thank you Gretchen, and I hope to come visit again soon!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a home away from home! My husband and I spent a few nights here and it was so comforting. We couldn’t have asked for a better place! Gretchen thought out every detail of the place and the colors are so fun! The second you step in you feel like you can relax and just be in that space. It’s so in tune with nature, and I was able to see a hummingbird for the first time just hanging out by the garden. We were also able to see some deer and wake up to the birds singing in the morning. If you need a space to reset and feel like you’re connected to the environment around you, definitely take a chance and stay here!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five star stay ! Honestly, I love this airbnb. Gretchen has planned for every need and the breakfast part of this beautiful place is beyond compare. Those muffins (swoon) ... Seriously amazing. Clean, cozy and a visual delight. Can't wait to return !"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really special one-of-a-kind place! Fully furnished with many personal touches. You can tell how much Gretchen loves this place and is so generous to share it with guests! Wish I had more time to enjoy it.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"A perfect place to stay and a great location! Outside city limits where it was quiet, serene, peaceful and absolutely gorgeous sunrises right outside our door/window! Gretchen was so quick to offer suggestions when asked and very prompt with any questions we had! A great host!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place to stay. Beautiful views and cozy area and very clean. We give it 5 stars!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a home base between Olympic and Rainier National Parks and Gretchen's place in Centralia was perfect. The town is a bit small for our taste but there were plenty of bars and restaurants in neighboring cities like Olympia. Gretchen's apartment is very artsy, and full of color and little trinkets to enjoy. Since we stayed for five nights we were so glad to have the mini kitchenette with the hot plate, fridge and more. Bring your own shampoo and conditioner but she has literally everything else for you. The internet is pretty good too. My partner and I were both on video calls for work and it was mostly great. Download speeds are slow but we only needed to download large files a couple times. Gretchen was so sweet and replied to messages quickly. Easy check in and check out. Thanks!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, thoughtfully and carefully put together guest suite. The host clearly cares about her place. Nice outdoor hanging-out with a view, when the weather is nice. Gretchen is communicative and easy to interact with."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchens place is the perfect location if you are planning on exploring the Mt St Helens region!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen is a superb host. Her place is warm and comfortable and in the most perfect natural setting. There is nothing not to enjoy. Make a visit there to enjoy the tranquility and the beauty of the surroundings by hiking on Seminary Hill.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen is a great host and wonderful person and we enjoyed talking with her. Her place is immaculate and has neat little artistic touches everywhere. She leaves homemade granola and muffins and yogurt -very good. The outside patio and garden area are gorgeous and we saw some deer one morning. Her whole property is beautiful with a great view of the valley below. There is a fun walk in the Seminary Hill woods right from her yard. All in all- a great place.
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen was great at communicating and very helpful with planing our stay. Check in and check out was easy. The only improvement suggested would be a larger bed.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen has a beautiful place here, she was more than willing to answer questions and go the extra mile for us, will be back for sure!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stayed with Gretchen for the second time. Her place is cozy and quiet with peaceful surroundings and beautiful views. Perfect place to retreat after a long day or for some writing/creative time. Plus tasty muffins and granola/yogurt for breakfast! Thank you Gretchen!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's place is magical! It's a cozy place to get away from the city and enjoy nature, whether from outside or admiring the views from inside. Gretchen has thought of everything we could have needed and more, and messaged us to make sure our stay was perfect. My husband and I highly recommend this airbnb!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's place is a peaceful haven with hiking trails that start on the property, lots of personal touches including great books to read and a yummy breakfast including homemade granola. Gretchen is the most generous and welcoming host!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far one of the best Airbnb’s in the country. We have traveled to many places and we were floored with views, hospitality, and location! You will not regret staying here as Gretchen goes above and beyond for her guests! Make sure to do as many of the things she recommends as possible, eat the muffins, write in her book, and enjoy the incredible views! This is truly an exceptional place to stay. We were legit sad to come home."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Don't hesitate to book this sweet, magical place - If you're looking to decompress, nothing could be more perfect! Gretchen is an attentive, thoughtful host who has obviously put both love and care into every detail she can think of for her guests. Others have listed them, so I'll just say it was delightful and made me happy each day to wake up and go to sleep each of the 4 days/nights I was there!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was one of the most peaceful and relaxing places i’ve stayed- if you like PCNW nature and art, you will LOVE this walk out apartment with an idyllic view!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen’s place is a nice little getaway tucked on top of a hill with beautiful views right from the window. Very well equipped, just as described and less than 5 min drive to town center. Gretchen is a gracious host and has taken care of everything you may need; have to mention the delicious muffins :) There are trails steps from her place and are a joy to explore, wish we’d more time to do that."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen’s place is one of the best Air BnB’s I’ve ever stayed at. It’s incredibly comfortable (including the furniture…and the bed!! The bed!! 🙌🏾), attractive, super clean, and very private. I absolutely love taking a quiet personal retreat there. There is so much to do right outside the door too…so if you don’t want to drive after you arrive, you can hike, walk, sit in the garden or meadow, or relax on the patio. And the views are sublime. Seriously, if I could, I’d MOVE into this place. Gretchen is also a wonderful host…communicative, helpful if needed, friendly, and private. And her muffins and granola are to die.for. I really cannot recommend her place highly enough."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's one-bedroom apartment is artistic, cozy, clean, and comfortable -- a home away from home! There is a nice view of Mt. St. Helens, and a nice garden. The location is closer to Mt. St. Helens (90 min), but two hours drive to the Mt. Rainier National Park. The village of Centralia is historic and nice, with shops, grocery stores, and restaurants. My daughter and I have really enjoyed our 4-day stay there! I would highly recommend it to anyone! Gretchen is very responsive to our requests, kindly made muffins /breakfast, and shared her tips for sightseeing. Many thanks, Gretchen for kindly sharing your warm home!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I booked a 6 night stay at Gretchen’s for Karla, a Boston friend; following is her review, which makes me hope I’ll some day get to enjoy an extended stay there too:
Three of Earth Farm is balm for the soul. Gretchen has created a peaceful, private, spacious and sparkling clean, nest-like retreat. The bed is supportive and comfortable with a view of Mt Rainier, (on a sunny day), and the bed linens are as smooth and soft as silk. Gretchen has thought of every last detail in creating her space to be as functional and convenient as possible; including a first aid kit and umbrella! She has a wonderful library of maps and trail guides/books as well as books about the PNW and nature in general. Plus, the hiking trailhead for Seminary Hill Natural Area is literally steps from your door. Gretchen is also super knowledgeable about exploring and hiking in these forests. 10 Stars!
Karla"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place is clean and so close to the town and where our VB venue was. It had all the primary needs.
Gretchen is a great host and made sure we had all the things we needed, super thoughtful home made goodiesfor breakfast were a hit!! Highly recommend."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, cozy, cozy! It's about a three-minute drive from Tower Street, the main drag in lovely old Centralia. Gretchen knows all the hikes on Mount St. Helens and answered all of my questions almost immediately. I wanted to see the mountain go pink at sunset from the back yard but I was too tuckered from hiking. It had everything I needed for a weekend away on my own :)"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen’s suite is fantastic. It’s secluded and so incredibly peaceful. You’re very close to downtown Centralia for exploring. The muffins, yogurt, and granola were a lovely surprise and oh so delicious! My only regret is not spending more time there exploring."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic little gem with dynamite view. Breakfast provided was excellent, lots of room, very cozy. Would stay again!"

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's place was peaceful, cozy, clean, and had everything I needed (plus delicious homemade muffins!) after some very long days. The location is gorgeous and the pictures don't do it justice. I wish I had more time to explore the woodland trails but I hope to be back the next time I'm in the area."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place with a unique touch. Will stay here again.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen's space is a peaceful retreat. Gretchen is an incredibly hospitable host taking great care in providing personalized recommendations and delicious homemade treats that give the space the extra special touch.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,So much bliss in this lovely place. Thank you for another wonderful mini-retreat and all the thoughtful touches.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen is an angel on earth. The place was a perfect home away from home. Her property is basically situated on top of a nature preserve with many trails, interesting history, and variety of animals, plants and old trees. One wall of the space including the bedroom is all windows letting natural light pour in. A doe and her two babies were living on the property and two mornings in a row I woke up to find them foraging through the huge window within feet of where I was laying. She stocked the place with delicious homemade granola, muffins, and a honey/lemon spread along with fresh yogurt. Do yourself a favor and stay here!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gretchen is super friendly and her breakfast was amazing. The garden is beautiful and the fire pit was an added bonus to this unique space.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is truly balm to the soul. Five-star everything ! Thanks to the birds and the wild landscape, it hits every sensory note and feels like a private wonderland. I will always remember my time here. "
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at Gretchen's place! It was the perfect central location for exploring the national parks we were interested in. The space was large and inviting with so many thoughtful touches. Gretchen was incredibly easy to communicate with and she made the most delightful muffins, granola and applesauce. It was such a treat! She also took great care to make sure everything was sanitized and clean and we felt very safe.
Sadly, we didn't get a chance to meet Gretchen in person but we'll definitely stay here again on the next PNW trip!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at 3 of Earth Farm was everything I had hoped for, and more. I took a week for quiet, reflective self retreat and couldn’t have chosen a better place to do so. The living space itself is welcoming, spacious, comfortable, and has a warm, loving vibe. The location is superb for one who appreciates peace and nature. A view from your window and baby deer on your porch!
I felt blessed to be able to walk the miles of trails of the beautiful forested natural area in the literal backyard. You can feel the dedication and appreciation that has preserved and grown the forested area over the years and let the healing power of nature soak into your bones.
As a host Gretchen was simply wonderful. She made my stay exactly what I hoped it would be, a quiet, comforting, healing time. I think even if you stayed just a night you’d leave 3 of Earth Farm feeling better than when you arrived, but better yet to stay at least a few."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's guest suite is absolutely beautiful, I could not have asked for a better blessing during a stressful trip. Her beautiful property is literally a breath of fresh air, serenity at its finest. I am so grateful for her hospitality. Also, the muffins were fantastic!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had the best stay at Gretchen's place...the setting is absolute heaven with a spectacular view. We brought firewood & enjoyed relaxing at the firepit. Hiked the woody trails just outside our door & then went to town for some shopping. So quick to get there & found some great treasures.
The suite was bigger than expected & decorated with so much artsy detail. Bed was super comfy & we loved all the little extra touches you don't normally get at other Air B & Bs. Highly recommend this enchanting little retreat!!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I recently learned that in the hour just before dawn, birds sing to announce they have made it safely through another night. Every morning of my stay I heard this joyous noise. That would have been enough. But there are also mountain views, trails through the woods, a cozy bed, a beautifully decorated suite and the best homemade breakfast around. I'm a return guest, many times over, and I am already looking forward to my next trip. Thank you, Gretchen. "
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful view, excellent communications, and homemade goodies waiting for us in the apartment!"

I would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Centralia :)"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Gretchen's place was great! All the pictures and descriptions are spot on. If you can book some time here, I give it my highest recommendation!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are in the area, definitely plan a stay at Gretchen's beautiful farm! Upon arriving, you immediately feel peace and joy. Take time to look through her books in the space, the photos on the walls and the cute and whimsical decorations. Next time I'm passing through, I'm hoping to stay for more than just one night!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is so cute! Super relaxing and the view out back is beautiful. Tucked away in the trees for the best little weekend getaway!

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Three of Earth was such a tranquil retreat and was exactly what was needed to slow an extraordinarily busy life to a pace in tune with nature.

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whether you are passing through Centralia and need a restful break in your travels, or are looking for an escape to a peaceful destination, you cannot do better than Three of Earth Farm. The bnb is one of our very favorites ever, and Gretchen is an exemplary host. The location is stunning. Sip your coffee on the patio as dawn brightens the sky over Mount St. Helens, and birds call through the mists. Wander through the bnb, marveling at the many, amazingly artistic touches. I never had the feeling that it was decorated with castoffs, but instead with thoughtful pieces of beauty, many of them functional. Do yourself a favor and book this place. It is food for the soul. We certainly will visit again, and next time it may even be the destination, rather than simply a stopover."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One of the nicest places I've stayed. I wish I had more time here. Highlights were the delicious breakfast, firepit and seeing beautiful deer in the meadow. I want to live here 😍"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gretchen's suite probably tops our list of all the airbnbs we have stayed in. It is super clean, stylish, and has a definite retreat/spiritual dimension to it. Gretchen is also a wonderful person who we are so glad to have met."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I stayed at Gretchen’s place for a night while attending a wedding in Centralia.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little gem is what airbnb was made for. It’s such a nice little place with so much thought spent on ever little detail. Outstanding breakfast and one of the best sleeps of my life. We hope to come back soon.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay here. Cheerful and friendly, Gretchen welcomed us with a hug and gave us tips about the area. The granola, applesauce, and muffins were all homemade, definitely a notch above the usual fare as well as delicious. I enjoyed the artistic touches; it was like a treasure hunt to me to see what Gretchen tucked in somewhere next. Not to be missed is the gorgeous scenery, wildlife, and a lovely view of Mt. St. Helens . It would definitely be a joy to stay here again."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a great home! Gretchen's homemade goods were amazing.

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Can use note to Gretchen. 😊
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful piece of serenity! Fresh muffins were amazing, and lots of tips for local hotspots and hiking!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything about 3 of Earth Farm is welcoming and cheerful. The simple breakfast is full of flavor and freshness and delight. The location is beautiful and soothing. The accommodations are clean and beautiful, full of color and whimsy. Staying here is like participating in a fabulous piece of art."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We highly recommend a stay at Gretchen's 3 of Earth Farm. The apartment overlooked the valley and was a very quiet and serene place to stay. The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was impressed with most everything. First, the place is large enough to be an apartment, all it would need is a kitchen. Next, she adds some personal touches to make you feel welcomed, including freshly made muffins. I arrived late, but it was not a problem, and I let myself in. You get a carport spot, private bathroom, and plenty of space for 2 people (possibly more but there is only a full size bed). She provides a ton of travel info, including tales of growing up in the area. I'd definitely stay again."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Falling asleep watching the stars is the most underrated experience in the world. From that bed you fall asleep to those starry skies and wake to singing birds. Breakfast goodies are the best you'll find anywhere and Gretchen is pure joy.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A whimsical, happy and lovely place. Three of the Earth is a delight. It’s comfy and roomy. Gretchen’s granola is even better than mine, her applesauce and muffins are simply delicious. This Airbnb is a treat to all your senses.
Gretchen was kind and set up her air mattress for us. My hubby and I are use to a king bed so the double bed would be a squeeze.
Be sure and check out Hub Bub, a wonderful shop filled with handmade treasures in Centralia. The owner is one of the sisters of Three of the Earth."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful spot in the world ! Comfortable place to rest and write from. Whispering trees and a visiting hummingbird . Enjoyed my quiet time on my own, but also the little town is fun to explore and the merchants are very friendly and kind. Gretchen is a wonderful host !"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a magical fairyland place, with a stunning view, gorgeous colors and lovely whimsical touches. So glad we made the trip from Mount Rainier, and stayed here on our way to Portland."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very quaint place!! What a gem!! Quiet and close to town. Very spacious. Would recommend this place to my family and friends. Gretchen is prompt and a wonderful host. Thank you, Gretchen!!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I did the STP and her place wasn't far from the midway point. It was just what I needed when I was done. Her bed was great and so were her yummy treats. Next time I do the ride I will stay here again!
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's home far exceeded my expectations. The location, on the border of Seminary Hill Park and overlooking a beautiful farming valley, is awesome. Gretchen has decorated her home with artistic and spiritual touches. And the muffin with apple sauce, granola, and yogart breakfast! My stay at Gretchen's was perfect."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Gretchen's space is spectacular. A welcome respite for anyone seeking solitude and quiet. We loved it.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a lovely and restful place to stay. Beautiful surroundings and plenty of spots inside and out to relax and enjoy nature. Will be back again if I'm ever back in Centralia.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen's home was a delightful experience. There was plenty of space with the bedroom and the living room with a lovely view outside all of the windows. She was very communicative prior to our arrival, including directions as we arrived after dark. There was also a great breakfast spread for each morning that was there when we arrived including granola, muffins, and applesauce, all homemade! She even made us some GF trail bars. The bed was very comfortable and the room was dark in the mornings, even with the large windows. We had a very comfortable stay and highly recommend it to others."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gretchen is such a lovely host. And her place is a little gem tucked away in a wooded area and so it stays cool even in warmer weather. We also got to see the deer up close in their garden in the meadow! It's such a serene environment and it was great to wake up to a great view. Her place is so unique and different from many airbnb places we've stayed in. I absolutely loved the breakfast options. It's a pity we needed to leave early for our visit to Mt. Rainier so we didn't get to try the vegan granola and apple sauce but the muffins were delicious! I would absolutely book this place again if we're ever in that area again. I highly recommend this place and try to stay longer than a day! Thank you so much, Gretchen!"
2019-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice space. The train horn blew every hour or so all night long, though, so bring a pair of earplugs if you're a light sleeper."

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gretchen’s Farm, 3 of Earth, is an exquisite place to stay. Quiet, beautiful, bright, sparkling clean, and wonderful amenities like homemade granola and muffins, wonderful yogurt, and yummy coffee. The furniture is truly comfortable and inviting. One could NOT ask for anything more. Oh! And the bed! Comfy and wonderful linens with plenty of pillows, and an outstanding view of the valley and Mt. St. Helens! I never wanted to leave...♥️ (Writers: this is an outstanding place to stay to get some serious writing done.) Truly one of the best Air BnB’s I’ve ever stayed in. ♥️"

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cozy little cottage is a perfect little get away spot. The decor is amazing and very tasteful. Hosts are responsive and helpful. There are some fun games and cute restaurants and shops close by. Only downside is the lack of kitchen ware. There is a sink and microwave as well as a mini forge and popcorn maker! But don’t count on a stovetop or oven.

,,,It’s a scam
,,,"The hot water heater was not working, had taken a cold shower the first night. I reached out to host and they responded very late saying someone would be out to look at it. Nobody showed up. The host finally said the hot water heater should get replaced. We still had two nights to stay there with cold showers. I had 2 very small children with us and the ladder that goes to the loft rolls, which they have blocked with door stops, but as your walking up the ladder it still rolls out from under you. Very unsafe. There was an electrical outlet in the bathroom that was pulled away from wall exposing bare wires where children can reach. The bathroom had dirty mud smeared baseboards."
