The three bedrooms were perfect for my husband, our two big dogs, my mother-in-law and aunt to all have our own space. The living spaces were really cute, cozy and perfect for unwinding at the end of the day. The kitchen and bathrooms were very clean and had all the essentials without being cluttered which made it easy to find anything we needed. Kelley was responsive and friendly, and when I asked to extend the reservation she was accommodating. There were more local restaurants in the area than I had anticipated which was a nice surprise! We especially liked Morning by Morning coffee shop and Tap and Pour brewery."

Elaine’s place was sparkling clean and she was a gracious and helpful host. She was very helpful, very quick to communicate and address our queries and followed up to ensure we were happy. The decor was modern and new. And the floor treatments practical. Thoughtful touches like some complimentary snacks and coffee pods. The bed although new was not quite supportive enough for us. The kitchen could do with a couple more large saucepans, salad bowl and Pyrex jug/bowl for microwave. Use of the vacuum requires hearing protection."

Marquita's communication was great, and check-in was simple and straightforward. The inside was nicely decorated and seemed to have been remodeled (bathrooms, bedrooms, living room). It was well stocked with towels and extra blankets/throws, and kitchen needs. The kitchen was also quite large, which was a pleasant surprise. Everything (the plumbing, air conditioning, cable TV, wifi, water pressure, etc.) all worked well. Just no issues to speak of."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was a very nice home with comfortable beds and all the amenities. I would definitely stay with Marquita again.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Near restaurants and base. Worked out great to meet family nearby.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place felt like home the instant we walked in the door. We are from Cape Cod, and the beachy and rustic themes felt so comforting. The owners thought of absolutely every detail, from puzzles and games for our daughter, to a lovely coffee center, interesting coffee table books, Netflix and TVs in the bedrooms, and bottled water in the fridge. The high ceilings and cottage-style doors were beautiful.
Additionally, their thoughtfulness was over the top. We had come to town to take placement of a newborn in a private adoption, but sadly the match failed at the last minute when the birth mother decided to parent. Not only did they allow us to change our reservation, but they also checked in to see how we were holding up emotionally and told us they were praying for us. So kind and personal.
We would 100% stay here again in the future if we're in the area. Not only that, but I've made notes of home decor ideas I want to use in our own home!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing stay and everything was great! It was a perfect spot to stay with my elderly parents and having everything on one level was so helpful.

The sofa included blue and gray pillows and a swivel chair. Each flat screen television was already set up with the wifi and the codes were located on the coffee station table. The directions included how to care for the house and how to shut down before your departure. The master suite was elegant which included a large bedroom, spacious bathroom, and walk in closet.

They outdid any super host we have stayed in. The place was adorable with all the decorations , the most comfortable beds, very clean, the kitchen very stocked with just about everything you need to cook any meal, and the area centrally located to everything. Very safe place to stay. We loved every bit of our stay. Our kids were so impressed with everything and wanted the host to know how much they loved it. Thank you Hannah and Lilly for opening your home to us. I know they will be super hosts soon. We came to see my daughter’s boyfriend who is stationed at Robins so being very close to base was another plus. If you are ever in the area give them a try as you won’t be disappointed. We will definitely stay again if ever in the area. Very responsive hosts as well."

Fully furnished with everything & more for a nights stay including an electric hot water pot, tea, coffee, sugar, and creamer as well as a tray of ice cubes in the freezer and bottled water in the fridge.. I was able to make my coffee when I arrived and let it chill to refrigerate for iced coffee in the morning.. Loved the hot shower and the heater to turn on in the morning to get the chill off.. top it off the landscape was so beautiful around the cabin. I transport a car from Florida every spring as well as return it six months later for friends who winter there and this charm will be my new stop. THANKS AMOS"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tiny house was easy to maneuver in. Plenty of lighting. Easy to step up onto deck in front of house. Dead end cul de sac. Extremely good, private parking. I thought from photos would be in country but it was in a neighborhood
i arrived after dark so really never saw the extent of the property, so walked my dog instead. Very quiet. Everything was very neat.
Heating unit was noisy, but I was so tired I went to sleep. Bed was good. Could use another ""crunchable"" pillow.
I left very early and never got to comment to host.
It would have been helpful to have salt and pepper. I brought leftovers and only one pot & paper dishes, no fry pan. Shower was fine.
I think couple extra rugs would be good as I was tracking in leaves as it was pouring rain the whole trip, also an extra towel to catch water on floor when one showers. Hated to use a white towel on the floor. And new dish scrubbers and dish towel.
It is pleasant and good w/a pet."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"As always our Thanksgiving stay was amazing! Couldn’t ask for a better host! Clean, cozy, warm, accommodating, close to restaurants, movies, mall, and visiting family! We’ll see you again soon!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the 2nd time I stayed at Amos’ place and have already booked a 3rd stay. It’s perfect for me to catch some sleep and a shower while traveling.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amos has a clean place that beats a highway motel in price. He offers a great value for any traveler. Plenty to eat in the surrounding town. Sure, it's bare bones, but it has what you need to set you up for the overnight. A reviewer mentioned how low the ceilings were, but they weren't that low to me at 5'10"" there was easily another 9 inches above and this only in the front and above the bed, the rest was high up above. Can park right near the front door -easy in and out. Definitely a good value."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I Highly Recommend this spot. The Home is completely private, and it's adorable. it has a very nice interior and is comfortable and clean. the house had great wifi, everything worked, had a decent TV, and my favorite part is the water gets hot! I thought this could've been a issue with a tiny house but I was wrong! not to mention the garden that surrounds the house is wonderful. the house is closer to the main house than it seems in photos, but Im okay with that. You also do get your own space for a car right next to the house. Lastly, the host were very friendly and understanding of any situation you may have going on. they will not make you feel rushed or forced to do anything. Definitely will come back if I need somewhere to stay!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I selected this listing for my first Airbnb experience because the price was fantastic & the home was private! I felt that I got a lot for the small $ that I paid. To begin with, it was nice having a dedicated parking spot next to the house.
When I drove up, I was immediately drawn to the lovely flowers surrounding the tiny home. I need to come back when it is not in the height of a Georgia summer heat wave & enjoy his beautiful flowers.
Speaking of heat-wave, Amos had the space nice & cool when I arrived. The tiny home has an air conditioner & a tower fan. The tower fan was a nice addition since I like to sleep with a fan.
The listing was exactly as described & pictured in the listing. I especially appreciated the dedicated workspace. Everything was clean & thoughtfully arranged to maximize space.
The only thing I would change is the addition of a hair dryer. I saw from the listing that I would have to bring mine from home. Otherwise, everything was delightful.
Thanks, Amos!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled alone and the fact that the tiny house is situated behind the main house made me feel safe. I had a few encounters with Amos and his wife, who were very friendly on all occasions. This house suited me for the two weeks I stayed in Warner Robins. 🙂"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good place for an overnight stay. Very friendly hosts.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amos was a very nice host and very friendly. It was a cute and great place for our layover….thanks Amos. Would definitely recommend him and his Tiny House and stay there again 😎
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect stop for sleep & shower while traveling. Had cargo on top of my car & could sleep peacefully without worrying about it like I would’ve at a hotel. So happy to have found Amos’s Tiny House!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another great stay! Will come back again. I enjoyed a quiet and peaceful stay, and the landscaping and flowers around the tiny home are wonderful. Thanks again!"
2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Overall for the cheap price, it wasn’t a bad stay. However if you are over 6 feet tall, this may not be the best house for you. 2/3rds of the ceilings in this house are very low. I almost hit my head and wasn’t able to walk under the light on the ceiling without hitting my head. I could barely sit on the toilet because my knees touched the wall in front of me.
The location felt a little sketchy. The house next door had its windows boarded up and quite a bit of traffic in and out throughout the evening. I also felt like in the pictures, the house is back a little from the main house, but it is really right behind it.
The host came out to his garage with his dog while I was sitting on the deck attached to our place, just enjoying the weather. I tried speaking with him, said hi, how was his evening, and got no response. I repeated myself, I asked if he needed me to go in so he could let his dog use the restroom, no response. He just stood there and watched me until I went inside."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amos is a wonderful host. I have stayed several times on my road trip through the area. A tiny house that is just right for me for the night. Nice to see the gardens this time.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Waaaaaayyyy better than staying at a hotel! Amos has a beautiful tiny home that is securely safe and easy to find! We loved staying there and personally he has the pretties little pup!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved my stay at the tiny house! I work 12 hrs night shift and slept during the day. It was so peaceful and quiet!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh, I really super enjoyed my stay at this Airbnb. It was the cutest little house that had been thoughtfully decorated. there was a combination lock on the little house, therefore, I felt very safe. They have a fence with a gate so when you park you feel like your car is very safe in there. Do you even have your own parking spot? That does not interfere with the owners parking. The neighborhood was nice and the house is on a cul-de-sac. It was like they thought of everything. It was painted pretty inside and had an air conditioner and a hot shower and the bathroom smelled really fantastic. They had nice white, crisp, clean towels, and a television also. They had coffee and creamer and sugar and a little kitchen table. The pictures really don’t do it justice because it was plenty big enough and not tiny or small at all. There were flowers in the yard and it was a very peaceful place. The host was very responsive and friendly. This is probably my favorite Airbnb that I have stayed at."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Literally the best bang for your buck! Used Amos’ place as a resting spot for our travels from Little Rock Arkansas to Orlando Florida. Very quiet and soooooo cute!!!!!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I am a returning customer. Never disappointed. I will be back. Thanks Amos!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a tiny house in a residential neighborhood. It was perfect for my 2 dogs and me. The yard is fenced in which gave the dogs some space. For a tiny house the inside has just the right amount of furnishings leaving open space as to not feel cramped. Amos and his wife were nearby, extremely friendly and helpful but not intrusive. I could not have found a better place to stay for our special event."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amos and his wife were very nice and friendly. Their place is clean and cute and the location was in a nice neighborhood. The yard and garden were lovely and the parking was in a gated yard. My only challenge with the place was that the bed felt really hard to me, so i didn't sleep well. I know I like a softer bed than most people, so you might find it fine for you."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,‘‘Twas Lit

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"As a woman traveling alone with a big dog, I can't say enough in praise of Amos's tidy tiny house, Mrs. Amos's friendly welcome, and the restful stay I had with them. The house is small, clean, and comfortable. I parked inside the gate and next to the house which has a large deck in front. My dog played with the hosts' wonderful dog in their lovely, fenced, flower-filled back yard. Amos and his wife are good at putting travelers at ease but also giving guests lots of space -- they are clearly experienced Inn keepers. I felt 100% safe! I'll book here again and again when I make the drive from Miami to Iowa City."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny home is bigger of what I expected, cute and very comfortable. It had everything I needed for my stay. A little far from downtown Macon but not a big issue for us. The AC worked great and the bed was hard but our backs needed a firm mattress so we liked it.
Overall the house clean and cozy."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was clean. Cheryl was very informative and helpful. The dogs loved having a big fenced-in yard to run around in and the neighborhood was pretty quiet. Also located really close to the base, grocery stores, and lots of restaurants. Very convenient!"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Thanks for sharing the home with us. It was very dog friendly and we appreciated the fenced in back yard. One of the cleanest Airbnbs I’ve stayed in and we travel a lot.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Cheryl was amazing. She was very responsive and she has a great eye for decorating . There were a couple of minor issues that she was able to get resolved quickly.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Peaceful, clean, exactly as described. Great fenced-in backyard (very small dogs might be able to escape out a few gaps along the back fence line.) I had a few minor glitches on check-in, but Cheryl went above & beyond to resolve them. For you bath lovers out there, the master bath tub was AWESOME. Main bedroom was extremely spacious w/attached bath, other 2 BRS were quite small but that wasn't an issue for me as it was just one person."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This Airbnb is comfy and cozy. It was just the right size for our party of 5. Beds were comfy. The backyard is huge. We had everything we needed. Host is so very accommodating and goes above and beyond.Would definitely stay again!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I cannot say enough good things about this beautiful home. Our family had such a great time, with so much quality time in nature. We fell asleep under trees, watched the animals and took in all of the beauty. It truly feels like a home away from home. The house is beautiful, it’s so adorable yet has amazing little touches showing the history. The animals are such an added bonus to go watch. I could go on and on. My son goes to college nearby and I hope to continue staying here with my family each time we come."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wow! What a great place to split up a roadtrip especially with young kids! The place was immaculate and SO many amazing touches from soaps to fresh eggs!

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Miranda was so kind! It was my daughters 16th bday and she left a balloon and some flowers for her to find. The property is LOVELY, the goat soap is a nice touch.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful, cute, and charming property! Stayed 3 nights with our family of 5.

House is very clean, cozy, and has all the comforts of home. Communication with Miranda was great, she made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. If returning to the area we will definitely be staying here again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I recently visited Miranda's beautiful house this past weekend for my son's wrestling tournament in Perry. All I can say is WOW. Her place was so quaint and beautifully decorated. Staying at an AirBNB on a farm is the best way to go when you have 3 kids. Great memories were made just letting the boys run around like kids should do the entire time - playing with the ducks, watching the chickens, and petting the adorably sweet baby goats that were only a week old! Not only that, but the young gentleman who tends to the animals brought us a fresh batch of eggs the very first day, and I can honestly say they were the best eggs I've ever eaten in my life! Everyone was so sweet to work with and Miranda was so communicative! Great experience all around!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a beautiful welcoming home, nicely decorated, and very clean and comfortable! All accommodations were provided and a little extra too. There is a pond, swings, and screened in gazebo that’s relaxing and peaceful. The host was friendly and helpful. This was one of our best Airbnb experiences. The one mistake we made was not staying longer!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So I went to this place and I was hooping that it would be super nice and I went with a 10-year-old boy and a 11-month chill chill chill-old daughter that just learned how to walk. The cool part was we got to play ping-pong for hours while the baby was walking around the room and she was just short enough to go under the table without hitting her head. It was awesome. They do have wonderful hibachi down the street so we did that and then we went back the next day and got sushi from the same spot, and then, of course, cookout has the best cheer wine floats in America. The house was big wonderful and clean, and I really like the bed in the master bedroom."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, Quiet, Nice place to stay but still close to everything"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cheryl’s place matched the description listing well and was a great price for the entire house. The game room and enclosed patios were fun for everyone!

Cheryl is a great host. Easy to work with, very responsive to any and all needs, and communication was very quick.
I will book again with Cheryl when back in the area, and highly recommend her as a host! Thanks for a great 5 days!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Was traveling for work, it was a very clean place. Convenient to everything. Would definitely stay there again!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were here for the weekend in Warner Robins. For a three bedroom with a game room, and lots of space , the price was not bad.
Where I get upset is in the cleaning and general sanitation.
I’m not really sure what happened, but there was just too much dust on surfaces, there were smashed flies on the inside of the window of the living room, and all the window edges were layered with dust. The dining room chairs had stains on them from liquids spillage, the master bedroom pillows has brown liquid circles under the pillow case from the absence of a protector.
In general the place just needed to be cleaned and sanitized thoroughly before hosting anyone.
The front door was tricky to lock even thought they left a sign. We had locked it and verified, but then my sister in laws walks right in later at night and said it was open. The front door had no lights and the bulb was out and covered by a nest."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"very cute and homey place! The only thing I would say is it is right by a busy road and to get into the home there are stairs (not disabled friendly).

2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"This was an okay stay. Upon arrival, access was fairly easy but there was an odd, musk smell. On the surface, the house is pretty accurate to the pictures. It seemed clean & organized. They did a good job of modernizing it with new furnishings, decorations, & floors. But when we started looking at some things, this home needs a serious deep cleaning. No one is perfect but there was dust in a lot of places (concern for allergies), vents seem like they haven’t been cleaned in years, there were some dingy pillowcases, stains on the shower curtain, ice maker was dirty, and also there were dead roaches under the dresser with some, I’m guessing, former tenants clothes. One of the queen beds is actually a full. Also, the washer was making a loud banging noise. All things, that made my friends and I believe that they are doing the bare minimum to clean. I really didn’t want to do a bad review but my friends & I didn’t feel comfortable. So we bought extra blankets from the store."
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Was a fun home for a great price 10/10

2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay! Cheryl had wonderful communication and easy instructions. The house had a great location, it felt very safe in the neighborhood. The house was very clean upon arrival. The rooms were super cute and the beds comfortable. We loved the game room, definitely an extra touch for an Airbnb! The kitchen is stocked with the basic supplies - and as she lets you know, there is coffee upon arrival but besides that and a few seasonings that is all the kitchen had. If you plan to cook bring oils and whatever other basics you think you’ll need that you might not think of (if you’re driving in at least). But we had a great stay, would absolutely return."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cheryl’s property was quite cozy, conveniently located and affordable."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love the place
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home, very clean!! I loved all the little attention to details! My husband, son and I came in from California for my brother-in-laws promotion to Colonel!

We had beautiful meals and conversations at the big dining room table. This was way more fun than any hotel!"

Thank you Cheryl ❤️"
2022-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was clean. The road noise is significant. The bedrooms are the hottest rooms in the house which made it difficult to sleep comfortably. I wouldn’t recommend staying in the hottest months of summer. Cheryl was wonderful and addressed the cooling issues we had immediately, unfortunately unable to solve them. The ping pong table was a huge hit with the kids. It just wasn’t a win for us overall."

Love the game room with the comfortable furniture and the good movies. visiting my grandson from the Air Force Base he enjoys a place to stay away from base that is more like a home than a dorm room..

2024-06-01,2.0,Group trip,"Stayed for 1 night. There was not enough towels and the ones that were available were extremely old and dingy and when removing sheets the beds were terribly stained red/brown. Check out was too much. We are expecting to basically clean the whole house (except stripping the bed, which we saw why. The stains under the sheets were disgusting.) Then, we had to pack and start dishwasher. Put laundry in the washing machine and start it. It is also required not only to collect your trash, but also take it out. This is entirely too much for Airbnb stay. What was the 75$ cleaning fee for?"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"House just as described. Stayed here while traveling on vacation. Convenient location off interstate and near restaurants. Dog friendly with large yard. No carpet in home. She has everything you need for your stay like soap, dish soap, and paper towels. Mattresses were comfortable. Didn't cook while here, but kitchen looked sufficient. Host leaves a small basket of snacks. There is also a toaster, blender, and a keurig. Full size washer and dryer. Ceiling fans in living room and bedrooms was nice as well. TV in living room and primary bedroom. Wi-Fi worked good. Jennifer was quick to respond. Booked again for return stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Jennifer's place. It was clean, comfortable, and relaxing. We were there for only a short time but we had everything we needed, especially after a long day of driving."
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"traveling with 3 small kkds can be tough but we felt right at home here. i mistakenly thought there was a pool and when i realized there wasn't, the host called around to several local pools to see who was open so i could take my kids to swim. SO kind! then at check in we had a minor mess and the host immediately responded to my message and even offered to personally come clean up the Mess right away.
lastly then we had a unexpected health issue arise and left before the reservation was over and the host was so kind about the condition of the home when we left. we will definitely stay here next time we are in the area and will recommend to friends that are traveling!"

2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Place was cute and perfect for a quick stop at night. Unfortunately it was not cleaned very well. There were crumbs left on a nightstand, someone’s dirty towel left unwashed in the washing machine, and floors/ baseboards could have used a good wipedown. The only other it was hard to see at night bringing our bags inside not well lit if you plan to arrive after dark. Convenient location"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Jennifer's place twice while driving to and from Florida. The house is in a great location right off the interstate and in a quiet neighborhood. Check in was a breeze even though we arrived late at night. We found some dog hair in one bed the first night we stayed, but we arrived late at night and it was otherwise a very clean home. It was spotless on our second visit here, so I think it was just a fluke. Beds are very firm for my preference, but it was fine for a night. Showers had good water pressure and plenty of towels were provided. We appreciated the snacks and water bottles provided. There was also a keurig available. We would stay here again."

Tucked away near a quiet cul-de-sac and far enough away from the interstate (but not too far!), the house was quiet and very relaxing. A huge bonus was the empty garage, allowing us to keep dry amid the rain!
She's done her homework on how to have a GREAT AirBNB, and I can't recommend this house enough, whether you're passing through or need to stick around a few days! Great location, easy access to amenities, and also reasonably convenient to Macon and even Atlanta areas.
Thanks for being a great hostess, Jennifer!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,my family has visited Florida four years in a row. we drive from MI and every year we stop just after Atlanta. we usually get a hotel but this year stayed at Jason n Jennifer's place. it was priced better than local hotels and we were able to have more space and a much more comfortable nights sleep. The house is a better value than a hotel. also Jennifer was the best host ever. The day before I asked if there was a blender in the house. I make smoothies every day. Jennifer bought and delivered one before I arrived. So nice of her to go above and beyond. it worked great. thanks again for everything.

However, When we arrived to check in the garage code didnt work, immediately notified the owner, said he would have someone out and no one ever showed. Also had numerous problems with the lock on the front door which is a number keypad, worked a couple times and then stopped, so had to go around the back of the house, in the dark to go use the back door. It was dark and gated and we were there for 11 days, so was very inconvenient. Finally got a key to use for the front door, 1 day before we were to leave, found out owner doesnt live in town, not sure if thats why the issue wasent resolved."

The neighborhood is safe. The backyard is clean and fenced in.
The home is practically perfect. So many additional items included in the event that you needed them. We are also hosts and took some ideas on how to improve our homes based on what is offered in this home. The house is clean, the sheets and towels were comfortable.
I could probably go on and on..."

2021-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean property and neighborhood. My family and I stayed at the property while visiting a family member who had heart surgery, and used the place just to sleep. Easy check in and communication with the owners, except when requesting last minute credit/partial refund…then no answer. We had reserved the property for 7 guests, but when only 4 guests used the property; no refund was issued. All in all not a bad experience, just make sure that you keep in mind that if someone from your group cancels, you probably won’t get a refund."

The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were nice (the main bathroom is roomy and great for a couple), and the garage and fenced backyard were pluses security and privacy. We used the washer/dryer to do some laundry, and the kitchen was stocked with Keurig coffee and all the dishes we could need. We didn't have much time to lounge, but the comfy recliner couches in the living room were great for sitting, and every seat had a good view of a large TV. The only (minor) issue we encountered was a strong fishy odor in the refrigerator, but we didn't cook while visiting so this wasn't so inconvenient. Thanks to Adam for prompt replies to all our messages and questions, and for providing a great home for our trip to Warner Robins, a great place to visit. We hope to be back soon!"

My wife and I have two young children and the room with two beds made a perfect bedroom for them. As we relocated to this area this place was the perfect stress free stay we needed as we await our new home and as I transition to my new work location.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I seriously could not have made a better choice for our trip to Warner Robins, especially when it came to fulfilling our specific needs for a family with children. The value of renting an entire house cannot be understated, it definitely checked all the boxes. Adam was a great host, very friendly and responsive. It's located in a nice quiet neighborhood with a private backyard. I actually wish I would have booked it for longer. The mattresses were legitimately comfortable, the additional bed hidden in the master closet was a nice touch, along with the additional linens, pillows, towels, and all the other basic household items that also came included (those things make a big difference imo). Not to mention the convenience of having a washer/dryer, and the Keurig was obviously a big hit! If I have to make any future trips down there I will definitely be reaching out to check availability."

The host communicated with me throughout my stay and was fast in answering my questions. Check-in and check-out was flawless. All the amenities that you would find in a hotel are provided plus much more. This property beats out a hotel stay any day. I am big on smells and on arrival there was a pleasant scent in the air. Nothing overbearing like chemical sprays you find in some hotels. The living room area was spacious as well as the three bedrooms. There is a TV available in the living room area as well as the master bedroom. My teenager had fun with ""Alexa"" during our stay. For coffee drinkers there is a Keurig and adequate enough kitchen space with all utensils provided for those who would like to cook. Instead of returning home with dirty laundry I was able to wash clothing before our departure which was a benefit for me. Overall the home is well kept and clean. Thanks to our Host for a pleasant experience."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Made my vacation possible!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Chu’s house is one of the best places I’ve stayed at for an Airbnb. Everything was stocked nicely even had snacks and coffee. Fresh linens, pots, and pans and dishes and everything, all I needed was my toothbrush and a change of clothes. We really enjoy our stay. Wonderful Host ! I would stay there again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Excellent stay! Ut rocks!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ut was a great host! Anything that came up was immediately addressed and rectified. We were traveling to a dog show and the yard and house were set up perfectly for the dogs. He even sent the dogs and us a special treat when the lawn hadn’t been mowed the first day because of the weather. Can’t wait to stay here again during future dog shows.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for providing an affordable place with more space than a hotel! Appreciate having the kitchen and 2BR/2Baths.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We overall had a great stay! Easy to get in with the keypad lock which was nice. It was wonderful having the garage since we were only staying for one night on the way to FL. Super convenient to not have to unpack the car. The place looked just like the pictures. Grass / shrubs were overgrown and the twin beds were uncomfortable but overall would stay again. Everything was clean and she had great quality towels. She provided toiletries and snacks which was nice as well.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Would book again!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great host. Great apartment 🫶🏽
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful place!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we really enjoyed our stay here. it felt like home. The host was very responsive.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Just a short drive off the interstate, Ut’s place was a welcome reprieve. Nestled in a quiet neighborhood, you will pass plenty of food and gas options on your way there. It was raining when we got there so we were able to pull into the garage, which made everything so much easier! The house was clean and smelled nice. There were plenty of coffee supplies and some snacks and shower supplies. We slept wonderfully and would 100% stay here again! It was very safe feeling and quiet. We couldn’t have been happier with our selection. I actually had chosen another place prior and then read some recent reviews and changed to Ut’s place and I’m so glad I did."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Communication was great and nice touch with snacks in kitchen. I appreciated being able to put the rental van in the garage…that was great.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The home was everything we expected. They were so kind, and even went above and beyond with the small things like coffee and snacks. We will definitely stay again as we visit WR several timea a year to see family."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was most comfy and clean and the furniture was like new; especially the super main bed. The neighborhood was a bit crowded with houses but this place was tucked into a nice cul-de-sac. Even though there was a really bad thunderstorm that hit through the night, we barely heard it. Got a great night sleep. The well stocked kitchen made for a very pleasant breakfast. Loved the Keurig coffee and the packs of goodies left by Ut for folks to enjoy. Our pup was so happy to run around the little fenced in back yard. Overall a most happy find for a very fair price. Way better than any hotel room."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were very pleased to arrive to a very quiet, safe neighborhood and enjoyed our stay. The home smelled good as we walked in. It was neat and snacks were great. Had a good time would be happy to stay there again . Utz is very nice."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ut’s place was just what we needed. Enough space to not be on top of each other and amply stocked with coffee and treats for snacking. For the price, it’s hard to find anything to complain about."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We found the house easily and stayed one night on our way south. The only negative was the carpets needed cleaning. Everything else was top notch. I would book here again for a short stay.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location is great for our purposes. It was clean and plenty of room. The added snacks and laundry detergent are a nice touch.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time we’ve stayed at Ut’s rental. It was everything we hoped for. She has a nice backyard for our dog and there is an attached garage where you can access the house.
Perfect for us."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,Great for couples that just want time free time together
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful host very peaceful and clean would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing time
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very comfortable house. Enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Love this little town home. Plenty of space for my family. Welcome snacks and a little fenced backyard made it homey!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice home in a nice neighborhood. House came with everything I needed for a weekend trip. She even provided complimentary snacks!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"LOVEDDDDD EVERYTHING!!!! the pictures do no justice literally house was 10/100000 everything I needed & more I felt like I was home , I’ll be getting again thank you so much for a comfortable stay"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stop for our move to Florida!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. I would definitely recommend
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ut’s house was perfect for a family of four and two dogs! We were passing through on our way to south Florida and stopped here for the night. This place was far better than expected! Her house was extremely clean and she even had snacks, waters and coffee waiting on us.
We were a little worried if this place was in a safe neighborhood when booking, since we weren’t familiar with the area, but I can say it exceeded all expectations. This house is part of a nice little quaint neighborhood where we felt very safe and secure all night. I highly recommend this place!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,She was very flexible with our request to check out an hour later due to some personal issues. Very much appreciated that. And home was safe and clean.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Ut was the perfect host. Very quick to respond to messages and very accommodating. Ut's home is very spacious inside and out and very clean. The home is also in a great community. Do not hesitate to book Ut's home.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Lovely and clean home and very well equipped! We would definitely stay again if in the area! Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,It was perfect!!! The host was perfect as well. The place was immaculate. It was almost like home. I strongly recommend it for overnight or even longer stays.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place for families, very pet friendly, close to restaurants & shopping!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I stay here with my family it was beautiful from the minute we walked in smelled clean everything was clean ut had snacks and coffee and hot chocolate which was perfect for the weather my kids enjoyed their room
They didn’t want to leave this home is cozy and peaceful would stay here again when we come back to Georgia"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just what we needed for a stop on our way home. Everything was as described.
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"it's nice for a pet, as it has a very secure privacy fence
That being said, there were noticeable dog pee stains on the carpet. The linoleum in the kitchen was very scuffed.
The beds were OK but VERY bouncy and small. I still slept pretty well.
Good location, near gas and food and easy access to I-75. Cul de sac road keeps it quiet and safe.
Overall: not too pricy and good location make it worth at least checking out."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely Stay! Had everything we needed for a short stop
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This will be my ""go to"" places if available during my trips to Warner Robins."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ut's place was clean and a very nice place to stay. She was very quick to answer any questions. Her place was just as described. We would recommend to all our friends.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed in this villa overnight on our way to Florida because we were traveling with four well-behaved dogs for an agility competition and we wanted a backyard as well as it’s hard to find a hotel for multiple dogs.
The backyard has a 6 ft privacy fence and was perfect for the dogs to stretch their legs. The house was spotless and spacious enough for the humans and four large dogs. The host provided everything we needed as far as amenities and we really appreciated the snacks and coffee!!
I hate paying a large cleaning fee for one night so usually limit my airbnb reservations to longer stays, but in this case it was totally worth it. This will become a regular stop on our FL trips in the future.
It was in the town of Warner Robins so about 7 minutes off I-75, but totally worth it."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really like that place, I we hope to go back there. Thank you"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Location ia great as it is within proximity to many restaurants and a nice park.
The home was like a home away from home.
Very accommodating to all!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was very clean and comfortable.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice home and Ut was a great and detailed host. You should definitely give this home a try! Truly enjoyable!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Super clean and very quiet. Enjoyed our stay!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very peaceful and nice location, loved the little touches, it felt like home."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was amazing! The host made sure we were able to easily access the home and it was very pet friendly. Will definitely be staying here again in the future.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful townhome and a great place to stay! The host was very friendly and the area felt extremely safe. We stopped here as a midpoint in our travels but I wish we could have stayed longer!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Our overnight stay was good. Nice Lil Debbies snack tray in the kitchen.
We were hoping after reading a review back in July about the uncomfortable twin beds that they were replaced. They weren't. These mattresses will hurt your back unless you're a child. Other then the horrible twin mattresses. The house worked good for our family for 1 night."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ut was very quick to answer our questions after check in. House was clean, comfortable and spacious. Very well stocked with supplies, too! Quiet neighborhood, we felt very safe.
We were not familiar with using Roku tv since that is different from our tv at home (we are seniors used to cable). But Ut was very helpful with that and quickly answered our questions.
We will return!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was great
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean place and nice host. But the picture of the home is very misleading. It’s a townhome. Not a stand alone home as pictured. The yard was so overgrown that our pups couldn’t use. That was our main reason for booking.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"UTs place was comfortable, well appointed, and convenient. Her place was clean and spacious for my family of four. UT was prompt in responses to questions. I would stay here again if we come back to the area!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The whole experience was fabulous. The house was easy to find, it was clean, Ut was nice and the neighbors were even nice. The house was very clean, the kitchen was well stocked(I have an infant and I had to boil some bottles, so we needed a big pot of water and she had one!), and there was a coffee maker, snacks, and best of all, the beds were so so comfortable! Thank you for letting us stay in your beautiful home!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a fantastic stay at this cozy two-bedroom Airbnb in Warner Robins, Georgia. The host, Ut, was incredibly friendly and communicative, making my experience even more enjoyable. The space was clean and tidy, and the neighborhood was wonderfully quiet, providing a peaceful retreat during my visit. Highly recommended!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"upon walking in, the place smelled so fresh and clean! with a crawling baby it was nice not having clutter or too much stuff he could get into. the place was stocked with all of your needs, plus little treats that were very nice! I loved that there was a high chair that my son could use too! overall, I would love to stay here again!"
2023-10-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The description of 3 beds is literally that. There are two bedrooms, one with a queen bed and one with two twin beds.
The TV was a challenge because the remote was not correct. I found another Universal remote in the master bedroom and we had to look up directions for how it could’ve be paired with the TV.
The home is not a standalone. It is a townhome (connected to others). That was a bit disconcerting.
The home was uber clean, had a nice snack bar, and coffee options."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I am a clean freak so when I say you could’ve eaten off the floor, please know I mean it! The place is nicer than the picture, rooms are spacious, living room could’ve fit a king size mattress. I have no complaints other than we couldn’t get the remote to connect to the TV, but oh well not a big deal whatsoever. Ut communicated and read that we had an infant and sent us pictures of all the things we could use for him (baby seat for table, kids plates and utensils, packnplay). Very easy to check in and out too. Quiet neighborhood and from what locals told me the “good side of town”"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,perfect place to stay when traveling from South Florida and need a comfy place to sleep.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give 10 stars I would. The only thing was the backyard grass needed to be cut. I had my dogs so of course they had to go out. Other than that if I need an Airbnb for my family, I’ll chose her again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ut was a great host! Extremely accommodating and, truly put a lot of effort into the space to ensure you have everything you need.
Home was very clean, beds were comfortable and kitchen was well stocked with bonus snacks. Would definitely stay here again, and recommend booking with her!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a nice place. I especially enjoyed the use of the garage.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Me and my family enjoyed our stay. If allowed, I will be a returning customer."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I will be traveling from Florida to Tennessee quite a bit, and I am thrilled I found this place! not only was there a cute fenced backyard for my dogs, but the neighbors are great and the place was perfect for all my family's needs! I am already in the process of booking again for my next trip!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Had a great time, thanks for hosting, would do it again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was great for my family traveling with our pets. I hadn't even left the house when I decided to book here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ut was an extremely responsive host and was always super helpful. Overall the home was very spacious, comfortable and clean. Having a garage to park in was also a great bonus and added to security."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Ut is incredible. She was very accommodating and very quick to respond to any questions. The space was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay. The bedrooms were very clean and comfortable, the bathrooms were clean as well. Felt like home. The neighborhood was very quiet. This is definitely the perfect place to stay in. We really enjoyed our stay, will book again in near future.. Thank You for the hospitality.."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ut's place was peaceful, clean, and comfortable. Being a pet friendly house, I was pleased to find that the home smelt clean and not of previous pets. Her home was well appointed with all of the necessities and provided a comfortable place for us to get a good night's rest before continuing our journey."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wet nice place
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to stay. Was very accommodating for sports dogs. Will definitely stay here again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Highly recommend! Nice, Clean, comfortable home away from home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet neighborhood
2023-07-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you plan to put an adult in those twin beds, DON'T! I got 4 hours of sleep! I have never even seen a bed like this in my life. I was so mad that anyone would put those ""beds"" in there! Where do you even get those things? They're so small that the Twin frame they are sitting on is much bigger than the mattress. It felt like a blow up mattress, but it wasn't. You'd sit on one end, and the rest of the mattress would tilt upward. When I was sleeping, if I dared to even shift or move, I'd wake up in fear that the mattress was going to tilt and that I'd slide off the bed. Having 20 rushes of adrenaline during the night is awful! I had to drive all day the next day and kept falling asleep. She could have just bought a $100 foam mattress! I don't understand why anyone would be so cruel as to cause a terrible night's sleep to travelers who have to DRIVE all day the next day. I hope this host did something amazing with that $100 that she saved. Hope it was worth my safety."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying in Ut’s home. It was beautiful and so cozy. Felt right at home at this house. Host was very responsive and accommodating. It was a pleasure being able to stay in this home. This home is located next to so many restaurants and shopping centers. Very quiet neighborhood. Guest have access to the garage which I loved. No complains at all.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very great stay! Great neighborhood! Very nice kitchen I was able to cook my family a great meal with pots and pans already inside the home! Will most certainly be staying again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Tastefully renovated, clean and appropriately stocked."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very clean and say to find
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Enjoyed my stay here. Great communication. Had all that I needed to enjoy my time in Warner Robins.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Misti’s home was an oasis of peace and quiet, tucked away in an established neighborhood of beautiful trees and cozy hills. The home was comfortable, clean, spacious, and welcoming, and I loved the decor and appliances. She was also very responsive, and proactive in providing clear checkin/checkout instructions. Definitely recommend!"
,,,Upon arrival they cancel our reservation when we pulled up at the house. I wouldn't recommend this house to no family and the communication was bad when no response and you have go through Airbnb.
,,,Great Place We enjoyed
