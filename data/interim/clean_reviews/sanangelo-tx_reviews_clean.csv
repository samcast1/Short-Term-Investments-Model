2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful home in San Angelo. Great location, close to Angelo state university."
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Candace‚Äôs place is well located! Here are my two cents:
- We had an issue trying to get in since the keypad code didn‚Äôt work. We messaged her and she responded within 20 minutes, so very quick.
- Although the house is for 8 people, keep in mind that there is one bathroom which is not optimal but if you don‚Äôt mind this, then it‚Äôs a great place to stay at.
- The house is nicely decorated and you‚Äôll feel relaxed in it as it‚Äôs clean and airy. When we arrived, the AC was already on so it felt nice come into a cool house. However, I wish it had some amenities like plates for 8 people or an iron and ironing board.
- Candace was very nice to communicate with!
- Some of my family members told me that two of the beds were a little hard but that‚Äôs subjective.
- The house is about 4 minutes away from ASU, it‚Äôs a great location in a chill neighborhood close to everything!
Overall, we‚Äôll stay here again! It‚Äôs a lovely home and the overall experience was pretty good!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, beds were comfortable and it was quiet. No dogs barking, etc. the reason I gave it a 4 star and not 5, is the amenities were lacking. No pots, pans, baking sheets, No coffee for the Keurig. There were only 3 bath towels. I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a new AirBNB. Would stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I came for a visit over the Christmas holiday unexpectedly and could not have asked for a better experience. The home was cozy and beautiful.

I can‚Äôt wait to find a another weekend to go back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This property was the perfect getaway on the lake for my children and I. We were able to tie up our boat on the house boat dock which made getting on the water each day easy. We then easily stored our boat trailer in the long driveway. The house was fully equipped with everything you would need. Game room was amazing! Thanks for allowing us to stay at your beautiful property.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,An amazing place to stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,amazing lake house the family loved it!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was perfect for what we wanted. Lake location is great. Easy access for boats and jet ski but low traffic if you have kids swimming or playing as well. Daneen was super responsive and helpful. We are already talking about when we are going to come back!

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! Enjoyed the serenity!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This home is amazing! We felt right at home. There was plenty of space for the 7 of us. Great set up for kids on one side of the house and adults on the other. Had everything that we needed. I would stay here again!
2024-06-01,3.0,Group trip,It‚Äôs an old home but then again the entire town seems to only consist of older homes. The rooms were decent sizes but every bed creeks as they are all metal. The doors in the home are hard to close if they even closed at all. The light shines in so bright in the morning so you won‚Äôt be able to sleep in. I did notice that there were some air mattress available which is nice although we did not use. The kitchen is dated and the faucet in the kitchen has very little water pressure. A/C worked well. I did see a large roach in the back bathroom but it‚Äôs an old wooden home and it didn‚Äôt feel like it was the worst of our stay. I would say the worse is the doors not closing so you don‚Äôt have privacy. Also asking a guest to take the trash bins to the end of the road for you is just not hospitable. Washer and dryer worked well. Wouldn‚Äôt stay here again but then again probably wouldn‚Äôt come back to visit that town again either. Sorry.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,had a great stay very comfortable
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. We slept well with little to no neighborhood noise. We utilized the kitchen as we hosted a bridal shower. All went well.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent place
Hard to see someone being disappointed here
The pool table was a bit smaller than I figured it was from the pictures, but the place was great. Soft beds, very clean, no issues at all."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures and description do not do this home justice. The layout of the space is much roomier than it appears! The bedrooms all have plenty of space for luggage, the living room, dining room and backyard patio are great gathering spaces. My family especially enjoyed playing pool and ping pong in the game room. We especially enjoyed the location close to the downtown area with easy access to Houston Harte loop to get to the southwest shopping areas."

The house was very spacious and had plenty of room. The game room allowed us to stay in on her last day with us and we were able to play pool and ping pong. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our airman her birthday dinner.
We did miss having televisions in the bedrooms but not a huge deal. We enjoyed our stay and the convenience of the home."

2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was just what we needed. Beds were super comfy. Couch was great for lounging. Kitchen was well stocked.
Downside: older houses usually aren‚Äôt insulated well. The floors were freezing (it was February). If you stay in the winter or cooler months, bring your slippers. We did need to keep it fairly warm during the day if we were there just to cut the draft. Nothing to blame the owner for by any means.
Otherwise it‚Äôs a cute house, good location. Quiet neighborhood."
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is as described and taken care of on the inside for an older updated house. The house would be better described as sleeps 8. I would say for being charged a cleaning fee that I would expect it to have been cleaned before our arrival. There was a noticeable smell, be it dogs or some other odor that was apparent. The house floors were clean but left obvious dust on the bottom of socks. There was also no wash cloths on site in any cabinets that we found. All in all it‚Äôs an okay stay in a good location, convenient to the highway and attractions."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great stay thank you

Host emailed me about noise detector detecting too loud. we did have 11 people in our group, 8 adults and 3 small kids. i guess instead of board games we should have played the quiet game.

2 things that aren't anyone's fault.
1. there are 2 wild fox that live under the next door neighbors house that came after us
2. we set our 300$ cooler on the porch to drain and someone came up and stole it! in broad day light. so be careful there are some homeless people that walk around there"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here! The house was perfect and exceeded our expectations. The pictures actually don‚Äôt do the property justice. Kids loved the downstairs room with video games and private cove.
Everything was super clean and beds were comfortable. It was a wonderful accomodation for our family.
Owner was super responsive and helpful with all our needs. When we visit San Angelo, we would love to rebook at this property."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We stayed here over the fourth of July for a family reunion we have every year. My two sisters and their families and my family decided to get an Airbnb instead of a hotel this year. It was a great choice. We got to hangout after we got back home in a great space. The basement was the perfect place for my 4 kids with the pullouts. I would highly recommend it was clean and spacious. I hope we can book it again next year.

2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,"Very close to ASU, but the backyard was under construction and basically unusable. The area behind looked a little sketchy. It rained the first night and the ceiling leaked in the game room. There was a terrible, musty smell in the basement and no one could sleep down there."

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a family event for the weekend and we enjoyed having an entire home to ourselves. Thank you for allowing us to check in early. Everything is was GREAT!
2023-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Arrival: after a long, long day of travel we arrived and couldn't find the home. Maps said we arrived but the house isn't clearly marked. We finally flipped a U-turn and took a look at the mailbox to find the address. We piled out of the car to dash to the restroom and had to dig up the door code. It was sent on the day of booking but not the day of arrival and it was buried in all the other messages. Cleanliness: zero stars. A washer and dryer are available for use but I had to empty both to use them. The dryer had damp towels and the washer had rags. My niece put fresh socks on when she woke and after 30 they were black on the bottom. My wash rag had hair on it as did the shower walls. The owner did refund me the cleaning fee. The best part of this area is the Buttercup cafe. This home is barebones. It sleeps many but only a few can have coffee as it's only a 5-cup maker so be prepared to make multiple pots. A nightly rate of $225-$250 is more fitting, I feel cheated."

2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is spacious and the host was very communicative which we appreciate. However we did experience some maintenance issues during our stay such as the guest bathtub was draining very slowly- too slow to take a shower, and the master bath drain isn‚Äôt low enough so the water pools and there was still a stagnant puddle 24 hours after use. The toilet seat in the master bath was not secured to the toilet and there were no toiletries supplied- no shampoo or even bar soap in the showers. The streets outside are well lit but because there are no darkening shades in the bedrooms there was a lot of light coming in at night. We were also disappointed there weren‚Äôt some basic items stocked like a blow dryer or wine glasses.
The maintenance items seem easy enough to fix- hopefully the host can address them for future guests."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful 5 star home. Great for larger groups.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is impeccable.It is suited for large families as ours consisted of 12 people.The rooms are very spacious and the restrooms were very clean and they had great candles and scents that added to the niceness of this place.There is also a nice chill spot out back.There was plenty of space for us all to be comfortably engaged in one area.Its not to far from the lake as well.I think the highlight was the basement and the ping pong table for my kids.We live in West Texas so we don't have many houses here with basements,lol! We will definitely be booking here again!!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place in the heart of San Angelo. Right next door to excellent Mexican food, a couple of blocks to a grocery and a short walk to the river. HUGE place, immaculately clean, we'll appointed, comfortable. Beautiful neighborhood."

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is amazing!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A large group of us were visiting San Angelo for an annual family reunion. John‚Äôs home was selected because it provide enough bedrooms for the couples and then enough beds for the single adults and children in the group. We were all thrilled at the spaciousness of the he house, with 8 adults, 1 teen and two toddlers, we never felt cramped!
Communicating with John was exceptionally easy. He responded quickly before we made our reservations, and answered questions quickly afterwards. While we were on property, he initiated emails to make sure all was acceptable. I really appreciated this touch.
A few in our group were more than a little concerned about Covid precautions. Well it would be safe to say that they looked at the house with a critical eye as to it‚Äôs cleanliness. The house was immaculate. Seriously, for such a large home, it was CLEAN. Kudos to John and his team for that.
This wasn‚Äôt our first time using a VRBO or AirBnB, but it was one of the best times!"

I was a bit nervous about the area overall and I felt so safe at this place. They had a private entrance with private gate that we closed each night and felt secure and never heard a sound. If you have a larger vehicle it might be a tight fit but our car fit perfectly. The unit itself is super clean and inviting, a perfect modern homey feel. The bed and linens and pillows were literally amazing I‚Äôve never slept so good outside my own home! The snacks were a great touch.

The outside temperatures ranged from the high of 88 ¬∫ to low of 52¬∫ (with rain) during my stay. I only used the ceiling fans a couple of times. The location is very quiet. The rental matches the photos. It‚Äôs a short walk from the Riverwalk or downtown area. The immediate neighborhood is not maintained well, but I always felt safe. Communication with the hosts was quick and responsive. If you want to be in central San Angelo, this is a great rental. I would request this Airbnb when I return."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this last minute so we could visit our son at Angelo State. We were able to walk to the river walk and the downtown area. The cottage was so cute and very clean. I thought the bed was very comfortable, but my husband thought it was a little too soft.
Thankfully we brought my car (VW Atlas) because if we would have been in my husbands full size pick up truck it would have been very hard to park.
Overall we loved it, and now our son wants us to find something like this to rent him for his last year at ASU."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful hidden treasure! Long before we ever made it to our trip, Dave and Annette were very helpful and accommodating with our schedule as we had to change our check in and our check out day! The instructions on how to get to their property were clear and concise, and we felt right at home! There were the comfiest amenities and the best night sleep we have had in a long time! The linens and the mattress were exceptional‚Ä¶ To the point of me messaging them and asking if they could give me details! The bathroom was perfectly stocked with everything that I could need from toiletries to a real blow dryer ( ladies you know what I mean) , a steamer, which in my opinion is so much better than an iron and beautiful white towels! The little Living Room kitchen was also great! Stocked with coffee and water and a few little snacks just were some great touches that you don‚Äôt always see! HIGHLY recommend, & next time we are in San Angelo we would gladly book again!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at the Bungalow was terrific. Clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Being able to park my vehicle inside a gated area was beneficial. The outside space was clean and spacious but 110 degrees kept me inside.
Location is convenient to multiple downtown restaurants. I will stay here again.
Thanks Dave & Annette!

We definitely appreciated the snacks available after a long drive with Al the boat. I will say for other guests who choose to stay, a F250 truck- you will not be able to close the gate in front of the Airbnb.l to enclose your vehicle with the house property. Other than that it was quick, easy, & beautiful. Our favorites were the fireplace, and the bed was like a cloud. Shower was spacious and pretty and spic & span!
I must say we LOVED it for just us two.
Thank you again for the stay! It‚Äôs beautiful!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean house! Had all the necessities and was very cozy. The only reason I leave 4 stars is because one of the beds broke as I sat on it the first night, so I had to sleep on the couch one night. However, Rachel was quick to respond and proactively fixed the bed over the weekend. Again, cleanest Airbnb I‚Äôve come across in a while.
Overall, great host and would recommend a stay here!"

Rachel was an excellent hostess."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were there on rodeo weekend, so it was probably more expensive than usual. Rachel helped us twice, and even took an early morning phone call and got someone out to help us get in when we locked ourselves out. Very responsive and helpful!"

2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I are in our 70s and I never read anything that is located on a second level. This property did not indicate that it was upstairs. It was extremely difficult for for both of us to get up and down the stairs.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I was in San Angelo for a quick trip so I didn‚Äôt get a chance to explore the neighborhood but it‚Äôs not real hard to get around San Angelo by car anyways. The unit was cozy and just what I needed for myself and a quick trip. Everything was clean-I didn‚Äôt have any issues getting inside. I liked the extra security of two locked entries. Would definitely stay again!
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a very small space but adequate for one person or a couple. It‚Äôs basically a bedroom and a bathroom with a tiny kitchen area. It was fine for my needs, clean, close to the area I was visiting. The place was not far from some good restaurants as well. Not as many amenities as some other places like a usb charging port but just bring your own."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sally‚Äôs place was super great for my girlfriend and I. The space is great and well taken care of & in a super cool location. Sally is very helpful and responsive, she always had some great recommendations for San Angelo. Overall a great stress-free stay!"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dawn‚Äôs place was super cute and reminded me of Marfa/Alpine with its cute decor! I have to agree with a previous review about the water pressure being too low. Also, we messaged Dawn about the door knob being loose due to missing screws, which made it hard to close the door, at one point I couldn‚Äôt get the door open from the inside but we never got a response about this. Having stayed in a lot of airbnbs, this was the first one where there was an abundance of fees for damaging or losing stuff. It kind of put us off and left a sour taste, but oh well. We still had a great time and like I said, this place is super adorable! We didn‚Äôt encounter any outside noise but we did have the room in the back. There‚Äôs also some kind of water pump underneath the a/c that would make loud noises every so often. I would still recommend this place! It‚Äôs just down the street from all the nice restaurants and bars."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was great! It‚Äôs a wonderful location.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We decided to make a quick weekend trip to San Angelo to escape the monotony of our small town. This cute Airbnb exceeded our expectations. We had never been out this way before, and the Airbnb was extremely easy to find. It is extremely walkable to the gym, bars and restaurants down the street, yet far enough to not hear much noise at all.
The Airbnb itself was cute, clean, and made us feel right at home. The kitchen has a microwave, toaster oven, and a hot plate so you could cook something up if you so desired. The only complaint we had during our stay here was the water pressure in the shower was low, but it wasn‚Äôt a big deal to us.
If you‚Äôre looking for a place downtown to stay, consider this Airbnb!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The location was great for someone wanting to do things downtown. It‚Äôs a short walk to numerous bars, restaurants, and a slightly longer one to the museum. Nothing super fancy but still very well maintained and comfortable. The only thing I could say as a negative is my wife wishes she brought her own pillow since the one on the bed was a little too firm for her taste. I had zero issues with mine but if you are particular about your pillow you should bring your own."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Jackelope was a nice downtown stay. San Angelo downtown buzzes on Friday and Saturday nights. Sunday morning was a bit dead. Even the coffee shops were closed.
I was surprised how quiet the room was despite the central location. Flexible parking. Steep and narrow staircase but fun decor. Lots of charm. We‚Äôll be back."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved getting to stay near downtown, and it was in a great location near all the events we came to town for.

They were very flexible with my early 3 am checkin and upon time that I needed to stay extra days even after making a spill on the bed sheets, they remained helpful and accommodating. The place is very cozy and has everything you need: a kitchen with all necessary quick and easy appliances (coffee maker; blender; microwave; portable stove w/ pots and pans). Great space to just relax and watch TV on their roko/apple play compatible flat screen. I hope y‚Äôall give it a shot like I did and enjoy your stay at these women‚Äôs property."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great stay at Dawn and Sally‚Äôs place. They were very flexible with the timing of my arrival, being very early in the morning. I would definitely stay again if I were in San Angelo. Upon the time that I needed to extend my stay, they remained very hospitable. I would definitely recommend to somebody who wants a chill place to relax, watch some tv maybe cook a little bit. It was a great place for me to visit my wife."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cute place, everything we needed was there. Good location!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will start out by saying that Dawn was amazing with communication, the place was super cute. However the stairs to get up to the place were very narrow and steep, this was not indicated in the description, and sadly I have a lung condition that made it near impossible to get up and down. The walls are VERY thin and you can hear the other room showering and walking and I know they could hear us. I was there to visit my 17 yo son whom stayed with me and on the first night we got a message about the noise level. We were laughing and being a family but because the thins walls it was a disruption to the guests in the other room. We did end up checking out early the next day and stayed at a local Hotel, as I really could not get up and down those stairs comfortably.
So with that being said this is a great place if you are just wanting some solitude and sleep. It is close to the up and coming arts district so great for walking as well!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space was precious and exactly what the listening stated. Dawn was very quick to respond to any needs we had and was very gracious with everything.

It is located in downtown San Angelo with lots of downtown amenities (e.g. dining and shopping) within walking distance. It is close to Goodfellow AFB and most everywhere in San Angelo is a short drive.

We got custom boots at RL Mercer down the road, went to Blaine's Pub for a couple if ice cold beers in tall mugs, had great pizza on the river and then walked all that off on the lovely river walk!

Dave‚Äôs Airbnb was an absolute dream for our recent family reunion! We came in from 3-different states, and their beautiful residence provided the perfect home base for our get-together.
The house was plenty spacious for the family with plenty of room for everyone to relax and spread out. What truly impressed us was their willingness to accommodate our multi-state family and its central location to downtown They provided us with a flexible check-in to meet different arrival/departure times and answered all our questions and concerns in an hour or less.
Overall, we can't recommend Dave and Annette's home highly enough. Their beautiful home, thoughtful touches, and outstanding hospitality made our family reunion truly unforgettable Thank you Dave & Annette!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the amenities that Dave's house had to offer! The home came with everything that we needed for our stay and we appreciated the space and thoughtfulness put into each room. (Note: It seems to be that most folks in San Angelo drink bottled water - as opposed to water from the tap!) We were a little surprised to see that one of the homes next door was in such disrepair, but it didn't affect our stay."

Dave‚Äôs place was perfect for our needs, close to stores and places to eat.
Very close as well to the State park where I did some hiking, and as well very close to the river walk area.
The home was clean and cool upon arrival and met all of our expectations. Easy to get into as instructions were easy.
Also we drove to San Antonio and spent a day at Sea World, only about a 3 hour drive from Dave‚Äôs place. Very happy with our choice, would stay with Dave again in the future. The home had everything we needed to make our stay awesome.

Would recommend this cottage to anyone wanting a comfortable bed and a place they feel at home!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"What a hidden gem! We‚Äôve never been to that area. Our son & his family just moved there, so we went to visit. Dave was a constant contact from the very beginning. The house has been updated‚Ä¶somewhat of a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô vibe, which we love. Both bedrooms had King beds & both had flat screen TVs, which was a criteria for us, as our kids joined us. The bathroom had ample room‚Ä¶shelving, shower, double sinks & also a washer & dryer, which was a plus. The kitchen was a good size, for a smaller house. We cooked meals & also used the outdoor bbq. If you‚Äôre on the fence about this property, I can assure you‚Ä¶you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"my first ever stay in a bnb. The entire experience was amazing. the description was accurate. I stepped in and felt right at home. the decor was very nicely done. the kitchen came equipped with everything I needed, I just added groceries! there was snacks/coffee/tea getting me with a laminated list of instructions for the stay and check out process, along with a direct line to communication in the event of issues. the bathroom was beautiful and clean, with modern upgrades. They thought of everything down to body wash and makeup towelettes. full washer/dryer. The beds were extremely nice. Each was memory foam, king sized, with fluffy large and multiple pillows. the linens were crisp and clean. digital temp control, house got very cool when we needed it to. the neighbors were quiet & peaceful. everything was within walking distance, but we chose to drive. I highly recommend this host. very accommodating. we're very thankful!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off, WOW! This place was incredible on the inside. Completely blew me and my guests away when we walked in! Worth the money and highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house !
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is in a great location with lots of space to gather friends and family. Checkin and out was simple, and the hosts were helpful when needed. However they were on the property, using the property (which I didn‚Äôt realize may be a possibility before it was booked), and interacted with us more than preferred. There was also a wasp and bug problem that prevented us from using the pool as much as we intended, and being bitten by wasps or the black flying bugs when you do use it. The back porch and view is great, although also a wasp problem that will hopefully be addressed. Overall, it was a great place to gather friends and family and we are grateful for the indoor space with ample seating to catch up with family."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First time with Air B&B and Heather was a dream!! We will definitely be repeat customers.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at Heather‚Äôs airbnb couldn‚Äôt have been better!

The homemade cookies awaiting us were a delightful treat that set the tone for the entire visit. This Airbnb exceeded all our expectations. The amenities provided were outstanding, and we lacked nothing during our stay. They even graciously accommodated some unusual requests. The pool was a refreshing oasis, perfect for cooling off during the hot Texas days & family bonding. The luxurious tub offered a serene and indulgent experience when relaxing at night. Another highlight of the property was undoubtedly the breathtaking scenery & the tranquility it provided. Surrounded by nature, we were able to truly unwind & reconnect with each other when not out exploring.

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Heather and her husband were amazing hosts! The house was amazing and had everything we needed. They allowed us to have our daughter‚Äôs wedding there and I know a lot of hosts stay clear of having large parties but I am grateful she took a chance on us because wonderful memories were made. I hope this shows other hosts that not all people are bad and will destroy your home while having large gatherings. Words can‚Äôt express how awesome our experience was but I hope many people will choose to stay in their home because it is beyond what you see in the pictures you have to experience it to truly understand how amazing it is!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The Lone Star Retreat is even more beautiful than the pictures. The house is nicely laid out and well appointed. Everything has been thought of. But the stand outs are the veranda with multiple seating areas and a large outdoor dining table and the view to the state park. It‚Äôs stunning. The pool area is well-stocked. Our family enjoyed hanging out at the pool and shooting darts on the veranda. Beds were comfortable. Lots of seating in the living room. Wonderful place.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family really enjoyed our time here for Thanksgiving while visiting my son who is training at Goodfellow AFB. The location is great - very close to shopping, but in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed shooting baskets in the driveway, walking to the park up the street, and running in San Angelo State Park.
The house is well appointed, with everything we needed to cook, spread out to play games, watch a football game, or stream a movie. The hosts were on-site while we were there. Always accessible and communicative.
This is our third time staying in San Angelo, and the best Air BnB we have stayed at."

Lots of extras in case you forgot anything! Kitchen is sparse with utensils, plates, and cups, but we just ate out! Plenty of bath towels as we had six people! We had a hot water issue and Rachel responded back immediately with a solution. Location was convenient for the stock show, but far from shopping and chain restaurants!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved it as we grew up in San Angelo and it was so much easier than a hotel due to us traveling with our dogs. Being able to sit outside within a fenced, good sized yard was priceless for us. We were able to host family & have room to cool, prepare & hang out. It has a smaller living area but we were able to hang out outside under covered patio and using picnic table. Outdoor lighting was great & gave great ambiance. Having 2 full bathrooms was fabulous. Just so great for our family. For someone who isn‚Äôt used to Firestick that was a little challenging but we were able to access local cable.
Overall the trip was successful and all our
family who visited commented on how great & secluded the home was. We spoke to Colin personally and he was very responsive and immediately helpful. We loved being able to bring our 4-legged kids & not worry about noises, barking & going up/down steps."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay while in San Angelo. We have stayed twice now and the location is perfect to the Rodeo Arena for High School Rodeo as well as Stock Show. The house is set up perfectly both inside and outside. The patio area is perfect for grilling and having meals outside if you like and the inside is very comfortable and the house is well stocked with anything you may need.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at the Rock House for 3 nights while I was in town running a race. The location is great, close to the state park, restaurants, and the Riverwalk. The inside was very spacious and clean, and everything we needed was provided. Overall a quiet area and neighborhood, although I didn't realize initially the house is located right off of a main road, so you do hear a bit of traffic from that, but there is a very secure privacy fence that goes around the entire property, and that was perfect and made the house seem very private! We didn't even really notice outside the yard with the privacy fence, and we really enjoyed the outside area and table and patio, as did our pups and son! Would definitely recommend for a stay in San Angelo!"

The 3 bedrooms are plenty big, the gathering spot (sectional sofa) in the house and the covered patio with table and chairs make visiting easy. It‚Äôs so close to Spur Arena that you can walk.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This house was perfect for our family and our dogs. It is small but comfortable. Our dogs REALLY loved the well fenced in yard. One of the window ac units did have a hard time cooling one of the rooms, but the others were fine. We will definitely stay again!"

It‚Äôs a great space with 3 bedrooms .
It does have room ac units and I had some challenges with cooling well and the noise of coming off and on.
Should be no problem except these really hot Tx. days this summer.

They were not only very communicative but very supportive to us during our stay. Everything was clean, fully stocked, and well prepared. We definitely recommend booking with them and will do so again if we find the need too. Our little dog, Fancy, loved the yard and also all the a/c throughout the house. Cute, clean space."

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Rock House is as advertised. It‚Äôs a private place and super clean. The patio is amazing and everything worked as it should. I would stay again!
2021-09-01,4.0,Group trip,The house was very clean and well stocked for a comfortable stay. We brought dogs and the fence around the place was super secure. We enjoyed coffee outside every morning.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect location near Spur Arena. The air conditioning units work wonderfully to keep the home cool. The kitchen is well equipped, and each bedroom is cozy. It is fully fenced in, and has a great spot for morning coffee. Nice to have a washer and dryer, too."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"There are plenty of reasons to stay at The Rock House and not a hotel. The porch, patio and grill are great worthwhile amenities for your stay. There are neighbors and they are neighborly, smile and wave. This is a great spot for Rodeo season, seriously walking distance from the Coliseum. Also, in driving distance is the Chicken Farm Art Center and a park with a playground. There are a few restaurants around the area. We chose to not go to any restaurants since this stay is during a pandemic. A couple of negatives, this is an older house, pretty well renovated, but there were a few bugs. I only saw a couple during the entire stay. Just beware, this town is in the desert(hotter/colder weather), bugs may come around. Just zip up all luggage so no unwanted pests in your belongings. The only big annoyance is the the primary bed room is better to look at then to stay in. The mattress is uncomfortable. Just placing a hand on the mattress is all the indication necessary. Didn't stay in the room, but it has the better bathroom to shower in. But all and all this house is a reasonable place to stay."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and clean. Comfortable stay.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent stay! Had a slight issue with the internet that was resolved within an hour. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was clean and in a easy to find location, my family and I enjoyed our stay"
2021-07-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is nice except for a few minor issues of the air conditioner unit not cooling in one of the rooms, shower head in one restroom we weren't able to get it to work and when we called two numbers and left voicemails asking for instructions no one ever called us back they left a message on the Airbnb website which we never accessed during our trip, could use a deep clean behind furniture and in the drawers/cabinets in the kitchen. Location is in an odd place and not near many things."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great little spot! Plenty of space and a great value. The outdoor area is precious! Will definitely stay again when in the area
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Lovely home and hosts. Great communication and very welcoming and accommodating. The house was clean and stocked with necessary items. Overall a great place to stay.
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"House was as advertised, host was easy to communicate with and very helpful. House was clean and in a pretty good area. Felt right at home."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The rock house was a great size for our family of 5. It‚Äôs not easy traveling with 2 exploring toddlers under the age of 3 but the set up of the home and yard made it a lot easier for us. Inside the home it was easy to lock the bedrooms to keep them in the main area. We took a couple of our door handle safety covers to keep them out of the restroom and laundry room and vuala! A lot easier to keep and eye on them . We also took a cabinet lock which help to keep them out from under the kitchen sink .The yard is completely enclosed with enough space for them to roam around. Over all we enjoyed our stay, if we ever return to San Angelo we will definitely consider staying there again !"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome AirBnB experience. Definitely beats a hotel.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great host with great hospitality. House felt like a home away from home literally
2021-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quick responses. Nice place. House is on main road. Bring your sling or Netflix login. Not many condiments provided so bring what you can. House is nice and as shown in picture.

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice little place
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We hope to never stay at a hotel in San Angelo after our stay at The Rock House. I can‚Äôt say enough great things about our visit. We‚Äôre a family of 5 and staying at a hotel is usually quite an ordeal for us. This house had everything that we could possibly need. While in San Angelo, snow was in the forecast and the house was prepared with space heaters in every room that kept the house extra cozy. Thanks again Colin and Chrys."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Rock House offers a great fenced in location with plenty of privacy! Just a few minutes drive to downtown and the house provides a comfy place to rest.
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,We spent the Christmas holiday at the Rock House and had a wonderful stay. The hosts have thought of and provided everything to make the Rock House a home away from home. We especially liked the patio area.
2020-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was great!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved staying at the Rock House. The patio area is wonderful! I loved the privacy of the fence and seating area. The inside was nicely decorated with very comfy beds. Would definitely stay here again! It's very cozy and I couldn't more highly recommend a stay in this home.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is a great place to stay, very clean, very comfortable, and not missing anything!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is nice little house on the edge of town near the coliseum. The hosts were gracious and welcoming. The house was spotless. It was perfect for our trip to visit family. We would stay there again.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful place. The hosts are really sweet and work with me because of Covid. I will definitely stay here if I come back again.
2020-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very hard place to rate because there are some big pros, but also some serious cons.
The house is beautifully updated and almost like staying in a hotel. The photos are very accurate. Having access to a full kitchen and a washer and dryer is very helpful, especially while traveling during the pandemic. The outdoor space is also very nice and securely fenced so you can let your dog out without worrying. Once you‚Äôre through the gate, everything about this house is very aesthetically pleasing.
The big problem with this place is the location. It is not in a residential area. It is right on a very busy street in a weird, almost industrial kind of area on the outskirts of town. There is not even a place to go for a walk. There is a constant traffic noise so even though you can‚Äôt see the ugliness from the yard, you can definitely hear it. I was glad to have my big dogs with me since I might not have felt super safe otherwise. It is a relatively quick drive to the state park, but that‚Äôs the only advantage of the location.
If you‚Äôre just looking for a nice place to lay your head, this house will give you everything you need in a very pretty package. If you are the kind of person who likes to take an evening walk or who wants easy access to things like restaurants or coffee shops, look elsewhere."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. We loved the place. No complaints at all.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place! Super clean and very comfortable!

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You can tell this home is well loved and cared for. The place was just the right size for my family. I loved the fence around the property. It was great to let my kids run around outside to let off some energy. Colin was quick to respond to anything we needed and provided clear communication on check-in and check-out procedures. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The home is located in an area that gives some privacy but still is close to town. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The Rock House was great! It is like a little oasis in San Angelo. Very clean and tidy. Colin and Chrys were very responsive to requests as well. If I am in the area again this will be my go to!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved how conveniently located it was! Only 5 minutes or so from Walmart and have many restaurants in walking distance. If we come back to San Angelo we will stay again!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a few days in San Angelo to just get away. We arrived about an hour and a half before check-in and were so glad that Chrys accommodated us. The place is very clean and roomy. Our little dog loved the doggie door and fenced in yard. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. Only problem we had was with the WiFi going out quite a bit and window units kept things cool but were a bit noisy.
I would highly recommend this place!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time at the Rock House. Colin was super responsive.
2020-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The only issue we have is now we need to find another reason to come to San Angelo so we can stay here again! All of the rooms were extremely clean, all the soaps were refilled to the top and the yard area could fit our entire group easily. Absolutely loved it here and hopefully we can visit again!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay!
2020-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a great place to stay, the host was incredible. Fast response time, and really helpful."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very clean, cute house. We were a little worried about the window units keeping us cool enough with 100+ temperatures but we had to turn them down a little at one time. It was perfect. The beds were really comfortable too. It had a nice seating area outside but we didn't have time to enjoy that. Maybe next time. =)"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was clean and very accessible.
There were some unforeseen events that were beyond the control of the host, but they were always quick to respond.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is super cute and very clean, and the fence around the property gave us plenty of privacy. We had everything we needed to feel right at home. This was the best AirBnB experience we‚Äôve had so far!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,This place is awesome! It‚Äôs was a little farther than we wanted it to be but the restaurants around it made up for it! I would hands down stay there again!
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The Rockhouse was a great place!
2020-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was great, and this place was just what we needed."

2020-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay for my family of five! The kids enjoyed all the concrete to buzz around on their hoverboards. We would rebook again if we were returning to the area. I bet this place is booked solid around rodeo time and any other coliseum events, as it is nearby(walking distance)."
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice out of the way private location.
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Not a bad place at all - private, clean and reasonably quiet. Neighbors may have loud tejano music going until 11:30 at night on weekends though."

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The rock house was perfect for our family! We were visiting relatives in town and were able to cook a meal for everybody. Check in instructions were easy to understand and everything was clean and very neat. I highly recommend!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,The house was great and very clean. This host was very kind and quick with responses. Would definitely stay again.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay. We loved the patio. The fence made it very private. The AC worked really well.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay at the Rock House! There was plenty of room to accommodate our faintly of 5. Chrys and Collin are the best hosts and think of every detail to make your stay wonderful. Great outdoor patio space too!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a perfect spot for a very comfortable stay in San Angelo. It is close to Spur Arena but easy to get anywhere. COLD air conditioning on the HOTTEST days!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was extremely clean inside and out and suited our needs perfectly. I wasn‚Äôt impressed by the neighborhood and the homeless sleeping on mattresses on the corner but we didn‚Äôt have any issues with anyone. I will remember this place when we come back next year.
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location. Exceptional value. Great restaurant , Mendez across the street. Very comfortable."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was a little concerned about the location and lack of central A/C, but both of those concerns proved to be unnecessary. The window units kept the whole house nice and cool - even in July. The location is pretty far north in an area that I was a little concerned about prior to arriving, but we felt very safe there. There‚Äôs little to no traffic in San Angelo so we were 15 minutes or less from every where we went. The house is on a main road and has lots of lighting. There‚Äôs a fire station about a block away, but we never heard any sirens. The house was very quiet and great for rest. The fence was wonderful for privacy and for our dog. The yard was very spacious and nicely xeriscaped. The beds were all comfortable and the kitchen is quite roomy. Chrys was very quick to respond to my questions. We will definitely stay here again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Chrys,
Thank you for a pleasant stay while in San Angelo. We were in town for several family events - Family Reunion, baby shower and a wedding reception. Your home was perfect. The location on the North Side of town was great with easy access to major roads, Chadbourne and Grape Creek Road. If someone were attending the San Angelo Stock Show & Rodeo, your home would be a perfect location!
Bedrooms are decent sized with comfy beds and the whole house was very clean! Oh and plenty of hangers in each of the closets, too!
Parking was more than adequate (at one point we had 4 SUVs parked on the drive way parking area and another in the circle drive).
The over the top touch was that Chrys provided a unique basket of travel accessories that most times are forgotten until needed! I loved that!
The next time we are in San Angelo we will be staying here! Thank you for helping to make our vacation so wonderful!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!! Not too far from downtown & the city. Plenty of amenities & very clean. Highly recommend it :)
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was amazing. The house was beautiful. Checking in was as simple as pressing a code on the door. My husband and I came with both our dogs and this place was so dog friendly. Metal gate around front and back, tile floors, close to pet friendly activities. We went hiking at the state park we were also going to check out the Lilly garden, but our dog got sick. Chrys was also extremely understanding when our dog got sick and the vet said she shouldn‚Äôt travel. We asked if we could stay an extra night and she responded quickly that she was sorry our dog was sick and that we could stay. It was comforting to know that, while we were worried about our dog, we didn‚Äôt have to worry where we were going to stay that night. It was an awesome experience."

All of our family stayed here while my husband and I welcomed our new baby into the world since we live an hour and a half outside of San Angelo! The few times we reached out to Chrys, she was very quick to respond! I would highly recommend this place!"

2018-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,This place is amazingly cozy we‚Äôre in the midst of a long term stay here it‚Äôs very private our dogs love it here with the completely fenced yard. We‚Äôre about 10 minutes from Goodfellow AFB where we are working Chrys has been very responsive to all of our questions and yet still gives us plenty of privacy. Love this place.

2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, cozy, stylish house! We would definitely stay again!"
,,,The house is very nice! A bit far from town but that was ok. There is no heat at this house so it‚Äôs a bit cold in the winter. The real issue for us was the house rules say this house is pet friendly but MAKE SURE you read the whole listing description (CLICK SHOW MORE) at the very very bottom it states there are ADDITION fees for pees even though that is not in the house rules!!! I didn‚Äôt do this - I looked at the rules instead and now we are stuck paying a huge $110 fee to the host.
