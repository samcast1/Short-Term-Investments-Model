2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Spent a long weekend here for its proximity to hiking and diving the mines in Bonne Terre. This guest house absolutely lived up to its glowing reviews! The space was beautifully decorated with incredibly thoughtful touches throughout—like a magnet to cover the glowing numbers on the microwave facing the sleeping area. It’s clear that every conceivable minor inconvenience has been considered and addressed. Anything that could cause confusion is labeled or comes with instructions. All in all, it was easy to quickly make ourselves at home. We’ll definitely return for more diving and would be thrilled to stay here again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful, peaceful and restful stay. We can’t say enough about how well appointed it was. Additionally, everything was labeled, and we loved the wall with images of things to do in the area. We had a special hypoallergenic request concerning no air fresheners and scent free linens/towels. They were kind enough to honor that request and it was so appreciated. Thank you, thank you thank you"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This is a very cozy spot close to downtown. You’ll feel right at home!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My sister, my daughter and I stayed here. We were in town for dance competitions and all the hotels were booked!! Kevin and Melissa were so quick to respond about a question before I even booked with them! Their place was amazing, clean, and felt like home. The neighborhood was amazing too!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved staying here! We did a winery tour in st Genevieve and it was the perfect little get away!
Everything was clearly labeled, the owners are definitely type A. Everything was immaculately clean. The shower was the best shower I’ve ever had.
They had enough firewood in the fire pit for an amazing sized fire that lasted a few hours, and she had little fire starters which worked wonderfully.
When we walked in there was spa music playing and it was such a peaceful vibe! There was an awesome coffee bar, a full kitchen and was perfect! I will be staying again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of my favorite airbnb experiences! The is such a cute and cozy place! The hosts had such thoughtful amenities, and the farmhouse design is beautiful. Thank you to the hosts for providing waters, coffees/teas/hot chocolate and other drinks. They even provided local activity brochures..and binoculars! You could tell in every corner how thoughtfully it was designed, decorated and maintained. The hosts were great communicators. They reached out in advance about some things…and during our stay. They are located literally right next door, but honestly the airbnb felt extremely private."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Found myself needing a place to stay for 2+ weeks before my apartment lease started. The Dove's Nest more than satisfied all of my needs. Kevin & Melissa were gracious enough to allow early check-in on a last minute reservation. Fully stocked suite and well labeled. Given the length of stay, I had groceries delivered, cooked meals, washed clothes and more. Hosts are very responsive and replenished amenities when needed. Many options for food within a 10 minute drive. Great experience all around, would stay again."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved the spot so cute!!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place! From the moment I walked in, I felt like I was transported to a different part of the world. Very clean. Extremely cozy and comfortable. Charming!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely great experience! The Dove’s Nest is cozy, homey, spotless and a great weekend getaway! Kevin and Melissa are great hosts and are very thoughtful in the small details of the home (mints by the bedside, places to go around town with time estimates for each one, the list goes on). 5 star experience, would recommend to anyone!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The Dove's Nest was perfect for my husband and I. The place was super cute, well decorated, all the amenities even mints by the bed. They definitely added the extra touch when designing this place. Kevin and Melissa also went out of their way to get info and provide recommendations every time I would ask a question. I would definitely recommend The Dove's Nest for anyone looking for even just a 1 night getaway."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful apartment. This would be a perfect couples retreat.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed in a number of vacation rentals and this one definitely stands out. The space is lovely, and perfect for us as a couple. They have thought of everything, and every corner of the space is filled with little touches like labels on light switches, super soft blankets, and extra snacks. They checked in throughout the stay to see if we needed anything, and we had zero issues or complaints. This spot is close to family for us, so we will definitely be staying here again when we’re in town!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was great for 2 people but it did sleep 4 which would also be ok. Felt very homey and welcoming. The bed was a little hard but that’s an opinion. Everything was perfectly placed and lots of notes and signs to help use and find stuff. Very responsive and proactive with messaging before and during the stay.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It’s such a treat to stay at Kevin and Melissa’s. They have added a gas stove that makes their cozy place even more cozy! They are conscientious, gracious hosts and I’m looking forward to my next visit."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa was a wonderful hostess, I had everything I could possibly need The space she & Kevin had fixed up for a rental was amazing! I really enjoyed the private patio space too. I appreciated that Melissa checked on me but didn’t invade my privacy.
I highly recommend this unit & will definitely stay with them again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect stay! It was my bridal suite on night one and the hosts transformed the space into our honeymoon suite day two! Absolutely lovely!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts went above and beyond to make sure my husband and I enjoyed our stay. a boil order was issued for the neighborhood, and they called us to let us know that they would have plenty of bottled water to accommodate the situation. It was beautifully decorated and very clean with lots of amenities. highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an absolutely wonderful experience at Kevin and Melissa’s place. Everything in the space was spotless, new and well decorated. If you are visiting the Farmington area you should do yourself a favor and book with Kevin and Melissa. We will certainly be back!!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Melissa and Kevin’s place is so beautiful and welcoming. The furniture is in great shape and very comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom are stocked with everything you need and more. All of the furnishings are plush and luxurious. They also include extra touches like local treats, bedside bottles of water and mints. I am always excited to see that their place is available when I am in the area!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, this was by far my favorite bnb stay ever. My mom and I were celebrating our birthdays with a weekend getaway and Kevin & Melissa provided more than we could have ever asked for. To start, the space is BEAUTIFUL. Every item in the space was high quality and well thought out. I felt more comfortable here than in my own home and that’s saying something 😂 if I could rent this place to live in I would. I want whoever designed this bnb to design my entire house. The space was clean, luxurious, quiet (which is very important to me), and nearly everything could be modified. The were so many lighting options all dimmable so you can set your own ambiance/vibe. The hosts were so thoughtful and set out so many coffee and tea options as well snacks. There were so many comfortable pillows. I need the comfortable couch for my own house because I didn’t want to get off of it after hiking at the state parks. Kitchen had everything we needed and more. Loved the shower. 100/10 would stay again! :)"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kevin and Melissa went above and beyond providing a crib for our daughter. They assisted us with supplies for the fire pit. Making us feel comfortable with the local area resources of places to eat and things to do
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,The Dove’s Nest was the perfect anniversary getaway! The details here were well thought out and very clean! I loved that everything was labeled clearly yet not too noticeable. The coffee bar and the items by bed side were a fantastic touch! Will definitely be recommending to family and friends!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of our favorite AirBNBs. We hope to get to stay again someday. It was so beautiful I took pictures! Perfectly decorated, lots of extras, and it was so clean, it felt like we were the first people to ever stay there. They had everything I love in a BNB… clear posted check out list and instructions, a coffee bar, games, stocked kitchen, information about nearby parks, cozy blankets, soft sheets, great towels, a hair dryer, nightstands with usb ports and plug ins built in👏 and a lovely private outdoor space. It was absolutely perfect. The hosts are friendly and great at answering questions quickly."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Doves Nest was the perfect place for a little getaway! Felt right at home. Beautiful inside and out. Everything you need. Easy access to town. Awesome outdoor space. I was sad it was 100 degrees and we couldn’t really use it. Kevin and Melissa made sure this is a home away from home. They even had local pictures and maps of fun things so do close by. Perfect for a weekend away or week of exploring the area. We will definitely go back when we travel that way.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kevin and Melissa’s place is stunning! The attention to detail is so impressive right down to the mints and bottles of water set out for you. Their place is very well supplied with anything you would need. All of the furniture is comfortable, especially the bed! The private patio was lighted with string lights and very inviting. I would definitely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Nice farmhouse that was very comfortable and close to Farmington.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an incredible escape from the hustle of everyday life. Having grown up in the country, this was a callback to childhood; the sound of cicadas, the crystal clear night sky, the quiet and serenity. Their farmhouse was crystal clean and the property is perfectly located b/w two incredibly quaint towns. For the coffee lover (or anyone with kids) be sure to check out the Station in Fredericktown. Countless hikes and opportunities for nature lovers. Highly recommended."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay! Newly renovated and beautifully decorated. Everything you need for a relaxing, quiet getaway. Loved the front porch!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful farmhouse, very tastefully furnished. Our hosts were wonderful to let us get in a little early to get baby gear set up before we were needed at wedding activities.
It should be noted that bedroom #3 is more of a loft, there's no door and one wall only goes halfway up, it's open to the stairwell. It wasn't a problem for us, but could be very awkward.
I didn't realize the bathrooms are both on ground level, while the second bedroom and loft are upstairs. It wasn't a big deal to us, though.
Overall, a lovely location and very pleasant."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Best hosts ever, comfortable beds, very clean, privet location, everything was perfect and we definitely enjoyed our stay."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Awesome place and perfect for our group visiting St. Joe State Park. There was plenty of room for our trucks and trailers hauling our ORV's. We will stay again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute farmhouse in a quaint location. We didn’t have any solid plans when we arrived, but found great hiking and activities to do in the area! Lots of reading books and relaxing!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved this little place !! It was easy to find (I was a bit worried on maps — but SO easy to find) it was small but spacious enough for what I needed . Everything in the kitchen for cooking, loved the bonfire area + the backyard to just go for a walk & get some fresh air !!
I loved how comfy the beds were 🙌🏼 it sounds so silly but beds are typically “hard” and not very comfortable .. but the master was ! Everything was clean + well put together ! Will definitely stay here again when coming down next time."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Was a great place to get away for the weekend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had such a good time here! It was a great place for a girl’s weekend. The place was as described and easy check-in process.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This is a very well designed, cozy little farm house! While I was quite comfortable, it did get a little cold for the ladies with just wall units. Some of the fixtures (showerhead, etc) were a little loose which may be from prior usage, not a big deal. I would definitely go back if we had to visit Farmington again!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Enjoyed our stay very much. Accommodations met our needs well
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,Loved this little place! Had plenty of room and well stocked with everything! Loved the peaceful surroundings. Would definitely stay here again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Steve made check in easy and was quick to respond to any questions we had! We were there for a girls weekend and we were 15 minutes from a couple of wineries! We would stay again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Steve and Jennifer's place. The house is cozy, beautiful and clean. We would stay there again if in the area."
2024-01-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful country home.
We did have an issue with no water for several hours but a serviceman did come and fix it"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful house to stay at. Kitchen is loaded with things you need and everything was just right for our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was so great for a birthday weekend in peace! My family and I enjoyed ourselves very much and were able to unplug and spend time together.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,I recommend this location. It was cozy and private.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,Steve described his home well. Was a very easy check in process and answered all questions. Some towels had a musty odor to them.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had an excellent experience at Steve’s place. Very accommodating for our group of seven, six adults and one child under 1, we used the kitchen for multiple meals. Nice location between Farmington and the Venue we were attending a wedding at. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again. The only thing I would say as a negative is the bedroom with the twin beds is not really a room but a loft. It’s open to the view of the stairs. Again minor negative, had a great stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,I recently have been researching Sears Roebuck homes and loved that we were able to stay here. The home is so inviting and there were several deer in the yard in the evening and early morning. We had 3 adults and 2 kids staying. There was plenty of room for every one and lots of towels. I highly recommend this place.
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Steve’s place was so great! It was beautiful and clean. We’d definitely stay again. Highly recommend.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing! I absolutely loved the destination and the surroundings. Beyond beautiful!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the peace and quiet.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,As described by the host and other guests. Beautiful place to stay and a short drive to Farmington. I would book again without hesitation.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I, our grown son and a church friend visited the Farmington area for a volunteer work project. We were delighted to find Steve and Jennifer's listing and just as happy with it upon our arrival. The check-in was easy and communicating with Steve and Jennifer was excellent. This recently remodeled house is beautifully decorated! The kitchen is lovely and has plenty of place to prepare and cook meals as well as a nice dining room with a large table that seats up to 7 guests. The beds were comfortable and everything was very clean. The 3 days we spent there were some of the hottest days this summer but the the little house was kept very cool with the split unit air conditioners. The setting is very peaceful and quiet as the house sits back from the road. A pair of almost friendly fawns came out to graze in the yard every day that we were there. If we return to the area, this little farm would be my first pick."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place to stay! Charming house in a peaceful location near elephant rock and Johnson shut ins. Two baby dear spent the weekend with us in the front yard! House was clean and tidy. Would stay again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was exactly as advertised and was an absolute gem to stay in. I would absolutely recommend and stay here again thank you.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place to stay if you are visiting the Ironton area. It was a reasonable drive to Johnson's Shut-Ins and Elephant Rocks State Parks. Very short drive to the beautiful Pickle Springs Natural Area. Less than 10 minutes to multiple grocery stores/restaurants.
The home was very clean and nicely updated. My family with two young children felt comfortable/safe and would stay here again. My children loved watching the two fawns that frequently visited to the property during our stay."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute home. Loved the decor, layout and to attention detail. The amenities were great. We had 2 fawns visiting the yard daily. We would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house was exactly what we were looking for. A comfortable home away from home. Peaceful. Relaxing. Enjoyed seeing the baby fawn every morning. Furnishings were spot on.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We so enjoyed our stay. It is a cute farm house, clean and a very private! Close to great wineries around the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place. Great for a peaceful getaway. Loved the farmhouse charm with the modern updates. Would recommend this place to anyone!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"This was a wonderful place to stay! Very clean, peaceful, and cute! It was the perfect place for my family of 7 people. Steve was also responsive and easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Cute little country home! We felt comfortable and safe. The updated kitchen was nice to cook in and the front porch was a delight. We visit this area of Missouri every year and we look forward to renting from Steve again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So many great things…
From how adorable the home is, how perfect the front porch swing was, and how my family (my 4 kids 16, 13, 9, & 7 my husband and myself) had plenty of room and were able to have game time.
30-45 mins to elephant rock and johnson shut in. We also went to Pickle Trail which was even better! So many adorable coffee shops around, great places to eat, so many options!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in town with friends - four adults and three kids (2-6 years old). The house was a perfect place for us to have a home base while exploring local day hike locations. We enjoyed Pickle Springs Natural Area, Elephant Rocks State Park, and Castor River Shut-Ins during our stay.
The house was beautiful and clean. We had plenty of linens and enjoyed the well stocked kitchen for all the plates and cooking utensils needed for making meals at home. A delight!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very much enjoyed our stay. Close enough to town that it wasn't a painful drive to do anything, but far away enough that it was quiet, peaceful, and private."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Perfect place to explore nature and wineries! We loved that it was in the middle for both and loved the privacy we had
2023-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very cute, updated farmhouse. Everything was extremely clean and as described. The house is cooled by 2 mini-split AC units, one upstairs and one downstairs. But because of their location in the house, only 1 of the 3 bedrooms are fully air conditioned. They do provide fans in the other rooms, and the downstairs main bedroom was definitely cooler than the upstairs one. But the queen bedroom upstairs was pretty warm even with a fan going. We stayed on a pretty hot weekend (88-90 degrees), and the upper bedroom was never completely intolerable, but it was warm. This is the only reason I’m giving it 4 stars. Overall a really lovely stay though!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, thanks"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,This house was beautifully decorated and absolutely spotless. I’m a little bit of a germaphobe and even brought some of my own cleaning supplies to clean when we got there but it wasn’t needed. Kudos to the cleaning team! It’s in a nice secluded location but close enough to town to be the perfect spot to stay. Steve and Jennifer were so nice to deal with and answered any and all questions we had. We look forward to staying here again on our next trip to the area.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,This house was adorable. We stayed for the weekend for a wedding nearby and were very happy with our accommodations. We really enjoyed relaxing on the front porch in the evenings and early mornings. We have already talked about staying here again in the future.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"One of the best Airbnb stay we ever had! The place is so clean, it's easy to find. Great place for group gathering."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a peaceful retreat! Came on my wife’s birthday with the kids. House was so cozy, welcoming and everything was perfect. Steve and Jennifer sent a guide with places to see and places to eat. All was spot on! Get a coffee at the ‘Station’, coolest shop ever, and picked from the many state parks to sightsee. We went to Elephant Rocks, highly recommend. Also you have the choice from a couple of wineries. We went to Chaumette Vineyards & Winery…great selection of wine and had a live singer on the awesome deck/patio, overseeing the vineyards. Finally, grab some homemade ice cream and sorbet at Columbia St. Mercantile. Highly recommend to anyone looking to get away from the hustle and relax!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Just as described. Great place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely beautiful house in a gorgeous location. My family loved every moment we were there.

2023-03-01,5,Group trip,A very easy choice if you are looking for a remote little getaway. The property is exactly as advertised. My friends and I spent the weekend here to connect and relax on a whim. Check-in and out was seamless. Incredible bang for your buck!

We will be back for sure! Thank you!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great little farm house to stay for a few days. Everything is newer so it felt clean and updated, which I appreciate. Liked that the property offered quietness and privacy. Owners were good about communicating. Checking in and checking out was easy. I would definitely recommend this property to others!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home was everything and more than the listing states. The home was clean and beautifully decorated. The second that we stepped in, we felt like we were home. We enjoyed walking the property, swinging on the front porch swing and waking up to the gorgeous views! The host was quick to respond to any questions that I had. We will be returning in the near future."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,Steve hosted my employees while they were working a local job. They informed me that they really enjoyed the house and that it was very comfortable. Steve was responsive and professional.
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,They loved it my roofing crew is working at the prison will need again tonight thru Tuesday night
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to stay if you happen to be in the area! Beautiful remodel of an old farm house. If looking for something that has a great atheistic yet keeps some elements of old house charm, this is a great option for you. Stairway is a bit narrow, but matches the period in which the house was built."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Karli was very responsive and a great host.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We rented this home, instead of a hotel. My husband's mom had past. It was amazing!! The host was so kind and gracious! Big bedrooms! Comfortable beds! She had coffee, and snacks, plus bathroom supplies!! The backyard had a great firepit, we really enjoyed the experience!"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Although we arrived in the evening and left the next morning, our short stay at Karli's was still very pleasant. The house is very comfortable and cute, and looks just like the photos. We didn't use all the amenities (kitchen appliances, laundry, etc.) but everything seemed very nice. If we were ever in the area again, we would stay at Karli's place again for sure."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute little house right in the middle of everything. Perfect location. Very nice inside, perfect for our family."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful place. We stay at a lot of places in the area and this one is near or at the top of the list. We felt like we were away. Secluded, scenic, peaceful, clean. We can’t wait to go back."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Very quiet and relaxing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was beyond words. We booked last minute and had the absolute BEST time exploring the property, hanging with the goats and chickens, fishing off the dock, and chilling by the fire. The house was spacious and very clean, with everything you could possibly need in the kitchen. Location was perfect and so close to whatever store you need things from. 10/10 will return. We truly had an amazing time at this beautiful place and what topped it off was how extremely nice the hosts were!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing peaceful cabin to relax at. The host made things so easy and the animals and pond made for an incredible scene to hang out at for the weekend. Will for sure be back and would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the area.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very beautiful and peaceful time & lots of time to just relax❤️
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Pictures do not do this place justice. Private and peaceful surroundings...front porch and dock are perfect places to have a nice quiet cup of coffee in the morning as you watch the wildlife (covered porch was great in the rain). Cabin was perfect for the four of us. Bathroom was a nice size and overall space was open and homey. Jennifer and Tyler really did a great job setting everything up for guests. Would definitely stay again on my next trip to the area.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and loved our stay. A very peaceful location tucked away in the woods with a gorgeous view of the pond. The property was beautiful. I would recommend this location to anyone wanting to get away and relax.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Again, a great place to stay, perfect property"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place great hosts amazing cabin to stay for peaceful family time
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is the perfect place to unwind! The view from the cover front porch is amazing. The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed. The property is very private and beautifully landscaped. Plenty to do outside with the bone fire pit, paddleboat, and tree swing. The miniature goats and chickens added to the charm of the cabin. Would definitely come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best place I’ve stayed in missouri by far, great for our family and we will be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a very peaceful and amazing weekend here and would 100% return. The privacy and view from the porch was great. And the house was very clean and cozy.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin in a peaceful setting! We loved the lake right out front and the privacy of the location. The interior of the cabin was cozy and a great vacation vibe. We could not have been happier with the cabin and the setting. The miniature goats and chickens were also a fun addition to the location!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay in this cozy cabin. It was perfect. The cabin is very clean and has all the kitchen items you need. The setting is beautiful and we enjoyed hanging out by the bonfire, fishing, using the paddle boat, and drinking coffee on the front porch.. This is also close to hiking trails. We enjoyed a hike a Pickle Springs. We plan to return."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A true little Paradise with all that u need in a stunning/private location! Tucked away in such beautiful surroundings yet just a short drive to Farmington and all the wonderful sights/adventures of the area! The cabin is perfect: clean, cozy, comfortable, convenient. With a wood stove to make it even cozier! The pond, dock, outdoor areas are fantastic! The hosts have done a fantastic job preparing this lovely spot and they were helpful in every way. I enjoyed my time there and look forward to returning…asap!!"
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin is truly magical! Nestled in a small patch of woods with a secluded pond and the company of two very friendly goats, this spot is perfect to get some time away from a busy city. My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights and felt fully relaxed by the end of it. Apart from waking up to beautiful fall views every morning, we were in a short 15 min drive of enjoying the charm of Farmington or the hikes of Pickle Springs. We would love to come back in the winter to see this place in the snow and have appreciated Jennifer and Tyler's quick communication throughout the trip."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,everythingwas amazing we can't wait tk come back
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had an amazing time, I felt right at home. They even left treats for my pup, how amazing is that?! I will be back. This place is perfect for a quite, safe and romantic getaway. Yes, you’ll see all the stars!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great set up! Really enjoyed it. Very sleek and professional company. You will be staying in hotel/cabin /trailer village with other 50 of so exactly the same hotel/cabin/trailers spread through the property.
Nice little trail to the creek.
After already drinking the water/coffee, what we thought was complementary, we spotted price card hidden, under coffee bags with prices of coffees and smores kit, which confused me, If the things inside are for sale it needs to be clearly stated, rather then been surprised with paid for ""hospitality"" later."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you we had a relaxing most definitely deserved time.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We just love staying at any of the Getaway Cabins. Despite there being several cabins around, it’s very quiet and peaceful. The cabin is spotless and they even left us treats and bowls for the dogs. We cannot wait to come back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at the Getaway Cabins immensely! It wasn’t far from home yet it felt like we were right at home. The large window above the sleeping area gave a beautiful view of the surroundings and it made the stay comfortable. We really enjoyed the campfire area, which made the whole stay feel peaceful and romantic. Overall would recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great communication. Easy to find with clear instructions. Definitely was a bonus having that huge picture window while it was storming outside. Went right to sleep and comfortable
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean, off grid tiny home with all the amenities you could want. We requested an extra dog lead and it was delivered within 20 minutes! Very accommodating! Enjoyed our weekend away here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to go and relax away from all the noise.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Two words…. Beautiful and peaceful! Such a wonderful getaway for me and my husband. We were able to reconnect with each other and just forget about the world for a couple of days. The cabin was clean and cozy. It had everything we needed and more. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a hideaway!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect space for my ""Me Retreat"". To be able to unplug for a few days was amazing. The description of the tiny cabin was spot on and it was very clean. The surroundings were beautiful and the space between the cabins was perfect as ones trip is not disturb by other cabin goers. I would definitely love to back to this establishment."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,BEAUTIFUL STAY!! So peaceful and quiet. Absolutely gorgeous location and the cabin was so cute. Had all the essential amenities & host were very responsive. 10/10 stay!
2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway as good going for it - looking for a place to unplug yet not be completely removed from people you found a great place. The window is awesome! I think the fact that it’s its own thing plus Airbnb gets confused at times? We had our first cabin with some cleaning issues and then a leak; however, Getaway gave us an option to move cabins and made sure we were taken care of. Enjoyed our stay overall after the cabin move! A great in between of nature and comforts."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the privacy of each location. While not far from other sites, unit positioned so window view was completely private for view. Although we didn't bring our fuzzy family member, multiple other guest did bring theirs. The facilities are definitely pretty friendly and other than lease and other well appointed accessories at the site you couldn't tell pets were in our unit previously. Upon entry the smell in the unit was very pleasant! Personal note for us and nice touches inside. Had a great time on our stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful area
2024-06-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"The hosts had great communication and even provided a welcome doggy bowl package inside, knowing I was bringing my furry friend along. I booked the cabin for 2 nights, but unfortunately, I ended up finding ticks crawling on the bed and my dog after the first several hours. We had walked the property but hadn't done any major hiking, so I would advise being extra cautious if you bring your pup(s)! I checked out late the first night, and we found over a dozen ticks already attached to her that we had to remove at home. Airbnb support was very quick to rectify the situation, thankfully. I wish we could've stayed longer to enjoy the amenities - the property has several different ""neighborhoods"" of cabins, but they are all spaced out and private areas. Beautiful view from the large cabin window... smores kit... basic necessities and overall a good spot to disconnect."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed to spent time here. Very clean, comfortable and you stay in forest but same time you will have everything what you will need
(I found dog bowls, aluminum roll, extra trash bags) and if you will need fire wood you can grub some for extra charge so really nice place to stay)"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"this place is heaven. a great place to disconnect and relax. the check in was so smooth, the place was squeaky clean. I had so much quiet time to myself. I locked my phone in the box and read the books. they have puzzles for you to solve. the view from the window is amazing. making a fire was fun. they provide everything you need. honestly 10/10 I can't wait to go back. thank you so much Getaway."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at the Getaway cabins for a Mothers Day solo trip.
Many of the state parks were easily accessible from the cabins as well.
It was a beautiful and relaxing spot to take a few days away for myself."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a beautiful place. Serine starlight bonfire waking up to a beautiful forest view bedside
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Very lovely place to disconnect
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the BEST little romantic getaway we could have hoped for! So secluded, beautiful surroundings, the tiny cabin is well equipped and very comfortable, and we loved cooking over the campfire. I’ve already told several friends about this place and we will absolutely be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Hands down the best place ive ever stayed on AirBnb. If you need to relax and be out in nature this is the place. The hosts were extremely nice and helpful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing visit! It was a very clean cabin and made us feel right at home. Perfect for a couple days away from the world. Will stay again!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Simply incredible! Perfect place to unplug and unwind! it's gorgeous.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is exactly what I was looking for. Came to the area for a lot of hiking, and this place was central located from several near by trails. This cabin had everything we needed to help us relax. The mattress and pillows were surprisingly very comfortable and the huge window was amazing. The cabin provided enough hot water for our showers and the linen was very clean."
2024-05-01,4,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my stay! It was everything and more that you could want in a camping trip.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was clean and had all the necessities, with things like coffee and firewood for sale.
There is very little around the cabins, the closest spot for Walmart and restaurants is about 30 min away.
It was quiet and peaceful, the views were beautiful, and there are some great hikes not far from the site!
I had service (AT&T) my partner did not (T-mobile)
Definitely would stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had the best time at our little getaway. We would most definitely recommend and look forward to booking again in the future!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a clever idea! We had the most relaxing time at Getaway.
Such lovley and peaceful grounds and we loved our tiny cabin! Loved the fire pits and enjoyed the peace.
I might recommend upping the price by like $20.00 and have all of the things in the cabin, be ""free""- the boxed water, coffee, smore kits, etc.
It would have been nice to have a proper mirror in the bathroom vs the 5x7 mirror on a keychain.
Thank you for a lovely weekend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect for some quiet time out in the woods!!They provided everything you’d need, including lighters, a lantern, and the basics for the kitchen and bathroom. The fire pit was great and having the large window to watch the woods in the morning when we got up was pretty incredible."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"No idea we had something like this around the city. The place is well put together, not a KOA campsite. All of our friends are already looking at going."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was a great getaway after our wedding. It was cozy and quiet and much needed. Just be aware that you are in the woods and there are critters. We had a spider or two pay a visit inside and our dog picked up a tick even though he was inside most of the time. Other than that we enjoyed our stay immensely!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"These tiny home cabins are everything you could want from this type of experience. There's a lot of space between all the cabins so you have a good amount of privacy. This isn't like at a resort or campground where all the cabins are directly side by side so you feel like you're trying to ignore the neighbors.
Everything worked great in the cabin. The shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. We used the stove to heat up dinner and boil water for coffee in the morning. The bed was super comfortable and the giant window right next to the bed was wonderful.
This company has locations all over the U.S. and we will definitely search them out in the future as we travel!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice place. Will stay again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful and cozy. Exactly what we needed. We booked last minute due to rain in our intended camping area, and this was the perfect place to wait out the storm. I was impressed by how responsive the hosts were considering the last minute booking."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A++
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great alternative to an urban setting. Nestled in woods, private from other guests, wonderful view of the landscape from the bed...what a scene to wake up to. We stayed in early spring so trees and greenery were still budding out. I'd like to come back in the summer or fall to enjoy foliage and color."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice. Smaller than we thought, but enough for a vacation. We had a request, and they accommodated us which we thought was above and beyond. The nature area within the park is great exercise!
Our only complaint was the gravel that surrounds all sites. We like to go barefoot while in nature as much as possible, and we also had our dogs with us. The gravel used was very sharp. Too much to walk on for us, and the dogs struggled a lot with it as well. While we appreciate that they seem to be okay with pets being there, if there was some way to maybe add a layer of smoother gravel the doggies would be much happier!!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoy the quiet time with nature and time spent together. It was a relaxing stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved the tiny home with modern amenities and decor. The massive window was fantastic.
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was brief but absolutely lovely. Definitely watch your pets for ticks. our dog got a tick within minutes of being there.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Glamping first timer, and I was impressed how much room was inside this little tiny home.
I did not cook or grill, but there is indoor pot and pan plus cutting board inside.
Definitely should bring a cooler to keep ice in. (Mini fridge in the tiny home, but no ice)
They had things like coffee and tea for sale (you make yourself)
But no food on site.
So come prepared!
There's a loves with a McDonald's at the exit off the highway & a subway across the bridge at the other gasoline station.
Staff responded to my message about issues with my door code at arrival.
The quickly reset the code and I had no issues the rest of my stay.
Was so quite and night and during the day. Was a lovely stay & I am looking forward to returning."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great time reconnecting with my husband while out in nature! We loved our stay and will be back!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay. Only 1 hour from St. Louis. The locals are super friendly, and there is plenty of nature to see. Thank you for accommodating our party of two so comfortably."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could see the Big Dipper from the bed! It was magical looking at the stars, which were very very clear, while lying in bed. Would highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The cabin view was amazing. The nature path was fun to walk. The Airbnb description could be more clear about what is provided for free and what is provided for a cost (and perhaps listing the cost). We brought our own stuff, but it would have been good to make a more informed decision."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our cabin was well appointed and had a picturesque view out the large bedroom window. We enjoyed sitting by the fire pit and making smores. This is a wonderful place to get away from it all. We’ll be visiting another location very soon.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful place just an hour from STL.
The modern, minimalist cabin was extremely well thought out and packed with amenities. Low shower head pressure for such a large, modern hand- shower, but no real complaints. Great hiking spots a short drive away, and just close enough to small towns with gas, groceries, taverns that you could have the best of both worlds. Very cute place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED our stay at Getaway! Just what we needed for an anniversary getaway! Relaxing and peaceful. I did reach out via message and didn’t get a response while we were there. And the bed was slightly uncomfortable, but good considering it’s a trailer. We can’t wait to check out a getaway in another location!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful and private cabin. Perfect for a vacation, long weekend, or a break from driving for a day as was my situation. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the bed, shower, and kitchen was. My dog loved it as well. 5 stars!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,Very cute little house with great picture window. The only thing I missed was a bathroom sink and bigger mirror.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a fun place to stay! The cabin was cozy, the host was very responsive and welcoming and the setting was incredible. Hawn State Park is close by if you’re a hiker and Sté Genevieve is great to take in if you like early American history. Gorgeous area of Missouri!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,This place is really cool. They have about 38 cabins in the woods. They are all spread out enough to have just enough privacy without feeling like you're alone in the middle of the woods. I was only able to stay 1 night but will return for a longer stay. Amazing cabin with large window next to bed. It was really cool to watch a lighting storm that came through from the comfort of the bed.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend, and would stay here again."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place was very secluded, no cell service, and absolutely beautiful. Close to Pickle Springs which is always a fun trip. Was a bit disappointed as I came to star watch and there was another set of ""rules"" which said fires out and inside by 10 pm. Extras which you may have forgotten are inside for sale, so no need to run to the store."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very enjoyable
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay and wish we would’ve booked it for longer! It was beyond peaceful, cozy, and such a cute space.
The only “con” is that the firewood situation is a little deceitful if you don’t do your research prior to your stay. When booking, it says the firewood is included in the cost of your stay, however, they actually charge extra for it ($9/bundle). Luckily we learned that before we got there.
Overall, our stay here was terrific and we’re already planning our next one!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nice little cabin/ camp area.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,one of the best places I have stayed .enjoyed the peace and quiet.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I absolutely loved how clean and cozy the cabin was, the only down side was the big curtain in the cabin was broken so we didn’t get to enjoy the view from the big window."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was a very nice place to stay! The location is great, slightly secluded but you feel safe because you can see other cabins! The window by the bed is amazing, definitely our favorite part. I do wish the sheets were more clean as I did see some hair on them. I also wish there were less items in the room that cost extra, I think it would be nice to keep those in a store nearby instead of taking up space in the room."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,An amazing getaway close to home. Definitely will be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, enjoyable tiny cabins. The hosts were responsive and very professional. I'd recommend for people trying to find a rural getaway somewhat close to St. Louis."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay. It was exactly as described. We will definitely return!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super fun weekend trip!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the second time we’ve stayed at a Getaway location and we absolutely loved it. Our go to for road trip adventures and relaxing time away from home.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay at the cabin. It was great to have a hiking trail right out our door. Having free firewood right on site made a nightly fire stress free. Very quiet and relaxing.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay and are co sidering staying again in the future. Was cozy and comfortable without being too small or tight.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A great getaway from the city
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The perfect getaway!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved it!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful weekend getaway! The giant picture window really makes it worth it. We were kind of bummed about the additional prices for firewood and other amenities but the small touches of the cell phone lock box, the personalized note, the books provided and even the radio (with Bluetooth hookup) was really nice. We had everything we needed to cook good meals, but there is no coffee pot or microwave.
The devices in the cabin (air, fridge, fan in the bathroom) were kind of noisy and kicked on/off a lot so if you’re a light sleeper, bring a sound machine!
The location is beautiful, with thick woods and the walking trail while it was quite a hill to get down and back up was pretty to walk.
Overall, it was a wonderful weekend away. The giant window is beautiful to look out and the overall layout of the cabin was really nice. The outside area was well prepared for campfires with a full grate for cooking along with a poker stick, hook (for a Dutch oven)."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Getaway was an absolute great time of disconnection and being out in nature. The cabin was just what I needed with a beautiful picture window. The team was very responsive and helpful for all my questions. This is the first of many return trips.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Even better than expected. Perfect getaway for our family. The host had every detail thoughtfully organized. Would highly recommend. We will definitely be back!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Worth it!! It’s our second time
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely! A luxury camping experience in an efficient tiny house. The picture window is a fabulous as it looks. Comfy bed, private bath/shower, and efficient kitchen space as well as campfire with firewood already prepared for guests.
We withheld a star because it wasn't as quiet as we'd hoped. Neighbors were fine, and the location was secluded and peaceful, but devices in the cabin kept us awake. If we ever stay in a Getaway cabin again, we'll bring ear plugs. The bathroom dehumidifier, important as it is, was noisy even with the bathroom door closed, and the air exchanger that brings fresh air into the cabin cycled continually. We're guessing something was wrong with that particular unit, so that's probably not typical. But you might want ear plugs.
Also worth noting: A card in the cabin listed costs for amenities, but we were assured they are covered for airbnb guests.
We really appreciated Getaway's proactive communication and quick responses to our questions."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed my time in nature and Getaway offered exactly what was promised.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed one night,Loved this little getaway! Will definitely be back again!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,perfect for what we needed... a quick getaway after a long day's hike! I would recommend including that there are provisions to pay for if you're wanting to use the fire wood etc. We were not aware before starting the camp fire. Dirty clothes left in the room made us feel uncertain that the place was cleaned.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway St. Francois was the perfect, peaceful retreat I needed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay at Getaway! It was peaceful and had everything we needed. For anyone going I recommend bringing extra blankets. Highly recommend for anyone who wants an outdoor experience with some comfort.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing!! The staff were quick to respond and very kind. It was a beautiful stay and we enjoyed the onsite trails. We will definitely be coming back!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exactly what we wanted/hoped for /expected
for a quick retreat to the woods!"
2024-03-01,3,Stayed with kids,"we arrived a bit later and because it was dark we had gotten lost, the host responded very quick and directed us to the right direction and we also had a couple troubles with the keypad, again host was very fast to help out and i appreciate that! the window is gorgeous in this cabin it layed out next to the bed is beautiful and comes off as a cozy aesthetic. i bet it looks even more beautiful in winter !"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was amazing! Was great to put our phones away and really connect. Everything was clean and well kept. Should have stayed longer.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, nice get away"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Was a great place to spend the weekend
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful spot for a little getaway! The hosts were very attentive, and helpful. The other cabins were at a perfect distance to feel like you had privacy. Just a very unique spot and would like to come back again with my pup! 🥰"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a very nice time.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The stay was incredible for my wife myself and our dog. They even provided a lead for a dog to use in the outside area!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We will definitely be back! We loved everything about it. Beautiful surroundings and very private
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Communication with staff was above and beyond! Will be staying here again and again!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful view!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place for the night.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great escape from the daily grind.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Went for one night weekday stay. was very clean, quiet, and secluded! definitely going back 😀"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This was definitely a much-needed getaway to disconnect from every day life. ￼ The surroundings brought so much peace and serenity into￼ the stay with the large windows surrounding the bed. They go above and beyond with the firewood and s’mores kits. Definitely will be booking this again as a decompression destination from the day to day chaos ￼of life.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Relaxing, quiet place to stay! We enjoyed the nature path and talking for hours by the campfire. Our cabin was well-equipped, clean,
modern, and cozy with a comfortable bed and great view. Will recommend to other couples wanting a cost-effective romantic getaway!"
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful stay. It was very peaceful and comfortable. Definitely a beautiful place to wake up. Be aware though that there are fees for coffee, tea, etc. There are not any instruments to make coffee (besides hot water kettle) to make your own, so we would’ve brought our own French press and beans had we known. It was really nice and relaxing, but for the amount you pay it seems a little cheap to charge for coffee and tea. There are also charges for firewood and fire starters, which we didn’t know about previously as well. Overall would stay again and recommend to friends."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the Lefty! It was so peaceful, well designed, and the perfect location. We will definitely be back!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,my first staying in getaway definitely worth it.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful stay. We were surprised at how big it felt on the inside. Everything was super clean and very well put together with very satisfying temperature control. We had a wonderful time!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very secluded, quiet, peaceful, relaxing. Could really really take a breath of fresh air away from the hustle of day to day life. Nice place to unwind and not feel any pressure"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at Getaway was amazing!! We’ll definitely revisit!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect getaway!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great spot if you want to unplug or do a little ""glamping"". The location is great with a variety of local spots to explore."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,I stay here all the time. Love this place its my getaway close to home. Compared to this area they are pricy. However its unlike anything else in the area and you totally get what you pay for. This place is awsome has inspired you to build a tiny home of my own. Totally worth every cent. I will keep coming back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,It was an absolute wonderful stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We found exactly what we needed. It was so peaceful and private. The cabin is compact and cozy and felt like home. Everything that cabin offered to us was in use throughout our stay. Nothing more nothing less. Waking up to a huge outdoor view from a huge window was amazing each day. The cleanliness of the cabin is something that beyond our expectations. I think moving forward this place will be our gateway destination..
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Loved watching the moon from a comfy bed. Next time we hike Pickle Springs we will come back :)
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for couples or just a peaceful single get away
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I couldn’t have enjoyed our stay more! We hope to make it a regular destination for us!!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The getaway cabin was amazing. It was peaceful with beautiful views. The host had very good communication and was available 24/7 by phone(call or text), sos phone or air bnb communication. They also provided suggestions on what to do that was close by. Now you will need to provide all of the campfire essentials like fire starters, lighter fluid, fire logs, lighters, etc because the ones they provide are very cheap and doesn’t work. Also make sure to bring all of your own pans, dishes, utensils, etc to cook with. Other than those very minor things this is a great small cozy cabin."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Most incredible experience! Worth every penny! 🥰
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This stay was absolutely perfect! Not a single thing I would change. It was unbelievably clean, incredibly peaceful, beautiful, and so very relaxing. Will absolutely be returning!
Thank you for such a rejuvenating weekend."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay and would definitely come back again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my second stay with Gateway. It's an extremely tranquil place. The cabins are very cozy and clean. Definitely a place to sit back relax and enjoy nature!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a wonderful way for me and my girlfriend to spend our first anniversary together, extremely peaceful and serene. The cabin comes with everything you need for a wonderful getaway."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful cabins with good views.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great getaway for my wife and I.
Was not prepared to have to pay for coffee, firewood, and several other amenities. Ill be better prepared next time we stay.
We will return, enjoyed the privacy, peacefulness, beautiful scenery from the trailer, and easy access."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was done intentionally down to every detail of the space. Would HIGHLY recommend!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"host is the best, good getaway for you and your significant other"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Definitely a nice relaxing stay and can’t wait to be back.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our peaceful weekend in the woods! The cabin was comfortable with good hot water, nice bed, and other well thought out amenities. Next time we come, we will bring more towels and blankets for our comfort (it was a rainy weekend), and more firewood (its purchase only at the cabin). Even with the rain, it was an enjoyable and cozy weekend. We will be back!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Will definitely be back! Everything was so nice, heating was perfect and so was hot water. Loved our stay!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always great
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,An incredible stay! Thanks
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My partner and I absolutely loved this spot. It was quiet and secluded with a beautiful view. The Airbnb itself was setup to allow you to turn off for a bit. The folks that work for this Airbnb are extremely sweet and helpful. We couldn’t have asked for a better parents getaway!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place. I chose it based on reviews and it was indeed just great. I stayed in this freezing cold (-20 C, -4 F at night) and was scared if it will be cold. But it was SUPER WARM, AC worked, water in the shower was HOT - just fantastic. Host communicated everything proactively, was always online.
There’s a nature path, I walked in the woods. They have recommendations where to go close to the cabin, what to do, activities, books. As a minimum - there’s a McDonalds 10 min drive 😁, but also recommended restaurants and you can do a fire (for a price, but still).
Super recommend! Just what I wanted to unwind"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,It was absolutely amazing. We loved the quiet and no distractions! We went to St. Genevieve and had the best food at The Old Brick House. We will be coming back. It was amazing to sit and watch the snow fall! We want to come back in the Spring.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Getaway is my happy place!!! This is the perfect spot for a peaceful retreat. I have been twice and plan to go many more times
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a fabulous day! Completely surpassed my expectations! The set up was lovely, super cozy, and warm, considering the freezing cold temperatures outside."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay here. The surroundings were beautiful and we will definitely be back again!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway is the place to go for some wholesome time to reconnect with nature, yourself, your partner, or all three!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had to really great time. Me and my fiancé got to connect scenery was beautiful. Can’t go wrong. We’ll definitely go again.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had an excellent weekend, great experience. We will definitely come back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Quiet and nice getaway!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to getaway!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The window by the bed made all the difference. It snowed while I was there. It was beautiful to watch. I asked for some recommendations, and they looked into it right away. These little cabins are such a fun place to get away, zone out, and enjoy nature."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay! Had everything we needed for a new year reset. :)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning! I didn’t want to leave. Peaceful and relaxing. Also extremely clean! Can’t wait to go back, 2 nights wasn’t enough."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The scenery and setting of the cabin brought an unexplainable sense of peace. The cabin was very clean and had everything you needed.
What I was not a huge fan of about the stay was that music was not allowed to be played outside, the water had a weird smell, I brought drinking water, also The signs were not the largest to see and there were not too many lights.
The cabin was well heated and provided a sense of safety and comfort. Overall, I loved it and look forward to another visit."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,such an amazing quiet location. we can't wait to come back. thankyou again
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was fun
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at the cabin! It was very clean and well kept. Lots of hiking trails within 30 min distance by car.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at prolly 50+ airbnbs and this is an experience that impressed me, especially noting the value. the cabin is very cute and very cozy, the stargazing was beautiful, the forest was peaceful, check in is no/contact/easy. There is no cell service or WiFi, but it’s noted in the listing and it was nice to unplug. I would advise fellow travelers to arrive during daylight hours, if possible, because it gets very dark (which is ideal for aforementioned stargazing, but tricky for navigation on gravel roads). I would advise the hosts to note more clearly that the coffee/tea/treats are available only for purchase, not for free. It’s somewhat atypical for airbnbs to leave out treats that will incur fees if taken, and it wasn’t marked very clearly. Luckily I noticed before grabbing anything, so no worries, just a note. I would absolutely recommend this stay. Thanks so much!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We (my boyfriend and I) truly enjoyed this cabin. The host was very friendly and the cabin was exactly what we were hoping for. It was a bit difficult to find, but once we realized the cabins were alphabetized, it was a smooth check-in. Would definitely visit again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Getaway was great and very accommodating to us! It was lovely and peaceful!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Getaway was a perfect weekend escape! It is quiet and peaceful and surrounded by nature. It is the perfect way to unplug and recharge! I can’t wait to return for another escape!
2023-12-01,3,Stayed a few nights,An amazing place to stay near bloomsdale. on concern we’re the condition of the blinds and the smell from the water
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a good idea to take a weekend away here!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as shown. All the basics and no extras which was exactly what I was looking for. I didn’t realize that this was setup as a camp ground with tiny homes on each site when I booked. I usually enjoy getting away from absolutely everyone but it was still quite and felt more private then a camp ground usually feels. Tiny homes all seem pretty new, well maintained and very clean. The host provides coffee, smores, firewood etc but will cost you extra. I travel with everything I need so no issues for me but something to be aware of."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First time booking a tiny cabin and definitely will do it again. It was just the calm I needed before the start of another year. Felt extremely comfortable, and I'm not an out doorsy kind of girl."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The absolute perfect getaway for a couple of nights! Scenery was beautiful in the middle of winter and in the woods. The cabin itself was very clean and everything we needed! 10/10 recommend!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely stay on a beautiful place. The cabin had everything you need and the bed was amazing. Would definitely book again on another place!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to escape and matches with what is said in their description. plus so accessible from st louis.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,always a great weekend at the getaway houses!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Let me just say this spot was excellent for a solo getaway trip. Even as a female I felt pretty safe for how excluded it was. I did not explore the nearby towns so I can’t say much on what was around. However there was a list provided on the table recommending local places to eat and visit on the table as I entered the cabin.
I would like to mention a hidden plus not advertised. As you enter the property there is this open field that is most perfect for stargazing. When I sat there I even saw 7 shooting stars (and I’ve never seen one before Lol!) The hiking trail was neat but very short. I never saw any wildlife except squirrels, which I’ll mention at night, kinda freaky to hear them squirming through the leaves. Overall this was an excellent location and hope to come back in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Stayed here for a night while traveling and this place was super cute and the bed was very comfortable. I would book again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was incredible. Very kind and communicative management made everything easy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quick getaway!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"These cabins are cute and packed with everything you’d need for a weekend in nature. The only thing I’d say is I somehow was expecting trails and nature things near the site, but that wasn’t the fault of the owners. It was magical being able to watch the Geminiids from the bedroom window at night here! We would definitely come again and check out Getaway’s other sites."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Love it would stay again
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. It was cozy and relaxing! We would have like to have been more secluded. Overall we enjoyed our stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect little getaway! So peaceful and private. The host was very responsive when we were having trouble with the smart lock to get in. Our favorite part was the firepit area and the host even provides fire supplies.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was very romantic and amazing!! It was also very private! The only thing I would be cautious is the smores and some of the stuff they supply it’s additional pay, but rather than that it was amazing place to stay, will definitely stay there again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Went to do some concentrated work for a couple days and found the space perfect. Easy to access but removed. A small low maintenance space with everything I needed.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Best value I’ve ever had. Defiywill return
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place to relax and experience tiny home in woodsy ""campground"" setting among 40 other widely separated homes operated efficiently by a tiny home national chain. Best part is big picture window at high end of tiny house; otherwise, the space was efficient & clean with one bed, sink, one chair, table, toilet, 2 burner stove, minifridge and shower. No microwave or Wi-Fi as per ""getaway"" design. Provided: sheets, towels & washcloths, dish cloth & towels, plates, bowls, glasses, cups, pan & skillet, pepper and cooking oil; outdoors: a picnic table, firepit and two Adirondack chairs overlooking ravine. Other amenities cost as follows: s'mores package $5, coffee $2, tea $2, hot chocolate $1, insect wipes $1, log bundle $8, fire starter $2. An hour from St. Louis, 30 minutes from Hawn State Park, 10 minutes from Bloomingdale (3+ restaurants). On-site hiking trail(s) out and back from center (half mile, quarter mile: 3 miles both, out and back). Will recommend and will probably go again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place for a weekend getaway in nature while still having a glamping feel. It was clean, had heat/AC, water including hot water, fire pit, kitchen supplies, etc. It had cute special touches like a radio, books, cards, etc.
Keep in mind that they do charge extra for some things like coffee, tea, firewood, fire starters.
Overall nice stay & would come again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was the perfect place to be alone and collect my thoughts. Very clean and the view from the bedroom window was amazing. I would recommend it for a couples getaway or for someone that just wants to getaway for a few days and unwind. Ill definitely be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Getaway was an amazing, safe, beautiful place to “glamp”. Close to wineries, restaurants, and towns, but far away enough that you cannot hear cars. So peaceful. Loved the cabins. Clean and stocked well. Thank you!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"awesome stay! nice and cozy, quiet and clean! will be back again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"loved our stay here, the cabin was comfortable and cozy. we loved the firepit and being able to walk along the trail. we definitely would stay here again."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to get away. The trailer was very cute and made you feel at home. The view makes it feel like you’re really away from civilization. Some amenities came at a cost (coffee, s’mores, food) which was a surprise but they weren’t too expensive. But have a hotel vibe more than airbnb. If I was expecting it, it wouldn’t have bothered me as much. Regardless I’d definitely go again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at Getaway’s cabin! The cozy atmosphere, thoughtful amenities, and easy accessibility made our experience exceptional. The attention to detail in the cabin was impressive, creating a comfortable and memorable retreat. The hosts were responsive and welcoming, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable stay. We highly recommend Getaway for anyone seeking a relaxing getaway. Looking forward to returning in the future!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A nice relaxing weekend.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was great! The cabin had everything needed for a relaxing time away. The nature trail was short but peaceful and Hawn SP, Pickle Springs, and Hickory Canyon were only ~20 min away. This felt very private even though other cabins are near by. All the amenities described were present, but some were at an additional, although reasonable, cost. Looking forward to staying again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect weekend “getaway” to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary! The peace and quiet, and rest and relaxation was everything we wanted and needed! The place was adorable and the window view is unmatched!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a great peaceful place to stay! We had a great night. I will say the only thing was the cabins were closer together than I expected. Overall, it was a very peaceful evening and a great way to disconnect for the night."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We LOVED our stay here. The cabin was clean and comfortable. The giant window made for a really cool view. We saw a few deer from inside our cabin and the fall leaves were nice too. We will definitely be back!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,It was really a nice space to get away.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice cabin, you can really get away"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect for a nice relaxing weekend
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I recommend this for anyone wanting to ‘Getaway’ for the weekend!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was perfect for a quiet, last minute anniversary celebration. Not far from hiking at hawn state park, nice and secluded, very cozy. It was too cold to camp, so this was an excellent solution. The layout was very thoughtful, and they had everything we needed."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Getaway delivered everything that they promised and more! I was expecting a peaceful and isolated experience in nature and that's exactly what I got. Despite the presence of neighbors, I might as well have been in the middle of the woods all by myself. These tiny homes are nestled in little wooded alcoves that act as sanctuaries of solitude. I will absolutely be coming back. This is my new favorite spot!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful weekend at Getaway! It was a perfect retreat and opportunity to disconnect. The cabin was super well thought out and cozy. Can't wait to try a few of the other locations.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very responsive! Beautiful place and had everything needed!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful home!! Even better then the pictures! And you can’t beat the location, blocks from town, restaurants, shopping, etc.
Jennifer was very responsive and accommodating and made sure to let us know she was available if we needed anything. We come every Memorial weekend and will definitely stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay in the Weber house. Very comfortable and conveniently located within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. Jennifer was very friendly and responsive! Highly recommend and will undoubtedly return for another visit.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved, loved, loved this Airbnb!
Clean, close to town, beautiful front porch, comfy beds..I could go on and on!
Do not hesitate to book this!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This space was perfect for our family! Great separation of space between the bedrooms also insured we weren’t waking anyone up when the baby was waking in the middle of the night :) They did a great job with the decor and it was cool to learn that this house belonged to the first mayor of Farmington. Don’t pass up this space for your next visit!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, just a block or so from downtown Farmington. Extremely clean and the interior was well done.
Would recommend anyone stay here who is visiting the area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We LOVED this house so much. This was such a beautiful place to stay. Very clean and relaxing. Jennifer was very responsive if we had any questions. Will definitely want to stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved this cabin in the woods! The porch was incredible! Perfectly in between Ste. Gen and Farmington.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"We loved the rustic feel, the Jacuzzi tub , HUGE shower, porch and that we could park inside the garage. Doug's story about his son really touched us as well because we had a family member die from complications of ALS in 1980. I truly felt the price was worth it though it would have been better for us if more of our expected party has been able to join us to defray costs. And Doug I think we fixed your porch hardware, it just needed an Allen wrench adjustment! Thank you for the wonderful experience!!! 💖💖💖"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,excellent place to stay. very clean and spacious! secluded but close to town and all the wineries. we went for a girls trip and really enjoyed ourselves!
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our Girl Scout troop decided to take a bit of a break from tent camping and we ""glamped"" at The Jonca Creek House. It was a wonderful cross of the outdoors meets a sleepover! There were plenty of beds for our group as well as seating during meals. The cabin was VERY close to Hawn State Park where we hiked the Pickle Creek Trail on Saturday, and then enjoyed a picnic lunch. The porch wrapped almost all the way around the house and we could hear the flowing creek out back. The creek is a little bit of a distance down a hill. More than one scout went exploring down at the creek. The house is right off of Hwy 144, not tucked back in down a long road, so it was very easy to find. We found the kitchen tools and dishes to be well-stocked. The refrigerator was very clean! Bathrooms were neat and clean with plenty of towels and washcloths provided. The girls were all very happy at The Jonca Creek House. They named the bear Samuel and took selfies with him. Ha! We enjoyed our stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home is absolutely beautiful, better then pictures! Had everything we needed. Extra towels, linens, blankets. Home was so spacious and clean. Would love to stay at Jonca Creek again. Thank you so much!"
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"Just a few minor issues, the door leading to the deck from the master bedroom was not able to unlock, seemed like the deadbolt was not working properly. The outside door handle on the porch leading from the dining table comes off completely.
Was very difficult trying to use the TVs probably need some form of instructions for that. We were just trying to get the news in the evening and the mornings and didn't really work out could figure out really any of the tv's. Home was beautiful and surroundings were very nice and great views. Would rate a solid 4 out of 5 just thought there was a couple things that could be addressed rather quickly."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location for hiking at Hawn State Park, Pickle Springs, or Hickory Canyon areas. Dougs place is a peaceful, spacious, well appointed lodge in the woods. We would return."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were looking for a place to stay for a spring break in the STL area that would afford us the chance to explore nature and visit Ste Genevieve and St Louis, and this was just perfect for our family of four plus our pup, in addition to our friends who are also a family of four! The kids had a ball exploring the creek and we all loved the proximity to area hiking trails. The house was clean, spacious, and you can’t beat the views and tranquility from the wraparound porch!
My only comment about the indoor space was that you could hear most noises within the house from both the upstairs loft and master bedroom, but the downstairs/basement sleeping areas were quieter and separate. So as long as your party knows each other well and doesn’t need complete privacy, it’s a wonderful setup."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed being able to take a hike on the property. Having the creek run right through the backyard was very nice dogs enjoyed their selves. We had a great time beautiful home, beautiful surroundings we will most definitely be back.!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"This house is fantastic! Do not let the rustic cabin-like looking pictures fool you. I am NOT a cabin girl and this place was so impressive to me. So super clean and spacious with everything you need to make your stay enjoyable! Plenty of towels, toilet paper and tissues! We came in town for a wedding. Stayed here with my father in law, 2 brother in laws and husband and they all all had their own rooms. My husband and I stayed in the king size bed with the en-suite bath and both the bed and bathroom were amazing. There are two additional full baths and washer and dryer. The wrap around porch was put to good use as the weather was perfect during our stay. If we ever come back to the area we would most definitely stay here again. This place exceeded our expectations. A+ Experience!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great spot to stay, while working there for a full month. Very nice house."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I had a wonderful time. The place was clean, smelled nice, had good amenities and had great value for the price. The listing shows exactly what you get and the wrap around porch was great to sit out on and hangout. Will definitely be coming back!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had an amazing stay. it was the perfect home for a Christmas away from home. The place is more beautiful in person. Tons of space, comfortable, and beautiful surroundings
we will definitely stay again!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,We really enjoyed staying at this place. It was comfortable and spacious. Having three bathrooms was a plus! Enjoyed the porch in the mornings and evenings.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,Perfect stay for St. Gen winery weekend. SO much more spacious than it looks in the pictures. We really enjoyed our stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay close to the park. Very relaxing
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was just like the pictures on the listing. The creek right behind the house was perfect for senior pictures. All of our girls really enjoyed exploring. The only complaint was the weekend went by way too fast and we had to leave to head home. This will definitely be on my list of places we will return to, probably when it's warmer so the kids can go wading in the creek."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Pictures don't do justice. Beautiful spacious cabin that comfortably fits the whole family! Right down the stress from one of the best wineries in Missouri. The perfect weekend getaway.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,had a nice stay at Doug's place. house was clean and as described in listing. thanks!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is absolutely amazing. The pictures do it no justice, it's so peaceful. It stormed alot during our stay and the thunder sounded so cool rolling through the hills. We actually extended our stay. Airbnb made that very difficult but Doug took the time to help us be able to that. The phone service and wifi aren't great, but it's well worth it. I definitely recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in yen for a 70th birthday gathering. This was the perfect place for us to unwind! Nice cabin with a stream in back that you can hear from the deck! Beds were comfy and master bedroom/bath was wonderful! We had plenty of kitchen things to make a huge brunch the next morning!! Very nice house!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing trip, Thank you so much for letting us stay in your home this weekend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family was impressed! It was clean and had fun, themed decor that really made the kids happy! It's pretty much located in Hawn State Park and just an hour drive from Johnson's shut-ins, Castor shut-ins, Meremec State Park, etc. We had everything we needed from towels to plenty of parking spaces."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,The house is cozy and the location is beautiful!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin far exceeded our expectations. It was roomy but still felt cozy at the same time. We found the home to be very wheelchair friendly. The nearby town was easy to navigate with plenty to do.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed about a week,This beautiful home was great because it was handicapped accessible and one member of the family can’t do steps so it worked very well for us. Wifi and reception was limited. We had a lot of business in St. Louis and it was a bit of a commute back-and-forth but overall a wonderful stay!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This home was perfect for our short get away. It is very spacious, peaceful and an absolutely gorgeous setting. I wanted a place to get my sister out of her 4 walls at home that was wheelchair friendly and this fit the needs. Even better is that it had outlets everywhere which helps if you have oxygen machines and have to stay hooked up. We brought our pup who loved darting from peetree to peetree. Definitely would return if I got the chance."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,the house was beautiful. the surroundings were peaceful.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great location for exploring the parks around Ste. Genevieve and Farmington. It's right outside Hawn State Park and 10 minutes from Pickle Springs and Hickory Canyons. It's private and off the beaten path, but there's a convenience store and gas station less than 10 minutes away for anything you might need. It has beautiful surroundings and a lovely wrap-around deck where we spent every afternoon and evening during our stay. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals. Bathrooms are large and we loved the jetted tub and walk-in shower. Beds and pillows were so comfortable. We loved the decor and the comfy feel of the house too. Great place. We would stay here again."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,Great place to stay. Wonderful home!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the house and all the surroundings.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Doug was super helpful with us
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,This was a little gem in the country! Super comfy beds too! The outdoor back porch setting was peaceful and picturesque listening to the rolling stream of water. Fun cabin in woods but not too far from winery’s. Ordered food from The Midway restaurant and was pleased with this experience as well. Thanks Doug! Would definitely go back for another girl’s weekend getaway

2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This house is the perfect weekend getaway for a group or family - it's close to St Louis city but the location is surrounded by woods and a lovely creek that makes you feel like you're far away in a forest. The wrap around porch is great for socializing and grilling and it's a spacious house with plenty of sleeping and napping spots! I can't recommend this house enough, everything was as described, clean and comfy!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had 2 couples and 2 dogs and there was plenty of room for everyone indoors and outdoors. Nice large cabin on a beautiful setting. It's tucked away off a low traffic road and about 15 mins to many places to visit for hiking, winerys, restaurants, and more. We had a great time and hopefully come back soon to explore more of the area."
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place for a group of friends or family! Plenty of space to sprawl out and plenty of bathrooms with showers so there’s no fighting! All of the beds were incredibly comfortable! The pictures did not do this house justice and it’s rustic charm is just so much more amazing in person. The wineries down there especially Cave Vineyards and Chaumette were a must see and about 30 mins away
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Place was clean and roomy. The house was located in great area. Peaceful and quite. Although it was bit far from the wineries and restaurants. Host was super accommodating. Would definitely come back .

2020-11-01,5,Group trip,The Jonca Creek House was amazing and had a great energy! Doug was super hospitable and kind! Highly recommend this property and we will definitely be staying here again once the winter months are behind us!
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Lovely stay. Close to hiking and wineries but you don’t even need to leave to enjoy Nature.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jonca Creek house is great place to stay, especially for a group. I would stay there again. One thing to be aware of is that it is a ways out of town even though it has a Ste. Genevieve address."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,The pictures do not do this house justice! It was much more beautiful in person as soon as we walked in the door. Very clean and close to local wineries. I would highly encourage anyone wanting to check out Ste Genevieve to stay here!

2019-11-01,5,Group trip,Doug's place looks exactly like the pictures. It was the cutest house and very clean. My friends and I cannot wait to go back in the spring to be able to enjoy the outside of it.
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"Doug was very responsive to questions about the property and made the logistics of planning the trip a breeze. The Jonca Creek House is a great cabin/lodge style getaway home within a brisk, 3 mile walking distance to Hawn State Park. Full amenities, including TVs, a kitchen, wrap-around porch (with furnishings), laundry, and a shower you have to see to believe. You may not see Jonca Creek from the house, but you definitely hear it while you're sitting out on the porch; we spent more than a little time just lounging on the porch to take it in! Impeccably clean and cozy; I'm recommending this house to others and hope to stay here for longer trips in the future."
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed here with a group of six girls to visit all the wineries. The homeowner was responsive to any questions I had almost immediately. We were able to check in early.
The house is in a great location with woods and a creek. It’s a beautiful house, very rustic and cozy. It was clean and well maintained. We had a blast and would highly recommend - it’s a great value!"

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Looking to get away with a very quite place stay? This is it. The creek running at the base of the hill was very relaxing to listen to with your morning coffee.
2019-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had a great experience here! Everything was very clean. The home is very spacious and the master bathroom is amazing! The house was well stocked with towels, blankets, and kitchen supplies. The beds were all comfortable (we used them all). It is thoughtfully decorated with a fun bear theme. The wrap around porch over looking the wooded area would be a great place for morning coffee. The owners were very nice and accommodating. This was a very comfortable home that I would highly recommend."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This small house is squeaky clean and well equipped. It’s tucked away behind another house and close to a sister dwelling. The town is small but is walkable from the house. Terrific host and fantastic value! We would definitely return.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay! It was a great, cozy place to get away for a few days. We had fun movie nights in the living space, and the kitchen was perfect for us to cook ourselves dinner a few nights. We would also recommend taking a walk to one of the restaurants nearby!
We happened to have lawn chairs in our trunk, so we enjoyed sitting out on the back porch. If you're able to get one or two chairs to set out there, I'm sure future guests would love it too!
Our stay was great overall, and our host was very helpful and friendly."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Doris was great about allowing an early check-in. Also it was nice to have TWO people I could contact if necessary. The kitchen and bath are up-to-date, and the washer and dryer were a plus. A few clothes hooks on the doors would have been helpful."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at this location but first time in House 2. It is extremely clean, comfortable and private. Enjoyed this stay very much."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family had a great stay at Doris’ Hideaway 2. It is located in a beautiful area with historic homes, and convenient access to hiking trails, as well as restaurants and grocery stores."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our time at this Airbnb. It is a tiny house which we weren’t expecting. The beds were small and inconveniently placed but no big deal. We were really there just to sleep. The bathroom and kitchen were clean and there is a washer and dryer on site but no detergent or soap for the shower. This would be a great longer term stay for someone or if you came prepared with everything you need, you’d be good. I appreciated that there was reliable internet and hard surface floors. Doris allowed us to bring our service dog in training which was a huge blessing. Thanks for a good stay!"

We will definitely stay here the next time we come back to the area."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little getaway for two!
Previous reviews talked about low water pressure and a bad smell from the water. The pressure was great.
There was a slight odor to the water, so if your used to city water, it may come as a surprise, but it wasn’t bad at all.
Bed was very comfortable for both of us and the hot tub was extremely relaxing!
I would definitely visit again!!!"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,Only thing was a picture of a pond and no pond on the property to go to.

2023-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The house was super cute and clean. The only issue I had was the water smelled really bad and the water pressure was really low so showering wasn't enjoyable. The host were very responsive, I'm pretty sure the water smell was a city issue. It was in a perfect location for me due to my father in law lived close by which was why we went in the first place. I would definitely book again hoping the water pressure issue gets fixed which I did let them know and they said they would look into it. This was my first time staying in a air bnb and it was much better than staying in a hotel. The hosts were great with communications and the house is really cute."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy check in/out and relaxed setting. Great spot!
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The rental decor and updated appliances were great! The washer / dryer were a nice touch and the kids enjoyed the hot tub outside. The host was very responsive as well.
Compared to other rentals I've stayed in, this property was missing some conveniences.
Check in time was advertised to be 3pm. We arrived at 4pm after a long drive and were told it would be another hour before we could check in because housecleaning was running behind. This would've been acceptable had it been thoroughly cleaned upon the delay. The living room and kitchen floors and counters were still dirty when we checked in.
The water at the rental was discolored brown and smelled, so we had to use bottled water the entire stay. It looked like the host may at times provide Culligan water for guests to use since they had a water dispenser and empty jugs, but they were all empty for our stay.
The kitchen needs dish towels, paper towels and a few more things like a strainer, cutting board and cooking sheets."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We had a good stay and our host was very responsive to any issues we had. I think for the area this Airbnb was really nice. The tap water had a funny smell, but from what I hear that is normal for the area.
I would book through this host again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very private and nice for just having a good time! Love the hot tub and fire pit!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We stayed while hiking the area. The hot tub was perfect for relaxing our tired muscles. The place was bigger than I expected and super cute. The host was responsive and welcomed us when we arrived. Will definitely visit again
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a quiet, small-town getaway, this is the place for you! The home was a comfortable size for 4 (we had 3 but could easily have included another) and was spotlessly clean. There are TVs in the living room (large!) and both bedrooms, a well-appointed coffee bar, and a hot tub out back under a sky full of stars. Decor and furnishings are simple/no frill but were just what we were looking for. Wifi worked perfectly. The host checked in with us upon arrival and was very helpful with recommendations for local restaurants and attractions. Very nice Airbnb experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Solid place, really nice furniture and kitchen has everything you need. Host was excellent and so was the hot tub. Overall a pretty good experience"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay at this space. Very pet friendly and relaxing. We booked cabin 2 and our friends stayed in cabin 3. The cabins were within walking distance yet had plenty of privacy between the two. There were perfectly laid out instructions for the hot tub, heater, shower ect. It was a little difficult to find based on the address provided as it looks like you hit a dead end however, our hosts were extremely responsive and reached out immediately when we contacted them for help with directions. Ashley seemed very friendly and their restaurant, coffee house recommendations were fantastic. I wouldn't hesitate to book again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I drove from Minnesota for a 5 day trip here and it was so worth it! The hot tub was the definitely the highlight. It’s in a neighborhood but you’re surrounded by tree’s so it’s still pretty secluded/private. The host responded immediately anytime I had a question. The space was very clean, and checking in was as easy as it can get. Most of our time was spent exploring the different trails next to the cabin, and we still have more to explore next year."
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Nice place just to get away & relax… Hosts was awesome and understandable definitely stop back here…
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, quiet and cozy spot with good scenery and a great host!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin was so cute and a nice get away for peace. The only suggestions is more mugs for hot chocolate and an indoor rug. It gets quite muddy. Definitely dog friendly great area for hiking and just getting outside.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,the stay was great!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,An amazing spot. Had everything I needed! My favorite was watching the crows dance in the trees from the hot tub. Extremely clean toilet and shower. The host is great. They let me check in early and even followed up to see if i needed anything. Highly recommend.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great host who kept this place in pristine condition. He was very responsive to my messages, while still giving me recommendations on areas near me. Has a great price on the location, and I would totally stay again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was better than expected! Perfect space for a couple looking to escape the St. Louis and relax. I was a little worried about the bathroom situation, but it was very clean and had no issues. The hot tub was a huge plus and amazing at night under the full moon! There's a small town nearby with amazing gooey butter ice cream that Tycoon reccomened in his guidebook. The cabin is close to Johnson Shut Ins and Elephant Rocks. I wish we had more time to check out the trail on the property and the river access nearby. Will definitely keep the cabin in mind for future getaways!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was truly an outdoor getaway, with the perks of having the inside comfort feeling. The hot tub was definitely an extra perk. Also, tons of trails to explore. The host was extra helpful and quick to answer any questions. would definitely come back! Plus, the internet/TV was super fast."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This spot was perfect for a weekend getaway. Although there were houses near by this spot felt secluded and private. As a single woman traveling alone I felt comfortable and safe the entire time. My dogs loved it too, there were trails right from the cabin we wandered through. Be prepared for tics, especially if bringing pets. The hot tub was for sure the highlight of the stay!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed staying here for the night. Bed is super comfortable. Property is as pictured.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've stayed in 5 bnbs in 3 months, with 2 little dogs, one of whom is disabled and uses wheels. This was their favorite place, and mine too. They were able to just be dogs and run free. That makes me happy, because really I'm just their concierge. It's nice to have a place like this. That being, they could use a mirror on a wall. A dish drying rack and some kitchen towels. And the WiFi was confusing, and if you say you have it, it needs to be accessible. I would stay here again and probably will.
Thanks ""Tycoon"""
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A wonderful place I love the environment

2023-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nice place for the cost. Clean on the inside of the cabin. Hot tub was well maintained. There are a few things you might want to bring yourself though, there were no sharp knives for cooking with the grill, no mugs for the coffee maker, no detergent for the washer/dryer, no trash bags, limited paper towels. The port-o-potty was filled above the water line when I arrived but cleaned out during the week, so be prepared for that possibility."

I've never seen a water cooler dispense water so slow. Damp towels left in the clothes washer. No hand or dish soap either. Maybe stick to the hotels in the area instead. Maybe it was the off season, who knows."

Katie responded quickly with questions I had. Not to mention the cottage is adorable and very clean. I wish we would have had more time to enjoy the patio. The yard was well manicured.

Yes, there are changes but all well thought out and done. My parents would be pleased also! While neighbors change the small town feeling is still there. Several relatives and friends stopped by to see the house and were impressed with the changes, cleanliness, and landscaping that has been done. The deck and patio are spectacular!"

We liked it because the home was really cool and spacious for adults but our two-year old ""wild child"" was a good boy because the hosts don't leave anything breakable low in the common areas. We really appreciated that.
Awesome, nice hosts. This is the epitome of a solid, interesting, small town, perfect Airbnb experince."

The location is within walking distance of the downtown historic district. The neighborhoods in the area are full of beautiful restored older homes. Katie is truly deserving of the title Superhost! She was very friendly, informative, and responsive to us. In addition to being a wonderful host, Katie also went above and beyond the call of duty in helping us to retrieve an item that we had left behind when we checked out.

2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Better than the pictures! Great location!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Dewey cottage felt like home away from home. It was even decorated with fall decor in and out. We enjoyed the firepit in the backyard. Katie responded fast to our questions. We would definitely stay there again.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I loved my stay here! The house was very nicely furnished, very comfortable. It was clean as could be, and the neighborhood was quiet and pretty. I loved staying here and will try to do so every time I visit Farmington!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay. Katie was quick to respond and everything was very comfortable!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were in Farmington just for one evening with our two little ones for a wedding. Katie's place couldn't have been more perfect. Cozy, filled with character, and incredibly clean. There was plenty of space for our family, and you can tell the house has been maintained with care and attention to detail. The neighborhood is quiet and right in the middle of the historic district. Katie was incredibly responsive and helpful! We would recommend Katie's place without hesitation to anyone needing a place to stay in the Farmington area!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was great
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"620 Dewey Avenue is in the heart of a historic neighborhood in Farmington, MO. This home is super clean, comfortable and charming. And, I can’t say enough good things about the host! This is definitely a 5* AirBnB!!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was very clean and comfortable stay for my family. I loved the minimal design of the home. We were very glad we were able to stay there while in Farmington.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location close to downtown Farmington. All the comforts of home in a cute clean cottage. Cute street and walkable neighborhood. Highly recommend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We really enjoyed our stay with “ the White House” Julie was very helpful and answered every question and concern quickly and efficiently! And she even left a little gift for our fur babies!!
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute house that provides all of the essentials for your stay but lacks some modern technology conveniences. Nice & quiet neighborhood. It felt like I was in my grandmother's house way back in the day, so in that sense, it felt like home. And for those of you who may be wondering if the house is haunted, it is not. It had a very relaxed and comfortable vibe. A million times better than a Motel 6, no question!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this home. Well preserved late 1800s to early 1900s home. Tastefully decorated to transport you back in time with modern amenities. Close to downtown with lots of local shops and eateries. Will definitely be staying again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Doris was a great host and very flexible. I will definitely stay at her place again when visiting Farmington,MO"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was one of the cleanest, most updated Airbnbs I’ve stayed at! The house is bigger than it looks and was so cozy and clean. We did lose power for a couple of hours due to Farmington electric so keep that in mind, but that’s to no fault of the host and other than that we had a perfect stay and would love to stay here again. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen fully stocked, and we had plenty of room to spread out and relax. The host is also extremely friendly and responsive. We loved it!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,very happy with our stay. it was a beautiful home and a great location. we plan on staying there again in the future.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My elderly parents and I were very happy with the hideaway! Doris was by far the best host I have ever met. She truly cares and goes beyond expectations to make sure her guests are taken care of, cannot recommend a better place to stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great quiet stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We felt very comfortable and at home. We were in town visiting our son and his family, so did not really use the kitchen much. But from what we did need and use it seemed well stocked with essential kitchenware. The house was pristine. The one time we contacted Doris she was very responsive. We really had no issues. Nice quiet neighborhood. The window coverings are sheer in the common areas. Blackout drapes in the bedroom we used. We would definitely stay there again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The guys had a great time and enjoyed the home!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice experience. Doris sent photos of some signage she set out for us to find exactly where to go when we arrived, which was monumentally helpful! She was very kind."
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This place was too small for 4 adults to be comfortable in the living room. It was very clean and nicely decorated.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, clean home! We enjoyed our stay. I really appreciated the extra touches with nice linens and soap, shampoo, etc. Overall, highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for us! Family of four with kids under three. Private spot. Easy walk (ten minutes) to downtown to our favorite pizza place. Secluded spot. Small driveway if you have a huge vehicle but super easy for us with a medium-sized SUV. This place was so clean and new-feeling. It's behind the big houses and we expected a coach house vibe, but it's better. They've made the cutest little home. Farmington is our halfway town on a long drive we take a couple times a year, so it's for strategic purposes that we visit; but, we've really come to love this little town! Doris was an awesomely responsive host. Cheers to her. My last little comment is that it made us so happy that there weren't a million LOW decorations or knick-knacks because there was nothing for our two and a half year old to break! Ha. Thanks for a lovely stay."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Hideaway #1 was clean and quiet. Slept great! Thank you so much!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,We always love staying here!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It's a cute little house and the host was really great. The description is a little misleading if you're looking for something private. It's crammed in the back of another property, with another rental unit 20 feet away. The driveway is super tight, winding around a fence and trees to get to it. No real complaints, just need to be okay with what you're getting."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Doris and Rikki were great. So kind and the place is quiet and so clean. It’s my second time staying there and I will stay there again. Best host award goes to this place
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I grew up in Farmington so knew this place would be a good location. What I didn't realize is that it was very private behind the larger homes, perfect size for our family of four and had everything we needed for a great stay. Fluffy blankets and towels, good heat and great shower (soap, shampoo, conditioner provided), comfortable beds, great washer and dryer. Factory is two minute walk and downtown is 5-10 minute walk to everything, including famous Plummer's hardware store and of course Hunts. Was great to stay here instead of one of the hotels out near the highway or the busy mess of box store/boring chain restaurants (in our opinion). Thanks Doris!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay while visiting family for the holidays. The home was very clean and comfortable.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,nice and quite place!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay—walking distance to good food, clean, and very cozy! We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,excellent experience
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thanks again! Thank you for being so flexible!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Thankful for her responsiveness and flexibility on check-in. A clean space with the basics!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, comfortably furnished little house nestled in a quiet neighborhood. Close to everything! This space was exactly what we needed to be able to explore the Farmington area and then have a nice place to relax and unwind in when we needed a break from activity.
One caveat: I discovered upon going to bed the first night that the sheets had been washed in a highly scented laundry detergent. I'm sensitive to scents and spent the first night struggling to find a way to sleep and still be able to breathe easily. I double washed the sheets and blankets the next day which mostly, but not totally, resolved the issue. If you're sensitive like me, just know it might take some work to make this space work for you. If you're highly sensitive this might not be the place for you as you won't be able to totally remove the scent. Otherwise, it's a great place!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very responsive to messages! Very friendly! Very cute accommodations!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay. Such a nice little spot. Would come back!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here. It fit our needs Last time we were much further out than we wanted to so this was a nice option in Farmington. If you are looking for a good deal and extra space this is a much better option than the hotels in Farmington, especially for a family. It was nice to be ale to do laundry and have family over especially with two little ones."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was sparkling, tidy, and very comfortable. The location is perfect for restaurants and bars.
Doris, she was very friendly in the messages we exchanged. We loved it!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to stay! We were within walking distance to several restaurants downtown and the home was pristine. Doris was also very quick to respond when I had questions about the area. Would definitely stay in Doris’ place again if we come back to the area.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location in Farmington. Walking distance to great downtown area with restaurants and shops! Will definitely return!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very neat and clean. Very comfortable and convenient for our needs. Appreciated the location and parking off the main road. Very happy with the whole experience.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Doris's Hideaway #1 was exactly as represented. A great location as a home base for visiting the many MO State Parks and Historic Sites in the Farmington area.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Overall decent stay. With small children, the flooring made it a bit difficult for the kids to crawl and walk. The home was overall clean. The area was quiet and quaint. Decent value for the price and is close to anything you would need. Larger vehicles may have some trouble parking due to the closeness of trees and fencing, but it provides a very nice feel as well."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful home that was very clean and comfortable.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay...Had everything we needed, would stay again if we were in the area. 8-10 min walk to downtown area. Good breakfast restaurant right around the corner (The Factory Diner)"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Doris was an amazing host. Very responsive and quick.
Her house was stunning!! So clean! So nice! She made her home a home she would live in. A few highlights. The kitchen cupboards are new, nice and clean and high quality. The shampoo and conditioner were Pantene. A classy brand. The toilet paper was as nice as at home super soft. The towels were nice and fluffy. Soft nice couches. I wanted a getaway to relax and rest and it was amazing!!! Highly recommend."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was clean and well-maintained. The neighborhood is good, and the house is close to shopping, dining, etc."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Farmington. I will definitely be staying here again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. Never been to one more clean. So comfortable. Cool temperature. It’s decorated beautifully. The washer and dryer was so helpful. Overall one of the best. You won’t be disappointed
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great!! Very clean and our host provided all the info we needed for an easy check in
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Doris was a wonderful host. We ended up having to extend our stay and thankfully she was able to accommodate us. This was home for 2 weeks, and it started to feel like it turned into our actual home. Would absolutely come back again, hopefully next time we get to enjoy the surroundings. Thanks Doris!!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back. Walking to town is just a couple blocks away. Nice boutiques and fantastic food. Great place to stay if you like to hike, so many choices with 4-State Parks in close proximity. The beds were comfy, the WiFi is fast, and the place is sparkling clean. We highly recommend."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay while in town. Very nice updates. A little tricky to find because it sits behind a larger house but owner communicated quickly. Would stay here again!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Lovely Mother's Day overnight with tired moms. We had a wonderful and relaxing time. Loved the bedrooms, main living space and hot tub. Would definitely come again!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a stunning placd to relax and get away for a few days. We spent alot of time at the house and everything was clean and comfortable. Beautiful outdoor space too.
2024-05-01,5,Group trip,The deck was beautiful. The views were spectacular. There were Eagles there for the first 4 days. The sunsets and sunrise were beautiful. Very relaxing.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Linda’s place was clean, cozy and very well appointed. The covered deck overlooks a beautiful, scenic view and is a wonderful place to relax. The beds were so comfortable! We would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The Queen Bee was the perfect getaway for our girls night. My husband came to get the campfire started for us and then left us be for the night :) The hot tub was a perk!
I never sleep well when I’m not at home but that was nit the case here. The beds were very comfortable. There were also plenty of blankets and pillows.
If you are looking for a relaxing getaway away from the hustle and bustle this is the place for you. It’s out of town and the house is surrounded by a cattle farm. We would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. The house was beautiful and clean. The hot tub was amazing. I plan to stay here again.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Linda is a great host. She is very friendly and responsive. She even helped come jump our car! Lovely location and close to several nice hikes. The kids loved the place too.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a group of 5 people riding at St. Joe State Park. Plenty of room for all of us. Very private setting where we didn’t have to lock up any of our ATV’s/UTV’s. Fire pit was fantastic. Spent a few hours by it. Wood was provided. Thank You for that. House was spotless. Linda was very responsive when and if I had a question. Overall a great spot very close to St. Joe State Park. Would definitely stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Queen Bee is the PERFECT girls weekend spot! From the lovely decor to the comfy beds and furniture to the peaceful quiet surrounding it was a great getaway for a few moms who just needed some time away! Highly recommended 5-stars!!!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderfully styled , accommodating space ! Beautiful decor and well yes out . Loved the deck and hot tub ."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed staying at Linda's place very much. It was just what we needed. Lots of space and very clean. We would stay there again. Our only complaint is that there is way too much chlorine in the hot tub.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was nicely decorated and very clean. It had big cushy sofas and comfortable beds. The deck was amazing! Loved the hot tub at night! The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pots and pans. Highly recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"My family and I stayed at Linda's place while our house was being worked on. Linda was a great host. The house was nice, the area was nice and my daughter loved seeing the cows in the field. It was quiet and peaceful during our stay. We would recommend this place to anyone who would like to not be downtown but close enough to everything to enjoy it all. Thank you Linda fo letting us stay!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best Airbnb’s we have stayed at. Well stocked with everything you need to make your stay complete. The accommodation is top notch, super clean and in a fantastic location. We loved our stay and will be back to Linda’s accommodation again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing stay! Will definitely be returning in the future!!
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Linda’s place was so cute. It was extremely clean. The kitchen was fully stocked and had everything we needed to cook. We loved the large deck outside with the hot tub. It was also so fun to see the cows in the pasture next door. The beds were very comfortable. The living room was great for watching movies. It was so great being so close to Farmington which is a charming little town. We will definitely be staying at this place again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house and property is amazing! This was the perfect place for me and my adult children and their kids for the 3 nights we were in Missouri for my great nieces wedding! If we are ever in the area again we hope the Queen bee will be available!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,This is a great place to stay at!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful location. A beautiful view of local fields and trees. Cows and horses nearby. Great hidden spot in Farmington within minutes of getting back into town. This would be a perfect location for 4 or more adults and a few children. Keep in mind the bathroom situation here is 2 toilets, 1 stand up shower, and 1 bath tub without a shower head. There is nothing wrong with them. It's likely my misunderstanding of the listing, but with 4 adults staying and thinking there was two showers available to realize one of them is only a bathtub made for a more awkward showering situation. This isn't a detriment, just a clarification of how the amenities are listed that wasn't clear to us while making plans. There is a great hot tub and trampoline along with a firepit. Loads of space to spread out and just relax
Linda was an amazing hostess, and was very responsive to our questions and minor issues that arose during our stay. Home was clean and felt very welcoming."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Super clean and well laid out! Would definitely recommend.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect stay for me and my mom.
Way more personal and hospitable than a hotel.
This is a tiny cozy house with a pickleball court within 40 yards away (other side of a fence)
The key though is.. if you hate pickle ball, this place is not for you!!!!!!!!!
No jokes we got there at 5 PM on a Wednesday and people were playing pickle ball. They were still playing when we went to sleep at 11 PM. I woke up at 8am a people were already there playing pickleball!
When we got back for the day at 9 PM Thursday, pickle ball! It must have been a tournament because 4 games were going on. They were still playing when I went to sleep.
So if you LOVE pickle ball, this place might be the hidden gem of your existence!
But beware of you have a problem with pickle ball.
Don't care? Want a quaint small cozy place that makes you feel at home because you were raised right here in Farmington. SCORE!
I def would stay here again. And maybe next time I""ll play pickleball!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The setting is beautiful, the home is lovely and the hosts are wonderful! We enjoyed our stay so much. The home is fully stocked with everything you need to cook and is very welcoming. So many little extra touches that are so thoughtful. Beautiful outdoor spaces and a lovely park steps away. We couldn’t be more satisfied with everything!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at the Carriage House! It was the perfect location for us to explore St. Louis for a day while also taking a day to visit Elephant Rocks. Our stay was very cozy and still felt private even with the main residence being close by. Lena was always quick to respond to any questions and the check in/out processes were incredibly simple. We would definitely reccomend the Carriage House to others!

Lena, our host was extremely quick to respond and offer recommendations. We had a lovely time staying at her place."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We truly loved our stay and loved finding such a gem not too far outside of StL! Felt right at home and wish we had more time to enjoy all of the home's amenities. Would absolutely stay again if coming to the area!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Highly recommend a stay at the carriage house. Beautifully remodeled with modern flair but cozy charm. This is for sure a hidden gem and definitely saved as a favorite to use again when we have more time to stay. Make sure to hit The Factory Diner for brunch.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, very private, hosts were very accommodating as we drove down to see the solar eclipse which was happening before our check in time, and they took the care to have the room prepared a little earlier if we wanted to get there in time to catch the eclipse.

We will come back again to Lena’s. Lena went above and beyond for us as she did with setting up her place for guest. We are from Louisiana and almost never experience ice and snow, we experienced it here in MO
Lena went out in the frigid temps on multiple occasions to salt a walkway and a path to our vehicle for us. We are so grateful we were able to book The Carriage House. It was the most pleasant stay"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lena’s Carriage House was beautiful. We had a great 3 night stay with 3 adults. We all slept well. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were clean and stocked with supplies. The kitchen was stocked with pots and pans and baking sheets, storage containers, plastic wrap, foil…even Pam and spices. We are 2 caterers and a chef. We cooked turkey, cinnamon rolls, pumpkin bread, ham, two casseroles, a charcuterie tray, and a dessert tray to take to our family Thanksgiving in Ironton. We had enough space in the kitchen for all of us to cook at the same time. We had enough refrigerator space for everything.
The house was close to a great place to get pizza.
And to top it off, Lena had a pumpkin pie waiting for us when we arrived.
We had a delightful stay."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,A wonderful place to stay if you have kids. The swimming pool is right next door. You can look off the porch to it. And not a bad drive to St. Louis if you wanna spend the day there
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very friendly and nice hosts! Willing to help out or answer any questions. Very beautiful quiet place to rejuvenate!!!

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very friendly and helpful hosts, close to where we needed to be and comfortable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We couldn’t find a handicap facility but Wendy and her husband went beyond to make sure we could enjoy our stay. Measured doors for us before booking and provide a shower seat. Her husband put a ramp so we could enjoy the outdoor patio and fire pit. The picture doesn’t do it justice. Its a small quiet cabin feel.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wendy’s place had everything we needed PLUS for a fun, relaxing weekend. The location was easy to find, checking in was so simple, and the hosts are very kind. I was simply amazed at their generosity and kindness during our stay. They are Christians who get the true meaning of spreading the love of Jesus. That’s rare to find these days. I can’t say enough good things, but if you book with them you are in for a wonderful experience! The fire pit, hot tub, and scenery is breathtaking. They even provided marshmallows to roast!!! It was like camping but with all the great comforts of home. Highly recommend!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and nice place
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nice little cabin, as described. Wendy is fast to respond. Would stay there again."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wendy was a great host! She is very kind and communicates thoroughly. Her little place was a little slice of heaven. Nestled in the hills and yet close to everything. A great place to stay as you explore this beautiful area. The hot tub and patio are her amazing. Wendy even left us marshmallows to roast, snacks and bottled water."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thank you, forever and ever...we will definitely drop some flowers off in the near future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely the nicest Airbnb cabin in the area. Worth the price! It's beautiful, private, up to date, has all the amenities, clean, cozy, etc...
But keep in mind, it is literally a cabin in the woods. There will be bugs and an occasional critter outside. If that's not for you, stay in town. We loved sitting on the back deck listening to the cicadas. We saw wildlife in the woods, birds, gekos, and even a turtle moseyed through the lawn. Peaceful, amazing getaway, the host is very responsive, and we can't wait to come back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a great stay! Would definitely go here again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at the cabin! The property is extremely peaceful and is close distance to several outdoor activities. Everything was very well kept and cleaned before we arrived for our stay.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,We got married and wanted somewhere close to go! It was very peaceful and serene.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"It was a great stay, peaceful and quiet. Best air bnb in the area by far."
2024-01-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Would absolutely stay here again. Amazing space to get a breath of fresh air, hike around. We didn’t go anywhere, just hung around the property. Hiked, played outside, cooked as a family, movie nights. Epic star gazing once the clouds went away. Plan on coming back for sure!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was great! We went for my birthday for some peace and quiet and thats just what we did. We relaxed the massage chair was wonderful, jacuzzi was nice! Beds were super comfotable and the bath and shower were awesome 5

2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Our family hosted an amazing thanksgiving dinner here, and the amazing kitchen and upgraded appliances made it a BREEZE!! Loaded with utensils a huge table for our whole family to gather around. The most coziest home away from home! Our children enjoyed walking through the woods, enjoyed the hot tub every single night. It was an amazing way to end the day!! The rainfall shower, and free standing tub were a favorite of our daughters!! Anytime we come back to Missouri we will gladly pick this house every time!! 12/10 😁"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Second time staying here - this place is the BEST. Super private and hidden away. Super to spend time in the woods, but so close to town and things to do. We come to the area for our dog competitions and we will always check this place first. Cool house, great setup. We had a weird issue pop up randomly and Tonya was insanely responsive resolving it in about ninety seconds flat."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Tonya’s place was perfect for a quick getaway for my husband, myself and our fur babies. The fall leaves were gorgeous and my favorite was sitting on the front porch with my morning coffee watching the deer pass by. The pictures really don’t do it justice. Thanks again for your hospitality."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great location beautiful scenery very private!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at this cabin. It was isolated enough to feel private; and a reasonable drive away to a LOT to do, whether it's visiting St. Joe State Park or Elephant Rocks State Park for family-friendly hikes and outdoor time or heading to Farmington for the restaurants. The property is HUGE! It's worth exploring along with the nearby wooded area with little ones. The hot tub & massage chair were big pluses for us. Beautiful scenery in every direction!! The ground-floor bedroom could use some more lights, but that was really our only gripe. Strong WiFi, strong safety features & a responsive maintenance person made up for it. Parking in the garage was unexpectedly handy. It was a nice stay & we would absolutely come back here!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a lovely place and a wonderful getaway! hot tub and massage chair were especially relaxing.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"this place was perfect for a short lil get away
the hot tub was wonderful and we loved the area
very friendly people and nice places to see around"
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Great place for the price was very peaceful being out there.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This space was perfect for our family of 4 plus one dog. We utilized every part of this home and feel rejuvenated and relaxed. The kitchen was updated with nice appliances which made cooking a breeze. We have two preteen girls who appreciated having their own bathroom and upstairs loft, they also enjoyed having good WiFi and I loved that their was a game room when I kicked them off their phones. We all used the massage chair and hot tub. I loved the shower and my daughters loved the soaker tub. The sheets and towels were soft and nice and the beds were comfy. We appreciated the on site laundry and the host was very responsive and helpful. What we rented as lodging for a family reunion ended up being more like a retreat. Thanks!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Eric the property manager was very helpful with a few minor issues that came up and came by to address them in person. The property was very relaxing and secluded, everyone had a great stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was great! The only things that bothered me were the cameras that I weren’t sure if they were on or off,
And there was a horse fly infestation in the upstairs bathroom. We just opted to not use that bathroom.
I could see someone struggling to find the house if arriving after dark but we didn’t have an issue.
Otherwise would stay again!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The good: Quiet, cozy cabin on a gravel road in the woods. The instructions were easy to follow. The property was maintained well. Very nice shower. Entertainment room was fun. The massage chair was a nice addition. The kitchen was large and stocked with most all the essentials.
The not good: As other comments mentioned, there is a rodent problem and it is still active. There were limited cleaning supplies including no disinfectant wipes/spray to deal with the rodent evidence left on the counters each night. The pots and pans were dirty upon arrival. The water heater breaker tripped (found the breaker box and solved this ourselves). Shower has poor water pressure. Air hockey table is extremely worn."
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,This property is stunning. We really enjoyed our stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was beautiful and perfect for our family. Absolutely remote while still being close enough to town for anything needed! Tonya was extremely helpful, flexible and responded quickly to messages. The cabin was well stocked and had plenty to do. The beach was a quick drive into the state park for a nice afternoon trip. We really hope to visit again in the fall!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Wind Ridge Cabin. The location was great, and the cabin was in a quiet private setting tucked back in the woods. The cabin was beautifully decorated. The kid's enjoyed the game room, the massage chair and hot tub were so relaxing. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was fully equipped. We would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful place. Peaceful, quiet cabin setting nestled in nature. Great for families with fun and relaxation in mind. Definitely would recommend if you’re looking for a quiet get away with modern amenities. 👍👍 clean and enjoyable."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tonya was great to work with and the cabin was wonderful! Beautiful surroundings, secluded, and close to everything we wanted to do (state park recreational riding)! Will absolutely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,3,Group trip,"This airbnb listing is such a cute space. The decor is cute, bathrooms were nice, and the home is in a beautiful spot, totally surrounded by nature. We were on a girls trip and having a great time, until we had some issues with a mouse that came on the kitchen counter and was eating our bagged food right in front of us. We then realized that our spare roll of toilet paper in the upper bathroom had holes in it from mice or some other critter eating it. We had several people in our group that dislike mice and felt very uncomfortable the rest of the trip. We contacted the property managers and they were very responsive and willing to come out to set traps, but we just decided to wait until the morning to check out early. Overall it was a good experience, but just wanted to warn others that the location is pretty remote, so mice are more likely to be a problem."
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay here overall! We had one hiccup where the security system code provided did not work and the alarm was set off once or twice, however the property managers were extremely responsive and offered to come right out to fix it! I think our only issue with the place was the amount of security cameras/equipment. It felt like everything we were doing was being watched so that took away a little bit from the experience. Otherwise the place was pristine clean and the property managers were extremely pleasers to work with!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!!!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was fantastic just as described. Peaceful and serene Exactly what we were looking for private yet close enough to hiking and shopping. We also recommended the Columbia Street Mercantile in Farmington. Their ice cream is homemade and superb. Best we have ever had. All in all a fantastic place in a beautiful location
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was wonderful! It was clean and spacious. The location was peaceful and secluded. It had everything you needed for our stay.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, quiet place. Very kind hosts! Tonya reached out to warn us about an incoming storm and gave us contact information if we needed help"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,fantastic host! easy to find and private. this is the perfect place for a quiet get away. beautiful house and views close to many things but far enough for peace and quiet!! 10/10 highly recommend
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin was perfect for a little getaway. I love that it is secluded and private, which made it very peaceful. It was great to be able to walk around in nature and relax in the hot tub and enjoy swinging on the porch swings. When looking for a place to rent, we were disappointed that this rental did not have a fire pit, as the kids were excited about making s'mores. But Tonya was awesome about getting a fire pit on site before our arrival and even included roasting skewers and firewood with fire starters!! It was the perfect addition to enjoy the trip. The massage chair, fire place, and game room were also nice."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely beautiful. 2nd floor deck that runs the length of the house, another smaller deck halfway between ground level and second level, covered patio the length of the house with a porch swing looking out into the woods.
It is so quiet. I did not hear or see another human the whole weekend.
I will stay here again and again."
