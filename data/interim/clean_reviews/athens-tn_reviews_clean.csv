2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great quiet place to stay! Belinda is awesome. Great opportunity to see some farm animals too if you desire. I can't recommend this place enough.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Belinda's cabin was a wonderful stay. The cabin made me feel right at home with all the farm animals. It's at the end of a private road and it was very easy to find. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby the entire stay. Highly recommended and I will absolutely stay here again in the future while visiting friends near by.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was a fantastic place. It was cozy and peaceful. Belinda was a great host and had all the right answers.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Belinda was a great host her property was amazing. Was peaceful my grandson loved the animals especially Dolly and Parton the guard dogs. Would recommend this cabin to anyone looking just to relax in the peace and quiet and it not to far from stores and resturants .
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very relaxing & away from town!
Cute little cabin & very clean with everything that we needed,"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Good stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Belinda was wonderful as a lady who knows her animals well. We were able to walk with our toddler in the pastures & feed the animals by hand! It was fun for all 3generations of us. The cabin was cozy & peaceful. We Loved the porch swing! The cable TV was spot on for my coach SIL to catch pre-draft programs. A short trip was made to Sweetwater to ‘Cup Runneth Over’ for fancy coffee. Belinda made several suggestions for other local places to tour & enjoy. Those will be for next time! We left feeling refreshed & fortunate to have found her place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our third or fourth stay at Belinda's cabin and, as always, we were thoroughly delighted. This feels like our home away from home when we are in the area - only better, because it is on a working farm! We love waking up and seeing the sheep roaming in the not-too-far pasture, hearing the cows while we are having our coffee, and just the general pure, clean environment and wonderful, peaceful atmosphere. It is always a bonus when we run into Belinda. She is a wonderful host and person! We can't recommend Belinda's place enough! :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Belinda was an amazing host. I was only looking for a place to sleep while visiting my daughter. The cabin was a perfect place for relaxing after a day of watching her play golf. The farm tour was so special for my daughter. Belinda took the time to tell her all about the animals and farm. Thanks for you and your families sacrifices Marine. God Bless and I will be back.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My family and I had a wonderful experience. If you are looking for a serene and cozy atmosphere this is the perfect setting. Private enough to feel relaxed, but close enough to town for all your amenities. Highly recommend!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was clean and peaceful surroundings. Enjoyed my stay. Belinda was responsive and friendly. Would definitely recommend and will book again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Belinda was an amazing host! The cabin is beautiful and you have the best view of the sheep out back! She gave us a tour of the farm and let us feed the animals which was so delightful. There are also two farm dogs named Dolly and Parton who gave us the friendliest welcome ! Definitely hope to go back soon.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin with everything you need. Belinda makes sure your stay feels like home. The animals on the farm are just an extra perk for an entertaining stay. Would love to come stay again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a great time, wonderful place and great host. Will definitely go back."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second stay at Belinda's cabin and our experience was even better than the first time we stayed, and that is saying a lot. Everything was just perfect. The cabin was as beautiful and as comfortable as we remembered it. Just a perfect location in every way. We did the farm visit again with our grandchildren and had the pleasure of seeing 2-day old lambs (soooo cute!!) and a baby alpaca - oh my gosh - no words for this cuteness! Belinda is such a kind, gracious host and we are so grateful that she was able to show us around the farm and took the time to talk with us and let us help feed the alpacas and the donkeys. We have decided that this will be our home away from home whenever we are visiting the area. It is just really wonderful and I can't recommend it enough."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a getaway for Valentine's and this cabin worked great. We have never stayed on a working farm and loved hearing the animals and our greeting by Dolly and Parton! Belinda is a great communicator as well. We enjoyed outlr trip!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a lovely “staycation” here at the cabin on Double T Farm! The cabin was very clean, private and quiet, extremely cozy and had everything we needed to have a wonderful stay! The farm is beautiful and the animals are friendly and well taken care of! Belinda is a superb host! She made sure we had everything we needed for a great stay. We loved taking a farm tour and learning more about her animals and the history of the farm. It is out in the country but still conveniently located to stores, gas etc. We highly recommend a stay here, and we are looking forward to staying again soon!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time. The cabin is comfortable and the farm tour was special!
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great country get away located not far from town. We woke up every morning to the sound of sheep playing in the field that you can see right out your backyard. Belinda was a great host and we had a nice farm tour upon request and hand fed some of the animals. She even made sure we got to bottle feed the baby sheep several times. If your looking for a quite place to escape this is a great choice. Definitely visit the Sweetwater Valley Farm for a tour and some cheese too!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Third time staying at this beautiful country cabin! A perfect place to unwind. Belinda is very generous with sharing her scenery and showing you around the farm. Unique and worth the effort to stay!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. As soon as we got out of the truck we were greeted with the familiar and loved sounds and smell of a farm. My wife had the biggest smile on. The fire pit got plenty of use. Our first night one of the boys stopped to check on us at the fire pit. Very polite and helpful. We also made great friends with the farms dogs. I hope if we get a chance to stay again we have time to set up a farm tour. Everything was as described.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Belinda and her cabin are great. A nice getaway for us. We would have stayed an extra day if we could! We’ll be back.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place to relax. Belinda is very kind and patient. She obviously loves the farm and is very knowledgeable. The farm tour was great.
The animals are fun, especially the ginormous guard dogs, the cabin is cozy, and the farm eggs are delicious.
My only complaint is we didn’t stay long enough. I plan to rectify that in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a nice cabin
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Belinda’s place was cozy , clean and very comfortable or only regret is that we couldn’t spend more time with the animals, we especially loved the cozy alpaca socks we were able to purchase from the farm, we will definitely be back.
Angel and Marc"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful spot. Full of peaceful farm sounds and beautiful views. A lovely cabin with all you need. I did not want to leave! mountain paradise. I will definitely be back. Based on the guest book the owners are super friendly and available if you need them. I'm very reserved so I was thrilled about the privacy they give me but I know if I wanted to socialize they'd be open to that as well. Cute animals all over! dogs were so sweet.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"would come back and be there again

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We absolutely enjoyed staying at Belinda’s cabin. The farm was so cute. We were able to feed the alpacas and donkeys. There was a 2 week old alpaca that was just the cutest thing I’ve seen. Everything was as described and perfect. I definitely recommend staying here and would stay again if we make it back up there again.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Belinda’s Airbnb was one of the best places we have ever stayed! It was close to lots of hiking and beautiful scenery, very quiet and private, and the cabin was so peaceful and clean. Belinda also gave us a farm tour which was so interesting and fun! We would highly recommend this Airbnb."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Belinda’s cabin and her farm were amazing! The cabin was perfect for my husband and me- clean, charming, and wonderfully appointed. Beds were comfortable, surroundings were quiet and peaceful, and the neighbors (sweet donkeys, super friendly dogs, sheep, alpacas and all the rest) were a wonderful and welcome surprise. Eventhough we knew it was a working farm from the description, the warmth and friendliness of the animals was an unexpected bonus. Thank you, Belinda, for thinking of everything guests might need! We also had our kids and grandchildren come visit for a tour of the farm and it was perfect in every way! Rod and Kris were so nice and did a great job on the tour. Everyone really loved it -a lasting memory for sure. We definitely plan to return and would highly recommend staying at the cabin on Double T Farm."

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,beautiful cabin on a farm. quiet and comfortable. the dogs are the sweetest and Belinda was very helpful. definitely worth it!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place! Nice and clean, pretty decoration of the lodge is very welcoming. We had a farm tour, we got to see all the animals and baby goats! The host is super nice and helpful. We were greeted by 2 great pyrensees. Don't be intimidated by their size, they are very nice and gentle, my kids loved them!
There is no real stove top except the electric one on top of oven toaster, but they have a grill outside and a fire pit. If you are traveling in winter or when it's too cold to cook outside, prepare to make some easy meal, not something fancy."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is our second stay at Belinda’s beautiful farm. The view of sheep and alpacas was such a delight. Belinda makes sure that you have everything you need. Very peaceful and comfortable! We will be back!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was exciting and so much fun! We enjoyed the nice cozy house with all the christmas decorations! It had a great kitchen with everything you need. The stove is very slow because it is electric, but we still cooked a lot! We met the hosts' grandson and we fed the alpacas, they are so adorable! It was a beautiful relaxing spot and I would visit again. The animals are so friendly especially the dogs! We took a nice hike in the area. Everything was absolutely wonderful!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cabin was immaculate and decorated so cute! Property well maintained. Very quaint and peaceful setting. Added bonus if interacting with the animals made this place one of our favorites!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's remote. It's beautiful. It's an amazing place to stay. Super convenient to Sweetwater. If you want a true Tennessee County Experience - here's your opportunity. I would encourage you to take it.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing property and host. This was our first AirBNB experience and Belinda set the bar high. Very clean. Very relaxing. Close to lots of outdoor activities. Highly recommend a visit.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little cottage in rural TN was a pleasure to stay in. I worked remotely one of my days there, and the internet and phone service was fine. It was peaceful and quiet, and I really enjoyed making friends with the dogs, seeing the alpacas out the back door, hearing the cows and sheep, etc. It was a pleasure to meet Belinda and chat for a bit, she is quite the superwoman! The place was perfectly clean and cozy. I was there for work, and did not explore, unfortunately, but hanging out at the cottage and on the front porch working was great. Highly recommend, and hope to come back."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It's such a beautiful getaway! All the personal touches make everything super comfy. The dogs are friendly and HUGE! The cute little blankets in baskets under the coffee table were perfect for snuggling while we watched tv. We're actually considering coming back with our friends that weren't able to make it with us this time. A+
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin! Great host!

Always again 👍👍👍"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this cute cabin. The home is very clean and well stocked with any items you may need. There is a lot of outdoor seating, including a fire pit and a small creek, so you can really enjoy the beautiful surrounding farmland. It was so fun to open the kitchen shade in the morning to see the alpaca grazing. Also, check-in and out was a breeze. We're already looking for an excuse to visit again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cutest little cabin! I’m so grateful we found this place and hope to return. It’s clean, comfy and has everything you need for a great weekend. The opportunity to feed the alpacas was a bonus!"

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"what a diamond in the rough!
we absolutely LOVED this lil place! quiet, secluded, amazing little cabin!!! and totally forgot about all the animals til I opened the back door first morning and there they were! really nice to get away from everyday life and back out into God's creation!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow what an awesome place to stay!! Belinda is a great host. Cabin is as described, in the middle of nowhere with all the peace and quite you can handle. Enjoyed sitting on the front porch with the giant doggies and drinking coffee. Will be back highly recommend!!!!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Another fabulous stay. Belinda is a stupendous host. The cabin is always clean and comfortable. This is a great, quiet, location. It is also close to local eateries/shops. We are looking forward to our next visit."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome cozy cabin, perfect for a couple or a couple and a kid or two. Dishes and utensils provided along with a mini oven/range for cooking or heating up leftovers."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this for my mom and her friend for their birthdays. They reported everything was great. It is back off the road a ways, but was perfect. Great communication, cabin was perfect. They reported everything was relaxing and peaceful.
Thank you Belinda!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved staying here. We were able to take a tour of the farm. My daughter even got to hold a duck and play in the creek near the cabin. We were not able to use the fire pit due to the weather. If you would like to stay on a working farm, then this is the place to go. For down times in the cabin we also watched TV. My four year old daughter was scared to go up the ladder to bunk up top, but that changed a few hours in. It was still a little nerve wrecking letting her go up but she was insistent that she wanted to sleep there.
As far as concerns, I would remind folks that the speedway is nearby. Saturday nights in the summer you can hear the cars from inside the cabin. The WiFi was spotty at best with low speeds, and cell phone service for us was barely one bar. Overall despite these negatives we had those expectations going in since the cabin is out in the country."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really enjoyed our stay! Beautiful property set in a peaceful environment.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic hostess, absolutely great. This was my first Air Bnb and Belinda made it very easy with great communication and everything was perfect when we arrived. A++"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not be more enamored with this charming cabin!! From the fabulous front porch swing to the ladder up to the loft, it’s perfect in every way. The space is lovely and Belinda is a gracious and kind host."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We delighted in the isolation of the location of this rustic log cabin. Everything we needed, and it was comfortable and cozy. Perfect place for quiet, time to ""unplug,"" rest, and rejuvenation! Definitely want to return in the future!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Belinda was a wonderful host. We had such a great time on the farm. My kids enjoyed seeing all the animals. The cabin was very nice and clean. It looked just like the pictures only better. If we ever find ourselves in this area of Tennessee we would for sure stay there again.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was fantastic! We had everything we could possibly need. The location was wonderful. Belinda was a fabulous host. There was plenty of sightseeing to do within an hour or less. Cherohala Skyway is a must!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love the cabin on the farm. It was peaceful and relaxing. Only negative was the gravel road back to the cabin. I had a low car and was concerned.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is the perfect place to unplug and get away. Belinda is a charming host, and she has taken great care to make the cabin a treasure to find in SE Tennessee. I couldn’t have asked for a better stay and host."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a peaceful stay! The cabin had everything we needed for our home away from home. Comfy beds, quiet location, and we loved the ranch experience. Feeding the alpacas and the sheep was so fun! Belinda was a great host and we would love to come back again!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great cabin! Exactly as pictured. Incredible host!
2021-05-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cabin and loved seeing the Alpaca and sheep in the fields. Dogs, however were a problem (wanted to be on the front porch with us all the time and barked a lot at night)."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is situated in a peaceful, serene setting with quaint views of sheep & alpacas nearby. We’ve stayed here twice thus far and find it to be generously roomy and the furnishings very nice & comfortable. A great place to retreat to after being out & about...or if you’re just wanting to hide away and relax, this is the place!"

2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Cabin at the Double T Alpaca Farm in Niota is wonderful! My sister and I spent 3 wonderful days here - and had a great time. Belinda is a wonderful host!
We enjoyed sitting on the porch in the mornings with our coffee, and in the afternoons with a glass of wine. So peaceful and beautiful! Belinda was kind enough to get us some firewood so that we could enjoy the fire pit on our last evening there. The cabin is adorable and well-stocked with everything you need. The bed is super comfortable, and the linens and big fluffy bath towels were an added plus! We enjoyed walking around the farm and seeing all the animals. The baby lambs were precious, and Sheba and Grouchy (the dogs) joined us for happy hour on the porch one night. We will definitely return the next time we are in the area!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,....
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful cabin- tucked away in the woods... the lambs were a perfect distraction- and very photogenic... LOTS of cardinals that would disappear as soon I would get the camera ready. Plenty of space to relax inside & out... we drove 11+ hours and the couch/recliners and bed was perfect!! Will definitely be back...
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a nice, tucked away house with plenty of space and peace and quiet."
2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful cabin. Wonderful host. We had a perfect stay.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband I stayed for a weekend get away during Covid. The cabin was clean, cute, and comfy. We enjoyed our visits from the barn dogs, visiting the alpacas, and lambs. The farm geese in the morning gave us a chuckle. The alpaca socks that are available made such great gifts to ourselves and to bring back for friends and family. We hope to come again in the future."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Cute, cozy cabin on a farm. Good location in between Chattanooga and Knoxville. The loft was a cool and unique. Cell phone service on the farm was poor which was kind of inconvenient but the cabin did have WiFi."
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is Wonderful! Great attention to detail and amenities, loved the decor and the space. Felt very much like home (or the home in a Hallmark Movie!) and the setting, surroundings and whole experience was even more than we expected. We would recommend the cabin to anyone and hope to spend more time there in the future if in the area."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This little country cabin was wonderful. It is above and beyond the necessities; is a few miles off the highway, and sports amazing scenery. There is literally a clear mountain stream across the driveway from the cabin. The cabin beats the pants off of any hotel. Would stay again."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely place- great stay. My daughter LOVED the loft bed!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Our stay at the cabin on Christmas was very special. We loved watching the animals on the farm. My girls loved sleeping in the loft and the fun games. The cabin was spotless and Brenda was an awesome host!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,You will love this cozy cabin!
2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful quiet place. Get greeted by two amazing dogs. It is amazing to see all these alpacas and sheep. The cabin is amazing. Only a short drive into town and maybe only 15-20 minutes from a vineyard or the lost sea adventure. Depending what part of knoxville you want to go on it only took us 40 minutes to go get dinner out there. If you want to go into sweetwater it only takes about 10 minutes.
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Host was terrific and the cabin was awesome!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Heart-felt and home are the two words that immediately come to mind when I think about our recent visit with Double T Farm's Cabin!
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean and cozy cabin with lots of cute alpaca decorations. The ladder up the loft was a little steep and I worried about my kids missing a step if they had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night but they were fine.
I loved how their dogs sat on our porch for a little bit. They are huge but gentle giants. And the farm tour was fun even if my kids were scared of feeding the animals!

2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our visit to Belinda’s farm! The cabin was perfect, clean, and had everything we needed, and our girls enjoyed being on the farm. Great host and hope to come back again!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Belindas cottage. When we arrived we were greeted by two gigantic but friendly farm dogs, who were very pleased to greet us and have us pet them. We also enjoyed looking at all of the sheep and alpacas that are right next to the cottage. The cottage is located a couple of miles back on a steep, loose gravel road, which made it a little bit difficult to get to since we were on a motorcycle, but it is manageable and Belinda made sure to warn us of this. The cottage was sparkling clean and was very well decorated. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A very nice cabin in the foothills. The Alpacas were nice to walk out in the morning to see.
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved the cabin & wished we would have stayed there the entire trip, instead of selecting a hotel closer to our second destination!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,My daughter and I enjoyed a brief respite at the cabin. Perfect weather and a great stay that included everything we needed to rest and relax. Belinda even took us on a farm tour and let us feed many of the animals. Enjoyed a cool fall evening at the firepit and woke up to the sounds of nature and the farm from the front porch. We’ll definitely be back!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Belinda's property is both peaceful and beautiful. This truly is a real working farm, that offers guests the opportunity to experience farm life while enjoying a quiet place to relax. We will be back soon!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Absolutely gorgeous!!! Perfect getaway so much peace you will get everything you want and more it’s too perfect I would stay there for days on end!!! You won’t regret it

2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Loved the cabin and the location. It is a quiet and welcoming farm. The cabin is cozy and clean. We decided to stay an additional day, and plan to return soon."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Belinda was a wonderful host. Very warm and welcoming and she made local recommendations for us.The house was decorated with cute alpacas and my son and I loved sleeping in the loft. The beds were very comfortable. Everything was very clean and little extras like k cups, hot cocoa and board games made the stay even more special. Belinda gave us an awesome tour of her farm and let us feed her alpacas, sheep, and cows. We roasted smores over the firepit. What a unique airbnb experience! We also enjoyed playing with Belinda's dogs."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was amazing we loved everything about it. We will for sure come back next year
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"WOW ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The cabin is exactly as shown. We loved the cozy space in the middle of the farm. We felt like we were a long place from nowhere but just 10 minutes away from the interstate.
Belinda is close and responsive. The decor and touches were awesome. Bed was great. Full sized fridge had ice! Had everything we needed. Loved to swing on the porch. Fun to be amongst the goats and alpacas. Dogs are friendly. We even bought a pair of alpaca socks."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful stay. IT WAS PERFECT! We had a Family of four and it worked out great. Had a campfire, roasted hotdogs, marshmellows and the cabin and farm was amazing. THE kids LOVED the farm and the tour of the farm. I highly suggest you booking this place. Don't pass this up."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Belinda's place was a gem! The cabin was clean and homey. My wife and I have stayed in many different cabins in the past and this was one of the best we have stayed in. It is truly in the middle of the farm but Belinda has made every effort to make the cabin space ""set-apart"" from the farm life. We definitely hope to return!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to relax and unwind. Feels like home. Quiet and relaxing. Very clean and comfortable with a wonderful host.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful secluded cabin!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,A lovely little cabin! My little girl got a kick out of watching the alpacas from the kitchen window and climbing into the loft. We only stayed one night and rather wished we were staying another. Highly recommended!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Double T Alpaca Ranch was an excellent place to spend a couple of nights! The location was so much fun with alpacas we could see from our kitchen window and sheep visible from the porch.
Before our stay, I wondered if the usual farm smells might be off-putting, but they weren't at all. The farm is clean and beautifully run, and the cabin itself? Sparkling clean!
The mattress was one of the best I've slept on. If you're a light sleeper, you may want ear plugs for the occasional animal noises.
We scheduled a complimentary farm tour with Belinda and made sweet memories feeding the alpacas and sheep! Belinda even recommended other things to see in the area.
Getting to and from the farm was easy as it's located right off a highway and not far from the interstate. The easy access didn't interfere at all with the idyllic rural and rustic feel of the place."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Belinda’s place is adorable! Beautiful cabin on a very private setting. Loved the alpacas and the farm dogs were so friendly! Beds were comfortable, couch was really nice, everything you need for a cozy stay. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Belinda is quite possibly the greatest AirBnB host I have encountered in 6+ years. The alpaca farm is amazing and a wonderful local experience. I cannot recommend this stay enough.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Nice farm away from traffic. Yet, close to Sweetwater. Very cozy & clean cabin. There is cable and wifi. We liked sitting outside on the porch. We enjoyed our stay and the farm tour. Belinda and her Grandson Damon are very hardworking and nice people."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great space for our quick overnight. Had a great stay. Comfortable bed, plush towels, and super quiet."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We will always remember our time at Belinda's cabin. The place was clean and in a scenic area, close to countless attractions. Touring her farm was our favorite part of our trip. She was so kind and hospitable and made it special for our two young boys by letting them feed her alpacas and sheep. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to relax close to nature or who has kids and wants to give them a taste of farm life."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed a restful stay in the cutest little cabin. We loved petting and feeding the sheep and alpacas. What a fun and memorable experience! The night was peaceful and relaxing watching the fire flies from the porch. Belinda was a warm gracious hostess spending time teaching the kids about how she takes care of her animals! We loved it!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Belinda, the owner of the Double T Alpaca Ranch, provided a home away from home for us! the cabin is perfect and the animals were so much fun. My children have a returned trip planned already! You will love the nearby town of Sweetwater, with shops and restaurants!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"You are in for a treat! Not only will you meet wonderful creatures, but also get to enjoy a sweet little creek, be delighted by fireflies, have a perfect cabin to play board games in and swing on the porch swing...AND you will sleep on a cloud because the beds and pillows are AWESOME!!! Not every Air B and B has a bathtub, so be sure take advantage of this perk during your visit. Other perks include lots of room, a comfy couch, tv, outdoor dining area AND indoor dining area, and 2 of the friendliest greeter dogs you’ll ever meet. Book your stay at The Double T today!!!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was amazing! It wasn't far off I-75 so it was convenient for our road trip but it was a secluded little cabin with a lot of privacy. It was the prefect size for our family of 4, great little cabin and super clean. The kids loved all of the animals she even took us around to visit the animals and feed the alpacas. Belinda was amazingly hospitable and willing to answer any questions we had about the area. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the area or looking for a break along 75 you won't be disappointed. I hope to go back soon."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just slightly off the beaten path but well worth the short drive to this quiet, private and exceptionally clean country cabin with many thoughtful special touches that make you feel at home even before you step inside it's well appointed space. I'll be back."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Not enough stars. The host is amazing! Cabin was SPOTLESS and had All the amenities, including AC, direct TV and wifi. Beautiful location. Great for ANY tourism in the area."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Incredibly clean, cute stand alone cabin right on the farm! I will def be back!"
2020-06-01,3,Stayed one night,We never received any check in instructions so we weren’t able to get into the cabin. The host was very quick to respond and try to correct the misunderstanding. Belinda is super sweet and I know it wasn’t intentional. Looking forward to staying there later on! Or hopefully getting a refund at least.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lovely Airbnb! My daughter couldn’t stop talking to our family about how much she loved the cabin and animals! We would stay there again in the future!❤️😊
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay! Felt so at peace in Belinda’s cabin overlooking her beautiful farm.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful house and setting. Practically perfect in every way.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Belinda was a wonderful host! My boyfriend and I went whitewater rafting with Bigfoot Outfitter (highly recommend) and Belinda had offered a farm tour for us! We decided to grab dinner right after instead but, we were blown away when we arrived. Being animals lovers we went crazy for the animals! We enjoyed our time and the AirBnB was a great place to stay! You can’t go wrong with it."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a great time. The house was cozy, and we loved the animals. Two dogs came to greet us, and they were extremely sweet. We highly recommend!"

2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay here with my husband was absolutely amazing. Everything was clean and easy to get too.
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,This is our favorite airbnb to this point. It's back away from the bustling road but still close enough to make a quick run to walmart. Check out the Amish farm markets in the area (Englewood farmers market) there are a lot of attractions in a 40 mile radius. If you love animals book it. Nice cabin in a good place. We hope to come back.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The animals are so delightful.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful tidy cabin on a charming working farm. Animals all around, a winding little creek, breezy lovely countryside. Great place to relax and enjoy nature and the company of lived ones."

2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the best Air bnb experiences we have ever had. The cabin was wonderful, and in a safe, out-of-the way neighborhood. My daughter was thrilled with the animals, especially being able to feed the alpacas. We bought some amazing socks made from the alpaca fur as a souvenir. We highly recommend it!"
2020-03-01,5,Stayed one night,What a charming and cozy little cabin. So peaceful! Great location. Highly recommend.
2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A pristine, charming, cozy cabin located basically on a petting zoo -- could the kids have loved this any more? From getting to sleep up in the loft to feeding and petting so many adorable animals, including a baby sheep born the day before, this was an ideal place for our girls to stay, and we all had a great time. Belinda was really generous and hospitable, and we definitely plan on coming back. This was originally just a nice place to stay on the way back from somewhere else, but we loved being there so much that we extended our trip by a day to get to enjoy it -- in future this will be a destination for us."
2020-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great treasure. Belinda keeps a wonderful cabin that comfortable and homey. Everything is clean and ship shape. But the real treat was the tour Belinda offers of her ranch. My wife and I were invited to meet and feed the alpacas, cows and sheep. We even got to bottle feed “Cookie” and Brownie”, her two new baby lambs. It was such an adventure and we can’t wait to return. Thanks again Belinda!"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Belinda place is one of the most unique experiences we have had staying at air bnbs, or anywhere for that matter. Interacting with the animals and hearing all the sounds throughout our stay was amazing ! Getting to feed the baby sheep and hand feed the alpacas and baby deer was awesome ! We will definitely come back and stay whenever we get a chance to."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a fun time! Damon was a great tour guide and we loved getting to know all the animals. The cabin was spacious, clean, and equipped with everything we needed. My kids loved staying here. The board games were a nice touch. This was a nice place to relax after a day of driving. We will definitely stop again next time we are passing through the area."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a sweet place to stay. We follow our GPS to the road of the address & it said we arrived but we didn't see the cabin. You have to continue to wind around the road/driveway until you see a skid painted like a flag...turn left. There you will see the cabin. It will be worth it. The animals are precious, the cabin is very cozy & the owners are great. We just walked in the cabin. They came by to give us a tour & feed the animals when we were all settled. We seen a baby lamb right after she was born. It was great♡♡♡"
2020-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Very beautiful place!! Top of my lists on coming back to!!! Belinda was a wonderful host!!

2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a delight to meet Belinda and stay at her cabin on the farm! It is such a cozy place with a great front porch and beautiful views of nature & the farm animals. Getting to have a farm tour was an added bonus. It does not have an oven if you wanted to cook your own food, but does have large frig & microwave and plenty of good restaurant choices within 20 minutes. Very nice & clean! Would love to stay there again!"
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a treat it was to spend five days at Belinda’s farm! It wasn’t long enough for us. The hospitality and time spent showing us the farm was an unexpected treat. We loved waking up to sheep and cows in our windows. Truly a great experience.
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We ended up staying here on our way down to Florida. It’s such a cute place to stay! We’re even staying here on our back because it was so homey and comfortable. The hostess was very sweet when we couldn’t find the farm (our fault) and made sure we knew we could ask for anything we needed. Thank you for such a nice place to stay!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful place to escape..
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is amazing and definitely exceeds expectations. A well appointed cabin with plenty of charm. The lovely animals are a bonus. We would certainly stay here again without hesitation.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Hands down one of the best AirBnB experiences we’ve ever had. Incredibly clean and the farm made it into such a fun stay. Belinda is so kind and went out of her way to make sure our stay was perfect! If we could give this property 10 stars we would!
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at many air bnb’s and this has been my favorite one! Belinda was so kind and gave us an amazing tour of her farm and let us feed the animals. The cabin was beautiful, clean and cozy. I enjoyed opening all the canisters around because each had something in it for us to enjoy. I loved waking up and walking along the road with grouchy (one of the dogs) meeting some of the sheep and guard geese. I already started looking into a second trip so I can bring my kids! If you’re looking for a relaxing off the beaten path location this is exactly it!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Belinda was a gracious and kind hostess. We loved the meeting the animals. The cabin was very clean and cozy. The setting is very restful. This was a great place to relax.
2019-10-01,4,Stayed one night,A great small Cabin for a weekend away. Host was extremely kind and willing to give a tour of the farm which we weren't able to do.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We just loved the cabin. The pictures just don't do the quality of the cabin justice. I really loved the quality of the bath towels, as silly as that may seem. The cabin was cozy and perfectly decorated. A lot of thought went in to it. Our kids loved the loft, calling it their tree house. Belinda was great!!! Great communication and attentive. She really made the stay special.
The location is great. We traveled to Atlanta, North Carolina, Chattanooga just to name a few places. The Mayfield Dairy tour in the area is great and so is Sweetwater Farm."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farm tour was fun as it was an upfront experience with many kinds of animals. Great information on taking care of the animals. The cabins has a homey feeling and an ability to having the ability to cook food in microwave, have a cup of coffee, keep drinks cold in refrigerator."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Belinda is a thoughtful and welcoming host! The space is perfect for a weekend getaway and Belinda will even take you on a tour of her farm. Feeding the animals is a treat and her dogs are the sweetest. I definitely recommend staying here.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Belinda is an amazing host. We had such a wonderful time at her cabin and on her farm. She was accommodating and quick to answer any questions we had as well as recommendations of places to go. The cabin was very clean, the beds were comfortable, and we had everything we needed to feel at home. We also enjoyed feeding the animals. We hated to leave but we will definitely be back as soon as we can."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful last night of a vacation spent here. Cabin was lovely and comfortable and our host was amazing. Loved the tour of the farm and meeting all of the special animals that reside there. Want to come back soon!
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely amazing host and place to stay. She makes you feel like your right at home. The cabin is fantastic. It is the perfect size. Super clean. Immaculate. This will be a vacation spot we come to for years. I wish there were more stars I could give this place.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Belinda has been an exceptional host. We arrived at her place around 5:30 PM. The place is secluded from highway, that adds a peaceful touch to the country side. The place is easy to find on google maps. When we arrived at the location, we were spellbound with the accommodation and amenities that were provided. The place is pretty clean and stocked with all the required amenities needed for a traveler. The room was well maintained and air conditioned. The beds were clean, comfortable and spacious. We wanted to experience the countryside and the way of life. Belinda offered us the farm tour, showing us her livestock that she personally manages. We even got a chance to feed the alpacas and cows on the farm. She even greeted us to her shepherd dogs that were huge in size and are pure bred. We got to experience the country side and enjoyed every bit of it. Belinda is a great host one can have. I would definitely love to come back some time soon and would definitely choose this place when i need a bit of the country side living."
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"An amazing host will make the difference for a trip, Belinda is that host!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Belinda is the type of person who is immediately lovable. She was friendly and kind. She made us feel immediately at home.
We did the farm tour and loved it! You can tell all the animals are loved. We got to see a nice sunset and you can see the animals from the house.
The owner’s house is far enough away that you have a sense of privacy and close enough that you know you can get help if you need it. (We’re from a rural area, so it’s our preference to have some acreage between the neighbors). There is also a monitor for video cameras around the cabin, which is a nice, unexpected touch.
The space is clean and cozy. The furniture is high quality and the bed was comfortable. I didn’t go upstairs, but my family said the upstairs bed is really comfortable too!
There were lovely flowers planted around the cabin and the porch is really cozy and fun to hang out on. The night stars are clearly visible from the porch.
I would definitely stay here any time!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This little cabin was terrific! It was very clean and had everything we needed including making our dog feel just as welcomed as we were! Dylan was extremely responsive and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is our second booking with villodge and we absolutely love it. We have stayed in cabin 5 and this time cabin 3 and it was just a nice and comfy. Dylan is great with communicating and we can’t wait to book again!!!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Dylan’s place was beautiful. Sparkling clean, spacious, comfortable for 2 and our dogs. Had a Kuerig and k-cups, fast Wi-Fi, huge TVs in every room. We had a great time."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful modern, quiet, and clean cottage. Great space around the grounds for pups to play and walk around. The biscuits and gold dog bowels was a nice added special touch. I did not get to use the fire pit this visit, but was stacked with wood and ready to go if I needed, next time! Close to the winery and state park. I will definitely be back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a hidden gem. We were in town for a wedding and this was the perfect place for my wife, dog and me. We’ve stayed in a few different Airbnb’s and this one was so perfectly thought out and well stocked! They even had a little dog treat container, large crate so we didn’t have to unpack ours, and bowls ready for your pup if you happened to forget to bring yours. I feel like this place is the perfect reason for us to make an excuse to come back! For those looking to do, the train looks awesome but we didn’t have time with the wedding, but we did have time to visit a local winery that was incredibly accommodating and allowed us to bring in our dog. We couldn’t help but to buy pretty much one of everything in there as it was all delicious!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Was a beautiful place and would recommend this place to anyone.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the cutest place, upon checking in it was so very clean and nice, just the cutest, it was like staying in a 5 star suite but out in the country which made it completely different. House had everything you needed, Dylan responded right away when I messaged him. It is very quiet, peaceful, grocery store was maybe 15 minutes down the road, along with drug stores and other little things.....liquor store too... We stayed for 6 nights and it was very peaceful. Bed was comfy too. We didn't do much but the house had everything we needed so it was restful. I would recommend, it was like Atlanta style (where we are from) in the middle of Tenn. mountains. Very tastefully decorated as well."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We were so pleased to stay at Dylan's airbnb. The place is just darling And was just 4 miles from the wedding venue at Hiawassee River weddings.
He has 5 2 bedroom houses all in a row And we booked 3 of them so the whole wedding party could be together."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This is the second one of the cabins I have stayed in at this location; there are 5. The hosts, Michael and Dylan, keep everything well maintained and are very responsive to any inquiries. They recently installed a fire pit behind each one.
This cabin, like the yellow cabin, has everything you could possibly want and more. A fully equipped kitchen (air fryer, Keurig coffee, utensils and even spices), awesome washer and dryer, comfortable bed and nice size bathroom and amenities. Quiet and great views. If you like to walk, there is plenty of space for that as well. Highly recommended."

The beds and other furnishings were very comfortable. We really liked the screened porch, and the view of the pasture from there. It's a very quiet peaceful place, but close to good supermarkets and eating places."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,All beds and showers were great. Clean. Roomy. Pleasant. Space is amazing to let the late risers sleep and the early morning person take to the screen porch with coffee to listen to the birds. Easy to find. A carport makes loading groceries into the amazing kitchen a breeze. This Airbnb hosted some members of The EmiSunshine Sunshiners Crew. We stay in Airbnbs all over the U.S. and we rate this one of the best. TheEmiSunshine.com

2019-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"James and Marissa are just beginning with Airbnb. The house has previously been used as a Grooms quarters for their wedding venue.
All of the rooms are very large and nicely decorated. There is a screened-in back porch where I sat and watched the rain come in over the green pastures and beautiful sunsets in the evenings. Peaceful and quiet, but very close to town. This is a place for rest and solitude or a great home base for seeing the sights of East Tennessee. Anything I needed...all I had to do was ask. I hope to return soon.
P.S. The Porter House is named after their sweet son Porter."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was incredible. After a long day of travel, we arrived late in the evening. Renee and Richard were there to greet us and answer any questions we had. The location was easy to find, quiet, and peaceful. The kitchen had snacks, water and coffee stocked for us and that was so nice to not have to think about. The towels were super fluffy, the place was spotless, and the cats were friendly! They really put their hearts into this.
Had a great chat with Richard one morning who was able to answer questions we had about the area, where to eat, where to find trinkets we were looking for.
HIGHLY recommend this place, location is perfect for going different directions to shop, eat, hike, fish. We will be back when we return!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was very easy to access. We loved the decor. The bed was very comfortable. The shower very very clean, and being a very tall person we loved the high shower head. The towels were very soft and thick… high quality. A great extra touch was the bidet. We had some rain and loved being able to park under the car port, with very easy access to the Airbnb. Even though no stove and oven, we could cook everything we wanted with the amenities they had, the access to the grill was very helpful. Even on the hot days and evening, sitting under the carport with the fans was very comfortable . We are very anxious to come back again, so many things to do around this area. We enjoyed sitting around the fire pit with the host and even a night by ourselves. The cats on the property were very friendly."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,great place to stay and very convenient location
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely stay with Renee! She greeted us on our arrival and introduced us to the cats who were nearby. The place was well thought out. Very clean and well-kept. We will absolutely be back here when we are in town!

Plus, it was only a mile away from the downtown area and an awesome coffee shop. Highly recommend!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Kailynn's Blondies Bungalow!! We came to Sweetwater to visit our son, daughter n law and new grandson. The place was very clean & cozy. The fenced in yard was an added bonus when traveling with your dog. Kailynn was very responsive and kind by giving us a heads up about the stepping stones might be slick due to the rain. The beds were comfy too. We will definitely stay here again!!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband myself and dog have stayed at Blondies Bungalow 4 times in 2023 and have enjoyed every stay. House is super clean, exactly as pictured online and Kailynn the host is a great communicator and very friendly. She responds very quickly if you need her for anything and no matter what it is, she takes care of it quickly. We would not stay anywhere else. What makes her AirBNB stand out against other ones that state they are pet friendly is that she has a fenced in back yard for your dog.
Charlene Richard and Remi"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place for our weekend stay.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place to stay, close to town but far enough away. Fenced in backyard was perfect for the dogs. Can’t wait to stay again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I have stayed at Bonnie's Bungalow 3 times now and would not stay anywhere else. Kailynn is pet friendly and only one of a handful AirBnB's that has a fenced in backyard. She even remembers your furry family member and has treats and a small toy on the counter for them. Kailynn is super friendly and quick to respond if you need to get ahold of her. Her AirBnB is cozy and super clean and you feel right at home upon entering the front door. I am glad I ran across her AirBnB online. I plan to be a return customer in the future. Her rates are awesome also. Don't second guess staying at Bonnie's Bungalow, you will not be disappointed. Charlene, Richard and ''Remi''"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"As pictured.
On a very busy road."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Very lovely house with thoughtful personal touches throughout.... plus pet friendly. There is a very cute dog park (wiggly field) 3 min down the road. Kailynn is very responsive and happy to help. We had a wonderful stay and would book again.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a return visit to stay at Bonnie's Bungalow. Kailynn is a great host, her AirBnB is always super clean and she responds very quickly if you need to ask a question or need something. We love staying at her place. My husband and I have been looking for a permanent retirement home in East Tn and plan to continue staying there until we find our forever home. Her location is pet friendly and has a fenced in backyard for your pet. Thats why we specifically chose her AirBnB to stay at. Most other pet friendly locations DO NOT have a fenced in yard. The small town square of Sweetwater has quaint shops to visit or get coffee or ice cream. There is a Walmart close by as is an Ingles grocery store. And her AirBnb has close access to the expressway to travel to other cities such as Lenoir City or Knoxville. Kailynn's Bonnie's Bungalow gets 5 stars from us.
Charlene Richard and ""Remi"""
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This little house was perfect for my sister and I.
One thing I want to point out is the cleanliness.. even though this little house is pet friendly (we don't have house pets) it was clean, no smells no signs, we found that refreshing and amazing.
We greatly appreciated our short stay and sure hated to leave, just a beautiful area to visit.
The cozy couch was quite welcoming after a long day of packing in as much as possible."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Kailynns place we cute and homey. It was just what we needed for our last minute short stay. She quickly answered my questions and was flexible with our schedule. 100% recommend!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Squeaky clean and very comfortable. Enjoyed all the comfortable pillows and the soft bedding. Would definitely stay again!! Thank you kaitlyn. Also rexxy loved the ball. It was a nice touch. 😊
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was the perfect little getaway! The house was clean as can be and the back yard was a huge plus for my dogs :) Best experience yet with Airbnb and will most definitely be back!! Kailynn is an amazing host thank you so much for everything.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great time in Sweetwater! We spent alot of time at the house due to the weather and felt very much at home in this cozy cottage. It was just as pictured and had everything we needed. Our senior dog was comfortable with everything being on one level and easy access.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and cozy as promised.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a wonderful stay. Definitely felt like the home away from home we were looking for during our stay with my wife and 3 dogs. Kailynn even gave us a very warming welcome with a bag of goodies for my boys. Such a nice gesture along with providing a nice and clean home. Would definitely stay here again. Sweetwater is a cute town right down the street. Loved it here.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The bungaglo was exactly as advertised! My husband, dog, and I very much enjoyed the stay. The lovely space and Kailynn's communication was extremely welcoming! Felt like home away from home :)"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was a nice stay! Cute house, very clean"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Kailynn:
Just wanted to let you know what a wonderful time we had at your AirBnB house. It was exactly as pictured and described online. And absolutely immaculate. We looked at many AirBnB's that said they would accept dogs but did not find any quite like your set up. When we happened to stumble on yours it was a no brainer to book it. You could not hardly find a place like yours to stay at for 6 days with a dog that had a nice fenced in back yard. We also appreciate how quick you would respond whenever we had a question prior to us arriving. We definitely will be back several more times....especially since we are scouting out towns and house hunting in East Tn with our realtor over the course of the next 10 months to find our perfect retirement place to call home. Your home was absolutely great!! Thanks again!!
Richard, Charlene and ""Remi"""
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Our stay was everything we had hoped for! It’s hard finding a place pet friendly and the fenced in backyard made it the perfect place.

2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this home to stay a couple nights while attending a wedding. The house was clean, cute decorative design. The beds were clean and comfortable. You can tell they are working on the home.
A couple things that could be improved:
Mold in the bathroom shower near the top. Bath fan was full of dead bugs and was a little musty. There was a family of hornets guarding the front door.
There is a Large ant hill at the bottom of the steps of the front porch so you had to watch where you walked. The lawn could use some maintenance.
The Athens area was super cute and felt safe. We were walking distance to the coffee shop and downtown. Overall we enjoyed the house and it was a nice stay."

Although we did not cook, kitchen seemed to be adequate. Would stay again when in area."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, son, and I had a great family visit in this quaint but well-appointed historic home. The kitchen had everything needed to prepare meals and we really enjoyed having access to the fun family games. There is really nothing that the house was lacking. We also appreciated the ability to bring our dog along! My only complaint was that the beds were not comfortable. I know that is such a personal preference that it is hard to find the right fit for everyone but the mattresses just seemed a little old to us. The guidebook noted some renovations are underway so that may an item on the list to upgrade. Athens, TN is a sleepy town but it gave us a good jumping off point for local outdoorsy things. The location is very quiet, walkable, and accessible to the downtown area. Our host, Danna, was quick to respond and provided clear, easy instructions. Check in and out were easy and the house rules were simple/ manageable. All in all, a very good and easy visit and good value. Thank you!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Donna’s place is beautiful and we plan on visiting again. We felt safe and secure and the home felt large for a two bedroom home. Definitely enough space for cooking family dinners and having friends over. It was beautifully decorated. 5 stars for sure!

It would be nice to have a little more seating in the living room but we made do with the dining chairs. The only complaint is one neighborhood home. It would have been a quiet neighborhood but these neighbors were very disturbing. There was a lot of traffic in and out, yelling, cursing and horns blaring, at all hours of the day and night. Police visited a couple of times. Other than the neighbor complaint, which isn’t Darren’s fault, the home and neighborhood is nice."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Darren’s place was clean and comfortable. Place met our needs for our stay. Fast internet, close to stores for groceries."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful few days there, and I sure to come back"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Darren’s place in Athens, TN was prefect for my fiancée, our two small dogs, and me. Beautiful brand new kitchen. Large bedrooms and living room. Very clean. Nice flooring that makes you feel like your suitcases or anything won’t damage it. Left the cake topper from our wedding in the refrigerator and Darren offered within minutes to send it to us once he came to check on the house. Easy to check into. Really could not have been a better experience. Thank you, Darren!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,We loved the place. It is close to our son so we will be renting again. The only thing that could be more helpful is more/ better living room furniture. Our son had to bring his lawn chairs so there was enough sitting.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay with family for few days or for a long period. The house is new, no details. Everything works perfect and clean.
There is a kind neighborhood. Good internet. I can’t say it’s near everything cause the city has not much places to go. But it’s near the main locals you need to go. Darren is a great guy. Answers fast, flexible and helps when he can. The negociation was fair and I’m look forward to rent a new place with Darren. Thank you so much."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a good time at Darren’s house; everything you need is available. Everything is clean…enough space.
2023-01-01,4,Group trip,"The home was nice.
Everything went well, he was very accommodating. My main issue was the seating in the living room. There is only a small 2 seater couch and a chair. When we all tried to gather and hang out to watch tv, there just wasn't enough sitting space. Other than that everything was great."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely home away from home. We stayed here while visiting family at Christmas. We arrived to a fully decorated Christmas tree! The home is warm and inviting. And the beds are comfortable. We hope to stay here next time we are in town.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great stay, neighbors were pretty loud but overall no significant problems. Would stay in the future"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,a+
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect home for my friend and our daughters to stay at while we were in town. Space was perfect for two 4 year olds to run, play tag and hide and go seek. And enough space for my 3 month old to relax. Very quick to get to Wesleyan!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Clean, bright, everything is new inside. You do hear the occasional train, but it didn’t really bother us. Good stay and would recommend."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Was having some WiFi issues but got the issue addressed promptly. All around great place to stay! Me and my crew thoroughly enjoyed it and hope we get to stay there again! 5 out of 5 stars.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,This home has everything you could think of and more. Beautiful Mountain View. They have taken the time to put together recommendations for activities. Kitchen is fully equipped for any cooking or baking you may desire. Would definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was an excellent place to stay. We enjoyed the privacy and the views!! It was located in a good area to branch out to see area attractions. We loved the area, close enough to town for restaurants and groceries."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved Melissa and Wayne’s place! The home was peaceful and private. Their instructions on how to get there and how to get in were very clear and easy. Everything was just how it was stated in the add. The home was well stocked with items we would need for our stay. It was very clean & neat. Melissa and Wayne were very responsive and helpful anytime we had questions about our stay. We had a great stay & will definitely be back. Highly recommend this beautiful place for everyone !
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Hope to be back soon.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,The place was nice.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second time staying here, and both times have been great.
Straightforward instructions and extremely clean. I will stay again."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Wayne & Melissa's cabin in Etowah was perfect for our needs. The cabin sits atop a large wooded knoll with incredible views of the surrounding mountains. The cabin contains a nice 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom layout which can accommodate many guests. We have stayed in many Airbnb's and this cabin had the most fully furnished kitchen of any that we have rented. This comes in handy if you plan to make your meals in the cabin, which is what we always do. The cabin has a large wrap around deck which was very relaxing as we listened to the quiet surroundings of nature. The location was great as well, being about 5 minutes from the heart of Etowah and only 20 minutes from the larger city of Athens. Etowah and Athens have everything that you need to enjoy your stay in Southeastern Tennessee. We will be looking to make another booking in the spring of 2024."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved it, except for the squeaky floors. A few more towels would have been nice. Overall it was great!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks again for another beautiful and peaceful stay. We hope to return soon.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting on the knob. Extremely clean. Lots of deck space. Beautiful view. This house served our needs perfectly. It was an excellent and comfortable base for our daily fishing ventures on the Hiwassee and Ocoee Rivers. Would most certainly recommend.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed the cabin and peace and quiet. Beds were comfortable and everything was as advertised. played some cards and cooked out there with some friends we knew from the area and all had a great time. Would definitely recommend and also rent again next time we come down. Thank you for the use of your home.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I needed a well deserved relaxing vacation. I got what I was looking for. Peaceful mornings, had breakfast on the porch and enjoyed the view. It was a very cozy place and I was able to unwind and reset. Great place to stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We love this house… the perfect place with all the accommodations for a relaxing away vacations . Not just beautiful inside and outside but Melissa and Wayne have it perfectly decorated and with all the necessary supplies and. Excellent communication from day one …. 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location and extremely clean. The location is perfect and in the center of Etowah and Tellico Plains.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful location in the wooded foothills of the Smokey Mountains. The cabin was lovely and clean, and we loved the views from the spacious deck.
The beds were comfortable and the kitchen well equipped. We hope it will be available the next time we return to the area."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a perfect spot!!! We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. From a private and peaceful location, to a clean and well furnished cabin, our experience gave us more than expected. The best part was we did not have to reach out to Wayne and Mellissa once we got there because there were no issues. We were asked what we were coming for and I told them. Then I was given recommendations and was able to plan my trip out. It rained every day, but it never interfered with the trip. Had a blast and will stay again when given the opportunity."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed the property! The air conditioning was very good, kitchen well equipped, big deck with Mountain View, no neighbors in eye distance, and covered parking. Be warned that there isn’t a smart TV or cable/satellite. Since Wi-Fi is available I purchased a Roku for our visit."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First and foremost , Melissa and Wayne are great with the messages and response times, as well as very broken down detailed instructions. The cabin itself was beautiful. The surrounding scenery was something out of a greeting card. The inside living space was very clean and well taken care of. We had a great time and definitely would recommend staying."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hiwassee Haven
Great place to stay if you are fishing the Hiwassee. The local restaurants looked ify but each one was friendly, popular with locals and had reasonably priced good food. We stay at a lot of places and this might be our favorite cabin. Will definitely be back next time we come fly fishing to TN."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay! The house is very clean and well stocked. We had our 2 younger kids with us, and they appreciated the toys and coloring books. The kitchen has everything we needed to cook, and there was one large, mostly empty cabinet, so we didn't have to have our supplies cluttering the counters. The mountain views from the deck are lovely! We felt secluded enough to be comfortable (no neighbors within sight.) Hosts were proactive in suggesting things for us to do in the area. We spent most of our time hiking around local waterfalls, but it was also a doable drive to Knoxville or Chattanooga for more attractions. We would absolutely stay again!"
2023-03-01,4,Group trip,"If you are looking for a cabin near Athens, TN or Etowah, this is a good location. The AirBNB is easy to find, it has a pretty view and it was clean. Check-in was easy and I was thankful the host disclosed the slow internet ahead of time so I could plan accordingly.
What I was very disappointed in was the down stairs floors of this cabin squeak, badly. I had booked the cabin as a place for family to stay during a funeral. Since it was extended family and we were on different schedules, the squeaky floors were an issue because they are loud enough to wake up another family member trying to get some rest. The other issue I ran into was there simply were not enough blankets for the number of people I paid for. With this host I had to pay extra to have 6 people instead of 3. For an extra hundred dollars I would anticipate that we would have more than one thin blanket per bed. We had one thin blanket per bed and froze."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you for a wonderful stay. Your home was beautiful and so peaceful. Just what we needed.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is absolutely amazing. The view is something I will miss. Very private location yet close to town. Short drive to many beautiful hiking trails and waterfalls. Tellico Plains was my favorite. Thank you again Wayne & Mellissa for sharing your home. I'll certainly be back.
Sincerely,
Ray"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is a beautiful, restful place to stay and enjoy various motorcycle rides and other attractions.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to stay! The cabin is spacious yet cozy, close to restaurants and stores and there is a lot to do nearby.

The falls are beautiful and a visit to the Amish market is a must for fresh veggies and fruit."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The location is wonderful. The house is on its own big hill with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. You feel like you're secluded, as you cannot see neighbors on this hill of 6 wooded acres, but you're not too far from neighbors. You are also just a short few minute drive to the old town of Etowah where you can get groceries, eat at a few restaurants, and visit the beautiful old train station. The house was clean and stocked with cooking essentials."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful view, clean and comfortable cabin, great setup! Lots to do in the area and this was a very nice central location but private and quiet."

2021-09-01,5,Group trip,Highly recommend a stay at Wayne and Melissa’s cabin. Not only were they accommodating for dates but also didn’t have to worry about anything while staying at their cabin. The cabin was amazing with a beautiful view and very peaceful. If you are wanting to get away from the day to day hustle and bustle definitely reach out to Wayne and Melissa for a great time and no stress.
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"The pictures do not do this place justice. This home is very nice. You will not be disappointed. It is very secluded and the views of the mountain are just wonderful at breakfast time sipping on coffee . The grandkids loved making s’mores in the fire pit. At this home just about anything you need they have thought ahead and supplied or gave a suggestion on. Firewood already cut by the fire pit. The owners are very prompt on answering any questions. Upon checking in the process was very simple as checkout was as well. The home is very clean everything works and no issues with anything. The prices are very reasonable when compared with other prices on comparable homes of the same quality. This home out beats the other locals rentals by far on quality , price, service and location. My family will definitely be back next summer for a 2 week stay."

They're perfectly situated midway between Chattanooga and Knoxville, with easy access to the Hiwassee and Ocohee Rivers for floating and paddling adventures, Conasauga Falls, Tellico Plains, and the Cherohala Skyway.

The kitchen and bathrooms are up-to-date and stocked with items you may have forgot. The home is nicely decorated and has a nice cabin feel.

2019-02-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place! Super clean.
My sis in law always enters hotels and other accommodations with a big pack of Clorox wipes and obsessively cleans everything before settling in.
She never even pulled them out here!!!
The stars were unbelievably bright. We enjoyed sitting on the pitch at night listening to the night sounds around us.
We also enjoyed coffee on the front porch as the sun rose
Had everything we needed for a comfy stay.
If you arrive late in the winter, make sure that you use the extra heat sources provided. It takes the house a while to warm up, but once warm, it maintains temp beautifully.
We will definitely stay there again when visiting family in the area."

Without a doubt, Wayne and Melissa’s cabin is the ultimate vacation home in the region for people on a moderate budget. In a secluded setting with great views, this home is perfect to unwind and relax in. We loved every detail that was put into this home. There are so many things to do in and around the house and then when you’re ready to explore there’s White water rafting, zip lining, hiking and other adventures only 30 minutes or less away."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a pleasant experience we had with Rochel. The place was absolutely amazing, comfortable and beautifully decorated. Everything we needed was made available.
One of my favorites about the place was the parking meter in front of the guest parking space. Extremely thoughtful and creative.
We will certainly make this our constant place to lodge when we travel to Tennessee."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful, private & peaceful
setting was so lovely complete with extra touches like a diffuser, fresh flower vase, snacks, use of a hammock & well lite walkway at night to downstairs unit. We loved our 3 day stay here and will definitely return. Rochel & Steve were very personable & accommodating hosts.
The bed was extremely comfortable, great shower & very clean unit. It is in our top 5 AIRBNB’S over the last 7 yrs."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rochelle took us in at very short notice for a two night stay. She was there to greet us on arrival. Privacy was great and she and her husband were friendly. Would recommend if looking for a clean safe place!

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place for us to spend our weekend while taking a train trip and exploring the area. The basement apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for a short stay along with plenty of room for the two of us. We had a minor issue with the television not working, and the hosts were super kind and went out of the way to bring us another one. The space was well appointed and comfortable. The bed was a firm spring mattress, there were plenty of extra pillows and blankets. Space tends to be on the colder side, but there's an oil heater to help warm it and keep you cozy at night. There were plenty of snacks, coffee, tea, and a mini fridge stocked with filtered water. Keep in mind, this is a shared space and there will be noise from upstairs, but there is a white noise machine on the nightstand for guests as well as earplugs. The hosts were extremely kind and very responsive throughout our visit. We would definitely stay again when in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't keen on the idea of staying somewhere with other people. This was my first experience with AirBnB and I like my fair share of privacy, but this experience was spectacular. An absolutely wonderful stay with the friendliest and most welcoming host. Super helpful with directions on arriving and even better hospitality. My girlfriend and I were astounded at how welcoming the atmosphere was. The host had many generous amenities and were very courteous with us. 5 stars all around and would definitely book again if needed to. Thank you again Rochel and Steve for a wonderful stay."

It was a good central location close to the event we were headed to in Athens, but not too far from Knoxville for a nice night out! We appreciated the flexibility in check-in time so we could enjoy the area on our way in! Thanks to our hosts for being very communicative and helpful as well."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I had a wonderful time staying at Rochel's place. It was very comfortable and i felt right at home. She was there to greet me when I first arrived and she was responsive to my inquires. The place was spacious and had everything I needed. I would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"A perfect AirBnb! Rochel's place was just what we needed during our travels. Take time to see the beautiful mountains and scenery while you are there. There was plenty of space for our family of four, super clean and updated. Will stay again, I'm sure!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here. The place was very clean and comfortable to stay in. Rochel was friendly and quick to respond

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Rochel was easy to communicate with, very clear in her instructions, and had a very clean and comfortable place! The extra touches (small snacks and toiletries, decor selections) were very sweet. I would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Rochel’s place was incredible. Clean and welcoming, a private oasis in the mountains of TN. I’d highly recommend this space to anyone!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed staying here with our 4 and 2 year old! Rochel is so kind and the kids were great with our kids when they played together on the playground in the morning.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rochel's basement suite is perfect! She has thought of everything and offers a lot of extras for guests, like flavored creamer, snacks, easy breakfast items, and bottles of water. It's clean, exactly like pictured, quiet ... Perfect for what we needed. This will definitely be a repeated stay! Thank you, Rochel!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rochel made this stay by far one of the best, from the check-ins prior to arriving at the home (13+ hr drive) to wishing me well, their hospitality is unmatched. Rochel and her husband, Steve, made themselves available my entire stay for any needs I may have had (did not need anything additional as Rochel had it all covered) while still providing a peaceful and quiet space. Rochel and Steve made me feel welcomed and right at home in their beautiful small town. I will most certainly be returning to visit, without a doubt."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The family is gracious in opening the home to visitors! It’s a beautiful place that will be more than enough for your time there!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rochel’s home was a home away from home. Clean, spacious, and loaded with convenient snacks/coffee station etc. I’d absolutely recommend this spot and plan to come back!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The pictures don't tell you how cozy the space is. There were also nice touches, from small snacks and package half-and-half for your coffee.
Rochel was great to communicate with as well.
I would return if I'm back in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Rochel and her husband Steve were awesome hosts! They greeted us and their place was super nice! They came down with their children to hang out and visit with us, it was a great stay. Our best Air BnB experience, by far👍🏻😁"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very reasonable- relaxing decor- set up for ease of use. Very clean- loved the patio/sitting area! Thank you!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place to stay! Cozy, clean & private! Rochel was such a thoughtful & responsive host! Will definitely book again on our next trip through the area and highly recommend!"

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place and super friendly hosts!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home with your own entrance to the basement. We will definitely be back. It was just as the pictures showed. The bed was comfy, the place was clean and the little snack basket was so thoughtful. Rochel always responded quickly and very nice. This little place is a gem. We greatly enjoyed our stay."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This basement apartment was awesome! Rochelle gave clear directions on how to find the house and where to park. She greeted us and offered to help with our bags. The lodging was beautiful, spacious, well-decorated and very clean! The kitchen is mini but adequate, and she provided water and snacks. The bathroom is nice with double sinks and extra toiletries. The bed was comfortable. We enjoyed our stay and would book again if traveling through that area again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This waa the perfect place for our quick trip to TN. We were all comfortable and cozy . It was so nice that they offered some pantry breakfast items. We all enjoyed a warm cup of coffee on the patio while we visited and enjoyed the serenity. I will book again if I'm in the area :)
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The room in itself was very clean and beautiful. very comfortable bed, really nice bathroom, cute little kitchen & there is even a den type area to watch some tv on a comfortable couch. We are thrilled to have not only a super nice place to stay, but the host Rochel was incredibly nice. She made sure we had things to drink, snacks, breakfast & coffee! she gave us some suggestions on beautiful places to check out while exploring on our honeymoon. My husband and I drove an extra 2 hours each day to get into town (Pigeon forge & Gatlinburg) we could've found a place closer but Rochels place was so so nice & comfortable and we felt safe there. I 100% recommend seeing the place for yourself. there was a nice patio with a hammock and a swing chair with also a table and other chairs to enjoy morning coffee (or wine 👀) it was so peaceful out there. we absolutely loved it! 10 stars!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a wonderful stay at Rochel's place. Newly remodeled, very clean, comfortable bed, and all the amenities you could need for a weekend getaway! She was quick to respond to any questions and gave perfect directions to find the place. Would definitely stay again!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a lovely and restful stay at Rochel’s home. Every aspect of the apartment was tastefully done, clean, comfortable and fully equipped. If you like a picturesque TN countryside then this is the place. Very well located and convenient to explore all of McMinn County. Plan to stay here again and hopefully soon!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was my favorite we have stayed at that’s not in Montana I hated we didn’t have more time but we will be going back !!!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was clean and the quarry was really neat. Everything was very clean. It was a peaceful getaway. It was nice to have a pedal boot too and a little raft thing to fish from. We had everything we needed to cook etc. The only issue was the Internet went out one night but was fixed quickly. I also would have liked there to be a handbook. Thank you.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very peaceful getaway. 10/10!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A very beautiful and cozy cabin with a relaxing atmosphere. A very comfortable bed, a deep soaking tub and a big, comfortable hot tub on the back porch. My favorite part was listening to the waterfall over the quarry while sitting on the porch. We also loved visiting the local Amish produce market just down the road.
Lucas was very nice and informative and quickly responds. We enjoyed ourselves and would highly recommend this cabin! We hope to return for another stay in the future."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was one of the best experiences we've had on AirBNB. It was a beautiful area with a great view. Lucas was a great host, super responsive to answer any questions."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved it so much we stayed another two nights!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place… had everything one could hope for for a peaceful getaway! The raft to traverse the quarry was perfect, and the water was not too cold at all! Very refreshing in fact. Hot tub was greatly appreciated as well. Our dog had a great time too :) Lucas was a very responsive and accommodating host. Highly recommend!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was one of the most relaxing and peaceful stays I have had in about 10 years. Once arriving at the cabin I felt so at ease and comfortable. The peace and tranquility was what I needed and loved see the deer grazing in the mornings as well as listening to the birds singing. The water in the quarry was breathtaking as well. The cabin was great and Lucas was a great host very responsive and quick. Everything he provided was great from directions to get to the cabin to recommendation. I will definitely recommend Lucas to anyone looking for a very special place like the little cabin on the quarry. Looking forward to scheduling another visit.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay. The cabin was beautiful and had amazing views and access to the quarry. Would recommend staying here and hoping to make it back again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed our stay. The mattress was super plush and comfy. They had everything you v would need. Beautiful view and the water was gorgeous.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lucas’ place, by far, was our favorite stop on our trip. We loved the cabin and didn’t want to leave! The quarry was awesome, we caught some fish and even did a “cold plunge”. It rained for a couple days while we were there so we had some good times on the back porch playing cards and visiting the Lost Sea (which is a really cool cave experience and not too far from the cabin). We cooked up a good amount of steaks and were just able to truly enjoy ourselves. We’re very greatful for the time we spent here. Highly recommend! We’ll definitely be back 😊"
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,The place is so beautiful. It was amazing views and I’m so glad I got to stay there.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very beautiful surroundings and very peaceful setting. The home was very clean and beautiful my kids loved the quarry.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,If I could give 100 stars I would! I am so glad I found this gem! We went over spring break/Easter and had an amazing time! We had everything we needed. Perfect place for families and pets! We spent most of our days navigating the Quarry and ended our nights in the hot tub and a fire! My mom lives in Florida and we live in Illinois! It was the perfect meeting point and we will make the Little House on the Quarry a yearly tradition!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing experience! Great attention to details, lovely and serene place! Comfortable bed, private and secluded. A restorative space, the jacuzzi and arcade were a fantastic bonus!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The directions were easy to follow. The property was neat, clean, and in working condition. The view was spectacular from the porch. We are making plans to revisit the property in the future.
Thank you Mr. Lucas"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying here with my best friend and our pups! The quarry was shockingly beautiful, the photos do not do it justice!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lucas’s cabin was perfect! The cabin as well as the view is amazing.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Great place! Loved it! 😍
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely amazing and beautiful space with lots to do! Loved every bit of our stay here! Very thoughtful and responsive host, definitely recommend!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Everything was just as described. The plethora of clean towels was amazing ! Our dogs loved it! We are hoping to come back over the summer!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,over all good for the price. the raft is very fun. Strange choice of decore though; bears and ocean.
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"This was such a beautiful and peaceful location. We loved the quarry and paddle boat, the fire pit and hammock, and especially the view."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,By far one of the best spots we have found for a relaxed weekend trip outside Nashville. The space was beautiful and clean and Lucas even went out of his way to provide coffee and little treats for the pups and humans! We went as two couples and enjoyed the fire pit and the hot tub! Everything was fabulous!! Ten billion stars all around! It’s so nice to find a dog friendly cabin without a million hidden fees and a truly laid back and responsive host. It was exactly the chill weekend we were looking for and we can’t wait to come back in the summer! Thanks Lucas!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Will come back
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a cute little cabin! great amenities, very clean, and per friendly! A very rare and appreciated combination."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is great and just as described in the listing. Very peaceful setting, quiet and the quarry is so lovely. The hot tub was relaxing after our long run. We world definitely stay here again!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you love secluded getaways, this is the place to stay. My boyfriend and I just came back for the third year in a row. It’s so quiet and peaceful here. We love everything about it. I can tell you that we will return for a fourth next year!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at ""Little House on the Quarry""! The location was perfect and peaceful for a last minute weekend getaway. The hot tub was very relaxing especially since it was in the single digits/below freezing all weekend. Lucas was very responsive to messages. We look forward to returning in the warmer weather when we can explore the quarry!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I have both done our fair share of traveling to places, big and small, and this has to be one of our top stays! Despite how private/remote the property is, the instruction Lucas gave us got us there without a problem, even as we arrived in the dark. The property looks even better than the photos, had everything we need, and was very clean! I cannot recommend this place enough and look forward to coming back again"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay it was beautiful and very quiet. The quarry is so peaceful. We absolutely loved it. Thank you again for letting us stay, it was perfect!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful cabin in a really unique & beautiful setting — and Lucas really went above and beyond as a host.
We loved having the hot tub, the fire ring, & the paddle boat to go out on the quarry (we weren’t brave enough to try swimming in January, even with my partner’s enthusiasm for cold plunges). Our dogs loved playing fetch in the open area near the barn — and although the yard around the cabin isn’t fully fenced, it was still fine for two dogs with only B-level recall skills. The quarry feels nice and remote, but the town of Athens is a short drive away; we became big fans of Ingles (the grocery store), and we had so much fun antiquing at The Hot Spot. We’d love to come back in the summer!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved this little “diamond” on the quarry so much. Beautiful cabin, nicely appointed with plenty of the necessary supplies. This was the first time I haven’t had to go out and buy necessities like toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap, etc. Everything was clean, and I can’t even begin to list all of the little things the owners provide to make your stay a pleasant one. And, so close to everything. Just can’t say enough about this rental. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely one of our favorites, the kids loved it the quarry was beautiful! Looking forward to our nxt stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"wonderful, (mostly) private cabin-at least for a winter retreat-nestled next to the beautiful waters of a quarry….note:
highly recommended to anyone even if you’re from the area check this out!
Would definitely stay again, thank you."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Its a very nice little cabin, and we do plan on staying there again in the future."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was one of the best Gems we have found on Airbnb! The house was beautiful, the hot tub was amazing and so clean! The views were awesome! Dog friendly to the max! Fire pit was a nice touch and walking around the property was beautiful. I will definitely be back to stay!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Stayed for a nearby wedding and love the place! Cozy, and private cabin with great views and relaxing area. Very responsive and helpful."

Host, Lucas, is friendly and responsive. Cabin and property are fantastic. Proximity to amenities is great while still feeling respite."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my first ever air bnb and it was great. Everything was clean and convenient, loved that there was coffee, hot chocolate plenty of towels. Host is great and responsive, there was no need to contact him because everything was as described. All i did was say hi and bye. This place has set the bar high for any future air bnbs I may make. Thanks again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Lucas beautiful cabin may be one of the most peaceful air bnb’s we have stayed at by far! I’m sad that we one stayed one night but we will definitely be back for a weekend stay in the future.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing place to spend me and my wife’s anniversary it was very special. what they did for us made everything feel very special and felt just like home we loved the views and it was an overall great experience

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed our stay. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to enjoy all that was offered but the place was beautiful
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Beautiful place. The view is amazing. Definitely saving this place for next time.
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,This place is for those who need peace of mind for a while. It is located on the edge of a quarry which felt like in movies for me; everybody will get connected with the place either way or the other. Lucas was inspired by his childhood days living by the quarry which brought the idea of building a wooden house on a quarry to let him know what life is like in a quarry. I felt good for just one night with my folks which put a second thought of staying there for a little long.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,What an amazing place to stay. Beautiful view and very comfortable. Felt very at home and would absolutely recommend to anyone.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I booked Little House on the Quarry as an anniversary get away! It was perfect! Peaceful! Private! Beautiful view! It was exactly as described, and a perfect getaway! We will definitely be returning. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This little cabin is sitting on the most beautiful property ever. It’s peaceful and scenic. You cannot put a price on the views and memories that this place provided.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A beautiful space for a relaxing weekend and cherished memories made!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Booked this cabin for our honeymoon! We could not have asked for a better place!

Highly recommend visiting this cabin and area! We can’t wait to come back!"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family came to town for a wedding but got an awesome family weekend. We enjoyed the beautiful view, the hot tub, the peaceful surroundings, and that our dog was able to be with us. Little House on the Quarry has everything you could think of and then some extras. I appreciated the extra towels and a good stock of paper towels, coffee, creamer, etc. We will definitely come back just to relax next time!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place beautiful view

The hot tub is lovely with a great view, beds are comfortable, there are three smart TVs! Bring a fire starter for the fire pit."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! Beautiful place

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved our time spent at the cabin. Perfect for us and our pups. We will be back
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,It was a very peaceful and beautiful place we loved it especially the quarry! it was clean and could see to the bottom. the cabin had lots to do around the place! the only thing was the neighbors next to the place worked outside cutting trees down and played loud music and party. we aslo loved the Amish market that was 3 mins away! and the beautiful drive around the place! check in was very easy and so was check out!
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,it was a great time!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you think the pictures are breathtaking, wait until you actually see the place in person. Can’t wait to return with the whole family."

House on the Quarry. Loved the quarry and hot tub. ❤️ the lost sea adventure, ruby falls, and Rock city were super fun!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved the cabin! I’m already planning another trip out there. This place is great to get away for a couple, family, or friends. The water is amazingly beautiful. The beds are very comfortable. Local food options are limited, but it’s very much worth it for the view."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Little House on the Quarry is absolutely perfect. Lucas’s attention to detail is both pristine and welcoming. From the clean inviting smell when you walk in, to the cookie jar full of oatmeal cream pies. The beds were comfortable and the linens/blankets soft. Pictures do not do this property justice. The rock quarry is incredibly beautiful. The cabin is delightfully rustic with everything you could need. We loved exploring the water and relaxing in the hot tub. Lucas quickly responded to all our questions and needs. I can’t wait to share this beautiful place with friends and family. We cannot wait to come back. Thank you Lucas!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, relaxing stay! We had a wonderful time."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This home is amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a nice & relaxing get away.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful cabin super clean. The cabin has a few games for the kids to do, plus the lake is gorgeous, great for swimming and fishing my kids had something to do all the time and connect with nature and disconnect from social media I recommend this place a 100% if you want to disconnect from the city life."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and peaceful place for a nice getaway would definitely recommend and plan on visiting again
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time at this house on the quarry. The house was very clean, clutter free and thankfully no carpet. I always check for dust and dirt under and around beds and there was none. Also, we appreciated the beds having mattress covers for extra cleanliness. (though zippered are best). The quarry was beautiful and the paddle boat and floating dock helped us to enjoy it. Also, it was nice to have cut wood for the fire pit. We had a total of six persons and as mentioned in other reviews, it would have been helpful to have some nicer kitchen pots and utensils for cooking. Also, we had to pick up a card table for us to all sit together when eating. 4 boys shared the loft and my husband and I had the downstairs bedroom. The sleeping arrangements and one bathroom worked for us, although it might have been tight if there was another couple instead of our crew of boys. It is a beautiful private location and we definitely recommend this place."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Had a fun experience with this cabin and the quarry. The quarry is beautiful and the hot tub and fire pit at the cabin make for a unique and fun stay. Gotta recommend a few days here! 😊

The hot tub was much appreciated after a 13 hour drive! Thank you for a perfect weekend!

The experience provided everything on our list with a pet friendly cabin, beautiful water view and a hot tub. Plenty to do within minutes of the location. We were able to explore the Mayfield Dairy, Swift Airplane Museum and the County History Museum while still having time to disconnect. The host provided great amenities where all we had to bring was enough food for a few meals. Definitely on the list to revisit in the future."

Lucas was very friendly and easily accessible, although we really didn’t need to contact him. I would definitely recommend this gem."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place was easy to find with Lucas’s instructions. Beautiful quaint log home, fire pit with wood available hot tub facing a quarry. Built a fire in the fire pit quickly set the tone for a wonderful anniversary weekend. Thanks Lucas."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, photos do not do this place justice. It was stunning! The quarry has a waterfall offering the most peaceful ambiance to match the view. Plenty of firewood and charcoal were provided for nightly fireside dinners and s’mores. Our pup also loved the place getting to work his sniffer out in nature. We took a drive out to Bald River Falls to hike and also walked the Eureka Trail. The little shops in town were also super cute and we got some Christmas shopping done! Lucas was very quick to respond and was so kind! 10/10 would stay here again (we’re already trying to plan for it!)"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We cannot wait to go back and visit again. We loved our stay and loved the location. Worth every penny.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cute rental convenient to the town of Athens. We loved the views, the beautiful Fall leaves, and Quarry. Bed downstairs was so comfy as there’s nothing worse then a bad bed on vacation so put that worry behind you.

Enjoyed this place, we sure did! We will be back!"

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a peaceful getaway in a Tennessee cabin away from everything but woods and wildlife this is the place to be. From fishing, swimming and boating on the quarry to relaxing in the hot tub, Lucas's place is where you need to go. My wife and I will definitely be staying there again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The quarry is beautiful! We loved everything about the stay except for the beetles and bugs (apparently it is buggy everywhere in Athens in the fall!) the dog park in town is great.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Exceeded expectations. So clean we thought it was just built! The stars at night, sound of the waterfall from the back porch with the view of the quarry were all spectacular. Details like marshmallows for the fire pit, popcorn and hot chocolate all very thoughtful and welcoming. Plenty of bedding and super comfy pillows and bedding. Lots of nice towels and hot water. Hope to stay again soon as we have family in the area. Looking forward to exploring more of the town and local attractions."

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family had a great time at the quarry house and would not hesitate to book again. We didn’t spend much time exploring the quarry, but it was a great backdrop for grilling out and having a fire. The fireflies put on a show both nights."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about this place is amazing! We had such a great time! The place is very clean. It was a little tricky finding the place through the phones GPS. We eventually found it just keep driving straight until you see the mailboxes. The quarry was beautiful! It was so fun swimming and paddling. I wish the dock was permanent/steady. It’s a little scary at first. Nonetheless we had a great time! I felt comfortable letting my dog swim at the quarry because the water was so clear! I recommend going to Bald River Falls & Gatlinburg skylift/skytrail. We were able to take the dogs to both places and everyone was so kind! :) Highly recommend this place!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Literally can not recommend this place enough! We had absolutely zero complaints. The place was beautiful, the scenery was amazing, everything was clean, the host responded in a timely manner and was very polite. We will be returning!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a beautiful cabin, with a beautiful view! It was cozy, very clean, and we enjoyed the sweet treats that were left upon arrival. The fishing was great, weather was perfect, and taking the pedal boat out on the lake was fun. Unhooking the dock and taking it out was an extra treat, we fished the entire quarry! There’s a great fire pit and plenty of wood for a nice evening fire and making s’mores. We look forward to going back!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! We will definitely come back again. We didn't want to leave. The house was immaculate when we arrived. The view was spectacular. The picture I took are breath taking. The quarry was an perfection. We went to the lost sea for a short outing and I highly recommend.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed. Host was helpful with any questions. We enjoyed the paddle boat and were able to catch some fish with some bread. Would recommend this place to anyone.

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This charming place has everything you need for a great stay; from gorgeous views inside and out (pictures really don’t do it justice), to a relaxing hot tub, and cozy beds… They had everything we needed to make our own meals and feel right at home. We went to the farm market in Englewood for fresh local produce, and had breakfast at Tellico Junction Cafe on our last morning in town. I recommend both! We also made a few stops in Sweetwater (Hunter’s Bakery & Cafe was delicious and had outdoor seating to accommodate our dog), went to Mayfield Dairy in Athens, and of course took a day to go to the Great Smoky Mountains. This place is a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of daily life - so quiet and peaceful. We could not have asked for a better vacation for us and our dog! She loved swimming in the quarry as much as we did (probably more!). The hosts were great at communicating and were quick to respond to any questions we had. We also liked the keyless entry so we didn’t have to worry about keeping track of a house key. Highly recommend!!"
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"Awesome cabin in a quiet area. The arcade in the house has thousands of games, but I found myself playing Mario Kart the most. The quarry water is unbelievable. Super clear water with some fish to look at around the dock. There is an Amish Farmers Market less than a 5 minute drive down the road which was great. We picked up some fresh fruits to eat down at the water. Place is kept very clean with lots of towels for the guests, which seems to be an oversight on so many other AirBnb we’ve stayed in. We would definitely stay again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place was amazing very beautiful view, short drive to the town. It wasn’t a problem for us, however the one thing is if you are older are less mobile then the average person it might be difficult to get down to the dock as it is so steep with dirty and rocks. Besides it was a very beautiful and very accurate. We really enjoyed our stay."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Cabin and quarry are absolutely beautiful. Host replies instantly. loved My time here 10/10 recommend staying here

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My partner and I had a great time in the cabin, we were able to escape the loud noises of Chicago and just unwind. We had fun down by the quarry, in the hot tub and also playing the many games they offered. NOTE: watch out for the momma birdie, she built a nest on the front door welcome decoration! We were very cautious when coming in and out as to not scare her. 10/10 will be back soon!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for a quick weekend getaway and this was absolutely perfect! The cabin was absolutely spotless when we arrived, there were plenty of towels for showering, linens on the beds were clean, and there were some snacks on the counter for us! The view is absolutely breathtaking, porch and hot tub were perfect for relaxing, and it was very quiet and peaceful which is exactly what we wanted!

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures are just a touch of how breathtaking the view and experience really is! You have to experience this hidden gem for yourself! It was relaxing, peaceful, beautiful and an amazing trip. We had two families and there was enough places to sleep and even on rainy days you can still experience the hot tub and the game system inside! Athens park only 10 minutes down the road also gave us a moment to get the kids out the cabin and they have a free splash pad experience along with the park!! Mayfield ice cream was right down the road and this gave us a chance to have the best ice cream in town! A perfect getaway!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend staying here! Just had a great 3 night stay at Little House on the Quarry. The view is spectacular. We basically stayed in the hot tub, but made use of the paddle boat and fire pit as well. We had such a nice and relaxing time! Place was very clean, checkin was easy, and the host is quick to respond 😊"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved the Little House on the Quarry. It’s a really unique and special place. The cabin has everything you need for your stay. The hot tub is wonderful after a long day. Plenty to do within an hour of the cabin - go into the Chattanooga or Knoxville or many fun hiking trails nearby. The raft is a really nice bonus to be able to experience the quarry. We already cannot wait to go back!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this cabin! The fishing was great; the swimming was wonderful in the clean quarry water. The inside was spotless.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Stayed here for a week. Cabin was very clean and had everything it needed. I was very pleasantly surprised at the amount of clean towels my girlfriend and I found in the closet considering we were staying for a week. The quarry and surrounding area was beautiful as well. There is a large wooden raft that allows you to traverse the quarry in a peaceful, easy, and enjoyable way. Lots of firewood for a bonfire was provided at no additional cost which was amazing as we were able to have a large and long lasting fire 6 nights in a row. Will most definitely be coming back."

The only issue was, since we came in the winter and there were no leaves on the trees, the privacy wasn't great. Would really like to come back in the summer or early fall! Lucas was very quick to respond to any questions we had!"
