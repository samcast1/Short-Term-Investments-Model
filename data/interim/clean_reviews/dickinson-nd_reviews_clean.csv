2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, clean, comfortable, had everything you could need to cook, eat, drink for a large gathering. The dining room table was amazing. So nice to have a table that fit the number of people the house can hold. Zero complaints or problems which is rather unusual for a rental. Cookware and knives were in good shape/sharp. The pool table was a BIG hit. Definitely worth the drive."

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Whitney is an excellent host and her home is immaculate. We appreciated all of her little touches along with a terrific kitchen and lots of space.
We chose Whitney’s place as a stepping off point for the North and South Units of Teddy Roosevelt NP. We could not have been happier with our choice.
A big thanks to Whitney for making us feel so welcome. This is our first family trip since COVID. Having such a cozy and comfortable spot to share made all the difference.
Loved the hot tub, dining area, ample sleep space, and neighborhood. Felt like a local right away.
I would highly recommend staying here for anyone looking to enjoy the Dakotas.
Thanks again, Whitney!

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Whitney’s place was beautiful, extremely clean, comfortable, and just simply lovely. We wished we had booked it for longer! Don’t hesitate to stay here."
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Although small house the space was very efficiently used. 7 of us family were very comfortable and Whitney was very responsive to any questions. Enjoyed the hot tub which was convenient to the roomy back deck.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home near Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We had a group of 4 adults and 2 teenagers. The house worked out great. One bedroom upstairs and 2 downstairs with a flex space downstairs that is set up as a 4th bedroom (no door but tucked around a corner downstairs so its still private) A full bathroom was located on each floor. The house is like a brand new house inside updated with Beautiful finishes. Seating for 6 in the open concept dining area. Nice deck and grill in backyard with a hot tub. The kitchen was well equipped and easy to cook meals if you wish. Near restaurants and grocery stores. Whitney was very responsive and helpful. Would highly recommend booking here. It is a great house!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place, would stay again. Whitney was responsive and accommodating of our late checkout times."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Whitney’s place was the absolute perfect spot for traveling around the area. Quick drive to Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Great, safe, and comfortable place to come back to after a long day of hiking. The hot tub was a lovely touch and the spaciousness was exactly what we were looking for. If this place is available, don’t bother looking elsewhere- book it right away! Hoping to come back some day. Thanks so much for hosting!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Whitney’s house is in a very quiet neighborhood and is cute and comfortable. It is one of the cleanest airbnbs I have stayed in.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Whitney was super accommodating and helpful We we’re in the process of driving across the country, as it appears are many of the guests, and you will not find a comparable accommodation anywhere near in this area. The house was newly renovated, stylish and very clean. Would absolutely recommend"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,A very nice small house with a very comfortable bed. I only stayed two nights and it rained the entire time so I can’t speak to the outdoor aspects of her home. I spent my time at the Theodore Roosevelt National Park.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a wonderful stay at this cute little airbnb. It was decorated for Christmas and very festive!

The place was very clean and Whitney is extremely responsive and flexible."

If you are considering staying at Whitney's home, do it!"

Loved watching the lightening and hearing the thunder with the storm that rolled through. I would definitely stay here again if available. Thank you Whitney for being such a gracious host!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place for visiting TR National Park. The house is about 30 mins from the South Unit and about 1 hr from the North Unit. The property has very easy access, it is clean with plenty of space, and a Walmart less than 10 mins away for groceries. Overall, a great place for families."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"BEST AIR BNB EXPERIENCE TO DATE!
I’ve stayed in at least 40 house rentals over the last 10 years and I have to say that Whitney’s Dickinson house is my best experience yet. Maybe it was the cozy bed, or the nice trendy kitchen and home decor, or the sweet back yard patio and hot tub, or the AC pumping in the house on the hot days, or maybe it was Whitneys above and beyond kindness and generosity. Who am I kidding, it was all of it! If you’re thinking about staying here, don’t hesitate, book it now!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very clean place, nice back-yard, and great location for proximity to National Park and Dinosaur Museum. Highly recommend."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nicely decorated home. We were very comfortable here and appreciated having a washer and dryer to use. And the hot tub was dreamy!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely house and great location. Her basement flooded during the crazy Spring snow storms and resulting flooding. The bed rooms are in the basement. She was able to accommodate us despite the issues. We were three adults and all had separate beds. There is a lovely deck with a grill which we used one night and also a hot tub which we did not use. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you could need if you wish to cook. The repairs to the basement are almost complete so would highly recommend this location!! Great host!!!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Clean, comfortable Airbnb with a hot tub! Was a nice place for my family and pets to stay and the host was easy to communicate with."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Whitney’s place was the perfect resting place after a long day of traveling. Her commitment to comfort and detail was more than apparent throughout our stay. The space is comfortable as well as charming. The perfect home away from home experience.

2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Whitney's place was very clean and cozy, a great place to stay while we were visiting Medora and the Theodore Roosevelt State Park. The bed situation was a different than the listing described - there was only one queen and one full, instead of two queens. I'd definitely stay here again if I had a smaller group!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is very pretty and cozy we enjoyed grilling and sitting in hot tub the host is very personal with giving you info to house will definitely recommend this home
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Whitney was great to work with. My brother and sister and I had to come into town on very short notice due to a death in the family. She worked out everything with only a days notice.
The home is very comfortable and clean. There is lots of room to hang out. We used the grill on the back deck but rain forced us to dine on the giant dining room table.
One thing to note. The location is advertised as a three bedroom to accommodate 6 people. The upstairs bedroom is beautiful, with a nice queen bed. One room downstairs has a very comfortable full sized bed. The third bedroom has a thin, full sized air mattress. This is my first time using Airbnb. I am fairly laid back, but i thought this was something people deserved to be aware of.
Overall, the experience was great."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place! Super clean with much attention to detail. Had everything we needed and very comfortable!
The back porch with the grill and hot tub were perfect for relaxing! Very close drive to Medora and Theodore Roosevelt Park."

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This property is nicely located about 30 minutes from TR park! The host is very helpful and communicative. She is able to answer all your questions and inquiries. She also gives amazing recommendations for the area. I recommend you stay here!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Dwell was a very pleasant surprise. Great accommodations, great host, and within walking distance to the local watering hole. My group and I plan on making this an annual stay for hunting season."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It says on the listing that Michelle is a Superhost, and in our experience that description is very accurate. She was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. The place was clean, inviting, restful and relaxing. The beds were super comfortable! We enjoyed being able to cook a simple supper there. This was our first time to book a stay through Airbnb and Michelle made it a very positive experience!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay!
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,All went well with our stay. Mott is a very quiet town. The river is quite peaceful
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great out of the way retreat.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A neat little cottage and a friendly host!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay. House was great. Mott was great.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our time at the Cannonball Cottage and will book again when in Mott.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were looking for a quiet peaceful place to read and relax. The cottage was super cute and clean. The view was was very beautiful and calming.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"For a weekend get away from it all, Cannonball Cottage is the place. Secluded and peaceful, the cottage is this and more. Plenty of hot water and great water pressure. Well stocked kitchen and love love the gas stove."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lauren's house was charming and the decor was very unique and like the photos. We enjoyed the peaceful location with beautiful sunsets from the porch. Plenty of bird watching also. Lauren was helpful and flexible as a host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great little place! We stayed for one night. It is just as listed!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great little cottage to be able to relax and enjoy my trip. Wonderful place and great people, excellent response prior to my visit."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a very unique location. Vast prairie landscape, wide open spaces and quite pastoral indeed. The river running alongside the cottage was a nice touch. As was the charming small town. Not a place we would normally get the opportunity to experience.
The cottage was everything we needed. The highlight is the porch for enjoying coffee and/or cocktails looking out at the landscape."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very fun and colorful house with a fun theme for an old house. Cozy with good shower and hot water. Lots of kitchen supplies.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, peaceful Airbnb! Loved all the character on the inside and outside, and watching the sunset on the porch. Grateful to have found this unique spot for a night!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Always a great place to stay. Beautiful area and a great house. Hope to be back!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved Cannonball Cottage! It is PERFECT!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful view from this lovely cottage in Mott!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Third time here, so charming and peaceful can’t wait to come back!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Cute little farmhouse very close to Mott. The firepit was ready and sitting out on the back deck was so relaxing. The river is down a very steep bank so accessing it was not possible. We were able to find some fishing spots close by so it worked out fine. There are a few neighbors but everyone was super friendly and we stayed over the 4th of July and got a great fireworks show.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lauren was very accommodating. thanks for a wonderful stay.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our second visit, the first was two summers ago. The central a/c is tremendous upgrade over the portable in-window unit. This was a 3 senior guys mini vacation to see Teddy Roosvelt Nation park. Lauren has lots of local information available. We would highly recommend the ""Cannonball Cottage"" for a group of 3-4. The local grocery had good stocking and the Pheasant Caafe has tasty food. We cooked several meals, and the kitchen pantry is well stocked."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed at the Cannonball Cottage while attending a seminar about a mile away. Since it was just my husband, myself, and our dogs, it worked out well. The only true bedroom had a double/full sized bed and a single bed. The second room with another single also had the shower and you had to walk through this room to get to the toilet and sink.
I thought if you are staying with your children or close family, this would work out okay. If you are staying with friends, make sure everyone understands the sleeping logistics to alleviate any uncomfortableness that might arise.
The only other thing to note was the very steep drop off to the river. I am not sure the pictures accurately depict this hill. If you have small children or dogs, this may be an issue.
Pros: Easy to find; all the comforts of home; comfortable sitting room; modern stove and fridge; fantastic, responsive host.
Cons: Steep drop off to river; bedroom/shower placement.
In short, a great place and would stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This riverside cottage is very cute and comfortable. It's an old house that has been updated by someone very artistic. Bright colors, cute art, and everything we needed for a couple of peaceful days. No TV was not an issue for us at all. I would recommend driving to Lemmon for dinner at R Bar. The local cafe was disappointing, to say the very least. The cottage is located out of town, with the Cannonball River meandering within a stones throw. Comfortable beds, plenty of linens, spices for cooking & a Keurig. This place is perfect for those who avoid the dreary, antiseptic feeling of hotel rooms."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lauren's home was perfect. It is surrounded by beautiful scenery. The home was very clean and comfortable. Such a great and quiet location and I slept great! Wonderful communication and fast responses from Lauren. I loved the place!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful, peaceful, cozy and perfect. Quick stop on our long drive from San Diego, California to Ontario, Canada, it was exactly what we needed. The cottage is comfortable, warm and inviting, secluded and quaint. All you need for a little getaway. Watching the sun set from the back porch was the icing on the cake! Beds were so comfortable, with soft linens and plenty of blankets.
Well equipped kitchen and bath with all of the necessities, including plenty of towels! The art work adds a nice touch, especially the painting of the women on the back porch of this very cottage!
Would highly recommend Lauren’s cannonball cottage and would love to come back and stay longer!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Quiet location. It was very muddy outside ( I know the host had no control over it) just to give you a heads up. The house is small and cozy it was nice and warm inside with the cold weather and snow outside. One other thing to note is there is no tv but really good WiFi.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This worked out great and met our needs for a 1 night stay.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place in Mott.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We truly enjoyed our stay at the Cannonball Inn. The accommodations were spot on and the sunset views were stunning. We took advantage of the perfectly positioned fire pit each night and enjoyed relaxing on the covered porch.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Cannonball Cottage was exactly as I hoped for. Great place for downtime and decompression. Quiet and comfortable with all the necessities. Having no TV was spectacular but WiFi was always there if I needed it. The river is perfectly serene and feet from the back porch, a terrific foreground for some amazing sunsets. Pheasants and deer nightly visitors just other side of the river. Nice breeze always blowing, only turned the a/c on one time. Beds were comfortable and linens/towels plentiful. Fridge get's full so bring a cooler if you have lots of cold drinks. Will definitely stay again if ever near Mott."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming cottage with a view overlooking the Cannonball River and the rolling fields of southern North Dakota.

The old farm house was SO charming! The colorful decor is adorable and inviting, the vintage furniture is well cared for and surprisingly comfortable.
The view off the back porch is stunning- my only complaint is the mosquitoes outside, but what can you expect near a river in the summer?"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great farm feeling right on the river. we loved sitting in the porch in the evening and watching the sun set and the weather you could see from miles away.

The sunsets over the river and the farm fields are just glorious. This time, we enjoyed seeing a nest full of baby Robins on the back porch fledge and take their first flight. It was a wonderful place to rest in the midst of a long cross-country road trip. We would definitely come back again."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lauren's Cottage on the Cannonball has been on my saved list for a few years. It worked well in a quick trip from Fargo to drive Teddy Roosevelt National Park. We are two grumpy old guys that travel with two adorable Shetland sheepdogs, Logan, 14 and Cullen 3. The bright colors and multiple pattern materials did not offend our masculine sensibilities. I was pleasantly surprised that the cottage was larger than I expected, especially the two separate sleeping areas. We experienced a beautiful sunset and photos of it and the cottage that I featured on Facebook that got a ton of likes and positive comments. I see lots of reviews of Airbnb places that say, We can't wait to come back"" and wonder how many ever do. We have never stayed in the same place twice in 42 years of traveling together. But I think Cannonball Cottage just might change that. I would not hesitate to recommend the cottage to couples or small families. Lauren has provided tons of local information, great reading material and a few family friendly games. Lauren is point on about directions, Apple Maps, Google, Waze, and my Garmin GPS all sent us south on the road not north. Thanks Lauren for making it possible for us to get a small taste of CANNONBALL COTTAGE."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a fun and quirky place in a beautiful, peaceful spot! We loved our stay, and felt like we had stepped into 1955 the moment we entered the house. Absolutely stunning backdrop agains the river and rolling farm fields. We loved watching the sunset and listening to the red winged black birds talking to one another. Had a fun game of scrabble in the little parlor while watching the sun set over the fields. Great out-of-the-way spot for some relaxation and vintage fun!"

If I ever find myself in North Dakota I would definitely stay again! :)"
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The cabin is quaint and in a quiet location. It was clean and the host was responsive. We had a bit of trouble finding it but that was due to my gps getting confused. We stayed on a cross country road trip and it was a welcomed quiet spot to stop after driving all day.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The most beautifully peaceful place to clear your mind or enjoy the wonders of slowing down for some time. The deck is perfect for watching the sun set with a glass of wine or watching the birds land in the river in the morning.

It’s lovingly restored with thoughtful decor and the sunset was beautiful from the back porch. Would definitely stay here again when passing through North Dakota."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My mom and I stayed for a night as a resting place on a road trip west. Was a great place to rest our heads, sunset views and river were gorgeous. Very remote, but assuming anyone who knows the area knows that."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lauren’s place is cute and quirky. She is a wonderful and responsive host. The pictures are accurate. There was enough space for my family of four to sleep and sit down for meals. There is one bed in the shower area, but that wasn’t a huge deal. We just made sure everyone showered before my daughter went to bed for the evening. The place was very close to the Enchanted Highway, which my daughters enjoyed so much we drove it twice. We were also able to drive over and explore Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The view from the porch is just beautiful. I could’ve sat out there for hours in the morning and at sunset looking at the scenery. We didn’t explore too much in Mott or Regent because this was just a quick stopover."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a very cool place to stay. The house decor is bold and fun, and the inside is comfortable and clean. It was the perfect low-tech spot for a quick overnight stay for us on our way up to Canada. We didn’t get a chance to enjoy the fire pit because we got in so late, but we did like the view in the morning of the river from the wraparound deck. There were two twin beds and one queen bed."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely little place, be aware the shower is in a bedroom, but the views are unbeatable. Great space to chill and call home base."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This little cottage was so cute! We loved the home-y uniqueness that it had. The outside space was great. We really enjoyed our stay and would love to return in the future.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cottage is adorable and we were endlessly entertained by the quirky spaces in the house. The house was clean, cozy, and well appointed. One small thing for those traveling with little kids, and this is not in any way a knock on the house, but I didn’t notice how steep the dropoff is to the creek from the pictures. It’s gorgeous and wonderful for the sunset, but I had to keep an extra close eye on my kids to make sure we didn’t leave there as a family of 3 instead of 4. Great communication and easy check in and check out!"
2020-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Definitely an eclectic place. Appreciated the timely communications from host. A nice spot close to the Enchanted Highway in North Dakota.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful river bank location with great views. A great stay with easy check in and communication
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,a lovely place to stop! thank you!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a fantastic place! We were passing through and I wish that we could have spent several days. It was glorious to wake up and enjoy a cup of coffee on the porch and watch the red-wing black birds and a robin attending to its nest. We had the most spectacular thunder storm that was amazing to watch. The place was comfortable and had everything we needed. It is very cutely decorated. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you!!!!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely little place and wonderful host!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic experience if you’re looking to get away for a bit! Cute place with lots of character and charm. Very attentive hostess. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful! The cottage has character and an awesome view of mother nature at its best! Deer, fish, muskrats, birds etc. Bonfire to enjoy and a covered deck to stay out of any weather."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We just had an amazing weekend at Cannonball Cottage. The cottage is adorable- decorated in lots of fun colors with so many unique touches. There were plenty of pots and pans and such to cook something easily. The beds were comfortable and cozy. The view from the back porch can’t be beat. Thank you for a wonderful weekend
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great, small place with a great view of the Cannonball River from the porch"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved Lauren's place. The house was wonderful with amazing touches which makes you feel the ease and peace of a simpler time. I love the view of the river and would recommend her place.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Be prepared to step back in time!Very unique cottage with beautiful sunsets. It has everything you need to be comfortable. Lauren was very responsive and gave clear instructions.
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quick responses, easy check in, clean place and beautiful scenery"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren’s cottage is a perfect sanctuary for two. We stayed during the days of COVID-19 as part of a birthday trip for my partner. The full kitchen allowed us to cook without worrying about finding takeout every (actually any) night. If you grew up on the Midwest or Great Plains something in there will remind you of your childhood or something passed down in your family.
Mott seemed like a cute little town that circumstances prevented us from really exploring. We did check out Theodore Roosevelt National Park for hiking, the Enchanted Highway for a lovely drive, and Salem Sue for the perfect amount of kitsch.
Our trip back included talking about when we might stay there again and where we might find sum in at places to stay on trips to other regions. I’d recommend that anyone stay at the Cannonball Cottage."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is going to be a long read! For anyone looking for a truly unique stay or even just a convenient one, I promise it is worth the read. Someone had posted a negative review that almost made me walk away from this listing. And that would have been our loss! This place is amazing!!! A cute cottage on the end of town, with a wrap around porch on 3 sides, and very close to the water. To say that this cottage and her host are accommodating does NOT do justice to every little thing that has been done to insure a fantastic experience. The beds, linens, and pillows, so cozy, so fresh, and crazy comfortable... Pssst...there are duvets and down pillows, and down alternative pillows. The kitchen is a delight! To hang out in and cook. Lauren has thought out every detail and gone so far above and beyond! The living room is colorful, comfortable, and cozy. Quaint, Cozy, Unique, Colorful (in a good way), and the views from the porch? I don't have a word for it as it is beyond beautiful... This place is like one big hug, sparkling clean, everything you need and more, and it is fun and relaxing. Absolutely worth every penny!!! There is a catfish of rather mythical proportions that showed itself twice. And how awesome is it that someone can shower while leaving the toilet and sink free in another room? This is glamping. If your grandmother was Martha Stewart before being Martha was cool, and had a cabin/ cottage, it would be the Cannonball Cottage. Lauren is an AWESOME host with great communication! This cottage is EVERYTHING Airbnb was designed and intended to be, on steroids."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cannonball Cottage is amazing. We really loved our stay there for 5 days! We will definitely be back. It had everything we could possibly want, and so peaceful."
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved our stay at the Cannonball Cottage. It was the perfect stop for our cross country road trip. Kitchen was perfect and the wrap around porch was a nice break from driving. Thanks!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is just lovely. It’s peaceful and relaxing and very comfortable. It’s the perfect place to go when all you want to do is relax. If I’m ever back that way, I’m booking it again!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Such a relaxing and peaceful escape from the chaos! We loved the fire pit and the deck overlooking the river. Wish we could have stayed longer. Thanks for sharing your little slice of paradise!
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a great place! So clean and a blast from the past! Wonderful view of the Cannonball river and an awesome porch we sat on and enjoyed a cup of coffee! Highly recommend!
2020-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cozy place with a neat collection of modern furniture and one-of-a-kind art. Very clean. Happy we stayed here.
2020-04-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"No privacy, sheers only on window both outside and inside home, including bedroom and bathroom. One bed is in the shower area which is really in a common area between the kitchen and the bedroom. Home is very dated, and lacking many comforts of home. Home is in a very agricultural/industrial area.
Rustic is ok this was run down, NO PRIVACY and poorly appointed. Very small, bathroom was just strange. The toilet and sink were together in a small space which only had very sheer and completely see-through window treatment and an interior window which had a twin bed directly outside it. That twin bed was in a common area which is where the shower was located, again no privacy!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very unique place, you feel lime you have been transported back to 1920’s - but with some modern amenities! The view is fantastic. No WiFi - perfect to unplug. The decorations were thoughtful, and the house has been restored with great care. It was very different but very pleasant."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lauren was easy to get a hold of, check-in was a breeze. The house is very clean."
2019-12-01,4.0,Stayed one night,What a special place! Definitely pleasantly surprised.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly as described. The cottage is a whimsical, mermaid paradise in North Dakota! We experienced all the hygge. So cozy! We would love to come back! If you plan on having coffee, bring your own cream and sugar. Also, Mott is a very small, rural town and there really isn’t anywhere to get groceries so plan ahead. There’s a gas station, but that was the only place open."
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Cannonball Cottage is a perfect place to stay when hunting around Mott. It's close to town but in a quiet area with a good view. The house was nicely equipped and Lauren was an excellent host.
2019-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space for two guest.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Cannonball Cottage. My husband and I were pheasant hunting PLOTS and public land near Mott so location was great. A bright, cozy stay in the middle of sub-zero temperatures :-)."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simple, clean and worked perfect for our stay."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome views, great place to stay for a long weekend."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED this sweet cottage. It’s right on the Cannonball River with lovely views stretching forever of river and rural farmland. No traffic on the road and unbelievably quiet. Lauren also kindly helped us connect with a very knowledgeable local resource for my husband’s photography quests. Very special visit, we will return."
2019-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a beautifully situated cabin. There are incredible views of Cannonball river. If you're in the area, it's definitely a unique place."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"One word, Home. The cottage is beautiful and clean. The vintage touches made it feel cozy and inviting. It was peaceful to get away from the noises of the city and indulge in a good book. We wished we spent a few more nights here!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Interesting place off the beaten path to stay
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I really loved this little cabin. We got there late so it was dark and quite the wind storm was blowing through but after the wind died down and we were able to sit on the porch, it was very relaxing after a long day on road. We could see lightning on the horizon and stars overhead. The next morning we sat out with coffee and watched the river flow by and enjoyed the peace and quiet before we had to head back on the road. The views were lovely. I loved the way the cabin was decorated and it was very clean with all the amenities although a coffee pot is all I need! I would love to stay here again if I ever come through this area again."
2019-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Lauren was easy going and helpful. Rustic cottage that met my needs.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lauren's place is quiet and has a beautiful view of the sunset! We loved relaxing on the porch and playing a game of Scrabble (game courtesy of Lauren).
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute, super fun! Perfect pit stop for our cross country trip."
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Just like the pictures and the other reviews. Off the beaten path, but we all need that now and then."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"For a peaceful setting with an incredible view of prairie farm land, this is the spot in SW North Dakota. The accommodations were very nice and absolutely everything we needed for our stay was on site. This is a very unique cottage that is perfect for a romantic getaway or just a relaxing visit."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was so charming! The decor, color scheme, and furniture details were so cute! Pictures didn't do it justice. I can tell someone put a lot of thought and care into rehabbing the house. It had everything we needed and more. We enjoyed an amazing sunset on the back porch and were able to get out with our telescope. The sky was so full of stars! It's right by the river, so bring bug spray. We had no reception while we were there or for most of our very scenic drive in. Not a big deal for us, but something to be aware of. Overall, a really great spot. We loved our stay in the cottage!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very, very cute place. It’s super cozy and has a fantastic view of the sunset. There’s no WiFi, which was a little inconvenient at first, but ultimately made the stay even better. It can get a little hot, though, and there is a steep staircase that goes straight to a locked door that is nothing more than off-putting. The shower is in the same room as one bed, with the rest of the bathroom in that room. The nearest town goes to bed very, very early, but ultimately if you’re looking for an escape, this is the right place."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good location…close to Theodore Roosevelt Nat’l Park. Kyle was nice and welcoming. I loved the sound of the birds chipping.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Clean! At a campground.
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was clean and comfortable enough. Could use some kitchen towels in addition to one roll of paper towels. Wi Fi didn’t work. Password made connection but would not work on 2 different devices. My main issue is that I did not hear back from Kyle for 2 hours after calling to check in. Fortunately, the back door was inadvertently left unlocked so we let ourselves in after no response for about 30 minutes. Kyle explained that he was “ distracted” because he was managing catering for 1000. Might I suggest having someone else answer your campsite calls if you are doing something else that’s more important."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,For the area it's great. The beds could be more comfortable but it was great other than that.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Nice place

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Urja’s place was great. It was clean, easy to find, and comfortable. And Urja is a great host. Who always provided the information I needed usually even before I knew to ask. I recommend this Airbnb."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Urja was so great to us! We enjoyed her little dog, Bella, who was a blast to play with! One day I had some car troubles and Urja volunteered to give me a ride to my vehicle to pick it up after it got fixed! We would enjoy staying with her again, definitely!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Urja is such a lovely host (and her dog, Bella, is a fantastic co-host!) and her home is absolutely lovely. There are many thoughtful details throughout, and Urja did her utmost to make me feel welcome and at home.
The location is very convenient for access to Theodore Roosevelt National park (only a 30-minute drive to the South Unit entrance).
I highly recommend staying in this lovely home!"

Thank you!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Urja was communicative before arrival, responsive on the day of my pending arrival, and friendly upon my arrival. Her townhome is clean, comfortable. We chatted a bit that evening and a little the next morning before I departed, taking her suggestion for a good diner for breakfast. Thanks, Urja! Hoping you return to CS one day! ; )"

I had a very pleasant stay and a good rest."
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Urja's place is just as advertised - clean, quiet, comfy and in a good location. Communication was good, check-in was easy. Would also recommend Phat Fish Brewery, which is close by."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I stayed for a night with a friend, on a road trip, after we visited TRNP and on our way to Fargo. The room was extremely comfy, and Urja put out a luxurious high air mattress for me so that we could each have our own bed. Urja herself is lovely and helpful. Would absolutely stay again!"

The bed is very comfortable & I slept well. Her home is dog friendly with a fenced yard. I stayed with her twice… so far."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful spot, wonderful host. Would stay again! Definitely one of the better air bnb Experiences I’ve had"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place to stay overnight in Dickinson. Urja and her pup were friendly and made me feel right at home. Off-street parking was right by the front door, the area was very safe, the bed was comfortable, Wi-Fi was fast, and the bathroom was nicely appointed. I also really appreciated how close to the Enchanted Highway this place was. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Urja is a gracious hostess. Her home is fresh & clean. She includes thoughtful extras like scented toiletries & a bottle of water in your room. The bed is very comfortable. My dogs were so happy to play in the snow & run in the fenced back yard.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you so much for hosting us and for your gift of the pie, it was delicious! This is a great Airbnb to rent if you are planning on visiting Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We were about 20-25 minutes to the South Unit, (less than that to Painted Canyon), and about an hour from the North Unit. You're also quite close to gas and the main restaurant in town. We stayed quite warm despite the cold temps and snow outside. If you are someone who likes to cook / eat at home, be able to do laundry on your trip, this is the perfect place."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and comfortable place. Andrea was quick to respond and offered to help if we had any special needs.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andrea's place was very clean and comfortable. She communicated well and amenities were great. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,comfy place to stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The first thing that stood out when we opened the door was how fresh and clean it was. Andrea was super responsive with the couple of questions that we had. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience in a stay. I recommend this place 100%.
The town of Belfield is perfect as a base for going to Theodore Rosevelt NP as it is the exit for the North loop of the park and the south is an easy 20 min drive. Make sure you stop for groceries before you get here since Dollar General is it.
The only thing that we ran into was that restaurants that were supposed to be open in Belfield and in Medora were not. Just make sure you plan accordingly for dinner. This was only an issue because we were there after season. If you go in season, you shouldn’t have a problem."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, convenient location to visit both North and South units of the National Park. Very basic, bring your own water and shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc and earplugs for sleeping if wind whipping through the thin walls would keep you awake."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place with lots of elbow room. Having three bedrooms and two bathrooms was great, and a full size, well stocked kitchen was nice. Easy checkin/checkout with no hassles or problems. Great value."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a mobile home, but very well maintained, clean and comfortable. We felt safe and had everything we needed for our 3 night stay. The town of Belfield is currently not very vibrant, but the location is close to Medora, and there is plenty of restaurants and activities there. We visited both units of the Roosevelt National Park and this Air Bnb was very convenient to both locations. Andrea responded quickly to my difficulty figuring out how to access wifi, and all was well after that.
Recommend highly if planning to visit TRNP and Medora."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable. Plenty of space. Quiet and private. Great location for visiting Theodore Roosevelt NP.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The home was clean and comfortable with plenty of space for the three of us to enjoy both shared activities and privacy. It was a quick drive to Medora.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Miller Cabin is a very pretty, clean and comfortable rental! There is not a grocery store within 19 miles so come prepared or shop at the Dollar General! We loved that there was a washer and dryer! That was so helpful on our 12 days trip! We would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location for visiting both units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Clean, comfortable. spacious place was nice to come back to after long days exploring.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had everything we needed and was perfect to relax in after long days of driving and hiking. Andrea's place has a great location for access to both the north and south units of Teddy Roosevelt NP. It was clean, well provisioned, and seemed pretty new. I would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Belfield is a blue-collar town and this BNB is a blue-collar accommodation, which is exactly what I was expecting based on the pictures and the price I paid. The BNB is a double-wide mobile home. I've been in single-wide and double-wide mobile homes before but none as nice as this one. The place looks brand new on the inside and it was immaculate when we got there. And I couldn't believe how spacious it was inside. The floors were solid (no creaks or squeaks) and it felt like you were walking on a slab foundation. Great amenities. This place is a long way from home for me and my wife and I were on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation, so I don't think we'll be in the area again but if I find myself in Belfield again, I would definitely stay at this BNB!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Andrea was very responsive. Her place was easy to find and very spacious. The kitchen was very well stocked with the needed essentials. We enjoyed the fireworks that the neighbors sit off as our stay was the weekend leading up to the Fourth of July.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was perfect for the T. Roosevelt National Park. The town is small but a great steakhouse, and we even went to the community dinner in town. Andrea was very responsive."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect home base for our family while we explored Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Location is great for access to both South and North units, as well as access to Dickinson with wider variety of groceries and restaurants.
The floor plan was great for us, and the kitchen amenities were just what we needed for meal time.
Washer and dryer were lifesavers for us after long dusty hikes with kiddos!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, comfortable, and quiet with the perfect location to explore both the north and south units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had 3 1/2 days to wander both the TRNP’s. Such beauty and ruggedness. We saw the wild horses in the S and bison in the N. Plus, discovering Medora was a treat. Great shopping, friendly people and wonderful restaurants.
There is nothing we wanted for at Davis Creek Cabin. There were plenty of dishes, pots/pans, towels, clean linens and the views were extraordinary! The house was just “comfortable and inviting”. We lacked for nothing and our hosts were available whenever we had a question. Highly recommend this destination!!!!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We’ve been to Medora multiple times and this is by far our favorite place we’ve stayed! Short drive from town, the national park, and the musical. And nothing beats the view, peacefulness & the hominess the Davis creek cabin provided! We give it 5 stars from our age range of 19 months all the way up to age 63!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Davis Creek Ranch. A peaceful location with beautiful views and close to town. The cabin was cozy and we felt right at home!

Medora and the South Unit of TRNP were easily accessible, but it was so nice to feel away from the tourist spots and immersed in the Badlands scenery. The kitchen was very well equipped and the accommodations were very comfortable for our family of 6. Our boys loved checking out the animals on the property as well. I would recommend this cabin to anyone looking to explore TRNP and Medora!"

Thank you Roger for letting us stay and we hope to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is very homey and comfortable. The property is private yet close enough to town that we didn't need to drive a long ways to get to the things we wanted to see and do.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The setting of where the cabin is located makes you feel like you're in the Badlands!!! The scenery is unbelievable and so peaceful. You are on a working ranch.
10 min drive, give or take on back roads to Medora.
The western decorations give you that true Western experience.
I would definitely recommend this place.
Roger is an excellent host!!!!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful setting for a cabin and the cabin itself was beautiful! Very private location, but with a view of horses and cattle on the property and georgeous views of Theodore Roosevelt State Park.
The host responded so quickly; I barely had to send a message and had one back. House was spotless and well-equipped.
Ideal location for anyone wanting a relaxing vacation out of the way from tourists or road noise."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The photos didn’t do this cabin or location justice! The cabin was peaceful, cozy and very clean.

We have been to Medora several times now, and this has been by far our favorite place to stay at!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Perfect little cabin. The location is amazing. The cabin is comfortable and high quality. I highly recommend this space over anything in medora. Looking forward to staying again.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect spot to spend your time in the Badlands. A short drive south of Medora and you are living in the Badlands, not just visiting. Clean, well-appointed home that has something for everyone of all ages. Easy access in and out. We hope to return!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect location for this area. The cabin was comfortable and the host had everything you needed. The view was fantastic and the mother cows and calves were really playful in the morning. It was fun to watch them.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A perfectly perfect country stay! The house was immaculately clean, as described to the T, and amazingly quiet and peaceful.

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our family stayed here for four nights and we highly enjoyed it! The cabin had everything we needed and then some, plus the views were spectacular.

Definitely a great place to stay - thank you for sharing it with us!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Well furnished, spacious and well-stocked with amenities. The cabin was in in a beautiful setting. Our additional guests stated that they would like to come back. Roughly 20 minutes from Medora itself but a nice escape from the Summer tourists in town."

We would not hesitate to rent again and refer to others. Thank you Roger and Naomi for sharing your ranch and cabin.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place exceeded our expectations. 20 minutes from the park and Medora, but completely remote and relaxing. The place seems brand new and was as clean as any place I have stayed in. Roger is a great man, and we loved the 3 days spent there, couldn’t have asked for more. Our kids loved it, we loved it and it was exactly what we were hoping for."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay here was perfect! Would highly recommend and look forward to staying there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What an amazing location right outside of Medora! Only a few minutes out of town and feels like you’re in the middle of a National Park! The cabin was comfy and so functional for a family of 5 adults and 1 toddler. There were lots of toys, books, and all the supplies you might have forgotten! Highly recommend for your visit to Medora and/or Theodore Roosevelt National Park!! Thank you very much Roger!
P.S. the horses in the pasture around the cabin are kind and beautiful! Our toddler really fell in love with those horses!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When I arrived I remember calling Michelle afterward and telling her how great it smelled in the room I rented. Trust that this place is as beautiful as the pictures and extremely comfortable too.
Michelle's room has a kitchenette with coffee, mugs, creamer, and breakfast bars available!!
Location: unpaved parking lot. The building is right in front of a neighborhood that has about 700 residents in the entire town I believe!
Blackout curtains in sleeping area, self-controlled heating/cooling available but loud...kinda helps if you enjoy white noise."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful woman of GOD who is loving, caring, kind. She truly loves the LORD and loves to serve HIM."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy little room and bath not too far from the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. It is a little less than an hour to the Painted Canyon. A great option for the price. Michelle was a wonderful hostess, very friendly and attentive to our questions and comments. We appreciated the cleanliness of the space, as well as added touches like snacks, coffee, and water. We also appreciated the books about North Dakota and others made available in the room. For us, the trains going by (visible from the front windows) added to the peaceful country atmosphere. We felt very rested during our two-day stay at the Dwell."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Michelle’s place was perfect. It was about 40 minutes from Teddy Roosevelt NP for those looking to visit, and right off the highway and easy to find for those who are just stopping through. I loved the books she laid out for information, and the room was very cozy. Thinner walls, but that didn’t bother me, I could just hear snoring of the other visitor. No worries, because everything was exceptional. Coffee, snacks, books, recommendations, fresh linens, affordable and great host!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"if you're looking for a place in range of the Theo Roosevelt Natl Park in Medora, this is a great option.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The hunting lodge was a great place to stay for our family of 6 (with 4 kids). We loved the space, beautiful setup inside and outside, nice bedding, roomy kitchen and dining room. Entire family enjoyed a few rounds of playing pool/billiards downstairs. I liked the speedy Internet connection that was useful for remote work. Location is close to all local attractions but at the same time we appreciated privacy of the location. We recommend this lodge for any time of guests - families like ours and group getaways alike."
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,When we arrived the parking area was big enough for our vehicles. Access to the house was great. Coming into the Lodge is welcoming with lots of natural light. Wood work abounds with a rustic log cabin feel. Bedrooms were adequate with bathrooms and showers near by. Pool table was fun to play. Kitchen was big with a large table to seat many guests. Appliances were available for our needs.

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We would highly recommend this place to others! There is plenty of space and the bedrooms allowed all of us to have our own personal space.

We loved the location and all the amenities such as laundry area, griddle, well-stocked kitchen and plenty of towels. We had a great time!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Lodge was perfect for our crew of 8. We had plenty of comfortable spaces and completely enjoyed ourselves! We saw a doe with her brand new fawn on wobbly legs while we were sitting out on the deck...it was so cool!
I would advise against using g**gle maps to locate this place- we were very much taken off course! Carla was immediately responsive when we contacted her and was very helpful.
The sign at the bottom of the driveway does not say The Lodge- it says JJ Outfitters. This also was confusing- it all worked out in the end and we had a great time!! I absolutely recommend this rental!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,You have a beautiful home. The views were amazing! The home is very spacious and perfect for a large family. We would definitely stay again. Thank you for opening your home to our family!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,The spacious lodge allowed us to host many large family meals. We were able to cook together and make great-grandmother’s yeast rolls and pies. The kitchen is stocked with everything you need for cooking and serving for a large group. Most of us traveled over a thousand miles to be together and we felt right at home. The views are spectacular. I cannot imagine a more ideal arrangement!

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at The Ranch! Highly recommend. Main Pros: The home exceeded our expectations with great space for our larger group. The kitchen was well stocked and clean, and the big table/deck was good for meals. Loved the coffee station! Beautiful yard with petrified wood stumps/logs and trees. Nice to have access to washer/dryer when traveling with kids. Great natural light with big beautiful windows and a view to enjoy. Private quiet location. Minor Cons: had to be a bit creative with childproofing the 2 staircases for our youngest group members. Low water pressure in the showers. A few safety concerns but Carla was made aware and I am sure she’ll address them!
Overall I highly recommend this location. Close enough to do a day trip to Medora and explore the national park too. Good for families or a hunting group."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Best part of this place is the bed- Soooo comfortable!! Very cute decor & Brooke was wonderful to work with and very flexible with us when we were having truck issues. I also loved how she had dog dishes and a bed ready for our pup!

Brooke went above and beyond and even had a tree up for me since she knew I was staying over Christmas! She was very patient with me as I figured out the area too. For long or short stays I would highly recommend! It is a full house and has everything one would need. Lots of space! And the bed was very comfortable

We fell asleep fast woke up early and had to travel to our next destination. Was not able to enjoy anything else. Loraine was very helpful and answered all our questions. Nice place to visit."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the midst of an extended road trip and needed a few days to cook our own meals and do laundry. Loraine's place served this purpose well and at a reasonable price. We used all of the kitchen appliances and all worked well. The washer and dryer also worked perfectly.
Loraine met us on arrival and gave us a very thorough introduction to her place. She was available by phone at even very early hours.
We used one day to visit the north unit of TRNP and the other to visit the south unit. We also drove the Enchanted highway. Since we were coming from the east, we stopped in Bismarck to load up on groceries, as we were warned that Gladstone doesn't have any stores or services.
The hot water was a big finicky, but Loraine let us know she didn't mind us calling to reset the heater at any hour, even as early as 3am!
While we visited, temperatures were in the high 90's, but the basement apartment stayed very comfortable. Temperature was never an issue."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loraine & Mark were great hosts. We greatly appreciated the breakfast items that were left for us on our arrival. The property was very clean and the beds were comfortable. It is in a great location for visiting the Theodore Roosevelt NP and the surrounding area. The little town is very quiet and we had undisturbed sleep every night. We had everything we needed for our stay, and were also able to use the grill on the upstairs deck, which was very nice. Overall we enjoyed our stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a very nice guest suite, completely stocked, even with breakfast food since Gladstone has no food shopping. Such a great courtesy!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved staying at Loraine’s was just what we needed after a long day of travel as a family. Most everything was as originally described, though the basement didn’t have the portable fans as listed, which would have been nice in the August heat. Would stay here again though!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a long day on the road, it was great to be welcomed by her. She happily explained everything to us and gave us many ideas of how to spend our free time. Unlike other Airbnbs, she even had food for us for breakfast!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family was roadtripping and uncertain of a stopover destination until only a few hours before our stay - Loraine was incredibly responsive and accommodating to make last-minute arrangements for us and even stayed up late to give us the tour!

All possible needs are met, from some history of the area, to suggestions for dining out, and all one could need for prepping a meal - just stop by the grocery first and your set. Loraine is a wonderfully chatty host who enjoys a visit with her guests, My mom and I loved the small bit of time visiting with her. Very friendly - in a good kind of way. Rooms are beautifully done and cozy. Everything worked, kitchen appliances to TV and sauna. Ahh - that sauna! Feels so good after driving around all day and lugging photo equipment in and out of the car. If I'm ever that way again, I will be booking in Gladstone with Loraine and her hubby."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loraine was very kind and hospitable, even with our late check-in. The place was spotless and she even provided us with the basic necessities included milk, eggs, butter, and some bread!

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and super value.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It’s wonderful when I can happily rave about the excellence of an AirBnB stay! And especially when the hosts and property deserve their AirBnB Superhost designation.
Without hesitation I highly recommend this place to friends and relatives.
Comfortable, well appointed, extremely clean and peaceful. Thoughtful breakfast food and snacks in the spotless new fridge. Great kitchen setup with dishwasher. Coffee maker, tea, wide variety of cooking utensils made it easy to prepare a meal or two during our 3 night stay. In house Big screen tv, good internet, foosball and other entertainment round out the experience.
Spectacular view from the deck of the river and countryside. Deer and wild turkeys in the backyard. And my family really enjoyed their kayak adventures in Loraine’s kayaks from her dock.
Location is perfect: near enough to Teddy Roosevelt National Park for easy daily access. Far enough from Medora to escape the Park's teeming tourists. And, after a full day of sightseeing and hiking the fabulous Badlands in the Park, you can return to the BnB and visit North Dakota’s nearby Enchanted Highway -- a unique and often overwhelming series of multi-storied metal sculptures constructed over several miles. Great for photo ops and some relief from the day’s fabulous hikes in the Badlands.
Loraine and her husband are caring hosts who go far beyond expectations and well-deserve their AirBnB Superhost title. They’ve obviously put a great deal of thought and effort into creating and maintaining such a nice property. Quick responses to any of our questions, good recommendations for local sites and food.
My family agrees this stay and these hosts made for an unexpectedly delightful experience. I hope we can return for a longer stay.
Don’t miss this one!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,The place was great and Loraine was very friendly and welcoming! We loved their Halloween decorations in the front yard and the breakfast goodies were a nice touch as well!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I absolutely loved my stay here. I'd originally intended to arrive early evening and leave early; however, it was such a lovely place I stayed as long as I could. Loraine and her husband built a lovely little path down to the river where they have kayaks you can use. Loraine was extremely friendly, communicative, and covered everything I would need to know. The home is at a high point; so the overlook is fantastic. I highly recommend this place."

The view from the balcony was spectacular. We had a wonderful choice of TV shows (Amazon and Netflix and probably other channels that we didn't look for) and there was a generous amount of food for breakfast (eggs, milk, sausage, juice, etc).
The space was very clean and well maintained and the kitchen was fully stocked (decent non-stick pan, lots of plates and cutlery). It was very easy to find from the highway. We highly recommend staying here if you're ever travelling through, or if you'd like a quiet holiday in a lovely out of the way place."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little place with a rich history around it. Stayed here after coming up the Enchanted Highway, very conveniently located! great little farm town, even had some wild turkeys and a couple baby deer on the block the place is located!"

You'll love it."

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My bestie and I, both busy moms, decided to visit the West side of the state for a quiet Birthday weekend getaway, and, y'all, we have no regrets in our choice in lodging. From the host to the area, everything was perfect.
Loraine is the BEST and most gracious hostess you could ask for. She had awesome suggestions and an excellent knowledge of the area and what it has to offer. She was very friendly, helpful and so sweet! We had an excellent time visiting with her and enjoying the scenery. She really made our birthdays special.
The space itself is super cozy with a perfect view. They have all the necessary amenities to make you feel right at home (laundry, dish washer, full bathroom, separate bedrooms, etc.). The town is peaceful and calm. It's really close to the Enchanted Highway, which is a cheap, fun little side quest that ends with an absolutely DELICIOUS meal at the Enchanted Castle (if you so choose). It's also just a hop, skip and a jump away from Dickinson, which has several other restaurants and little stores to visit.
10/10 would 1000% stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loraine was a wonderful hostess, and our stay at her place was great.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loraine is a wonderful host. She took the time to show us around the guest house and even called once we had checked out to check in and to ensure we had a safe journey for the rest of our trip.

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loraine and Mark were wonderful hosts. Loraine met us on arrival for a tour of the property and airbnb. She checked in many times to ensure we were okay, if we needed anything, and to ask if we would like to join them for dinner at the firepit. Dinner was wonderful and s'mores even better! Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great place for me stay during my extended road trip. It was very large, well equipped, and clean. There is ample outside space to enjoy, with a nice view of the surrounding countryside. I also very much enjoyed my breakfast that Loraine offered."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can’t believe what a joy of a time we had! Seriously ZERO complaints. Lorraine and Mark were so nice!! Even had a fire and ate dinner together one night.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have been hosted by some fabulous Airbnb hosts. My gosh, Loraine and her husband's commitment to providing excellent accommodation and being excellent hosts is unparalleled. Loraine and Mark ensured our comfort, our knowledge of the area and opportunities of interest for touring, and are simply delightful hosts. They even assisted me in hosting a cook out with friends on their extremely well appointed upper deck, complete with a fire. The accommodation itself is spotlessly clean and tremendously well appointed. The photos did not prepare us for the reality, in the best possible way! I do not want to take that element of wonderful surprise away from other travelers by detailing every aspect of this stay. You cannot go wrong choosing this stay and we will be back each year ongoing."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Good communication. We couldn't find any coffee to use with the machine other than some little single serve decaf filter packs for a single serve machine. Note that the second bedroom has a single bed and the air mattress is literally only big enough for a child . Lorraine is very friendly. Met us in front of the house to take us to our rooms. Very clean.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loraine was very kind and accommodating. We had to arrive late and she was able to check us in and make sure everything was good. Great stay!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed here on our road trip. The three of us had plenty of room to spread out. The Airbnb has everything you’d need for an overnight trip. We loved that there was a full kitchen where we could make breakfast. The town is small and dark at night but easy to find. We loved walking around and exploring the dock and small town. The dock and kayaking looks like it’d be super cool for the summer! The host was very sweet and willing to help with anything. She even helped us upon our later night arrival. There’s tons of games, tv options, etc. to use while staying in the Airbnb."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loraine’s place is not far from the highway, but when you are there, you feel removed from the world. Beautiful view overlooking the countryside. There is a sauna and massage chair if you are sore from driving. There are no restaurants close, but the unit has a full kitchen for storing and preparing food that you bring. There is also an outdoor pizza oven and grill. We didn’t get a chance to use the kayaks, but would love to next time through. All of the fixings for breakfast were provided (eggs, sausage, toast etc) so we “fueled up” and hit the road in the morning. Best night’s sleep we’ve had on our trip 😊"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean! Quite! And felt I was able to relax and heal from issues! Perfect place to get away for a few days!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lorraine was the best host you could ask for! She was helpful, patient, and stayed up late to welcome us and chat, despite having to wake up early the next morning. The home was comfortable and well-stocked, and the outdoor space was beautiful."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great spot! Close to dickenson and had a great view. Loraine was very accommodating to our changing schedule and made check in a breeze.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loraine's B&B was the perfect spot for our overnight stay on our way to Montana. She's one of the sweetest hosts I've come across - she stayed up late untill midnight to make sure we settled in comfortably after we arrived late after our long drive. The place was super clean, and had everything we needed for our stay. The B&B overlooks the beautiful Gladstone valley, and we wish we could've stayed longer. We would highly recommend this place to anyone! :)"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loraine and Mark’s place was amazing. It’s so large (two bedrooms) and a full kitchen so I was able to cook every night. Great views and would love to stay again!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A comfy home away from home. It was very clean with ampple supplies including breakfast foods. It was a private location with beautiful views. The best part of the stay was the hostess. She was warm accomodating and left sweet messages every morning outisde the door and was ready to help us in any way possible. It was also conviently located to see Theodore Roosevelt National park.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,These people really know how to Airbnb. We felt like we were at our own home with the little things they supply like spice assortment and other touches that just makes you feel welcome. Highly recommend this place over the other airbnbs in this area.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The townhome is warm and comfortable. We were there from Oct-Dec and the heat worked great. The Wi-Fi worked flawlessly and had plenty of speed to work from home or stream. The kitchen is spacious and has everything you could want. It has a large walk-in pantry which we loved. There is an attached oversized, heated 1 car garage. The bathroom was standard size, and each bedroom had a closet, dresser and a TV. One bed was firmer than the other, so depending on your taste, one of the new queen beds will fit your needs. We loved the very comfy dual recliners and the large reclining couch. They worked perfect and were ideal for watching shows on the 50"" TV. There is a desk and a Lazy Boy office chair in the living room. She also provided a gas-powered snow blower and shovel for those snowy days. But the best part of this home is the 5-star host Ashlee and her husband Chris. Both could not have been more helpful and accommodating. We definitely would rent this townhome again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time at this Airbnb. The space was clean and comfortable. The host was kind and very helpful. We would definitely stay here again.

The space is very roomy, clean, and comfortable. We all felt right at home. The owners are kind and friendly, and the dog is adorable. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Highly recommend staying here!"

2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a very reasonable ""off the beaten path"" place to stay for groups/families that would like some time together yet still have their own space."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This downstairs apartment is very nicely put together. It is spacious and provides for all your needs. Juanita, the owner is very pleasant and makes sure that you enjoy your stay. It is a very small town, away from any more-populated areas. I used it mainly geographically, for a base of making day trips to Theodore Roosevelt National Park, and didn't mind being away from it all. You do have to be careful with your gas tank; the closest gas station is about 25 minutes away. She does have two dogs, but she kept them away from me, because I'm not a dog-person. Overall, I very much recommend it."
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,You can find this property located next to the Catholic Church. Take time to enjoy the lovely yard and patio.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean and very spacious. The pictures do not show how big the apartment is. Six of us stayed and never ""ran"" over each other. Nice kitchen ware and everything worked easily. Beautiful flowers and lawn. Wifi amazing and this little town is so quaint. Just 17 miles to Dickinson for any needs. The town cemetery is just a short walk away and worth exploring. Reminents of the old town bank make for interesting photos. We hope to stay again."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"great space for a family or even families, quiet out of the way location filled with charm. There is a beautiful church adjacent to the home with a history of its own. Nita is the perfect host and will absolutely make sure you are comfortable for your stay. Not to miss!"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I came to Dickinson to cook for college mens and womens golf teams while they were playing in a tournament. My original accommodations fell through, and I am actually glad they did because that led me to Juanita's place. Wonderful, peaceful setting, which was nice for someone that was doing a lot of frantic cooking. Kitchen was large enough for me to easily prepare meals for 23 people. The rest of the place was just as accommodating. I will be looking to stay here everytime I am in the area! Juanita was a great host!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice place for a family get together! Plenty of space for everyone to enjoy and relax!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The lodge was amazing. I haven't hunted since I was a kid growing up in Pennsylvania, but staying at the lodge renewed my interest. The house was very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the pool table and would have loved to spend more time on the deck, but unfortunately the weather did not cooperate."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean, very relaxing space. Great for large groups. We stayed here with 2 other couples for a weekend getaway.

2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our group really enjoys the outdoors and the rustic, hunter cabin feel of the Lodge. There is plenty of outdoor space to walk, play games, or even just hang out. Carla was very good about getting back to us with questions we had. We have stayed in a number of vacation rentals over the years and the Lodge would be one that we would recommend to others."
2019-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The Lodge is absolutely beautiful and so cozy! Our family reunion was so fun there and we are all going to make plans to come back next year!

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an amazing place to stay! You can even take photos with a full sized taxidermied bear. The place is large with tons of beds all nicely made and ample towels provided. I just regret that we did not have more than one night to spend.

2019-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Spectacular host and amazing house! Highly recommended if you’re are in the area for the Medora Musical or other travel needs.
2019-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a very large house than can easily accommodate 10 people. We had 4 in our family party, and we used only about half the house.
The location has many facilities that are useful for families including a large and beautiful yard, a wonderful deck with many chairs and table, a washer and drier, and a well-equipped kitchen with a large dining table. This house appears to designed as a hunting lodge. There are many large elk and deer heads mounted in the living room, which might bother some people. As described in the description, there are many double beds but no queen sized beds, which may be a disadvantage for some families.
Overall, I would say this is first a perfect five star hunting lodge and second a pretty good place for families."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful accommodations!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Warm and welcoming while spacious, this hunting lodge doesn't disappoint. It was tastefully appointed in Dakotan style and well located off I-94 to Theodore Roosevelt National Park and the Enchanted Highway. The views are breathtaking--Highly recommend!"

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Spacious, well equipped, perfect host"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a hidden gem in a beautiful location. Spacious, welcoming and so clean!!! You will NOT disappointed!"
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend staying at the lodge. My parents, husband, 5 yr old and 18 mo stayed at the lodge when we were visiting Medora ND. Carla was very responsive to my emails prior to our arrival. The lodge was very clean and comfortable. The pack and play, for my 18 mo old, at the lodge was very clean (I did bring my own fitted sheet). The staircases are open which made it a little nerve racking with a very fast 18 mo old. We did make a makeshift baby gate and it worked well. The house met the needs of the grandparents to the grandkids. I'd highly recommend the lodge and would stay there in the future."
2018-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Large space, beautiful deck, all the amenities we wanted were already provided. A beautiful home. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. Thank you!"

It was very clean and comfortable, lots of space to spread out and relax, filled with unique person touches, and the kitchen was outfitted well for cooking and serving large groups. The hostess was extremely accommodating to a last-minute extra night. The location is a quick drive to town with scenic views. I highly recommend the lodge as your next Badlands accommodation."
2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,All the space anyone could need. Room and space for 5 couples or 10 people. Convenient place to stay while enjoying a visit to the Medora area.
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The Lodge was great. The views were gorgeous, and the area was so quiet. It was the perfect place to kick back and relax after a day of hiking in Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The hunters in our family very much enjoyed the mounts as well! The hosts were very accommodating, we had a great time."
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home with all the accommodations and plenty of space. This is a hunter's dream home!
2018-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"We held a sibling reunion at the Lodge. Age range was from 66 to 84 and unfortunately not all the bedrooms were on the ground floor which we knew when we selected it. It is surrounded by beautiful trees which don’t show much on the pictures but give one a real feeling of seclusion when sitting on the expansive deck. Everything promised of amenities was there and in some cases more than expected. The animal trophy mounts might startle you at first glance, but folks, this is a functioning hunting lodge!
Thanks, Carla, for a relaxing time and for being very responsive to any questions during the reservation process all the way through our stay."
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The lodge was better than the photos. Very clean and a relaxing place to be for the week! Would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Dickinson. Carla was so easy to communicate with and was very accomdating.

2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"The location was stunning and the lodge was perfect! Great kitchen and grill and Carla was quick to get back to us with any issues. We loved our stay there, especially since everyone got their own room and there were 3 showers so no bathroom backlog in the morning!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This cabin was just amazing. It was so private and fit our group of 14 easily. It was spacious with a pool table and different spaces for small groups to each do their own thing but open space enough to accommodate the whole group. Highly recommend!
2017-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"This house is right off the highway, not much a detour at all. The house is absolutely lovely! Well equipped kitchen, every room is clean and cozy. The beds are quite comfortable and the host is accommodating! The view and sun rise is gorgeous. It's more than spacious for my group of 8 to stretch, relax and entertain. Wish we could stay longer!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful gathering place. Comfortable and clean. Sitting on a hill and surrounded by pasture and picturesque farms, was peaceful and delightful and an extra treat not expected. Our family, including our 102 year old father, had all we needed to have a super four day stay."
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The lodge is a beautiful home, located in a lovely area, with great views, it is easy to find, and includes everything you could possibly need during your stay.
We were very comfortable during our one week stay. The place is very clean and everything is new looking. The wifi works really well, strong signal. It is an easy drive, just a few miles, to restaurants and stores.
Carla is a great host, it is obvious she takes very good care of the place. She answered all our questions, always getting back to us quickly, and always very helpful.
We highly recommend this host and this house, you will love it too."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"""Over the top"" for our family group of 9. Only wish we could stay longer. Soooo much better than a 5 start hotel!"
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Lodge was clean, huge and perfect for our family. We loved sitting out on the deck in the morning and evenings."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent accommodations. Ckean, comfortable, has everything you could possibly want. Feels like a mountain getaway in Colorado. We highly recommend this place."
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick stay at the Lodge as part of our trip to Medora to see the musical. We had 6 adults and 2 kids and there was MORE than enough space to accommodate everyone. The house was immaculate and well stocked with amenities (even though we didn't use them at all). More importantly, it had plenty of bathrooms for all these people! The place is easy to find and is just far enough off the highway as to prevent any noise or disturbances.
My guess is that this doubles as a hunting lodge so while the animal heads and life-sized bear in the basement were a little unexpected, it did not take away from our experience or the great stay we had at the Lodge."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice quiet and clean place! Easy to get to both units of TRNP

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the best bang for your buck and most importantly very clean. Yes, it is outdated but I think that is part of the charm. The restrooms and linens were super clean. I am a stickler and it met my expectations. Not dingy at all (sigh of relief). we came here after seeing Medora musical. very safe and easy to get to. I was traveling with my dad and my bf and did not want to make it awkward for everybody, so I brought a twin air mattress which fit perfectly in the room (so that every body had their own bed). Very communicative host and appreciate the hospitality! It had a microwave so we were able to heat up the food the night before. I definitely would recommend!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was convenient and well-priced. Christian was friendly and offered great brewery recommendations.

We enjoyed our one night stay so much we decided to reserve an additional night."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice little motel room close to Medora, not a lot of big hotel bells and whistles but if you need a good nights sleep this is the place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We booked Christian’s place during our trip to TRNP. The room was extremely clean. It was advertised as no Wi-Fi so we knew ahead of time but did not have trouble getting service. We were thankful for the refrigerator and the cables to stream from our phones to the tv. The beds were very comfortable as well. A great and affordable place to stay while visiting the parks.

Very responsive host, nice TV comfortable beds, and good water pressure. Quiet location in a convenient, easy to find location that's right off the freeway. I felt safe and slept like a baby.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This listing is truely five stars. I wish there was a better way to distinguish places that exceed expectations because I often, and think most reviewers, feel like they know what they are getting at a place based on listing, photos and price so always want to be fair and give good ratings when it was what you thought it would be. This place was better than its pictures and more than exceeded my expectations. Such a cool and unique building and a beautiful, newly remodeled, modern decor inside. There were a lot of tasteful and kind touches and everything you could need. A bonus to our visit was the delicious Vietnamese restaurant, Lemon grass, that was walking distance from the place. Owners were very sweet and the food was wonderful. The stay was a great cap off to our family’s South and North Dakota adventure."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a wonderful experience at Nathan’s apartment! The pictures online were very nice, but did not do it justice. Everything was high end and very tastefully furnished and decorated. We wished we could have stayed longer, and would absolutely stay there again if our travels bring us back into the area. Our group has stayed in a lot of Airbnbs, and this was one of the nicest places we’ve stayed. Book it if you can!
By the way, as another reviewer mentioned, the garbage truck that comes through in the wee hours on Thursday morning is very jarring. It’s not a big deal at all if you know what is going on, but if you’re not prepared, it is quite alarming."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Loft was so well decorated and comfortable. It had everything we needed. We would love to come back and stay again. The bedding, towels, pillows and rugs were all such beautiful and soft fabrics. Loved the rain shower heads. It was the perfect place for visiting Theodore Roosevelt NP. The town is so cute too. Many nice stores and we walked to 2 really good restaurants. We used the washer and dryer to get ready for the rest of our trip. Nathan was really good with communication and also very nice. The price was good and so well worth spending instead of staying in a hotel. Nathan thought of everything needed for a home away from home!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Delightful comfortable urban-decorated loft in a rural community setting. Lots of nice touches.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, super clean and very comfortable! Perfect for two couples - great layout with en-suite bathrooms for each bedroom. Highly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely great stay. So many amenities and huge space. Free and easy parking as well
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We found this to be our top pick out of any Airbnb or VRBO rentals. We travel a lot and this felt like home. So comfortable, clean, beautifully decorated, and great location. Thanks again Nathan for everything."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An amazing loft. Look no further. The pictures don’t do it justice. Only problem is that we only booked one night. I would have loved to cook a big meal in the amazing kitchen. Super comfy queen bed.
I look forward to staying again when I bring family out next year.
Thanks Nathan!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Alley Cat Loft was perfect for our stay! We were only there 2 nights, but the accommodations were so nice I wish we had booked it for a longer period! The loft is beautifully decorated, well-appointed with everything you need in the kitchen, baths (there are 3!) and laundry and most important to me, it was spotlessly clean! All the conveniences of home....only better! The loft has great natural light and it so unbelievably spacious in the living areas as well as the bedrooms and baths. Even the closet space is huge which I love because I like to put my bags away and out of sight! Downtown Dickenson is charming and we loved being able to walk to get food, have a drink, etc. It's also a perfect home base to visit Theordore Roosevelt National Park and other nearby sites. If we are back this way, we will definitely book the Alley Cat and we will give high recommendations for any friends who might visit the area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nathan's place was fantastic. It was absolutely beautiful and spacious. Having 2 full bathrooms and an added powder room was great for our group. It looks and feels luxurious. We loved the living room rug. It was so soft and snuggly. We've already booked a 2nd stay.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Second stay was just as perfect as the first, so clean and comfortable. Could have stayed even longer, great space with all the amenities needed."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was beautifully decorated and immaculate. Could not have asked for better. Great location/oasis for our adventures in the area. Thank you!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic stay - even better than the photos show!! First off (from a total clean freak) - thank you so much for the no-shoes rule. That keeps the floors so much cleaner, we do the same in our home and I so appreciate this as no place ever has clean floors until now! Nathan’s place was very clean and felt like home. Everything we needed was in the kitchen - flatware, glasses, plates, bakeware, etc. Appliances work great, the entire place was top-notch and such a hidden gem. We look forward to our next stay, this has been one of the best experiences we’ve had staying somewhere and one of those places we could have stayed even longer. Thanks for the most excellent loft!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The unit was ideal for our stay to include kitchen essentials and ample pots and pans. The wifi was fast and reliable, and the location was perfect for exploring Dickinson. This was an ideal base for going to Bismarck, Medora, and Teddy Roosevelt National Park. Host communication was excellent and we would definitely stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The loft is beautiful, with every attention paid to detail. The kitchen was well equipped."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Inside is very nice and just as described and pictured. Nathan responds within minutes. I successfully used the washer/dryer (with the provided detergent). The big closet in the master bedroom was awesome to put our luggage.
Coffee and hot chocolate are the only food/drink items. So, if you need snacks, sugar/creamer, spices, etc., currently, they weren’t provided. However, Nathan said the sugar/creamer was a good suggestion, so that part might be changing soon.
Personally, my husband and I didn’t prefer the location since it was a non-residential area and required a walk down an alley (well-lit thankfully) to get inside. Also, at 5:25am on Thursday the garbage truck very loudly showed up right below my bedroom waking me up. Just giving you a heads up since it was pretty startling. However, I did sleep very well otherwise. The bathtub and shower were both great also.
It’s obvious that Nathan cares about running a quality Airbnb. Hope you enjoy if you go this route!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderfully spacious and luxury place with close access to Teddy Roosevelt National Park! Thanks for a great weekend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is over the top. Beautiful, light filled, generously appointed, perfectly clean, great location, communicative host. Absolutely top notch."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nathan’s place was so wonderfully decorated and clean. Felt right at home the minute we got there. Much bigger than I thought it would be with plenty of space for our whole family. Nathan had given us very clear check in instructions so getting there was a breeze. Thanks!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, well decorated and welcoming. Clean, spacious."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful place. It’s prettier than the photos. So many conveniences including a spacious kitchen, washer/dryer and electric fireplace. Very roomy but a cozy feel.
We were delighted and plan to stay on our next visit to Dickinson."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was one of the best Airbnbs we've stayed in. The apartment is gorgeous, well laid out, and extremely comfortable. Nathan covered everything (there were boxes of Kleenex everywhere you'd hope for one) and was a fantastic host from beginning to end. His instructions were spot on and he had great recommendations waiting for us.
Highly recommend!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely apartment with beautiful finishes, thoughtful design touches, and comfy beds. We felt more at home here than most AirBnB’s we’ve stayed at which are many. We enjoyed dinner at Blue 42, just around the corner, and went for a walk in the neighborhood afterwards. This was a great stop for our family of four."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic place!! We were very pleased with our stay. The loft is super clean and comfortable. All the thoughtful touches made it feel like we were staying in a home and not a rental. I highly recommend staying here!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this property for housing in Dickinson. It is a large apartment tastefully decorated with all the amenities needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The hosts take great care in presenting this space - and the effort shows. It would be ideal for an extended stay. Our visit to the area was all too brief. We hope to return and book this property again.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our only regret is that we stayed at Nathan's place at the tail end of our road trip! It was beautiful and prepared as if we were going to stay for weeks. Gorgeous place, well kept, would highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The Alley Cat Loft was beautiful and exactly as described! Easily walkable to local restaurants and parking right outside.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Loft is probably the nicest AirBnB I’ve ever stayed in. It was so nice that we bought dinner at a local restaurant and brought it home to eat in our elegant apartment every night. Staying here was a real treat!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A great place to stay!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unreal spot
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place was immaculate and walking distance to lots of restaurants and night spots. The hosts were quickly responsive and a joy to work with. Note: When it's cold the keypad to get into both sets of doors can be temperamental but they work great for easy check-in and check-out if you are patient.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Host is very easy to communicate with, gorgeous loft."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and location. Comfy loft and owners were very helpful.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Staying with Elizabeth was so comforting. Felt like being part of a farm. We all slept so well
the breakfast was amazing. Fresh bacon and eggs and potatoes filled up our tummies so we could get back on the road.
Her place is a little ways off the highway but it’s worth it. We also felt safe parking our van, which was full of suitcases and musical gear."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,First time using Airbnb and Elizabeth was very helpful and helping me get it set up and their farmstead was very awesome to stay at and Elizabeth was very accommodating to our needs. If I’m ever in the area I’ll stay there again thank you.

She had farm fresh eggs and sausage in the fridge, along with juice, milk, and plenty of coffee. We spent a day exploring Theodore Roosevelt National Park.

Despite being quite far away from your work site, our boys always ask us to comeback to Elizabeth.

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ask in advance about arranging to enjoy delicious farm-ranch style suppers: This bed and
breakfast extraordinaire gets even better. The walks around the vast property where no
neighbors can be seen are recommended. Elizabeth is an amazing host. Her thoughtfulness and sincerity was felt through out our most relaxing stay. We felt well taken care of and wish we could stay longer!
Thank you, Elizabeth, for everything!"

We recommend!!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect place for our family. We loved getting to step into Elizabeth’s (and her family) life for a few days. We had plenty of room for the 7 of us, the house was super clean and well stocked with absolutely anything one might need. The night sky out away from everything was fantastic, and the homemade breakfast every morning just couldn’t be beat. All 5 of the kids said it was their favorite place we’ve stayed. Elizabeth was a a wonderful host. We can’t wait to stay with her again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Elizabeth is a fantastic host! She is so attentive, friendly, and kind. I felt more like I was staying with family instead of someone I just met. The accommodations are very clean and she has really thought of everything. The property is very secluded which we loved. Of all the places we stayed during our trip her place was our favorite!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Elizabeth has honed her skills as a host. She is dedicated to making your experience a good one. Everything she prepared for us was delicious. Any issue that came up big or small she was always willing to go the extra mile. Unfortunately we had a emergency issue with our dog and she stepped up beyond measure. She even offered a refund if we wanted to leave the remainder of our stay. I'd highly recommend her Ranch whether you're just passing through or need a good place to stay and hunt. 5 stars all the way!!!!!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing basement apartment with large bedrooms was a nice way to escape from the summer heat & our stay included a wonderful breakfast each morning. Our dog got to enjoy running around off leash and we got to relax and enjoy the scenery in a wonderfully remote location. Elizabeth is a very nice and friendly host. Gave us lots of information about the ranch and the area and was very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Sleeping in this large ranch home, it was so quiet and dark! Perfect for the tired traveler, and plenty of comforts in addition to the sleeping arrangements, which as a solo traveler offered me the pick of comfiest and coziest bed out of 5. Free amenities including snacks in the full kitchen, and best of all a home cooked breakfast with farm fresh eggs. I loved watching the sunrise, being greeted by the cat and chickens outside, and getting to know my host. I felt very well taken care of, and would love to visit again!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can't say enough about Elizabeth and her fantastic place. We honestly booked this 1-night stay because we just needed a place to stay on our way to western Montana. We left with huge smiles on our faces, determined to come back to North Dakota and spend more time there.
Elizabeth was friendly, communicative, and helpful. Her farm is gorgeous, and my kids loved just wandering around on the prairie watching the thunderstorms miles off into the distance. We mentioned we were hungry and Elizabeth quickly agreed to cook us up a simple meal for a very reasonable extra charge. When we told her we would be leaving super early in the morning she was still awake and ready for us with hot cinnamon rolls to take on the road with us.
This little stop we thought of as just an over-nighter has so far turned out to be one of the highlights of our long trip! So thankful we chose Elizabeth's place to stay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Elizabeth is a great great host.

Elizabeth gave us a full support on our needs.
We recomend and we will be back!"

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fun
2020-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Absolutely amazing! Elizabeth welcomed us and our hunting dogs with open arms. The space was very clean, comfortable and so cozy!

We all agree it felt like home away from home. Thank you!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great accommodations and friendly host!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What an experience! Elizabeth’s hunting themed home is such an immersive place. It was really fun. The land around the house is so vast; I wish we had more time to hike it! Elizabeth made a delicious breakfast for us too.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth is an amazing gal. Beautiful ranch. Super comfy bed. Chickens onsite. Seamless from arrival to departure. Highly recommend this airbnb foran authentic ND stay ♡.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed two nights at Elizabeth's place on our trip to the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The location is a bit far away from the park, besides that everything was great. The underground rooms are super cool even in summer time. Elizabeth is a great rancher/hunter/photographer. You will be inspired by her storys about the national park and local life, much more interesting than what you can get from google."
2019-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place, easy going and laid back, beautiful area and great host!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Elizabeth went above and beyond and made us feel like we were a part of the family. It did not even feel like we were away from home the whole week we stayed. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the area.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this place. Infact my uncle's plan to stay there. Just a great family. Elizabeth is warm and friendly. Even offer to loan me her hunting boots lol! I will definitely be back along with my family. She was very flexible with our schedule that changed due to weather. I can not recommend it more. They were the highlight of our trip !
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"From homemade breakfasts, to the peaceful respite of quiet evenings on the range. The VanLishout's went out of their way to provide excellent hospitality during my week of stay on their ranch."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stay included a delicious breakfast with HOMEMADE blueberry scones! Beds were comfortable and sheets were clean. Scenery was gorgeous and there was a massive field for my dog to play in!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Elizabeth is very accommodating and makes you feel right at home. Her space is cozy with comfy beds. The bathroom is well supplied with anything one might need.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth is fantastic! She’s so great. And her place is amazing. It’s pretty far from any towns, but that’s what we liked about it. It’s a beautiful rural area with animals and views forever. She made us a delicious breakfast and her hospitality was outstanding! Plus, she’s fun to talk to and can answer any questions you have about the area. We will definitely go back next time we are near there."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great host, comfy place, good breakfast, and a view that goes for miles. Highly recommend if you're passing through. Keep in mind that it's off the beaten path a ways, but I'd say it's worth it."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Elizabeth is a very thoughtful host, I took a job In south West North Dakota, and Elizabeth accommodated very well to me being on second shift and needing a place to stay for a week. Very thoughtful, very clean, very quiet place. Thank you for your hospitality Elizabeth!"
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Elizabeth was so sweet! We got in kind of late, and she still was up and greeted us when we came in. Her place was cute, clean, and she even included snacks for us! Would totally recommend."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks Elizabeth for your hospitality. This is a very unique place with a very unique experience and everyone should experience it if they are in the region. I loved the stay at your farm house. Elizabeth was nice to talk to. The house was clean and the experience was above expectation.
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Talk about a host who went above and beyond! The GPS didn’t take me to the right place so Elizabeth drive out after dark to meet me and take me to the house. In the morning, she guided me back to the highway. This is a real working ranch and it feels like it, but Elizabeth went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed. I’d highly recommend her place!"
,,,"The host lacks principals and morals, I do recommend to look for alternatives."
,,,Our plan was to stay 4 nights. We left after 1 nights stay. We didn't feel welcome or safe. There are no locks renter can control to stop host from entering at anytime. All direct verbal communication was abrasive. We only stayed 1 night and left next morning because we were afraid and offended. There was no way we felt comfortable opening any conversation with our host. Via text we were accused of locking them out. We had already left and weren't on or anywhere near property. I am flabbergasted at the behavior we experienced.
