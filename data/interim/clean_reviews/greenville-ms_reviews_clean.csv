We arrived during a festive holiday season for Leland with Deer Creek adorned in decoration awaiting their famed Kermit/Santa Christmas float, so needless to say, we were enamored.
Only briefly in town for business, the well-kept abode with a plethora of adorable decorations, was a perfect retreat !! We each had our own themed room and made extensive use of the well-stocked kitchen and pantry !! We will definitely re-book on our next adventure to Leland !!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay at Carol's pink cottage. It is very spacious! I was in town for the Highway 61 Blues Festival and I couldn't believe how close I was to downtown Leland. As a visual person, I appreciated the pictures that Carol sent to me for check-in instructions, etc. I loved having the eggs, bread, coffee, snacks and water bottles! I slept really good in the front bedroom as the sounds from the highway didn't bother me. There's a nice room, with a firm mattress in the back of the cottage for a quieter rest. The water pressure in the shower was nice too. I also enjoyed being so close to where Kermit lived (the Jim Henson exhibit) with the cotton patch garden and the creek. Checkout instructions were the easiest I have stayed at. I highly recommend Carol's place and would love to stay here again."

She‚Äôs very responsive to answer any questions you may have no matter what time of the day or night it is. We didn‚Äôt arrive until late in the night and she had went to the house and turned on some lights so we wouldn‚Äôt have to walk in an unfamiliar house in the dark. Before we got there some bad thunderstorms had came up and the temperature had dropped some and she messaged us and let us know exactly what was going on. We would recommend her lovely home to anyone wanting to spend time in that area.
Sincerely
Henry Dillard and. Jane Stockstill"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôll forever be indebted to Ms Carol and Bobee, who went above and beyond to make me feel at home in Leland. The Pink House is adorable, full of character and charm. Every element inside and out ‚Äì from the furniture and decor to the snacks and manicured garden (Yard of the Week during my stay, and totally deserved) ‚Äì is curated with the utmost care. I loved my whirlwind trip and only wish I‚Äôd stayed longer. As Gonzo sings in The Muppet Movie, I‚Äôm going to go back there someday (if you stay at Carol‚Äôs place, be sure to visit the Kermit the Frog museum just across Deer Creek). Thank you for looking after me, Carol! Until next time. x"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We recently traveled to Leland to visit family in the area. Pink On The Creek was clean and well stocked with goodies. There were plenty of clean towels for me and my 2 boys. Carol was super responsive. We would definitely stay there again.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The guest experience was phenomenal. Mrs. Carol and her husband really goes the extra mile to make you feel at home during your stay. The home was clean, spacious, well lit, peaceful and quiet, and in a safe area located close to downtown.
The level of the service provided by the hosts was amazing and far exceeded any expectations. Mrs. Carol was thoughtful in having snacks readily available upon check-in, leaving the lights on for my evening arrival, and preparing a handwritten note. I just truly loved the gracious hospitality offered in the Mississippi Delta.
In addition to providing a surprising welcome, Mrs. Carol is the epitome of communication and responsiveness. Before I arrived, I asked about a walking trail so that I could continue my daily workout routine. Mrs. Carol not only messaged directions but also images of landmarks so that I could become familiar with the path in a strange city/town. I followed those directions and was able to complete my 4 miles each day and I‚Äôm truly thankful for that. Note: There were no dogs or loose dogs around, so that made everything so much better in unfamiliar territory.
Overall this stay was great, the service was great, and the overall guest experience was phenomena as mentioned in my opening paragraph. The host are indeed Superhosts and should forever more be rated beyond five stars. I will definitely consider this property for all future stays.

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed the stay. We enjoyed the location. It was a beautiful location, quiet and peaceful just as described. The pros were the distant from event locations, easy access to the nearest cities and towns, and a single dwelling. The cons where there is no street sign to get to the location from the major highway (familiarity with the area was a plus for us). If you LOVE nature and fishing, you can't go wrong."

The outdoor space was perfect for the kids they had plenty of space to run around and play. LaQuanna was very responsive throughout the booking process.

We love everything about it, peaceful/quiet neighborhood, clean, and spacious. Instructions were provided prior to our arrival and honestly we didn‚Äôt have any issues so we had no need to contact LaQuanna. I want to highlight the fact that I mentioned a few small issues during my last stay and I immediately noticed the changes this year. As a repeat customer I appreciate that!
We will definitely reserve her home anytime we are in town.
Thanks again ‚Äúcousin‚Äù"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful time staying with Laquanna over the Easter weekend. The accommodations were outstanding! There was plenty of room for the family to have their own separate space without being on top of each other and plenty of gathering space. The host was extremely accommodating while we were there probably for the last time for most of us after burying our love one. If you‚Äôre in the area and are looking for a great place to stay look no further! My family & I highly recommend staying here we felt welcomed & at home A big Thank you to the host for your southern hospitality üíï
2023-01-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,This place very peaceful but needs maintenance the sinks were clogged and dishwasher were clogged as well.And Laquanna is not at all understanding.She just had very careless attitude.She didn‚Äôt want to accommodate you after I told her the problem.But overall it‚Äôs was very peaceful but at same time frustrating.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family has stayed at this home now a few times and it has been a great experience each time! Excellent and responsive host who is very generous and thoughtful towards her guests.
The home is a great place for family to gather & my kids also have loved all the indoor and outdoor space.
Look forward to coming back!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My sister and our family came together for a funeral‚Ä¶ and we wanted to all be together under one roof. This was the perfect place and with spacious rooms. Beautiful bedrooms and bedding. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone .
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"The area and home were very quiet. This was the first time my family and I experienced the Fall where we were able to experience the many leaves and the shedding of trees. Observing the playing of squirrels and the manner in which they moved up and down the trees to collect their food was fun to see. The country life was great, we are from Nassau, Bahamas, hence do not have the opportunity to enjoy such an atmosphere.
The disappointment regarding the house was no type of privacy in the front and back area of the house, due to there being no type of drapes or curtains.
Overall the trip and stay were great."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay. There was plenty of space to spread out, and the home is close to stores and groceries. A heads up for future guests, the beautiful windows provide nice views during the day, but left us feeling a little exposed at night when it was dark outside and we had the lights on inside, as there are no coverings. Although we would have preferred window coverings, we would stay here again in the future."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,It was nice
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was the best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed at. LaQuanna was an awesome host. Returned calls in a timely manner and made sure if we needed anything to please call or send a message. Her home was immaculate and clean and comfortable. It made our visit there even better.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is absolutely awesome and amazing!!! LaQuanna is a fantastic host!
Every aspect of this home was more than ""expected""....The space, furnishing, location, cleanliness and overall accommodations are wayyyy superior based on our experiences with other Airbnb's!!! I personally can say that our host LaQuanna is the best! This is our family's 2nd time in the last 8 months staying here. Please consider this host and property for your next visits to this city! You'll definitely be satisfied! I give this property and host LaQuanna....5 stars!!!üåüüåü üåü üåü üåü"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was beautiful, spacious, clean and inviting. The location was just minutes away from shopping and dining. Everything about the home was breathtaking. The home decor was beautiful and the yard was truly remarkable. You have to see it to believe it. I would rate the home 10 stars, it was everything we imagined and more. I would definitely recommend this home to my family and friends. LaQuanna was a great host. This home was truly A King's Palace and a Queen's Dream."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home is very beautiful and spacious not being able to enter through the carport was very inconvenient.
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family had to travel from Georgia, Michigan and Texas to say our last goodbyes to my grandfather. None of us live in Greenville so having your house made it possible for most of my family to stay together. It was big and close enough for everything. The house was perfect!!!
Thanks LaQuanna for being so sweet to us."

2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I booked LaQuannas‚Äô home so that after years of COVID Quarantine we would be able to finally visit our 80+ year old Nana and a plethora of other family members in Greenville. We absolutely LOVED staying in LaQuannas‚Äô home! The DECOR made us feel like we were at home. Each room was pleasing to be in and comfortable to congregate in. The kitchen and dining rooms are HUGE. The home is spacious and the bedrooms are separated into ‚Äúwings.‚Äù The home is very quiet. I could not hear any members of my party getting ready in the morning. The kitchen ideal for cooking, baking, tons of space for guests to congregate. The appliances were up to date. We appreciated coffee machine, coffee ‚Äúpods‚Äù and creamers that were supplied. We took full advantage of the game room. We enjoyed playing darts and taboo. The beds were very comfortable, and the amenities (lotion, shampoo, conditioner) in bathroom areas were well stocked. The checkin and checkout instructions were easy to follow. This home was perfect for us and any large family that loves to cook, laugh and dance together. We will be staying here again! Thank you again LaQuanna!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family needed a place to stay in Greenville, as we were coming there to lay my mother to rest. Having a house to stay in, was so much better than using a hotel, because we were able to spend a lot of time together, and it was just so nice. I can't thank LaQuanna enough for letting us use her lovely house for the sad occasion. The house was spotless, the beds were comfortable, and she thoughtfully left us a few snacks and drinks. Everything about our stay was perfect, and I am so grateful that we were able to have family time. I highly recommend this house and LaQuanna as host."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home is simply beautiful each room makes you feel at home and the space oh my god plenty of time for children I look forward to coming back to visit thank you Laquanna for allowing my family to stay in your beautiful home

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay.
2022-01-01,3.0,Group trip,"It was a good place to stay honestly! The only things I would improve would be the cleanliness, & the light switch labels (there were a lot of light switches). The sink water was cold in the kitchen, but that‚Äôs not a big deal for me. The other thing as well is one of the guest that was in the house with me was experiencing different shades of the water & that would be the only other thing."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was great and was perfect for our family visit.
Our kids had so much space to spread out and play and the hosts were very responsive and provided everything we needed and were very welcoming.

We would love to come back and stay here again for our next visit to Greenville."
2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The host was exceptional and represented among the highest levels of customer service and hospitality during our stay in Greenville. Her response time to our queries were very detailed and turn around time was very fast to make our stay comfortable. This home was one of the most breathtaking and spacious Airbnb we have ever been privileged enough to stay at. This was a gorgeous home and it was more breathtaking when we entered the spacious rooms and bathrooms. Overall, we had a great experience and the amenities were great. The home was wonderful, clean, and perfect to celebrate our Thanksgiving weekend. I would say this home was PERFECT!!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice cabin with a great view! We used it as an overnight stop but seemed like it would make for a good extended stay to relax and enjoy the view/time away from the business of life. Everything was clean, host was responsive, and no chores/hoops to jump through before departure like some listings require."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was great and very nice
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! This has to be one of our favorite places now. The pictures do no justice. This camp was the cleanest place we have ever stayed by far. Great appliances, comfortable furniture, plenty of room, and a stocked kitchen to list a few things we found amazing. The host is the kindest person and so responsive. We didn't want to leave. We hardly came in from fishing off the large pier that comes right out of the back door. A hidden gem to say the least. We discussed how soon to come back on the way home."

Brenda was friendly and easygoing!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"They are the nicest people that you can meet. Very attentive to any needs, but not intrusive on your stay. Brenda was very helpful on extending my stay several times. I was working in the area and did paperwork in the evenings. A very nice and quiet place. There are e few historical sites nearby. I was even invited to a local car show‚Ä¶but had to work. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Brenda is the Gold Standard for Airbnb hosts. Helpful with anything we needed. So friendly and kind. It was a pleasure to stay with her and get to know her!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had another great stay at Markita and Terrence's home. I will book this place every time I visit if it's available. The price point is perfect.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"STAY HERE! YOU WILL LOVE IT!
We stayed at Markita‚Äôs place while in town for a funeral. The host was very responsive, informative & kind. She was nothing short of amazing. The house itself is SO SPACIOUS! The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. It felt just like home. My children enjoyed having their own wing & of course Hubby & I loved having our own space separate from the rest of the house. The master is literally like a separate apartment. Also, the house is not far from the highway, Walmart & various shopping centers are right down the road. We were very pleased with our stay & will define look to stay here again when we return."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home was a home away from home. The pics does not do justice. It‚Äôs beautiful & very spacious. I enjoyed my stay and will definitely book again.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My husband and I hosted Thanksgiving at the Airbnb. The house is huge, it accommodated our family with plenty of room. There is so much potential in the house and I am sure our host is definitely on making it even roomier for future guests. I think this place is perfect for visitors like myself with large families. The downside is the stairs leading into the property. I have a disabled child and this place is not wheelchair accessible but I definitely recommend this host and their house."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family and I really enjoyed the stay...very spacious & unique home! Highly recommend......

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Markita was a great and responsive host. She made things very clear for me and my guest and there were no issues.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First off let me start by saying, ""WOW!!"". This place is amazing. I couldn't tell from the pictures just how huge this home is! This house could easily and comfortably sleep 12 people. The home is beautifully decorated. The kitchen is perfect if you want to cook a meal. This is truly a home away from home and I loved staying here. The hosts were spectacular! They are friendly, responsive, and everything you could ask for in a perfect host. I highly recommend this home to anyone traveling to Greenville or surrounding areas!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Listen this house was everything and more it was 9 of us plus a toddler The host had someonein less than 10 min with something minor ( TV remote) they went above and beyond for our needs even when I come back to Mississippi I hope she still has this place I give the house host 10 out of 10
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My siblings and I rented Markita‚Äôs place for and extended 4th of July holiday. We were visiting the delta to celebrate my grandmother‚Äôs 85th birthday.

We will DEFINITELY be back!"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Markita was a great host. I sent her a message and she immediately responded. He husband came right over to take care of my concern. Very nice house.
2023-06-01,3.0,Group trip,Just okay only one shower difficulty to get in the tub and broken front door. Needs lights for driveway or front area not well lite for night arrival
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was great. I just didn't like that the shared bathroom doesn't have a shower.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful home with a beautiful host to match! Markita‚Äôs home is so spacious and beautifully decorated. The little back porch wasn‚Äôt pictured but we loved the extra outside space where we could enjoy the weather and let the kiddos run wild on the lawn. This house was extra special to us because it is very close to family and not too far from Walmart. Our family from Greenville came to visit and was absolutely blown away. What really made our trip unforgettable was the high standard of hosting. What a sweet heart! Markita saw that we were having trouble getting in and she called before we could even pull our phones out, I think that was my favorite part. Her attentiveness was unmatched and she wasn‚Äôt over bearing at all. She stepped in when we had problems and was always so polite and helpful. My family and I would love to tell our host that we loved your home, thank you for letting us use your space and we can‚Äôt wait to come back! You made us feel so comfort and at home"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"The top three things I look for in a rental are cleanliness, cleanliness, and cleanliness. The home was immaculate when we arrived. Beyond that, it was well located to nearby restaurants, grocery stores, and major roadways. The home is very large and there was abundant room for the 6 guests we brought to move around. The host went out of her way to accommodate us and was very responsive to what issues we had. We would stay there again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"There was an issue with the place that ultimately led to us not staying there. However, Ms. Markita accepted responsibility as soon as the issue was brought to her attention and she contacted AirBnB right away so that we could get our full refund.
She was extremely apologetic and listened very attentively to our situation, which was completely out of her control, and she was a astute professional.
We would definitely recommend this place to others and hope to have Ms. Markita as a host in the future."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was perfectly adequate for our needs. There was ample space for all five of us. The d√©cor was eclectic. The water pressure was good. We used the kitchen every day and had all that we needed to cook basic meals. The heating system worked well. And Marketa was great to communicate with.
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a beautiful home. Much larger on inside than the outside of home. The security cameras gave us a confidence in the safety of the home. Would definitely stay here again!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great stay, communication was excellent. Would definitely recommend"
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Super cute house, great location for getting downtown and around town quickly and easily. The security system is awesome and helps make you feel safe. Will definitely stay here again for my next trip!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Well presented house with a responsive host. There were no cabs to get us back to the accommodation but a friendly local very kindly gave us a lift home.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were in town for my brothers wedding and needed a family friendly spot not far from the venue. We grew up a few blocks away and it really felt at home. Initially I was skeptical due to the location but there were no issues!! Annette was very helpful when communicating about any questions I had and any issues that arose during our stay. We would definitely patronize this location again as it was everything the description and pics said it would be. We appreciate the hospitality.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This is the third time I‚Äôve stayed at Annette‚Äôs throughout the years and it‚Äôs perfect for our work group. Everything is always clean with comfortable beds.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was fantastic
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It is rare that you get to park inside a garage on an Airbnb but this place had a garage! The house was the right size for us and was comfortable and clean.

However I was uncomfortable because there was no remote for the garage which meant I had to leave the garage door open when I left the property. The property was somewhat clean but cleanliness need to go a bit further with cleaning wall stains, baseboards and pots and pans were not properly clean. The dust pan used for cleaning was filled with hair and dirt. I had elderly relatives with me and the noisy cars driving by was almost unbearable for them. The appliances, dishes and washer and dryer were clean. I also appreciate that there was supplies available to do laundry. Lastly the sound of the heating unit was loud and startled when it came on late and night."

Slept like a baby! Hopefully it‚Äôs available the next time we come down for a visit."
2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The photos are an accurate description of the property design and decor. It was very clean and the alarm system did provide my family a bit of comfort, since the property is not located in one the better and safer parts of Greenville. Furthermore, the house presents as a cheap flip. In every room the floors slope away from the center of the house and the shower tile appears as if a new home owner used Tic Tok as a guide."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The BEST kept secret in Greenville for lodging! We will never stay in another smoky, overpriced, questionably clean/safe commercial motel/hotel in Greenville if we can stay here. 27 years of sketchy lodging is over!

2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house is beautifully decorated inside and is extremely inviting.

Communication was easy. The location is very central in Greenville. My family felt safe in the neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying here over the local hotels.
The intent was a bit spotty, but that‚Äôs normal in the area. My sister was able to use it to work remotely for a day, but I did need to use a mobile hotspot for my daughter to do homework. Not really anything the host can do about that until Verizon brings high speed fiber to the area.
The backyard is big and private. Great place for my youngest to get some wiggles out.
You can tell the host has put a lot of effort and love into the place. Would stay there again."

I've had the incredible opportunity to travel the world, experiencing countless Airbnb accommodations along the way, but I must say that my recent 10 day stay in my hometown was an absolute standout. This hidden gem is hands down the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. It feels like family. You can tell it hasn't been used as a party house. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the warm and welcoming ambiance of this home. In the heart of my hometown, it offered the perfect blend of comfort and peace. . It felt like stepping into our own home within my hometown. The host ebony, let's call her 'Mrs. Hospitality Guru,' deserves special mention. Her genuine passion for ensuring their guests have an exceptional stay was evident from the moment I made the reservation. They went above and beyond. Lastly, I must mention the exceptional value for money. The price was an absolute steal. We are DEFINATLEY booking again. Must success Ebony"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family and I were thrilled that the ""Dollhouse"" was just as described. The house was extremely clean and had everything we could possibly need but food and the supermarket was across the street to take care of that!
This place was so adorable. I look forward to staying there again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"She was very great, and worked with last minute issues to prove us the house within an hr of reaching out."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our 2nd year staying at this beautiful home, and it won‚Äôt be our last!
It‚Äôs a home away from home for my family and I.
This home is great but it‚Äôs the kitchen for me, if I may be honest! The setup is big enough where my whole family can be in the same room and not be in my way.
The entire home: Top Tier
Cleanliness: Top Tier
Communication: Top Tier
Reasonable Rate: Top Tier
My Host Annette: Top Notch Top Tier
Y‚Äôall better come on and get y‚Äôall a stay here"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our guys enjoyed their stay, it was perfect their needs."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As soon as I walked in the door I was floored. The pictures were exactly how she described in her listing. I was so impressed. The spacious kitchen allowed me to cook for my mom surprise 80th bday party in peace. I felt like was home. Annette puts her heart into her air bnb and it shows. I will be back home in July and I look forward to renting from her again.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"By far the best air b&b stay, very well kept home. I definitely would go back if I had the chance."
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was impeccably clean and well stocked.
The two bedrooms upstairs were extremely small and did not allow privacy to egress from one bedroom to the bathroom.
You have to go through one bedroom to get to the bathroom. The stairs were entirely too steep. My husband and I could not navigate the stairs and had to sleep downstairs.
My two grandsons had to sleep on cots (not roll-a-way beds) in the living room.
We were uncomfortable having a section of the house locked off and not sure if anyone was coming back to use it."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Hidden gem.
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"My group and I was very impressed with the location. We enjoyed our stay. And we all said, that we will try to continue to reserve this airbnb whenever we visit Greenville MS, if it's available. Great place to stay. I didn't want to leave."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The home was spacious, beautifully decorated, and in the perfect location. The host were very professional and very responsive. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home away from home, excellent energy!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great Place to stay
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was great! The house was clean and equipped with everything we needed during our stay‚Ä¶.and the bed was super comfy! Annette was quick with her responses and even helped with finding a nail shop in the area! I would definitely stay at her place again while visiting Greenville! 10/10 recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Lillie‚Äôs house was amazing. Beautiful throughout. A real home away from home. Annette was very responsive and polite. I am from Greenville and will book this home again. Patio was a plus.
2023-08-01,4.0,Group trip,Our stay at Lillie's Manor was wonderful. The house was very clean and cool in the hot temps outside. Annette allowed us to check in early and was very responsive throughout the process
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great older house, completely remodeled. Modern appliances in the kitchen, good lighting, adequate A/C (even in this unbearably hot August in Mississippi). A great place, friendly host, no problems at all. Will rent again if opportunity arises."
2023-07-01,3.0,Group trip,"The inside and outside is nice but considering it's an old house, the smell can not be masked by Pine-sol. The patio was over taken by dead bugs, dirt and leaves. The kitchen was not swept because a dead roach was on the floor, dents and cracks in the wall and ceiling, the fridge not clean on the inside, spider webs in the attic shower and blue room. I could go on but the home is not functional for 8 people, nor such a large refrigerator, which blocks cabinets. Not to mention the attic is not insulated so the air had to be placed on 60 in order for the upstairs to cool. This house may be acceptable if you and your family will spend more time out and about than inside."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Annette's house is very spacious and clean. The stairs to the upper bedrooms are very steep and the light switch is just downstairs - no changeover switch. There are only 4 sets of dishes in the kitchen, so the stay with 6 people is only possible to a limited extent. The house is very stylish and furnished with a lot of love for detail. A place to feel good and relax."
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great place for the area. Clean and well stocked. We enjoyed our stay. Clean linens and the beds were comfortable. The second floor, however; is very steep I would not recommend for young children or the elderly. The second bedroom is not private was not a problem in our family, but just be aware. Thank you again for a great stay. Would return again if in the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lillie‚Äôs Manor was an awesome place to stay. It was a home away from home. The entire home was very accommodating. We would recommend Lillie‚Äôs Manor as the play to stay when in Greenville.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was so cute, cozy, and comfortable! Annette was always helpful and was a great host! It was a great place to stay at!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"My sisters and I enjoyed our stay at Lillie Manor. It has lots of space and we felt safe. The home is nice, clean and beautifully decorated. We will stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Was My First Airbnb Experience. I Must Say It Was EVERYTHING!!! This Place Was Clean, Safe, Awesome Location. It Offered More Than Enough Sleeping Space. What I Was Most Impressed With Was The Off Street Parking In The Rear. My Family and I Loved Lillie‚Äôs Manor And Will Be Again In The Very Near Future.
Thanx So Much Annette For Making My Very First Airbnb Experience One To Remember.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family used this house for a home away from home as we came to town to lay our father to rest. Coming from different states, this was a great spot for us to be together. We especially loved the choices of sitting areas as well as multiple sleeping accommodations. This really made us feel as if we were home. We would certainly use this house again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Ms. Annette is Great! The house felt like home! Spacious, clean, an accommodating!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Less than 5 minutes off the highway and everything was exactly as described. Very convenient location, pristine, plenty of linens. I‚Äôm traveling with my family and group home and it‚Äôs so nice to have our stops be stress free. Thank you to our host!"

The house was super clean and had more than the comforts of home. I highly recommend booking this home. The home was centrally located to our favorite restaurants and near our family. So spacious for family to spread out. We‚Äôll be booking this home again!
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was just as pictured upon arrival. The only issue we had with cleanliness was a couple of the pans were dirty when we removed them from underneath the cabinet. Everything else was super clean. There also was not enough toilet paper or paper towels available so we ran out the second day of our stay, and there were no trash bags available for the kitchen so we had to use our own plastic bags. The rooms upstairs were pretty cold, but several heaters were available to use which was awesome. Overall, the house was very nice and my family enjoyed having so much space. I would choose to stay here again."

I would absolutely recommend this house and this host."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a pleasant surprise. I‚Äôm from the delta so I had my reservations about what an air bnb could be there, but I was very pleased.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house was super CLEAN. We very much appreciated that. Owner was very responsive with communication. Beds were comfortable!

We truly enjoyed our stay while in town for a family reunion. Plenty of space! Would stay again!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was absolutely wonderful! It was very accommodating for me and my family. So much space we were able to all have our own area when needed. The neighborhood is very quiet and well kept. We did have a minor issue with plumbing but it was resolved very quickly. I look forward to booking this place again for our next visit.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Annette‚Äôs home is extremely nice and clean. Best Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed at! Very roomy and spacious!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely space with lots of spread out space. One attic room sleeps a little warm for the summer but we had enough space without having to use that room. I will definitely come back and stay longer.

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great space. Feels light and open. Perfect for families. Annette was highly communicative, easily assessible, helpful and accommodating. My Aunt was in a wheelchair and there was no access for her so please consider that if you need handicap accessible. Also, the attic sleeps a little warm. I would definitely stay again anytime I need to visit Greenville."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, would definitely recommend!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you ever need a place like home, look no further. The home was immaculate, clean and in a ""great"" and ""quiet"" location.

Thank you for hosting my family."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was spotlessly clean! It has multiple places to gather and enjoy conversations. Everything looked brand new - fresh paint, new furniture, new fluffy towels! Great off-street parking and easy access to the house."

The host was very professional and Kind. I hosted an older group of relatives and they had a blast fellowshipping with each other. This property overflowed the five star scale. I will be using this Air BNB again soon.... Makeysha ONeal from Dallas,Tx"
2021-12-01,4.0,Group trip,"Great place for larger groups, home is very nice and the neighborhood is convenient."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What can I say:
My family and I stayed at Lillie‚Äôs Manor Thanksgiving week. The overall experience was simply amazing!! The home was spotless and smelled so clean. What I loved most was the option to set the alarm system as we went to and fro! It made us feel safe and secure. When we ran into a minor hiccup, April was there to save the day, even on Thanksgiving day!!!
Parking is located in an alley which can be dark at night and it can get a little muddy when it rains. Other than that, everything else was more than expected!
This has been by far the BEST AirBnB, we‚Äôve stayed at in Greenville and our permanent go-to spot when visiting going forward!"

Everything you might need is provided at the house and there is lots of local information at hand as well. Highly recommended!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time at this cabin - despite the dreary weather. The kitchen and living room were spacious and comfy. The decks and screened porch were wonderful! The wood stove kept us cozy. The sun finally came out on the day we were leaving - and the view at dawn was exceptional with a placid lake, pink sky, flocks of birds, trees reflected in the water. The fenced yard for the dogs was ideal and made traveling with our pets a piece of cake. West was a fantastic host. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a little too expensive for only 2 days but I guess that's how the world is now. If it weren't so expensive I'd go back all the time, but I'm also a single mom so I stay broke with 2 teens, lol.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We came for a funeral, so there was not a lot available where dogs were allowed on such short notice. We found exactly what we needed. This was private and refreshing to be next to water. The Airbnb has most of what you would need on a day to day basis. The bed was so comfortable. It is very isolated, not near other houses. The host was very quick to reply when I had any questions. Pictures don't do justice. This place was beautiful and met our needs. We will be staying there every time now to visit my grandmother. Highly recommend."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Nothing negative to say

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Everything was perfect
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in the area for a family reunion at Lake Chicot State Park. When a family member discovered that all the cabins at the park were booked, I found Jonathan's Water's Edge Oasis. We decided to let the family member have our cabin at the park and we would drive the 5 miles back and forth to Water's Edge. It was a great decision! Comfortable beds, nice appliances and a great outdoor area. The cabin is exactly as describe and depicted in the pictures. So much nicer than the park cabins!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It was perfect! Quiet, peaceful and the sheets and bed were amazing! Loved it was next to the water and will return as we have family nearby and will come visit more and more! Thank you Jonathan, your response time was great and your directions took us directly to the cabin! Will stay again!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was perfect for what we where looking for. Very comfortable and AC worked great. Plenty of outside plugs to hook up boats. A outside light would of been nice but all together great stay. Oh yea don‚Äôt leave the front porch light on after dark. Bugs swarm to it.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great cabin on the water. Nice and quiet/no one nearby. Well stocked with coffee/other pantry items
Nice break from hotels on our cross-country trip.
Loved it!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Decent place to stay overnight for our family while passing through on the way home from the beach! Only issue we had was finding the home, address took us to an intersection. Use the provided coordinates and it‚Äôll take you right to it!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Follow the coordinates address doesn‚Äôt get you there
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Loved the location. We had a great time cooking on the bbq grill and sitting outside. Nice cabin and slept like a baby
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I booked the place because i was working in the area and I was stuck for an extra week at the last minute. Jonathan was so accommodating i was able to extend my stay with no issues. I love fishing and with two available docs it was easy to come in after work and walk down to the docs and throw in a line. The fishing is different than at home but that just makes it fun. I would recommend bringing lots of bug spray when the sun goes down the mosquitoes come out and they are relentless i would recommend burning a citronella candel on the front porch. The place was awesome and i definitely would recommend even just for a night or two i will definitely be looking for future stays with this location.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Second time we‚Äôve been there. It‚Äôs quiet , comfortable and meets every expectation we have. Hope we can keep staying there in years to come. Just a really great feng shui about this property"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful quiet spot on a creek. Cabin was updated and comfortable. BRING BUG SPRAY. It was lovely to hear crickets and frogs chirping and see incredible star gazing at night, but being on the water in rural Arkansas there are a lot of bugs outside. We appreciated the tranquil location and views of the Milky Way!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Don't forget your fishing pole! Water's Edge is a great place to drop a line from your choice of 2 piers. The channel to Lake Chicot is right outside the front door and the fish nursery is just a little bit upstream. The house is exactly as pictured and very cozy and quiet. Jonathan was very helpful with directions when GPS sent us the wrong direction. It's truly a getaway with no WiFi so leave your cares and phone at home.

,,,"Worse Airbnb place I ever stayed at I felt isolated in this house and everything was locked couldn‚Äôt go out the back door to patio house smells old inside they need to spray for roaches and fix all the lights that were not working in the master room bathroom where the toilet is at sorry but I‚Äôll
Never stay hear again couldn‚Äôt even wash my
Clothes with that old washer they have there it was plugged if for what ever reason üò©üôÑ"
,,,"The house and furniture is old smelly and out dated. I didn‚Äôt want to complain cause we was only there for two nights, Being a woman of color, things can be very difficult for us so I didn‚Äôt complain. The chairs in the kitchen was removed out of the kitchen, just because we seen the leg on the chair weak and
rigged together.The sink was not left in the condition of the photo.. it was cleaned.When it comes down to the dishwasher, the young men (14-15 years) called their self cleaning up.. (they were not aware )the outside patio has rusty nail sticking out of the boards the host has a piece of wood, holding it up didn‚Äôt notice it to after she sit down.. there was no smoking of any kind inside of the home. My uncle was help your cleaning assistant with removing the bedding off the bed n sit his cigar down on the dresser pieces of it had to fall out .There was a mixup in between checkout time. I thought it was 11 o‚Äôclock and we didn‚Äôt help your cleaning lady take off the bedding. I believe we would‚Äôve been out there between 10:15. It‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre looking scam me out of some more money with that outdated house you need.the house needs a professional deep cleaning"
