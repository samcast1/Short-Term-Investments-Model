2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Travis really made us feel at home! We had a great time and would definitely try to stay again! I loved the peaceful and accommodating space! Beautiful
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was very nice with old charm. We enjoyed our stay. This house has so much potential if there were a few updates (but for the price we paid it was a steal). If it had updated furniture in the bedrooms and a sitting area with book shelf in the master this house could get triple what it’s renting for now. Great location!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a architecture or bibliophile's dream location. It is an adorable farm house in historic district. My three year was ready to leave our house and permanently move in. He especially loved the game room. The hosts are really accommodating and responsive.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Thank you for a great stay. The location was great for me while I was visiting family in the area!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay for a relaxing getaway. I appreciated the old home feel with the hardwood floors upstairs with the comforts of updated utilities. Travis was very helpful with any questions I had and was extremely responsive. I look forward to staying here again next time I visit the area.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis was an amazing host with an amazing house! I had questions about check in Travis was very responsive and accommodating. The house was beautiful, spacious, and clean! I rented the house for family coming into town and the location is great as well. private enough where it was a relaxing place to come back to each night, but near enough to all major attractions.
I will definitely be renting this house again!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis's house was a fantastic place to stay for a few days. The house was quiet, private and comfortable. Travis was very helpful and communicative leading up to the stay. Would love to stay again, thanks for the hospitality!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Thank you Travis
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Travis was a great host. Everything was clean, his instructions were clear. Of note, I thought I'd left a piece of jewelry at his home and he was graciously going to go look for it and mail it back. I ended up finding it in my luggage, but it was very nice of him to be so open to doing so. I can't recommend this place enough."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Very easy to fine
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The location was important to me. Our host was available for any questions even before arrival which I appreciated. Best part of the home for me was the updated tub and shower. Looking forward to another stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,House was clean and comfy. Was in town for a wedding and this worked out perfect for our needs.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Travis was a great host, and we enjoyed our stay very much. We arrived late and found everything exactly as planned. It made the trip worth it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Travis is a very nice host to answer our questions promptly. The surroundings are quiet and beautiful.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great location to check out Watkins Glenn. Really spacious house with everything you could need. Travis was so kind- when there was a city wide power outage for hours, I texted him asking if there were candles in the house. Travis drove over to the house and brought us 6 candles!!!! He stayed to check that we were able to light the candles. This was definitely something he did not need to do, truly thoughtful."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts are quick, easy and clear to communicate with. House was lovely and clean, and a perfect location for our quick stay in Elmira."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis was a great host and extremely friendly. The place was nice and clean, very private area. Also a great find/affordable place, would definitely come back again! :)"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the second time we've stayed here and we will again! We visit family in this area often. Travis was very accommodating. We checked in early, Travis was very responsive with helping us with this. Very clean!!! Thanks again! We'll be back."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and super cozy! They had everything we forgot.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,My family stayed at this home and was very impressed with home amenities and host communication. Well worth the stay and price!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay here. Extremely affordable and lots of space. Plenty of modern conveniences although this was an older property. Given the age of the house, there was definitely a lingering odor here and plenty of devices to mask the smell."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The house was just as described, plenty of space, clean, and in a peaceful area. We would love to return when visiting the area."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place, very clean, had all supplies , ideal place for a few people to stay. Excellent host and very responsive."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was very welcoming and in a good neighborhood, very quiet. Travis was very kind and reached out after check in to see if there was anything that we needed. Would definitely stay here again the next time we visit!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"It took us a bit to check in, but Travis was very helpful — turns out our difficulties were because we were checking in 20 minutes early! The place was spotless and we liked the little “extras” placed throughout. We had no problems at all checking out this morning."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We only stayed one night so I don't have much to say. The house was clean and the hosts were very willing to help with any needs.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is as described, and the checkout requests were very minimal."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A fantastic place to stay. Lots of room for a family of 4. Very quiet neighborhood and the house sits a good distance from the road.
Great place for walking. I did two walks a day and a few were very late night walks and the area is super safe.
Travis was on the ball with everything and his communications went above and beyond.
Highly recommended and we would certainly stay there again when in the area.
Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Nice place to stay. Older home but very clean and welcoming. Close to Elmira College. 6 adults stayed comfortably. Great touch with coffee. Nice neighborhood. Outdoor space was nice to have. A grill and picnic table would have made it even better. Great communication from the hosts.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The property was as advertised. In a good location in West Elmira. It especially worked for us because it was also dog friendly. The house has AC but the upper floor was a bit stuffy due to pre-AC floor registers vs ceiling vents. There were numerous fans that helped out. Ceiling fans in the bedrooms would be a worthwhile upgrade. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful in the evening. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and spices with selected condiments in the refrigerator. The property book was very well thought out. The internet seemed a bit spotty at times. We would definitely consider it again in the future.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! Thank you for your hospitality!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night at Travis’ house on our way to Buffalo. It was clean and served well for our short stay.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend great location easy to contact very responsive clean house very spacious quiet neighborhood
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, good parking, clean, nice little provisions from the hosts!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Travis was very responsive to my messages. He and his wife had an assortment of various little things that people sometimes forget staged throughout the house from eggs in the refrigerator to batteries to bathroom supplies. Their attention to such details was appreciated.
My kids loved playing air hockey. The beds were quite comfortable and there was plenty of space to put our clothes from dressers to closets. The house is in the heart of West Elmira with an assortment of convenience stores, restaurants, and grocery stores within a short drive. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"5 stars : a nice place for $75 ?
I needed 3 bedrooms for relatives meeting there and also a well behaved dog. ( Swiss mountain dog mix) . Even though it was freezing he loved the walks along the River!
It could definitely use at least one comfortable chair in living room but the camping chairs were actually fine. Sofa comfy.
I will rent it again but will bring a couple mirrors. ( 4 women, a mirror in upstairs bathroom) I can’t comment on the downstairs bathroom since we ( women) didn’t use it.
I left a couple days early because of a surprise ice storm coming to Buffalo. In hindsight ( I still have no tv and the ice is still covering everything), I wish I had asked if I could have extended the stay instead of shortening it!!
They seem like very nice hosts. Springtime will be gorgeous and walkable. ( I grew up very close by on the same street)
Thank you guys!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great place and neighborhood.owner keeps in touch and checks to see how was your stay and if you need anything.would definitely use again

Perfect space size for our group
Comfortable beds and small details well supplied and thought out. Would not hesitate to return-"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my second stay at this house. It is very well supplied and , also, very comfortable! Great location as the neighborhood is quiet and scenic. The host is so responsive. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Elmira"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great area and beautiful home. very clean house and peaceful neighborhood. will stay again next for my sons basketball tournament held every year here.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Travis is a wonderful host and made our stay feel like home. His communication is 5 stars! We visited family in Elmira for Christmas and to our surprise the living room had a Christmas tree and stocking over the fireplace. It was a nice surprise since we were away from our home. The house was very clean and had spacious rooms. The kitchen had everything we needed and we used the coffee bar every morning. Next time we are visiting family in Elmira we will be sure to book this house. Thank you Travis!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host and great property
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Clean but an old house
The floor is noisy when you walk and some of the closet doors not working
There is no mirrors in any bedroom. The only one is in the bathroom."
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"There were lots of nice things about this house. It was reasonably spacious and pleasantly furnished, easy to locate, quiet, and the beds and linens were extremely comfortable. There was a thoughtfully put-together loose-leaf with area information and a nice grouping of useful materials in the kitchen, including a cookbook. The upstairs bathroom had a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner/shower gel and there were plenty of nice towels. Check-in was easy and there was lots of parking.
However, things could have been better with a little more effort and maintenance, at minimal cost to the owner. With respect to maintenance, the lightbulb in the downstairs toilet (which is tiny - more of a 1/4 bathroom than a 1/2 bathroom) was burned out, and a bolt was missing from the seat; many of the doors upstairs did not actually close; the doors upstairs also needed oiling; the coffee pot was not working properly. It would have been difficult to use the lovely cookbook that was there since the kitchen was missing basic items like cutting knives, a bread knife (or at least a serrated knife), a cutting board, and a grater. There also were no small glasses or wine glasses. In addition, there was only service for 4 . Finally, with the added cleaning charge, it does not seem reasonable to ask guest to strip beds and load and start the laundry and dishwasher."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great stay! The place was very homey in general, the dining and the game room were our favorite spots in this spacious house"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. I had some difficulty locating the access code on the site but excellent communication from the host quickly remedied the situation. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a great time visiting friends in Elmira NY. One of the highlights of the trip was our rental home - Travis and his wife were super helpful and their home was warm and welcoming. If you need a great place to stay I highly recommend you look these folks up!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Really accommodating and communicative host, and the stay was comfortable for our group of 5 plus a dog."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay and host was gracious enough to give us a late checkout

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This house is an absolute gem. Everything was clean. The beds were comfortable. The coffee maker was awesome and had to-go cups. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, and there were no worries coming and going after dark. Travis, the host, was available immediately when we had a question. And he made sure everything was perfect. Planning a trip back to Elmira in about a year and I will immediately book this house again once the dates are announced."
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very tidy and lovely home. It is equipped with everything you need. Comfortable beds clean nice bathrooms. Travis is a great host and there when you need him. Card games and air hockey were fun! We had a great stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I love staying at Brandon's AirBNB. perfect space with full desk and a few blocks from downtown and Hoffman St. looking forward to the next trip.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon has an amazing apartment space (the whole lower floor of this beautiful historical Victorian home) and he was a fantastic host! He sent me everything I needed to know well before the trip; check in was super-easy, and the place not only was super clean; but is tastefully decorated with a variety of ""period-pieces"" - it really felt like I was transported into another time; but still with all of today's amenities (such as wifi and ROKU). I can't say enough about this place and it will be my ""go-to"" whenever I'm back in town if its available. Thanks so much, Brandon!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon deserves 7 stars.
Easy transaction in all ways, Brandon even gave food recommendations in addition to opening his home and providing food and drink access in the fridge
The historic charm and history of the neighborhood was so cool to walk
The home was so warm and welcoming, he rolled the red carpet out.
We will definitely be staying again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brandon's place was an absolute delight and beautiful. He was very responsive with our communication. His place is in a nice location to see the sights of the Elmira area and close to great eateries. I would definitely stay here again. Absolute bargain for the price.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time at Brandon's spacious and historic apartment. It was huge, yet cosy, and full of character. It was well stocked with amenities and was truly a very comfortable and lovely stay. Thank you, Brandon!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Brandon was a fantastic host from start to finish. He even offered to drive me to the airport when I had difficulty finding a ride at an insanely early hour. Very responsive, friendly, and accommodating."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved staying at Brandon's place. The inside is like you are walking back in time to the early 1900s with the conveniences of today. Looked like original floors and woodwork throughout this 1880s house. Located a few blocks from some restaurants - on Hoffman St., and plenty of parking. Hope to stay here longer during my next visit."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great apartment for our stay in Elmira, NY. we thoroughly enjoyed the decor."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful, clean, spacious home! Brandon has definitely gone the extra mile to make sure your stay here will be a home away from home. The kitchen is well stocked and filled with goodies, the bathroom had plenty of extra towels, and it was such a treat to use the fireplace on cold nights. I will be making another trip to Elmira simply to stay in this home again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very spacious apartment with many amenities. Great location within walking distance to great restaurants and bars.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon's place boasts stylish decor and a prime location. My stay there was thoroughly enjoyable, and I highly recommend it to anyone planning to explore the region, particularly Watkins Glen, downtown Corning, and the Museum of Glass."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cool space and an amazing value for what you pay for. Did not love the giant deer head over the bed but that was the only drawback.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute little place! Exactly as described and I loved that Brandon’s description was very honest. He was extremely friendly, responsive and proactive in messaging me! I would highly recommend and would stay again if in the area."

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I wanted a mini girls trip to Watkins Glen and found this lovely home to stay at. We walked in and fell in love with the place. It seriously felt like we were transported back in time and we had a blast. Clean, spacious, and comfortable! The only thing that wasn’t mentioned was that there is no temperature control on the oven so as soon as you light it, you have to put the food in to cook and watch it very carefully. Overall, we def recommend and want to come back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I loved everything about this place. If you like old homes, this is it! The kitchen smelled just like my grandmother’s kitchen."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As soon as we got to Brandon's place we felt immediately at home! it's a shame we could only stay one day, but even the one night was so relaxing. It's homey, warm, and inviting. Everything was clean and ready to use for us when we got in. Before we left we even got to sit in the beautiful back garden that was so tranquil. I would most definitely come back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful historic house in the heart of Elmira
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon's place is amazing. The house is very old and beautiful, with a Victorian style.
One bedroom with a large and comfortable bed, a very full kitchen. The accommodation has several more rooms, one of which is a large living room with a TV, and a couple more of little use but incredibly decorated. A period dining room with a table prepared with a cutlery and crockery like the 19th century, and a music desk, including an old Stanway&Sons piano (sorry it's in pretty disrepair and out of tune, but it gives a surprising vibe) The decor is very eclectic. There's a moose head on the bed. Maybe someone can disturb you. My wife and I thought it was fun.
Definitely one of the most unique homes we've been to. Thank you so much Brandon for your kindness and offering this very special place!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brandon’s place was a great place to stop. Very comfortable and clean! I would absolutely stay there again!

If you have a chance to stay at Brandons apartment do not hesitate."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We stayed for 6-months during the pandemic and wanted to come back. We stayed a month this time and we had an equally amazing experience. Brandon is a great host. Highly recommend.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We spent six nights in Brandon's beautiful Victorian house. The space is huge with several large rooms, all featuring an eclectic mix of fascinating furnishings and collections. If you like old houses, this is a wonderful find!
Brandon was very responsive when asked questions. The space is furnished with everything that anyone could need while staying there. I especially appreciated having a coffeemaker with coffee available for our use. There was plenty of hot water and a good shower.
We were there during a very hot heat wave, but the AC unit kept the bedroom cool enough to sleep well in the comfortable bed.
Our little dog enjoyed the fenced-in yard as well as walks around the neighborhood, which is in a historic district filled with Victorian-era homes. A large grocery store is two minutes away by car.
Highly recommended for anyone visiting Elmira."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Brandon was an amazing host - he was very friendly and very responsive! Brandon was able to provide us with a beautiful, clean, and mess-free space to stay!

The neighbourhood was very walkable - we really enjoyed exploring the different historical sites!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous property filled with beautiful eclectic artwork. We found this place as a random halfway point on our drive to Maine, but immediately upon unpacking for the night we knew we had to try to book it again for the drive back. This property was worth our 7 hour drive even if we hadn't traveled anywhere afterwards, it's beautiful and super unique! The neighborhood is filled with impressive, funky historic buildings that we really loved seeing as well. Book the Friendly house if you appreciate art and history, as well as impeccable interior design! Our host Brandon was incredibly helpful and nice, we will def stay here again the next time we head up north!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Brandon is a super friendly host. Our pup got along well with his dog. He was very responsive to any questions and fixed an issue we had immediately. The apartment is awesome ! Lots to look at for sure. Extremely roomy- the pictures don’t really do justice to the size of the apartment. Loved the access to the nice backyard and being able to be out there with our pup. We will definitely be back !!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic location! This property is absolutely beautiful and super peaceful. The host is helpful and responsive. My boyfriend and I loved it so much, we immediately booked a second stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon’s, house it’s an authentic historic place,it’s very comfortable, I stayed 2 nights and I wish that I could stay longer. Huge space for just 2 persons, the kitchen nice and well equipped for prepare breakfast and dinner. Clean and well illuminated the whole apartment. I recommend his place to whoever want to spend few days relaxing upstate. For sure I will stay at his place again. Thanks Brandon for hosting us."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a nice big space with lots of antiquey things. Always something interesting to see, lots of books if you're there long enough to read them. Generous kitchen. I felt comfortable there."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay at Brandon's place. It's larger than it looks in the photos and certainly one of the most interesting places we've stayed in terms of all the decorations/antiques in there. Bed and sofa both comfortable. We were a bit concerned that our one-year-old would break something but everything was generally above baby height so it's a relatively baby-friendly place despite everything on display.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Brandon is a friendly, responsive host with an equally friendly dog. His place is stunning- truly palacial!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very wonderful, very spacious and lovely decor, loved every second although the floors are very squeaky 😭 I felt like I was being very loud"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stopped over in Elmira with our one-year old on our way to Canada and were thrilled to find Brandon's place. What a gem! It feels like it's rare to find such a unique and homey place on AirBnB these days -- this apartment is full of character and so many thoughtful touches like oatmeal, popcorn, and small chocolates by the bed. Since we were stopping through on a workday with a baby, Brandon was flexible with our timing, which we really appreciated. We loved making food in the kitchen, hanging in the backyard, and exploring the apartment. He was also very attentive to the fact we have an almost-toddler -- but the apartment was spacious, carpeted, and a great place to entertain her for the day. Thanks for a lovely stay, we'll be back!"
2023-05-01,3.0,Stayed one night,Good interesting stay. Would’ve been nice to know that the thermostat & heat didn’t work before booking. Slept very cold that night.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for business at the chemung fairgrounds and chose the place because it was so charming and very close. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood after the work day and check out some amazing architecture! We were more comfortable than we expected to be and were a little bummed to not be there for a downtime getaway.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was so interesting and cool! It looks like the host kept the rooms as original as possible, with large pocket doors and period pieces. Everything was very clean and well kept, the backyard was beautiful. Make sure to look at how to get into the house and where to park, this doesn't have dedicated parking but I never had a problem parking on the side street. The windows look original as well so I was able to hear some road noise from outside but that's my only gripe. There were QI chargers on each side of the bed as well so I never needed my charger. Definitely recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Brandon's perfectly clear instructions, photos, and description made it super easy for us to check into this ground floor apartment in a historic townhouse. The space is so unique, full of funky, eclectic details and decor (including a collection of antique musical instruments, mounted antelope and caribou heads on walls, colorful stained glass in the powder room, a grand dining room table with festive seasonal settings, and beautiful plants everywhere).
The bed was comfy, we enjoyed the morning sun in the backyard, and the neighborhood was lovely to walk our little dog and look at some cool architecture. Parking was easy and the location was convenient. We will definitely look to reserve this apartment again if and when we next visit the area!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a gem! An incredibly cool, historic home with treasures everywhere you look. The decor fits the home—it’s like staying in a museum. It’s very clean and nicely furnished with everything you could possibly need. Tons of great books and when I saw an “Ab Fab” magnet on the fridge, I knew fate brought me to this house! Ha!
Brandon is an exceptional host. He communicated clearly, and made us feel at home. The house notes were super helpful. Check in was easy and we appreciated the drawings and photographs that clearly illustrated where to park and how to get inside. Small bathroom but who cares? Bed was comfortable. House creaks and noises were charming. We just loved staying here and will definitely return!
The neighborhood is nice and suburban. Stores and dining options are walkable, but a quick car ride expands to even more options. There’s so much to do in the area, we stayed super busy but wished we had more time to just chill at the house! This one deserves ALL the stars."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon was an excellent host. He was friendly, responsive and eager to help with any questions I had. The house is beautiful and unique, with amazing antiques and a friendly artistic atmosphere. I will look to book at this Air B&B in all future trips up to the area for work or play."
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed over a week,Brandon was a great host. However the presence of a loud upstairs neighbor right above the bedroom made it very difficult to sleep without ear plugs in.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brandon’s place is a true gem in Elmira. Such a cool space and fun stay. Highly recommend this stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon has a truly amazing place and I felt like a special guest staying there. It's like going back in time but with all the modern comforts. I especially appreciated having breakfast food provided and the wireless chargers by the bed! Check-in and check-out were easy and I had no issues during my stay. It was quite quiet inside the apartment--it's an old house so you'll hear the upstairs neighbors walking around, but it wasn't an issue that affected my stay. Street parking is easy and was always available. This is truly a one-of-a-kind stay and you won't regret choosing it!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely!! Better than the description. Will definitely return if in the area.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Brandon was friendly, helpful and responsive. The place had a ton of space, with cheerful holiday decorations. Thank you for having us stay!"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The space is just as advertised. Has to be seen to be believed. Will stay here next time I’m in town.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Homey in every way. Space was decorated beautifully. Enjoyed this space immensely!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We ended up having to cancel our trip, and communication with Brandon throughout the process was excellent. His responses were prompt and thoughtful, and we will definitely look here again next time we are in town."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved everything about this listing. The historic feel was quite charming. Highly recommend for couples looking to be near everything but still desire to
have their own private space."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely stunning place. We loved all the details and it was the perfect location for us. We highly recommend staying here if you are in the area.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Gorgeous apartment with a lot of history and personality. We loved all the fall decor. Brandon was incredibly accommodating and responsive. Hands down the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very unusual, in many ways charming, rental. For example, when is the last time you arrived to find a dining room table set for twelve with China and silver?"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Remarkable furnishings in an apartment in a convenient spot with easy parking.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon's apartment was an excellent place to stay while driving through New York State. I wanted to visit the Mark Twain locations and local museum in Elmira, and the apartment is close to downtown and really well located. The house is a Victorian beauty with incredible woodwork. The interior was homey, very comfortable, and full of vintage style. The full kitchen is nice to have - wish I could have stayed longer, for sure. Not too far away is Patrick's Irish Pub, which was neighborly and a good place to grab a quick burger, and for breakfast we enjoyed Downtown Grind coffee."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Exquisite home. Check in was easy and Brandon is super responsive to messages. I highly recommend staying here.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house is filled with so many amazing treasures and eye candy. So much comfort and Brandon’s hospitality is above and beyond. This is a real find!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Outstanding, eclectic, sophisticated property! It’s like walking into a museum of art, furniture and memorabilia! Brandon responds immediately and makes you feel at home!
Thanks, Brandon!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Incredibly furnished & gorgeous historical details — I booked just for an overnight break on a road trip & was totally blown away! Brandon is a very generous and communicative host as well. Totally recommend
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed one night. Beautiful apartment. Would book again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The place was absolutely amazing and I can say the photos do it no justice! It feels like you’ve stepped into a piece of history and it’s so beautifully preserved.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,We needed an extended stay while my husband was in town for a 2+ week job and this was absolutely perfect. It checked all the boxes for us. I didn’t have a vehicle while my husband worked and I didn’t even need it. Neat restaurants within walking distance and plenty of delivery options to be overwhelmed with. If we’re ever back in the area we will rebook. Brandon was a delight!!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lovely place with cool decor. Brandon os an attentive and kind host!

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If Brandon’s place is open when your looking for a place to stay, you need to book it! We just spent 13 days there and it was great! It is easy to see why Brandon is a Super Host! He is very responsive, had great suggestions for us and is just a very nice guy! The home is very well stocked, very comfortable and a great location for us. We will definitely stay here again in the future."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brandon’s home is marvelous. His role as a host is unmatched. What an incredibly welcoming and relaxing space. I can not recommend enough!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,A great place to stay. Brandon pays great attention to detail. You will enjoy your stay here.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb. It could be my last, as how could anything match Brandon's place? Looking at it online, I thought it was too good to be true, but the reviews were exceptional and I confirmed our reservation. Sadly, we were just passing through on our way from Canisteo back to Boston, so we were only there overnight. What a gorgeous, unique, well apportioned and totally cool apartment. It had everything we would've needed and far more! The space itself, the furniture, the decor, all of the food, drink and supplies - what more could we need? The outdoor space looked extremely inviting as well. I DO hope that we can come by another time and spend more than an overnight there. Thanks so much, Brandon!!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! Great location, very clean, well stocked, very comfortable. Loved the large screen TV...too often you get a tiny, old TV. Place is exactly as described."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing, eclectic place! So spacious, wonderfully appointed and a great place for a quick family gathering. Attentive host when the internet needed tending too! Thank you for our great stay."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Brandon is a great host. His place is a comfortable and unique place to stay.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Excellent stay again, love the apartment. Would love to be here all the time."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Brandon is a very gracious and responsive host. This is a special place, well provisioned by your host. Do not hesitate to book it."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I wholeheartedly concur with Andrew’s December 2021 review – about not really “getting it” until you go inside and the enchantment of the “Christmas experience.” We had a thoroughly pleasant three day stay.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You won't truly ""get it"" until you arrive. Perhaps you won't be the recipient of the special Christmas experience, but I'm guessing the home evolves as the seasons do. This is a huge, beautiful home from the outside, but walking in to this airbnb, our mouths dropped. My girlfriend was certain that we had entered the wrong place. After wandering around for about an hour we began to settle in. Coziness abounds. As does the whimsical and downright cheerful vibe. We lit fires, took a bath, cooked in the outrageously stocked kitchen (be sure to add on top of subtracting), found perfect lighting combinations, and generally had such a nourishing couple of day's. How bland life was before airbnb's. Places like this bring such vibrancy to traveling. Bravo!!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great place! beautiful decorations in a historic building that we never get sick of. can't wait to stay again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment is absolutely beautiful, really good value, a stunning historical home. It was also beautifully decorated for Christmas & was just such a pleasant place to stay / got me in the holiday spirit, making my work trip feel more relaxing, cozy etc. I didn't get to meet Brandon, but the check in instructions etc. were all very clear , the kitchen was well stocked & I felt very at home. The only thing I would mention is that if you're traveling in the winter, the heat can be a bit loud at night, but that's to be expected with a historical home & he is super clear about that in the house description. I would definitely highly recommend, it was also a very convenient location if you have business in downtown Elmira."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This place is just a wonderful blend of the eclectic and tasteful...Victorian and modern touches and beautifully decorated for the season. Our two week stay in this historic landmark could not have been more delightful. Brandon is a great host ... quick response to all communications and and requests.
The Kitchen is amazing and completely stocked from bacon and eggs, milk, fruit, all types of spices, canned goods and every gadget and appliance imaginable...we were even able to make cookies for our family and work on the amazing metal kitchen table.
Plenty of hot water, and great temperature control.
Quite a large space that's perfect for entertaining.
We will stay here again for sure!!!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon’s place was absolutely perfect for our 5 night stay. A fully stocked kitchen, delightful decorations and immaculate vibes made for a very good anniversary trip. Brandon was communicative and clear!
We initially had some worries about being warm in an old house (because old houses seem to be universally drafty) but the Nest thermostat made for perfect climate control. Also the Roku had a guest option where we could log into our streaming accounts and it would auto log us out by a set date- never seen that before and it was great!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a such an amazing time at Brandon’s place. A National Historic home came with all of the charm and warmth. Super spacious, clean and cozy with small simple touches that made you feel more than welcome. This may become an annual tradition :)"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I don't even know where to begin. It was such an honor to stay in this stunning historic home. The space is huge, well appointed, comfortable, and lots of nice little amenities from coffee to candy. Check in was easy, and it is a great central location from which to explore the Finger Lakes region."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an awesome place to stay. The house is historic and the apartment is decorated with impeccable taste.
The neighborhood is full of other historic homes and you can download a walking tour if you have time.
We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"An absolutely beautiful Airbnb. Every single room of this home is more amazing than the next. Brandon is an amazing host, with great communication and amazing food tips. Great location for a trip to the Finger Lakes, central to everything and the perfect home base."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful and clean. Many snack and continental breakfast options provided which was great We will book again next time we come this way
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our weekend stay in Brandon's eclectic apartment. We appreciated the comfortable front room and well-stocked kitchen. It was convenient for our visits to Watkins Glen and Corning.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brandon's home is beautifully decorated and extremely cozy. Tons of amenities and charm.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A very spacious first floor apartment in a historic home.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"My husband and I worked at Brandon's place for a couple months during late summer. No real complaints; Brandon does a good job describing the property. We'll give some details that might be interesting for people staying for a long period.
Things we enjoyed:
• Eating and hanging out in the backyard.
• Walking to Farmer's Market on Thursday.
• Walking to Finger Lakes House for drinks.
• Driving to Watkins Glen, Ithica, Rochester, and the Finger Lakes.
• Brandon was very generous in letting us partake of some of his foods and drinks.
• Brandon giving recommendations for things to do.
Cons:
• That section of Elmira is a little rough. We had no incidents at all but it was rough enough to not feel great about walking around too much.
• It's a big house and so light didn't penetrate that far into the house so was a bit dark inside.
• Lot of animal heads on the walls; more than I expected from the pictures. We didn't find that aspect conducive to relaxing"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming and fascinating home to stay in, much more interesting than a hotel. We had so much space to come home to after exploring Watkins Glen, Corning, the lakes and wineries. The house was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate. The kitchen was bright and had everything we needed. The backyard was lovely — Brandon is an avid gardener and we were trying to identify the many plants and flowers. We enjoyed sitting in the Adirondacks and listening to the water fountains and birds. The communication from Brandon was excellent and checking in and out was easy. We would definitely return."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great house to stay in. We enjoyed the backyard as well
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property is amazing. We had a great time and it was located close to family. If you are looking to step back in time, this Is for you. Branson is very communicative and easy to work with."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Another great stay! I've stayed here multiple times, and I appreciate the spot-less, spacious and unique apartment."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We were in Elmira for 10 days to watch my son play baseball and this apartment was perfect for us! I loved the charm and character of the apartment (pocket doors, wood floors, open floor plan, high ceilings…). It has every amenity you will need and was very clean. I spent each morning having coffee in the fenced in backyard looking at the flowers and water features. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to stay in the Elmira area."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This large apartment in an historic building is filled with whimsy and unique decor. Lots of space and lots of consideration make up this pleasant space.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is gorgeous! Elmira is such a cute town, and I highly recommend staying here if you get a chance. Plenty of room, lots of really neat touches and decorations, and a well-stocked kitchen. Brandon was very communicative, and overall, our stay was great."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The apartment was exactly as described and suited our needs for our finger lakes trip perfectly. Brandon's communication is spot on as well.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brandon has a wonderful place to stay and relax in a cute town and a gorgeous old house with beautiful decor the two could not have been any better will for sure be back
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon’s place was amazing! Perfectly located in Elmira we had lots of room in an elegant and beautifully appointed apartment. I travelled with my small dog and appreciated being able to bring him along and have a fenced in yard for him. The bed was super comfortable and I appreciated his “mi casa is su casa” approach.
Too bad our daughter is graduating from Elmira College and we won’t be back regularly in the future. If so
This would be my go
To space."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a wonderful place to stay. There were a ton of little touches that made the space perfect for us! My golden doodle loved the yard and the toys left for him. Amazing historical buildings in the area and great places to walk.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Excellent place. Tons of character. Loved my time here.
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We were searching for a simple place to stay while visiting Watkins Glen and came across this gem. A beautiful historic home in a quiet area. We enjoyed exploring the home as much as the area and the fact that I was able to bring my dog with me was a major plus. If you visit in the winter remember that old homes can get drafty but the bedding Brandon provided was super warm and cozy. Prefect place to crash after a hike.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Excellent place to stay! This was our second stay here and we would definitely stay again! Very comfy and stylish, decorated appropriately for the season, and fresh fruit!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Huge apartment with amazing Victorian decor.
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A huge, gorgeous first floor of a grand Victorian house right on the main street of Elmira. Eclectic, idiosyncratic decor in rooms and spaces literally from another era. Very convenient, very funky, very fun."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stay here, you will not be disappointed! I was in town for business and I wish I had more time at the apartment because it was cozy and so grand! If I’m ever back in the area, this is where I will be staying!"
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is huge ; much bigger than expected. Really cool decor ; was like a mini museum inside. Lots of art and interesting antiques on display. The fenced in yard was bigger than expected too; great for my two little dogs to run around freely in. It's not a private back yard though; it is shared with upstairs tenants. There was a lot of poo from the other tenant's dog.
Not much to do around the area either. Texas roadhouse is a chain but was surprisingly good and really our only option on a Sunday. It was all we could find. Then Monday was Martin Luther King day, so we were restricted. The one Starbucks in driving distance was closed down, but there are some local cafes around. I liked that the owner provided a stocked kitchen. The fridge was stocked with eggs, yogurt, cheese and heavy cream. There is also a kurig with free coffee pods to use. Also noticed some oatmeal packets and hot chocolate packets. I'm not sure what he meant in the description when it listed continental breakfast. We were never served anything, but there were foods stocked to pick on, which was appreciated. We also ordered in one evening from salsas Mexican restaurant, which was good,, but mostly cause their skinny margaritas was delicious. Theres a nice TV in the living room, but thats the only room with a TV. Overall, it was a GREAT value. I gave it 5 stars. My boyfriend and I, as well as our 2 little dogs, had a nice and relaxing time there, and we would consider visiting again. Thank you so much for such an experience."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brandon's place is truly beautiful in a splendid old victorian house. I stayed for a week and felt really at home.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I spent a week here and it was a very nice time! The place was decorated for the holiday season, with lots of lights and cheer. It was quiet and relaxing, which is what I was looking for. Brandon is very responsive and helpful - the house has everything you need."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great old house w/ gorgeous decor.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is even cooler and more spacious than pictures suggest. Elmira doesn’t have a ton going on, but if you’re just looking for a quiet place near nature to land for a bit like we were then it’s a total steal. There was plenty of space for us to both work remotely and we enjoyed Brandon’s vast dvd collection in the evenings."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay with a great host! So much character to the apartment. We would definitely stay there again!

2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time staying at Brandon’s unique and charming apartment. Easy check in and Brandon was very responsive. Short drive if you plan to hike at Watkins Glen.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"If I could give Brandon fifteen stars, I would happily do so.
Today, we said goodbye to Elmira and a truly wonderful summer in the finger lakes. When Covid hit NYC, we hightailed it to safety. We had no idea what was in store. We couldn’t have chosen a better place to spend these past six months. Spirits were renewed. Goals redefined. And hope rediscovered. Thank you, Elmira and our wonderful host Brandon for an unforgettable experience. We hope to see you again someday. For now, farewell."
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay, will try and stay there whenever I come through again.
Brandon was quick to respond, great with details and super generous with amenities.
Can't recommend enough!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have stayed at AirBNBs across Canada, the US and Europe and I have to say Brandon's place was my favourite one I have ever stayed at! I am 7 months pregnant and this was our last roadtrip before baby and Brandon's personal touches made our stay so much extra special! (My partner enjoyed a beer from the fridge and Brandon told me to take candy bars for the road!) He was very quick to respond to our questions. His space was sparkling clean.. I felt like I was staying in a museum! Definitely will be coming back to Elmira just to stay here again."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Would definitely recommend Brandon's place, and intend to come back there again one day. Brandon was an amazing host - never intruded (we were just in text contact), but was very quick to respond to our needs. For example, due to very low overnight temperatures one of the pipes froze and we had no water in the shower. Brandon fixed the problem right away by turning the heater on in the basement (NB: this was a rare case emergency as temperatures usually do not drop that low). Brandon's place was convenient for us because it offered late check-in - we had no problem finding the place or parking. We really enjoyed spending evenings by the fireplace. The place is cozy and stylish. All the amenities are as listed and more. The place was decorated for Valentine's day - hearts everywhere including delicious heart-shaped cookies Brandon left for our breakfast alongside juicy and fresh honeycrisp apples. We are grateful we came across this amazing place."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, comfortable apartment in a beautiful old home. Fun and quirky touches throughout. Great communication. Convenient yet quiet location. Really enjoyed Brandon’s hospitality."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed for a week with my pup. There was lots of room and all of the amenities of being at home. The bed was super comfy, place was quiet, cozy, and warm. Brandon made his place so welcoming for guests! It was much better than staying in a hotel!"
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place. Easy to get to. Awesome host. Definitely a must if by Elmira, NY."

2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great experience
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We've been to a lot of Airbnb's over the years.... Brandon's place is the cream of the crop. It is spacious, clean and has all the amenities you could ask for. We loved being able to bring our dogs along who, I feel, liked the place as much or more than we did. This is a place we will definitely go back to. It is clean, cozy, spacious and comfortable. If you're considering traveling in this area and you have the opportunity you should definitely stay at Brandon's."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This apartment is larger than expected and completely stocked with everything you could want or need. Definitely a real home away from home feel! Brandon was very responsive and helpful. This is a great space in a great location. I would absolutely stay here again!
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved Brandon’s place! The home was clean and sweet! Victorian style with personal touches, every corner had something different and it was unique in its own way! For my boyfriend and I, it was our first trip upstate and the stay was great! The dishwasher took forever, you may have to turn the dial for the drying function to get it to finally stop - other than that the house was great! Fridge was packed, just check the dates! Not much to do around in the town of Elmira, but if you drive a quite you’ll find shopping centers! Brandon suggested Lib’s Supper Club which was yum! Anne’s Pancake House was also a sweet spot! DO NOT judge a book by its cover, the small town will capture your heart the way it caught ours!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great space with charming touches and lots of room. Our host was very clear about expectations with a very complete house manual which was very much appreciated. We will be back given the opportunity.
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing space. Super Host. Be prepared to be amazed!!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband, myself and our two small dogs spent our first B&B experience at Brandon's home. What a wonderful time it was, first it's a gorgeous Victorian home, second, we had this amazing apartment all to ourselves. Five full rooms that were amazingly comfortable and immaculate. Brandon had special touches all around including beautiful plants and fall pumpkins. He even had a toy basket with dog toys and dog treats! The bed was large and comfy, t.v. huge and the kitchen is adorable with everything we could have possibly needed. There is a fenced in yard which is gorgeous and the neighborhood was very nice. I would highly recommend a stay at Brandons home, you won't be disappointed."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon's place offered a great experience! Vintage design, great amenities, clean and quite comfortable, it was a perfect stop for our trip to Canada. We really enjoyed the easy access to the fenced-in yard. Highly recommended!"

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great space! Shockingly large, especially when coming from NYC. Very clean with lots of small touches. Perfect for our dog. Bed was very comfortable. It is a historic home, so the layout was a bit tricky for us at first. Would definitely recommend!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This suite is a gem! A beautiful restored Victorian home, 5 spacious and well appointed rooms, very comfy bed, all that we needed and more, well located close enough to downtown but in residential neighborhood, perfect! For the price of the local Holiday Inn! A super deal!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brandon’s place is just lovely & exactly as described. It is huge with so many unique & warm touches making it feel very warm & homey.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely loved this apartment, it was a lot bigger than expected, stylish, well decorated, and did I mention big? Host very fast with replies.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a very nice stay at Brandon's place. Excellent all around, nice and spacious."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment is huge and really exceeded our expectations. The photos don’t do it justice. Me and my boyfriend stayed with our dog. We loved the fact that there was more room for the dog to roam around than a hotel would have. We also spent a good deal of time just checking out the interesting instruments, books, and unique decorations. Would definitely recommend this stay to a friend!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Brandon’s place is the perfect Victorian escape. It’s a quaint little apartment with super cute finishes. I love staying there it was perfect for our time at the Corning Museum of glass.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon's space was absolutely amazing. The house is gorgeous. Ss soon as you walk into the apartment, we were wowed by how big and spacious it was. The space is unique and such a cool place to stay for the night. Will definitely stay again if ever in the area!"
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very unique venue. Older home with neat quirks.
2019-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"One of the more interesting airbnb spots i've stayed in- a huge, kind of weird (in a good way) space. an old victorian house in a neighborhood full of them. i passed a lot of houses on the block that i wished i could see on the inside- here was my chance to do so. plus, an easy walk to campus. brandon was quick to respond and his instructions were easy to follow."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you again for your hospitality! No joke, your cozy home was the BEST AirBnB we’ve EVER enjoyed. We travel frequently and Brandon’s home has all the charm, uniqueness and warmth most places lack! We could have stayed an entire week just in the apartment! This is a MUST stop if you love history, art and a bit of the unorthodox."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Check-in went very well. The apartment was beautiful and stylish with historical and decorative surprises at every turn. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment was really spacious and unique! It was very close to the college, which is why we were visiting. Very clean and lots of interesting things to look at inside. I wish we had stayed longer to take advantage of the outside area."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was MY FAVORITE home of all the ones I have stayed in. A luxurious Victorian mansion, with pocket doors, original hardware, and many unique and interesting furnishings. It was absolutely 5-star in every way."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Spacious and private place. Brandon had plenty of provisions in the kitchen! He is a very responsive host and provided very good answers and information. Great old house!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are traveling in and about the Elmira area, this is the place to stay. Its immaculate, charming, stunning Victorian woodworking details, a delightful garden with sun and shade opportunities, a ""stocked"" frig with ample of assorted ""goodies"" to satisfy your taste-buds. But the best is Brandon....a gentleman with humor, wit, stories, kindness and geared for customer satisfaction. Book early, as I did, so not to miss this historic gem of a place."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We thought that Brandon’s house looked great from the details online and when we arrived we were even more impressed.
Brandon has a truly beautiful home (and garden) and could not have been more helpful or more generous during our visit. His advice on local eateries was also excellent.
We only stayed one night as we were en route to a family gathering in Buffalo - we would certainly have liked to stay longer!"
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Huge space, well-stocked kitchen. About 30mins drive to Corning. Basically you get what you see in the pictures!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place and value for $$$
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brandon's place was bigger than I expected and I loved the Victorian features. There were also thoughtful touches throughout the house (chocolate beside the bed, fruit in bowls, and a wide assortment of Keurig coffees. )The solid wooden fence and the landscaping made the backyard a very enjoyable space for myself and the dogs. The location of the house was convenient and easy to find and the bed very comfortable I would definitely stay here again."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Brandon’s apartment is such an amazing space, in many ways. Beautiful and well appointed with a ton of character. Brandon is a great host as well. Outstanding stay, would happily book again!"

2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I really enjoyed staying there. If you have pets, this place is perfect!! The bathroom is very small-shower only (no bath in the claw foo). It was warm. You cannot adjust the heat, but I didn’t need to. I moved the tv to the bedroom and then moved it back at the end of the stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cozy upstairs space. It's easy to tell from the amount of DIY improvements that the space was constructed thoughtfully, from extra shelving in the bathroom and kitchen to handles near the staircase to ensure accessibility. The bathroom and kitchen were also well stocked with both essentials and some luxury items. The rooms are well-decorated so that it feels cozy, not cramped. It's within 45 minutes of some great state parks and attractions and if you're willing to drive a little farther there isn't much in the region that feels out of reach - we went to Letchworth state park and it only took a little over an hour. We had a great time visiting!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice place, nicely decorated and on a quiet street."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great location to stay in the Finger Lakes region. Very close to Watkins Glen, Ithaca and the Corning Museum."

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Easy to check in, place was very clean, bed was comfy. There's a lot of restaurants, stores & parks all within 10 mins. Watkins Glen is 27 mins away. It was good for a little weekend away."

2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Ana's place is up a narrow, steep staircase with short treads on stairs. The bathroom feels cluttered because it is quite small, yet it has typical bathroom items for guests to use."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to stay! Ana Maria was very helpful and friendly!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ana Maria's place was clean, she was very friendly and responsive. The bathroom is a tight squeeze, but all else was perfect. Definitely a great place for singles or couples with no children."

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"clean, convenient for short stays"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a lovely private apartment for our night on the road. Very clean and inviting. The bathroom as others have noted is quite small but it worked for us. I only wish that there had been information provided with local restaurant suggestions. Other than that, a great place."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice home away from home. Great location as we had to be in Big Flats and Athens PA for our visit. Stores and eateries in walking distance. Would stay again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Ana Maria and Barb were both very attentive. The apartment had everything we needed and many thoughtful details. The entire apartment was very clean. It is a good size for a small family or a few guests. The house is on a quiet street.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was just right. A bigger person might have some trouble in the bathroom was a little tight for us. The neighborhood was safe and walkable. It has a 7/11 within walking distance. Will definitely rent again if available.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"403 Wells-Every thing was beautiful fresh paint in bright colors immaculate just remodeled only thing - need a rail on steps was great and total privacy great, loved it"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ana Maria’s place was comfortable and equipped with what we needed for our “home base”. We were able to explore the Finger Lakes and attend the IMSA 6 Hours At The Glen car race which was a great first time experience!
I will caution that the bathroom has tight quarters and the shower is in an open tub with a wrap around curtain enclosure. It was okay for us but I would caution to anyone with mobility issues as well as the stairs leading from the entry to main area.
We appreciated the friendly greeting upon our arrival."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was centrally located to everywhere I needed to go to. This was a return visit after 50 years of moving away as a child. I was very comfortable staying and walking around with my service. The little park was a great place to listen to the music from Legends bar & grill on Wednesday night.
I loved the little apartment, it had everything one would need.
It was the perfect place to stay on my return to my birth place."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place for a couple to stay to go explore the Finger Lakes area! It's an updated space that has everything you'd need. Ana gave us all the information we needed in advance and was quick to respond. Would definitely recommend!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great! Thank you for everything!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a nice stay. Will book again in the future
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute one bedroom apartment in an a area that felt safe and was centrally located. Check-in was easy, comfortable bed, and host was excellent with communication.
I loved that it was pet friendly. The stairs worried me with my senior dog in that they curved at the top (so not a full step) and did they not have treads, but we did ok for the night."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ana Maria’s place has a very good, central location to get to many things in the Finger Lakes region. It has been newly renovated and was very clean. The bedroom was a great size but the bathroom was quite tight and difficult to manage at times. It’s the perfect size unit for a couple but would be small for any more than two people. We enjoyed our stay in Ana Maria’s while we explored the Finger Lakes."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ana Maria’s place was clean quiet and comfortable just like I like it. The bed was super comfortable and the hosts were responsive and friendly as well. Great deal for my stay, I recommend."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used this as our home base as we explored the Corning Glass Museum, Watkins Glen State Park, and a trip along Seneca and Keuka Lakes. It was nice to have a clean well stocked place to return to after a day of hiking or exploring shops. Barbara and Ann Marie were easy to communicate with and offered to go above and beyond to resolve a minor issue we had with the coffee maker. I've already recommended this Airbnb to a relative."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My boyfriend and I stayed here during out hiking trip. It was very easy to find, lots of spaces to park and very easy check in. The space was beautiful. Very clean and welcoming. The only warning I will give people is that the mattress in the bedroom is very firm. If you enjoy more give to your mattress when you sleep you will probably have a hard time getting comfortable. But other than that 5 stars. Very very friend hosts that respond and help right away. I'd definitely recommend to stay!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It was very clean quiet and peaceful. I didn't arrive until 9PM. Watched 10 minutes of news. Then to bed. The bed was super comfy. Woke 0630 did some research on computer as I had some car issues. Made a cup of coffee left at 0720. So, didn't
spend much time there would stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ana’s place is very nice. Kitchen has most everything anyone would need to prepare meals.
The bed is very comfortable. Slept soundly and woke to the pleasant sound of birds chirping each morning.
Location is in a quiet neighborhood and close to attractions in Corning and the Finger Lakes.
I will definitely stay here again!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to stay. The bed was comfortable, it was nice to have a separate seating area, and the bathroom and kitchen had everything we needed. It was clean and quiet and Ana Maria was a friendly host."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and cozy place. Clean and comfortable. Awesome host
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What exactly have a pictures are. Clean nice neighborhood.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay !
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at Ana Maria’s apartment. It’s cozy and comfortable. Very clean with all amenities as described. Ana Maria was able to answer any questions promptly and even worked with us to have a later check out time due to plans we had. We will definitely stay again as we travel to Elmira often.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was beautiful inside and stocked with everything we needed. It was very comfortable.
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great place to stay! Definitely a 1-2 people place but very comfortable and did the job. I was there 4 nights and was very satisfied. Everything was as described and very clean. Ana was very nice and responsive. When I’m back in the area will definitely stay here again.
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Good stay. The apartment is quite small and so are the appliances, but definitely livable. However, if you’re 6”+ I don’t think you’d fit in the shower. The bed was comfortable. We did have to place a couple of orders for things that weren’t there (dish soap, the conditioner was close to empty, etc) but most of what we needed was provided. Ana Maria was very responsive and checked in on us a lot. Our check-in was flexible. There really wasn’t much noise at all from the apartment downstairs. The neighbor did get on us about taking our dog outside because he was standing on her driveway, so if you bring your dog, make sure you ask where the property line is. Overall, it was what we expected and it was decent quality for the price. We would recommend it for a safe, comfortable place to stay in the Heights area."

2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Three of us arrived and there was No body soap, okay it was like 1 teaspoon in the bottle. We arrived during her “quiet hours so I didn’t want to trouble the host. When I messaged her the next day she did leave a bottle, but didn’t apologize first. Too many rules and messages sent"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very cozy, charming apartment. Recommend."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay with Ana Maria. The apartment is immaculate and beautifully decorated. There are personal touches everywhere to make this feel like a home away from home. There was no problem bringing our dog with us and Ana Maria was available right away to answer any questions or concerns we had. We highly recommend staying here. It was close enough to all the trails we wanted to visit in the area and conveniently located to stores and anything else we may have needed.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful second floor apartment with all the comforts of home. On a quiet street with minimal noise. Had quick and great communication with Ana Maria. Would definitely stay here again.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The apartment is located in a small town about 30 minutes from Watkins Glen. There are small town shops down the road with tiny playground for kids in walking distance. Would recommend the coffee shop for coffee and breakfast sandwiches in the morning.
The apartment was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The linens and pillows were of good quality.
The door has a double deadbolt so I felt safe and secure at night. The bathroom is small but does the trick and the water pressure in the shower is strong.
Movie theatre is located a town over in a mall for entertainment. Would highly suggest visiting The Corning Museum of Glass while in the area. It was a unique experience that my 7 year old also enjoyed."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely apartment and perfect location. Thank you!

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were able to book this last minute and it was a perfect stop off on our way back home. Everything we needed to make a quick breakfast after a good night's sleep. The apartment was very clean and appears freshly decorated. It was close to a gas station where we were able to get milk. Check in was very easy and our host very responsive.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ana was super friendly and easy to deal with. Her place was absolutely adorable! The unit is renovated to look rustic but modern. One of my favorite things about the space is the use of mirrors. We’ve found in our travels that sometimes people forget that mirrors enhance a space and make it easier for numerous people to get ready. There were also plenty of thoughtful touches that made it feel like home.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wry conveniently located, check-in was a breeze, even after hours, Ana Maria was very responsive as a host, and the apartment was exactly what we expected and needed on the way to the Finger Lakes. Would stay again!"

(bring bug spray) There's even a dog park just a quick drive away at Eldridge Park.
We fell in love with the area and all of its surprises. Waterfalls, a carousel, and even Twain's gravesite. So much more than we expected. We couldn't be more pleased with our stay!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, clean and well-appointed"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The apartment is a lovely space and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay for an overnight on my way to Albany. Communication and check in were easy and I would definitely stay here again!
2021-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"At the first I was not planning to write any reviews but then I think it will be helpful for the upcoming renters from the experiences we had.
The rental we booked was from Aug. 24 (Tuesday) to Aug 27 (Friday), 2021. On Aug. 23 (Monday) 1:02 pm the host sent me “some last minutes instructions” and last instruction was:
• “For any questions call xxx-xxx-xxxx, my co-host xxxxxxx will be available to answer any questions you might have.”
I copied her entire message to my phone and thought that will be the communication channel to use during our stay.
Aug. 24 (Tuesday) we arrived at the address and I texted the phone number at 2:54 “Good afternoon. We just arrived. I am wondering where is the drive way?”
“ There isn’t any driveway, free parking on street.” That was the reply I received immediately.
So the phone number was working and we communicated with each other successfully!
Aug. 26 (Wednesday) after my wife washed her hair in just seconds of using the hair blow dryer, the bathroom, living room, and the lights for the stairs all went off. I texted the co-host at 7:45 pm and told her what happened. Asked her “please reset the power back”. No reply.
I waited a few minutes then texted her again told her “tonight is our last night staying here. We need lights to pack up our belongings and clean up the place.” I Asked her to get back to us. No reply!
We then decided to walk downstairs to see if the owner was at home. The storm door was closed, but the inside door was halfway open. We then rang the doorbell. No answer. Waited 5 minutes. Rang the bell again. No answer! The entire night we were in the DARK with no electricity in the Living room (no air conditioner), bath room and stairs.
Oh, by the way, on our way back home on Aug.27 (Friday) at 11:23 am I received a text from the co-host “Please contact Anamaria downstairs.”!
Suggestions to others:
1) Do not use hair blow dryer at all though it was listed for using! (I hope the host will remove the hair blow dryer and warn people not to use hair blow dryer if it is still there).
2) Do not assume you can contact the host to inform them of any problems by going downstairs.
3) Be aware there is no drive way for parking your car (I hope this would have clearly spelled out in the description of the rental)."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The neighborhood is nice, quiet and clean. Plenty of towels and toiletries, including a blow dryer. Instant coffee was there in case you don't have any. Host is very responsive."

The air conditioner units had to work hard but the weather was really warm for our stay. The apartment is situated in a safe and friendly neighborhood.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spent 2 nights at Rodica’s apartment. My overall experience was very good. The apartment was spacious and clean with all amenities one would expect.
The kitchen was generously stocked with cleaning supplies as well as complimentary coffee. There was plenty of towels to use during our stay which was also a convenient. The apartment is about 10 minutes away from the “downtown” area which has lots of restaurants and bars for you to enjoy.
If I had to pick anything negative about my stay it would just be a slight odor coming from the apartment across the hall. It wasn’t enough to ruin the stay but you will definitely notice it upon entering the apartment.
If you are traveling in the area I highly recommend this apartment for quality, spaciousness and pricing."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A lovely airbnb experience! all that you need, clean, comfortable and great location. Also Rodica responded very quickly and was so kind and accommodating!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed here before, and picked it again when I was coming to town because I knew it would be clean! Not afraid to use the kitchenware at all. Rodica also thinks of the little things like chargers and make up wash cloths. Also she has good pillows, always a plus."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment was extremely clean, well furnished, easy to find and get into. We slept wonderfully well and enjoyed coffee in the morning. I appreciate the convenience and the price while we visited family. The only negative aspect for some people might be an odor of previous smokers evident in the carpeted rooms. I hate to criticize even this, but one member of our group is sensitive and it would have been good to know ahead of time. Thanks otherwise for a nice stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My sister and I came home to Elmira for the holidays to visit our family and friends, and we chose Rodica's place for this trip.
The apartment was spacious and well appointed with everything one would need to be comfortable and feel at home.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Greatly enjoyed our stay! We’re a family of six but only brought along four for this trip across country. Adorable house, fabulously decorated, super clean! The location is great no matter what you’re here for: Watkins glen, Ithaca, horseheads, Corning, big flats or Elmira. Kitchen was just enough, bathroom was fine, bedrooms were great! Host was super responsive and great! My only small complaint was that the water supply couldn’t handle both a shower and a kitchen sink at the same time; the pipes rattled in the wall and you had to shut off the shower and wait a minute for them to settle. However, not a big deal for just a few days and just shows character of the infrastructure of its time. ;)
We had snow show up while we were there and a container of ice melt magically showed up on the steps at some point for us. The host thought of all of the small details.
I just wish it was a slightly bigger house so it would be my first choice next time I need to come back here for more of us!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am so glad that we found this charming little house to stay in for our 3-night getaway. We ate only breakfast in, which didn’t involve any cooking. However, the kitchen is equipped well for meal preparation. The neighborhood is quiet. The house is furnished very nicely, with comfortable seating and bedding. There is a partially fenced in nice backyard. There are two chairs and a small round table alongside the back of the house. We made use of this seating area for a short time. It was too hot and humid, though, to enjoy for too long. We visited various places in Ithaca and up and down Cuyahoga Lake, as well as Watkins Glen. The house locations makes sightseeing in those areas very convenient. We enjoyed our stay so much that we look forward to returning g to this charming little house sometime in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay in this cute little house.

Easy check in & check out.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Aury's place is very nice and the pictures are accurate. This is a well-maintained older home with fast Spectrum Wi-Fi. The smart television does not have an antenna, but streams well over the Wi-Fi. We did use our own Roku, but only because we are more familiar with it. I would not hesitate to rent the house again.
The only negative things I can think about in the house are
• There is a small AC window unit in the window of the living room near where you sit to watch the television. It certainly is not large enough to cool the entire house, but since the nights are cool it really is not a problem. The unit is noisy making it difficult to enjoy the television since it is located just behind your head.
• There is no dishwasher in the house, but that is fairly normal in an older home like this one.
We were there for IMSA”s, Sahlen’s Six Hours of The Glen car race and the house worked out great for us! His team finished 3rd in the LMP2 class this year! We hope to rent it again next year if my cousin still has a ride in the race!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a really nice, comfortable stay in Ana Maria’s main floor apartment. It was a great place for our family of four and our dog (we loved that we were able to bring her…thank you). The place was clean and well-equipped with a lot of nice little touches for those that may have forgotten things. We did not use the kitchen for cooking but it seemed to have everything one would need. The bathroom was spacious, the water was hot, and the water pressure was excellent!
It as an older home with a lot of charm. It may not be the best place to stay if you are a light sleeper or if you are seeking a lot of privacy. We could hear the voices of the guests staying upstairs and everywhere that they were walking around. The wood floors on our level were also very creaky and loud. I recommend ear plugs or a white noise machine for light sleepers.
Overall, the apartment was great and we would gladly stay there again when visiting family in the area.
Ana Maria was a wonderful and attentive host!"

Everything we could have wanted or needed was at our fingertips. So many items available for our use. Comfortable beds and plenty of pillows were wonderful after our long day at the softball fields. Nice quick walk to Legends for burgers and then the gas station for milk. We appreciate the attention to detail and will definitely come back when we are in town again!

2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Stayed here for a week and really appreciated the location because it is walking distance to Legends, Harry's, and Bell's Coffee. Had an issue with the hot water running out and the host was able to replace the hot water heater the same day we asked them to check on it. The host was also very prompt with replies. Living room and kitchen are a bit drafty which is we found it difficult to follow the suggestion on the thermostat to keep it at 65 degrees or cooler."

The internet was good for cable (115 Mbps x 12 Mbps). The AC units could have been better (portable air conditioners with only one hose instead of two are bad), but plenty of fans are provided.
Will stay again if in the area."
2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Location is private and in a quiet area, easy to find.

2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kimberly, was very responsive to any of our questions. overall, it was a good stay.
we were visiting the area, so was not planning on staying in the house most of the day. but, if we were to stay in,
There is a huge backyard, it is a well maintained lawn, where you can basically play golf, if you want to. It would have been great if a small fire pit, or an area to do a small bbq and few chairs were available to sit outside.
Bedrooms were spacious, and beds were comfy and we had a good night sleep.
Kitchen had all the pots and pans and etc to cook a meal, and everything was clean.
Outside -There is no fence or tree line in the backyard or surrounding the house, so if you want to have privacy it will be difficult but we did not see the neighbours at all nor we were home most of the day.
overall it was a nice stay and would stay again. Thank you Kim"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great spot indeed. That I'll have saved in my favorites for future reference. the place is extremely cozy and homey. You'll feel right at home here. There's a nostalgic 50s feel you'll get from this place. I highly recommend it.

The ideal place for a peaceful vacation!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect location for our out-of-town guests since it was right down the road from us. It is a quiet neighborhood surrounded by trees. So nice! The bonus was this newly renovated house! So gorgeous! Well appointed with lots of beautiful things within. Sunny and bright, lots of seating and large kitchen island and dining table. My guests stated that the bed linens were really nice and the mattresses very comfy. The master bath shower is magnificent looking, yet runs into the bathroom, so that could use a bit of finesse. One small suggestion is to provide some salt and pepper shakers, cooking oil and a few coffee pods to get the guests started.
The weather was gorgeous for their stay with the daffodils and hyacinths blooming. We will certainly use this gorgeous, impressive home again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect location for us when we visited family in Elmira. Two adults, one 3-year-old and our dog all felt right at home. The house is beautiful with plenty of space. I could tell a lot of thought went into the details/renovation, even down to the art on the walls. Only complaint is extremely minor - there wasn't a welcome book/info describing how to work things or where to find items, local suggestions etc, but everything was easy to figure out and laid out nicely. The one question we had for Dave was answered almost immediately. Definitely hope to stay there again~! Kathleen"
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We were so excited to find this beautiful rental in such close proximity to our 101 year old great grandmother! We've been renting an RV to stay close to her when we visit from TN for the last few years but it will so nice to have a warm, spacious home to stay in this time! The kitchen was equipped with most of the basics & was certainly large enough for all! My only complaint was that the new mattresses were incredibly firm. I slept on the giant couch in the living room 2 of the nights we were there because I just couldn't get comfortable in the bed."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay in Elmira area.

I’m my 98 year old grandmothers POA and visiting her can be exhausting for her while this sanctuary of a home provided the needed comforts of home as I am traveling four hours to get to her. Thank you for your beautiful home.
Sincerely,

enough utensils. The large TV and fireplace were a great bonus.
Grocer nearby as well as Elmira University."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jairo's listing was exactly as described. The apartment was easy to get to and perfect for me traveling solo. While the neighborhood is a little ""eclectic"", with both renovated homes as well as a few that could stand to be torn down, this renovated property is conveniently located, with a grocery store, gas station, and food choices, all within minutes away. I would definitely stay again if I returned to the area and highly recommend it as a viable option. I just suggest remembering to leave the porch light on when leaving out for the evening because the building sits back from heavily treed street with little lighting."

We're crazy for Kitty. Stay with her. You'll be, too. :)"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough about The Enchanted Cottage. The house was in a nice area of Elmira. It was very comfortable and charming inside, made more so by all the little touches Kitty added. I had an injured knee, so slept in the room off the living room, and the bed was very comfortable. My husband slept in one of the upstairs bedrooms, and said he slept very well.
Kitty communicated well with me. It was easy to get inside, and she had little notes throughout the house to help make our stay more comfortable. I encourage people reading the reviews to check The Enchanted Cottage out. You won't be sorry. Next time we're in upstate NY, we will definitely try to spend some time here. If you're reading this, Kitty, thank you so much!"

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Enchanted Cottage was a lovely place to stay. Kitty really goes the extra mile to make sure you're comfortable and every need is covered. Throughout the weekend, I was continually impressed by all the little things she has done to ensure comfort. The beds are clean and comfortable and there's plenty of extra bedding and pillows neatly stored in the house. The bathroom closet is packed with plush towels and there's a nice basket full of toiletries. And when I went to make a couple of meals, I was impressed by how well stocked the kitchen was! Not only are there good quality pans and dishes, there was a full spice rack, oil and butter, and even foil and cleaning supplies! Entertainment is well covered too. There's lots of information on local sights, movies and books, a scavenger hunt, and the Wi-Fi information is posted in multiple places in the house so you're good anywhere you might need it. I also really enjoyed the piano, which is locally made and kept in tune. It was relaxing to play it after a long day of travel. Not only that, there's all these little considerate extra touches. The keychain has a flashlight, the light switches are labeled, and there's other little notes to help you find things in the house. There's even a tasteful reflective sign at the foot of the driveway to help you find it on a dark night. And the driveway itself is convenient for unloading your car right into the house! The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe, and it was easy to get there from the highway. Kitty herself was very easy to communicate with and I enjoyed my weekend very much. I highly recommend staying here!"

If you are in need of lodging in the Elmira area this should be your first choice.
2020-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"You will not be wanting when you choose the Enchanted Cottage by Kitty! Old world charm with great amenities.
It is nicely situated in a quiet neighborhood yet close to many conveniences. It’s a quick 40 minute drive to Glen Watkins State Park for those who are looking to hit the trail.
One of the little perks we enjoyed was star gazing by the back porch beside the pond, and if you get lucky even catch a falling star!

She even made ginger scones for my birthday! The house is stocked with everything you could want. It is conveniently located to many area attractions.

2018-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"How great is this place? Well, literally within hours of arriving, we messaged Kitty to see if we could extend our stay! From the moment we arrived to find a handwritten welcome, wine chilling in the fridge and a freshly baked homemade blueberry cake on the counter, to the moment we checked out, our stay was a dream. The house is beautifully decorated with so much character, the rooms were cool and comfortable, and the house was stocked with everything you could possibly need. Toiletries in the bathroom (even face masks), spices and cooking supplies in the kitchen, a huge DVD library, and tons of information on things do to and see in the area. It was such a pleasure to be in such a relaxing environment - both inside and out! We cooked several meals and ate in the dining room while we played a few simple tunes on the piano, and we had coffee and snacks outside while the kids ran around in the backyard. We felt so at home and it was a true vacation. And before I forget - the treasure hunt! Kitty tailored the hunt to our little ones, so they had a blast looking around for the castle where princesses live and the door that was smaller than they were (and of course they loved the prize!). Kitty was very responsive and helpful when we had questions, and it was an absolutely wonderful stay. W will definitely be back!"
2018-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The Cottage was an extraordinary getaway in a beautiful neighborhood with everything you could possibly need nearby. The little space out back is a perfect place to have your morning coffee. The kitchen and bathrooms are equipped with everything that you will need on your trip! Kitty answered any questions that I had immediately and made sure my stay was relaxing right down to the home baked blueberry coffee cake and chilled wine in the fridge! We will definitely be back!
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a five star stay. Kitty clearly put a lot of thought into creating a home that is welcoming for guests - and full to the brim with amenities should you forget anything. The location was ideal for our family get together and we were very comfortable. Communication was excellent. The home is as advertised if not better. Our kids thoroughly enjoyed the scavenger hunt (we did it multiple times!) and my whole family appreciated the blueberry cake that Kitty made to greet us upon our arrival. We hope to stay here again in the future when visiting Elmira. Thank you Kitty.
2018-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Kitty’s home was fabulous for our group trip to Watkins Glen. She provided plenty of amenities and made our stay extremely comfortable. The attention to detail was superb and we especially enjoyed the music selection! I highly recommend a stay at Kitty’s home!

2018-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kitty’s place is wonderful. So lovely and comfortable with lots of beautiful little touches. My family and I had to make a last minute trip to attend a memorial service and Kitty’s fast and accurate communication made our booking and check in so easy. The home is wonderful with tons of space, plenty of privacy, and a great little kitchen. We would definitely stay here again."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Impressive home, will consider staying there again next time I am in town."
2017-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kitty's house is located in a charming neighborhood. She has gone above and beyond with adding personal touches and making her house a home away from home. If you forget any travel items, she probably has them stocked in the house for you. The treasure hunt was fun and the wine and blueberry cake hit the spot!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the enchanted cottage. We were in Elmira for a family reunion/celebration and it was the perfect home base for our weekend.
Kitty is a great host who was communicative and provided all the comforts of home and then some. We hope we'll be able to stay again for future family visits - a great find!"
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a great stay we had in the Enchanted Cottage. It was so perfect for our group of ladies. Your house helped make our reunion so fantastic.

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kitty has a lovely cottage, and is a great host. She is great with communication and flexible with check-in / check-out.
The home is clean, well stocked, and has some lovely movies (great throwbacks!). She welcomes you with a treasure hunt, coffee cake, and wine -- a very nice touch!
Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2017-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is organized with the guests in mind. Everything needed for a pleasant stay is covered. The cottage is located on a quiet safe street. We loved taking walks in the neighborhood. Kitty went above and beyond with the best surprises ever!
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great little location right next to the country club in town. Very low traffic area with plenty of parking at the house.
Kitty was a great host, providing ideas and scenic routes in the local area for me to ride my bike.
Couldn't have asked for a better house or host!"

2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We really loved it here. Comfortable and charming. Kitty helped us out with our last minute stay. She adds all the extras that make it lovely.
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended! Enjoyable in every way!
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kitty is the best AirBnB hostess I have had the pleasure of interacting with. Always prompt, communicative, courteous and what a cottage. No detail is too small, down to the spare toiletries. The cottage is full of love and pride of ownership. We had a blast and seriously can't wait to come back.
Besides, Kitty loves dogs and flew planes. Dogs don't dig hollow people and you can't be a pilot if you're not honest and perfect. Kitty is an amazing woman. Book with confidence."
2016-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Kitty's cottage. The home was clean, comfortable, and cozy. We appreciate all the treats and comforts of home Kitty provided. It is the most well stocked Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The neighborhood is also nice and quiet. I would highly recommend!"
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Enchanted Cottage was amazing! We felt very comfortable throughout our stay and Kitty outfitted the house with plenty of personalized touches to keep our minds and imaginations active! We were greeted by homemade coffee cake, a bottle of wine and a treasure hunt. It was a nice way to explore the subtle details of the house while enjoying the wine. The house was well stocked with basic toiletries (for men and women) and plenty of clean towels. The kitchen was also fully stocked with pots and pans, plates, utensils, spices, etc.

We would definitely recommend a stay the Enchanted Cottage and would love to stay again if we come back to the area!"
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kitty was a great host. The house interiors were thoughtfully done. We had a nice time playing the treasure hunt Kitty arranged. My son had fun playing with the piano. Overall a nice pleasant stay
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent three days of our holiday in this lovely house. Kitty was helpful in planning, the communication worked perfectly, and we even got help in planning our trip from Boston to Elmira. During the trip we got a helpful text about local road works. The house corresponds perfectly to the description - cozy is the key. It is located in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. In the house we were greeted by freshly baked cake, basic groceries in the fridge - and a treasure hunt - TFTC ;-). We had all in all a truly wonderful stay - thanks Kitty."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This house is on a quiet street in a good neighborhood. The house and yard were well-maintained, and everything worked. The doors closed property and there were no problems with the plumbing. There were many nice decorative touches and lots of interesting books and touristic materials, but there was still plenty of drawer and closet space for our personal items. The house was immaculately clean. We thought Kitty went way beyond anybody's expectations to make us comfortable by providing a well-equipped kitchen with everything you might want for food preparation, including a large variety of spices. There were also a lot of toiletries a visitor might need. She even welcomed us with a freshly-baked coffee cake."
2016-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The description of the Cottage on Glen were spot-on! What a wonderful place to call a home away from home! When we entered the house, we were welcomed with a cheery note and a tasty treat! Each clean and tidy room had its own comfy feel - for reading, chatting, sharing a meal, or cuddling down for the night. We discovered a great running trail that followed the river and led us through a neighborhood of beautiful historical homes. Wish we had discovered the Cottage on Glen earlier in our daughter's college career.
Thank you!!
Michelle and Rob"
2016-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A group of friends and I enjoyed our weekend getaway at the Enchanted Cottage. Of course, when you arrive to fresh baked cookies and wine provided by your host, you really can't go wrong! Kitty was a great host - easy to get a hold of and quick to respond. The house was clean and cozy with plenty of room for 4 of us. The area has lots to offer in close proximity. The only thing we missed out on was good weather... But of course, that is what wine trails are for! Thanks again Kitty!"
2016-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Hosts stayed out of our way. The house was clean, comfortable, and in a very nice neighborhood. The host provided us with a bottle of wine (though it was from Washington even though this is advertised as a great place for wine), crackers, cheese, chocolates, water, coffee, cream etc. The bathrooms were stocked with anything you may have forgotten. I forgot shaving cream, and there it was! While we never ended up cooking there, the kitchen was well stocked with spices and other necessities."
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unsurpassed warmth, accommodation and sense of welcoming hominess - comfortably informal and inviting; cozy; homelike. Kitty's the ""hostess with the mostest"" in our book!"
2015-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent space and location. Kitty was accommodating and helpful. We were in town for a family wedding. We had the room to visit with visiting family in a comfortable convenient setting. The rooms were good sized. Parking was easy. The house was clean and everything worked. The neighborhood is quite residential and quiet. This is a great family location. An Airbnb that is a whole house is a great find as we could spend time together in the various common areas. With all the electronics that drain our attention, it is terrific to find a spot to relax and enjoy someone's company. We would hope to stay again."
2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family had a wonderful stay at Kitty's listing, The Evergreen. There was wine in the fridge, snacks on the counter, and helpful toiletries in the bathroom. The beds were beautiful and very comfortable. My favorite was lounging on the daybed in the sunroom, reading and enjoying a glass of wine! Thank you, we had a lovely time!"
2015-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful house ! In a wonderful place ! Entirely renovated, we have past really vacations with my parents. Kitty is a great person who know how to deal to make sure you will feel comfortable! The place is nice with kind neighbors. I recommend 200% !"
2014-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kitty & John's new place ""The Castle"" on Glen Avenue in Elmira to run the Wineglass Half Marathon. It was a lovely home with tons of charm. Kitty was a gracious hostess who left fresh flowers & a basket of goodies to welcome us. The beds were so comfortable and we enjoyed sitting out on the large porch as well. Elmira is a very cute town, only about 20 minutes from the Corning Museum of Glass. Thank you Kitty for a great stay!"
2014-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first AirBnb experience and it couldn't have been better. We wanted to experience real suburban America and Kitty's house and the neighbourhood in Elmira was just what we were looking for. Everything in the house looks just like in the pictures, the street is quiet and tasteful, the neighbours friendly - one even came over for a chat. Communication with Kitty was easy, she responded to all my emails right away. The complimentary coffee, tea, orange juice and even the bottle of wine was appreciated. Thank you once again."
2014-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2013-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This has been one of our best Airbnb picks ever! The house is located on a calm street and close to all the great things The Finger Lakes have to offer. It truly is picture perfect, a real home-away-from-home and we loved every second of our stay. Kitty was kind enough to provide us with 4 bikes to explore the neighborhood and made sure we had everything we needed. A great experience and highly recommended for anyone looking for a place to stay in the area."
2013-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friends and I stayed here this past weekend and had a wonderful experience. The house is very comfortable and well appointed. Kitty went out of her way to make sure we had what we needed and that everything went smoothly. We took advantage of the DVD library and the piano provided in the house. The sun porch and daybed were a favorite spot for all of us. The house provided a very relaxing and private ""home base"" for our adventures in the area!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed a fantastic long weekend at Ana and Barbara's charming ranch. The house was very clean and comfortable. Everything was as expected and as described. Communication with Ana and Barbara was great! They were incredibly helpful and responsive. The neighborhood is very quiet and friendly. The location was wonderful as well, with Watkins Glen State Park just a short drive away, offering breathtaking natural beauty to explore. Additionally, the Center for Mark Twain Studies, being only a few minutes' drive added another layer of richness to our visit. We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay and highly recommend it to everyone."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Nice interior, nice supply of bathroom towels, well stocked."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely host who was super flexible with us filming a short film!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great experience with Ana Maria. The house was clean and had plenty of space for 3 adults and a large dog. We were all able to have ample space from each other and I had a private space to work remote during the week. Wifi was fast and reliable. The neighborhood was pretty quiet, some children and dogs but that is typical for any residential area. It felt safe and private. Neighbors seemed friendly. The yard was plenty of space to walk my dog. A fully fenced yard would make this place an absolute gem!
House had all the necessities and extras like soap, basic ingredients, and coffee. Nice houseplants. It was cool to not have to run out and grab laundry soap to do a load midweek. It's the little things that make a difference!
Overall, our stay was excellent. The house is what you would expect from a typical AirBnB. Ana Maria was responsive and friendly. She came over to take the trash out and was proactive checking in our needs. I would stay here again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Simple and clean home. We had a wonderful time.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and pleasant to be there.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,good to be back! nice quiet neighborhood...friendly neighbors.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, would come again!"
2024-01-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,Ana Maria was very responsive to all issues however the kitchen is not fully functional. The oven does not work and the stovetop burners are also not very effective. Several very necessary cooking items were missing such as cookie sheets and knives. The dishwasher is not totally secure and rocks when loading. The drain in the bathtub does not stay up so you stand in water. I also wish there were blinds on the front door and the other living room window. All in all the house is GREAT for a short stay but I was there with children for over a week and it did not totally work for us.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a nice stay at Ana Maria's place. Check in was very easy and there were a range of eating options within about 10 mins. Ana Maria communicated well. The accommodation was a good size, had decent heating, a well supplied kitchen, washing machine and drier (we didn't use). We thought the price charged for the area was a little high, and it's a bit of a stretch to describe as it a ""lovely ranch""."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little house! We were there shortly, just stayed to sleep on our way back from a trip. Would book again!"
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Ana Maria’s place was as shown in photos. She was very responsive when there was a heat issue and came on Christmas Day to fix it. I wish I knew the oven wasn’t working before our stay since we had planned to make some things for the holiday. Other than that it was a nice place.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Ana Maria was a great host. The Airbnb was cute and very clean. Plenty of bath towels, comfy beds, big kitchen and liked that the living room and kitchen were open."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cozy. Owner very quick to answer my questions. Highly recommend.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Ana Maria was very quick to respond and confirm our reservation. This was crucial because we were traveling and booked same day. The house was very comfy and exactly what we were looking for as we were passing through Elmira.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ana Maria was responsive and the co-host, Barbara, was also very quick to respond. She offered helpful suggestions on area attractions. The home was very welcoming and comfortable."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My family and I had a WONDERFUL stay at Ana Maria and Barbara's AirBnB. The house was very clean, spacious, and amazingly decorated. They put a lot of attention to detail into the design and comfort for their guests.
Communication with Ana Maria and Barbara were great! They ""get it"" and made everything easy and seamless for us to check in, check out, etc.
Location was wonderful as well. A short drive to Cornig - this is where we spent most of our visit at the museum and downtown area.
Overall, a wonderful experience and we will be back to stay again for sure! You will not be disappointed in booking to stay at their lovely AirBnB."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Thanks for the quiet stay. The place was clean, and welcoming."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"what a delightful home! we loved the quiet neighborhood and the peace and silence of this part of NY state.
The home was great. Standouts were the contemporary appliances - the washer-dryer, dishwasher, microwave, refrigerator and kitchenware made us feel right at home. A separate study for working made WFH a breeze. The internet speed was top notch and the hosts super responsive.
Overall A+ and we for sure hope to be back."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house was beautiful, cozy, easy to find, and very neat. The host was responsive promptly and helpfully. One small note is that I didn't see the full house rules in the ""house rules"" section on Airbnb or in the house itself - just a tip to guests that the host will ask that you please strip the beds, take out the trash, and start the dishwasher if there are any dirty dishes. All super reasonable and very easy, I just mentioned to the host that these extra requests weren't visible anywhere I could see them."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Honestly, it was a really cute little house. The price was nice. The host was great."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was very clean and cozy. It was eazy to access. My friends and I would definitely stay here again. My only critique was additonal comfortable seating in the living room. The blue chairs were pretty but not comfortable.

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,AC was not too good but at least we had a place to sleep after hard days work.
,,,"Host asked for the check-in to be 10pm -12am and never responded to one message, phone call or email..!!.. There was NO self check In so we had to wait outside in the freezing 🥶 cold during a snow storm 🌨 while we waited for almost 2 hours for an empty response..!!!.. Ridiculously Unprofessional behavior to display for a first time guest that wasn’t at all familiar with the area ..!!.. If your going to request at check-in time , you should probably make sure you are awake to greet your guests .!. SMH 🤦🏽‍♀️ First bad experience I’ve ever had with Air BnB"
