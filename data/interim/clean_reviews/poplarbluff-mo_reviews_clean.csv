2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin exceeded expectations. Everything is exactly as described. The entire place was pristine in cleanliness. We've stayed in several cabins in TN & MO and the setup of Kerri's hot tub & the hot tub itself is by far the best we've experienced. Kerri is an incredible host as well. So responsive & kind. Secluded is very true & that was so nice. We will definitely stay here again. It is certainly family friendly & kids would love it, but is perfection for a couple's get away. Every positive review is true. We're so happy to have found this location."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved this space! Right on the river, woods and ground to explore and very private. I wasn't expecting the taxidermy but it was all tastefully done if you like that sort of thing. The hot tub and fireplace almost felt treehouse like, and the wrap porch had a beautiful veiw of the water and wild life. It was exactly the peaceful weekend getaway we where looking for."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place for a weekend getaway. Very private and peaceful. Kerri is a great host who is very responsive and helpful. The cabin is clean and honestly better than the pictures make it look. Would highly recommend and am hopefully looking to go back in the future.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures did not do this house justice, it was just beautiful and so peaceful. We enjoyed the hot tub area the most, but the cabin had spectacular views of the river and was so welcoming. We felt right at home!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a very secluded, beautiful place to stay, this is it. The stairs are a little small and steep, but overall amazing! The pictures don't do it justice. Everything you need is right there. Locals are great as well, we enjoy visiting small businesses, and they are the best! Oh and Tom is a nice addition!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the second time we’ve stayed here, and we plan to come back every year! Beautiful cabin and so peaceful. Pictures and description of this place do not do it justice!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed three times! Love it every time.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful property right on the river. We really enjoyed the screened in detached porch with the hot tub, TV, and fireplace. The rope bridge to access it made it very neat."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was beautifully decorated, clean, quiet, and peaceful. The hot tub tree house was, by far, the best part of the experience. Fishing was fun on the river. The water was clear and beautiful. We even enjoyed painting our rock to leave behind. Thank you for letting us enjoy your lovely home."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. It was a perfect to celebrate an anniversary. Secluded with all the comforts of home in a beautiful setting.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was comfortable. The surroundings were beautiful and the hot tub was amazing. Very secluded.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, peaceful, clean, private, everything you could ask for on a weekend getaway. Cabin has everything you need in the kitchen to cook with including seasonings and cooking oils. Could use some grilling utensils or we just couldn't find them. The river is beautiful, current is strong so be careful when getting in. Hot tub building is amazing, as is the outside fireplace. Do use bug repellent, as the one day I didn't, the chiggers found me, my bad. Was a perfect weekend to celebrate my wife's birthday. Thank you Kerri for sharing your beautiful cabin with us. We look forward to coming back.
David"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at Kerri’s cabin for our first getaway as a couple after having our baby last fall. It was such a great experience! We brought our own canoe to use on the river. The current was strong so beware, but we were still able to paddle upstream a ways, swim at a beach, and then float home. The Airbnb itself was cozy and clean. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook, the porch was great. The stairs upstairs were steep, so watch your step. We loved the side cabin with the hot tub too. The space was very private as well with only occasional motor boats going by.
We would love to come back again some day!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Heaven on earth exists here! My Husband & I stayed for 8 days. Every day we saw something new! The wildlife is priceless! Seeing deer, turkeys & so much more was the coolest thing! The windows in the cabin give you so many views it’s impossible to sit around! The Cabin is gorgeous! We felt right at home! Everything was so clean including the amazing hot tub! Every detail has been thought of and executed perfectly! This is hands down the best experience ever! There is not a single thing to complain about! My favorite part were the tiny tree frogs. The night sky is so bright at night. Plenty of shade when it’s sunny and the river is remarkably clean. There are trails to walk and lots of nature to experience! This was Our Dream vacation and because of Kerri, it came true! We will definitely be booking again! You won’t be disappointed with this property!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The pictures do not do the place justice! It was beautiful and very private. Everything was perfect and we had an absolute blast. The only thing I would say I was not fond of was there was no privacy in the bedrooms upstairs. There was a curtain on one side, but no walls to separate the bedrooms or a door. We would definitely stay again though. I highly recommend if you are an outdoor lover for sure!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a great place to stay. So peaceful. Such a great place to relax and get away from the day to day. Will be looking into renting it again in the future.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Picture do not do this place justice! We had some pretty big changes in plans and Kerri worked with us so well and was very quick to respond. This place by far exceeded our expectations! I can’t get over it and can’t wait to go back! Absolutely had the best time! If you want to relax and have fun… this is the perfect place!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin in the woods is perfect! The cabin is decorated with a rustic, outdoorsman theme. It was clean and had everything we needed to make meals at the cabin. The hot tub area is unique and perfect for relaxing even if not using the hot tub. It’s secluded and right on the Black River. With the trail, river, fire pit, and open area, there is plenty to enjoy the outdoors. We loved this cabin and enjoyed getting away with our family. It makes me want to purchase a cabin for my own family. We hope to come back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We are from chicago and a lot of the hustle and bustel. My family and I were looking for a peaceful place to unplug, and we definitely found it this hidden jem. The log cabin in the middle of the woods that backed up to the river was exactly what we were looking for. Oh, did I mention the hot tub was the most relaxing part of the whole trip. Thank you again for sharing your beautiful hidden jem with our family."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would 100% recommend this cabin! the pictures does not do it justice! I knew the outside was going to be beautiful but I didn't realize how secluded and how much space there really was. Also the inside was far nicer than I expected! the small bridge between the bedrooms was so cute and different. The whole place was incredibly clean and the host took pride in making sure everything was up to par. We unfortunately had car troubles before we left but she helped us find a good mechanic and even offered to bring us what we needed since we were stranded for a bit. Me and my husband spent alot of time fishing and cooling off in the river. Everything was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing about the place if I could! My family hopes to come back next year in the spring or fall to experience the place in a different season!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is very peaceful. Very beautiful getaway! Mosquitoes are pretty bad but nothing can be done about that when your by the river just make sure to have bug spray! They do have candles that help and had bug spray. The only other thing to watch for would be if you are coming out of the hot tub room with DRY feet be careful you will slide without warning! Other than that coffee, dishes, condiments, seasonings, candy, clean comfy beds, tv, washer and dryer all a plus. Was already cool inside when we got there. There was a deer on the trail we got to see as well!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is beautiful! It’s like a treehouse almost the surroundings are beautiful and the cabin is meticulously maintained in and out- we were impressed and relaxed! Everything has been thought of - the hot tub area was our favorite place to hang out!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time we've booked Kerri's place and there will more. We just live the views and peace and quiet.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a unique, and beautiful place to stay. The hot tub was so relaxing,and the peaceful nature that surrounded the cabin. Love the rustic decor! Would definitely recommend to stay here. I would come once a year!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay at Kerri’s place. It is perfect for a peaceful r&r vacation. You are only about 10-15 minutes to poplar bluff where you can find most anything you would need. Definitely will be staying again!

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just as described and better. we celebrated our birthdays and 25th wedding anniversary during this trip and could not have picked a more peaceful, beautiful, and serene property."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is a huntsman paradise! Even though mounted animals and camo printed linens aren't for me, it was incredibly comfortable! Out of nowhere, down a winding dirt road emerges a small piece of heaven! 10/10 hands down the nicest and most memorable place you could possibly stay when visiting Poplar Bluff!
Bad weather left me unable to get the full experience, but the refuge and relaxation provided via the separated hot tub building was some of the very best in my life thus far, no question!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was so perfect after our not so good stay a couple days before this! Definitely not long enough, would have rather stayed at cabin our whole vacay! Perfect little getaway, secluded with amazing views and sightseeing! I took many walks by the river and to wake up and sit on balcony and drink a cup of coffee was ideal! We would love to return!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was everything we expected and more. loved that it was secluded and loved the hot tub! the river was up due to all the rain but me and my wife still had a great anniversary. would recommend this place at any time of the year

I am so glad they are sharing this piece of heaven. Would definitely like to come back for another stay!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Awesome place very secluded away from it all
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at this cabin!! It was definitely a glamping experience with the fire out front and river access. Talk about a secluded retreat! No other property is even within view and is a short drive from the main road outside of a closed gate. If it was any cooler we would have loved to take advantage of the hot tub and gas fireplace inside the additional structure but we didn't use it, being so hot outside in July. Many little details were thought of and provided such as games, life preservers, additional seating and fans for the upstairs loft area. Excellent stay and would highly recommend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little get away. Just the right distance from town. Highly recommend for a peaceful, quiet time!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was incredibly clean and there were small details that made our stay that much more wonderful. There was a nice welcome tray with a notebook that gave instructions for things to do, had menus for local restaurants, and things to do in the area. The location was absolutely wonderful. The cabin is remote, yet only 15 minutes from town so we were able to grab a quick bite and get back to our vacation. We loved our stay and hope to come back in the fall!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean. Choosing a favorite spot to sit and enjoy the view was difficult; too many to pick from. Greatly enjoyed the gas fireplace in the evenings. Private and quiet.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the getaway everyone needs and deserves. It’s so peaceful and relaxing that if you need time to clear your head or think about life, this is the place! I used it as a romantic weekend getaway and it was amazing!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There would only be one reason not to give this place 5 stars, and it would be due to being selfish and hoping it doesn't become booked next time I want to come! Truth is, it doesn't get better than this! It was thoroughly clean, relaxing, right by the river, and all the amenities you could hope for. Kerri was very kind and communicative, and the property is simple breath-taking. If you're looking for ultimate romance, this is the place. If you're looking for a place to hang with the girls for the weekend, also the place! The beds are comfortable, the hot tub addition is amazing, and it's close to town if you've forgotten anything. We will absolutely be back!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! My wife and I rented it for a romantic weekend getaway. It is very clean and very private place.

2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book It!! This place is absolutely amazing. No complaints , had a fun time. I hope to visit again soon. Thanks for such a Blessing!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place! The house and tree house hottub area is amazing! The river access is just right there in the yard. We found out that you can do a little float trip, it will take about 3ish hours and you stop at Hillard Bridge. We had 2 cars and parked one at the bridge so when were done we just drove home which took about 7 minutes.
Couple of things to note, the 2 bedrooms do not have doors and are just up in a loft area. Also meaning that if you are downstairs you can see and hear into the room areas. Even though the bedrooms are not ideal it was still a great cabin and experience! Kerri was quick to respond and helpful with questions."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful cabin right on the river, hot tub area is amazing. The Ice maker works really slow so stop for ice before you get off the highway but other then that everything was perfect 💕"

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This cabin is absolutely everything you could want and/or need for a little getaway. Right on the river with a beautiful deck for meals outdoors. And the little rope bridge over to the hot tub was very charming and made for a great weekend!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful place inside and out! The cabin is secluded, but doesn’t lack for luxury amenities! And it doesn’t matter your age — crossing a swing bridge to a “treehouse” hot tub is pure magic! Thank you for a great location to make some wonderful lasting memories."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is fantastic! The owners thought of everything. It's very well furnished, comfortable beds, and even had everything we needed and then some to cook all of our meals. The screened in hot tub room is such a retreat and I love that it's separate from the main house. Everyone loved the rope bridge too. The river is beautiful and makes it everything so serene. We walked the trail and enjoyed seeing lots of deer in the field near the cabin. We can't wait to stay here again on our future trips to the area."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really relaxing

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great relaxing getaway! Very, very private and secluded! The hot tub is amazing and the outdoor fireplace area is fantastic! Cabin is super-clean and spacious. Kerri was great with communication, directions and instructions for check-in. Any older folks or people with disabilities should beware of the stairs to the bedrooms - they are very steep and can be a little tricky to navigate, particularly when carrying luggage, etc. However, don't let that deter you from staying at this great little cabin - the furniture is just as comfy to sleep on!!! :) Overall a wonderful stay! Highly recommended!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin and property are amazing! The hot tub area is to die for! We were in and out of it all weekend. The ease of access to the river was perfect. We spent our days floating, fishing, and exploring and our nights were spent sitting by the campfire making s'mores, sitting by the river listening to the wildlife and watching the stars, and relaxing in the hot tub. The decorations are perfect and really make it feel like home away from home. They have everything you could possibly need while staying there. We only left to visit Big Spring and to run to the grocery store. We had a perfect Memorial Day weekend and can't wait to return!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures don't do this place justice. Change of season issues, but a great stay overall, I will gladly return."
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was even more remote and more beautiful than we expected! The pictures and descriptions are modest, this place is Heaven on Earth! We enjoyed the peace and quiet sitting by the river, eating on the deck, evening fires, and jumping in and out of the hot-tub all day long . During our visit, we only left one time to enjoy a meal at Crabb & Company. Great food and great service, you need to visit during your stay. We will absolutely return to this Airbnb and will recommend to others! Thank you!!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place to stay. Definitely recommended.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kerri's house was really wonderful. Lots of really thoughtful and well planned amenities and touches throughout. The location near the river is beautiful in the morning, it is very quiet and relaxing, and the space is fun to hang out in. The small touches like the marshmallow skewers near the campfire area show the details to which Kerri went to make this a great place to relax, unwind, and enjoy the outdoors. Highly recommend."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An amazing and beautiful cabin! The property is absolutely amazing! Definitely wanting to go again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kerri’s cabin is a wonderful spot for a peaceful weekend getaway. We left during the day to hike at Markham Spring recreation area and Lake Wappapello state park & spent lots of time relaxing in the hot tub in the evenings. The cabin is in a private location and was very clean. I would definitely recommend this cabin for a relaxing weekend for a couple or a group of 4.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place on the river. Tree house hot tub was great!!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always our go to place for a relaxing weekend getaway!

2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin and surrounding land is amazing and great for small groups and families that are looking for a secluded and relaxing atmosphere! The cabin itself was beautifully designed, very clean, and conveniently stocked with everything we needed and more for a weekend getaway."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a great time. The cabin is very private and yet close to Poplar Bluff if you need anything. Hope to stay there again.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This space was great for the four of us. Even though it rained every day it was still so relaxing to be in the hot tub and watch the river go by. Lots of everything you need in a kitchen to feel at home. The heated floor in the bathroom was lovely. The upstairs bedrooms can be tricky to get to if you have a fear of steep steps. It was an adventure!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"As great as the cabin/area looks in the pictures they just don't do this amazing cabin the justice it deserves. You just never really know until you get there, and we were blown away when we got there. The privacy was amazing, loved feeling like we were alone in the world out there, and yet it was just a short 10 minute drive into town with anything and everything you would need if you had forgotten anything. It really was the perfect place to relax and disconnect for a bit, even though we did have perfect cell signal while out there which was very surprising. We truly loved every second on our trip and plan on saving this cabin for a future stay. We've already told many of our family and friends how great it was as well."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Second time here and it still can’t wait to come back! Such an amazing place.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our group of gals had the BEST ladies weekend at this cabin! The space is located very close to town if one found the need to go to town, (I was there 3 nights and never left - it was wonderful!). The cabin is situated perfectly a hop, skip and jump from a private beach area on the river which exceeded every expectation we may have had, and the cabin itself is equipped with everything one would need, and the communication on the part of the hosts is very responsive and efficient. We would DEFINITELY recommend!!! :D"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely experience! We had total seclusion in a well-kept, updated cabin. The amenities suited our needs perfectly! The house was incredibly clean with nice touches about. The hot tub cabin was such a relaxing experience! We definitely plan to return! I would highly recommend to anyone to stay here - even if just for a short period of time. You won't regret it."

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here. Perfectly secluded, quiet, location for a relaxing trip yet only 10 minutes from poplar bluff for several dinning options and anything else you might need. Very clean, comfortable, welcoming. Really enjoyed sitting on the deck taking in views of the river and the hot tub room was amazing!! Would definitely love to stay again."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful cabin for peaceful relaxation.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The cabin was even better than in the pictures. We enjoyed our week in the secluded space. It had absolutely everything we needed.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is such a hidden gem and a wonderful way to escape and relax! My husband and I enjoyed our weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary and will definitely be booking it again in the future. Kerri is a wonderful hostess and provided us with all of the information we needed and also answered all of our questions very promptly. The cabin was spotless and had everything we could possibly need as well as many unexpected extras:) Thank you for everything!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am a bit of a neat freak, but I felt 100% comfortable because it was SPARKLING clean! Amazing location and super secluded. We loved our stay so much that we already booked our next trip!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kerri's cabin on the river is a beautiful place to get away from it all and relax. We enjoyed soaking in the hot tub. The cabin was clean and stocked with pretty much everything you need. The steps to the upstairs are a little tricky. Especially for someone who has a bit of fear of heights. Lol. But the bed was very comfortable. I highly recommend visiting this property and would definitely enjoy coming there again.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is wonderfully secluded but only 13 minutes from town and a well stocked WalMart Neighborhood Market, with terrific beer and wine selection. It was sparkling clean and had everything you’d need for a romantic weekend or a family getaway in a rustic, hunting lodge motif complete with stuffed deer heads and bob cats. The river is just 100 feet away and its cool water is nice, although it’s not as nice as the screened in hot tub. Plenty of wildlife in the area that visit too."
2020-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!

2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is our second time staying here and we just love it. Kerri is an excellent host and the cabin is perfect. It is a wonderful place to get away.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kerri's cabin is a wonderful place to get away from it all and relax. We spent 4 nights and never needed to leave. Between the screened in porch, fire pit area, deck, and actual cabin itself, it's easy to find a spot to read or watch a movie and be comfortable no matter the temperature outside. It was in the upper 80's/lower 90's during our stay and the hot tub was still great to use in the mornings and evenings. We enjoyed jumping in the river (life jackets advised) upstream from the cabin and letting the swift current take us back to their boat launch area. A bonus, it's not a super buggy area, with regular application of bug spray we only came away with a couple of bites which I was impressed with. We hope to return again!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kerri is an excellent host, and this cabin is the perfect getaway!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is impressive in the pictures, but it is so much better in person. Beautiful in every way. Setting is so peaceful and secluded.

2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Book this cabin! Such a beautiful way to reconnect and unplug! Every inch of this cabin had a special little detail and decoration. The ambience at night in the hot tub suite was unbelievable! We saw a bald eagle fly and land right outside our deck, deer running through the woods, and an owl hooted for us every evening. What a breath of fresh air it was to get out and away! We enjoyed the walking trail around the cabin and we made a bonfire in the amazing outside fireplace. The beds were so comfortable and the bathroom was spotless! Kitchen is equipped with everything you need to enjoy home away from home!Kerri and family, thank you for sharing your family treasure with us! We will be back!♡"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Kerri’s cabin is a great place to escape from the big city. I recommend her cabin to anyone trying to get away from the city life

2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Best AirBnB I have stayed at. My wife and I loved our time there. It rained the whole trip, but even though that limited us to the indoors, there was still plenty to do. The screened-in porch feels like it's own spa! The cabin itself feels very homey; you can tell a lot of effort was put into making it not just a vacation place but a home away from home. The property itself is very large, and the isolation is so relaxing and peaceful. The perfect place to get away, unplug from life and technology, and just rest! One of our favorite vacations as a couple."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a wonderful place to get away to! The hot tub room was pure heaven. Everything was clean and beautifully decorated. Very peaceful and aesthetically pleasing. Kerri was a great hostess and gave us all the information we needed to find the cabin with helpful tips. Very satisfied and would like to visit again.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is beyond amazing. Nothing could have been more perfect and the host was great at answering all of our questions. If you want a placeto go for total relaxation, this is the place. We can't wait to go back!"
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"HIGHLY recommend! An all around amazing experience! This was our second time staying at the cabin and we couldn’t have been more satisfied.

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The pictures don’t do this place justice. It’s just beautiful.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING!! The pictures of the place dont do it justice. The place had anything u could think of from chairs to rafts to charcoal, coffee, all kitchen supplies and utensils, EVERYTHING! We brought all that with us because you never know so next time we wont haul all that lol
The hot tub and gas fireplace in the attached screened in portch were so cozy and fun at night, very cute and charming. The beds were EXTREMELY comfortable and sheets were very soft. The cabin is completely spotless and updated. Love the bedrooms in the loft, it's almost like a treehouse! Us girls cant wait to come back, but this time for longer!! Friday-Sunday was not long enough lol we all wanted to just live there and never go back home lol"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you are looking for a private place to get away from the hussel and bussel of life. . Check this place out!

2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My boyfriend and I stayed at this cabin for our anniversary and it was amazing!! It was a beautiful property inside and out. It was very peaceful and relaxing. A nice long day of fishing on the river followed by a soak in the hot tub (which has the most incredible ambience). Host was great with communication and very thoughtful. We loved our stay and will definitely come back if we are ever in the area again. Thank you so much for everything!

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second stay at this wonderful cabin, and we were more blown away than the first time. Since last year they have added on a screened-in hot tub area with gas fireplace and flat screen tv. They had so many thoughtful, personal touches.....robes and toiletries you wouldn't expect. The location is so private. It truly is your space away from the world on the river while you rent it. You may see an occasional fisherman traveling past by boat, but other than that you could dance naked on the wrap around deck if you wanted. We were so grateful to be able to stay again. I want to thank Kerri for being a great host. She was extremely responsive."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This ""cabin"" is wonderful! We hosted a small wedding there and I received many compliments. Several friends who liked it so much they want to rent it now! Kerri is a top-notch host!"

2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I have stayed at countless airbnbs, vrbos, and the like. We are always looking for hidden gems that are worth a repeat visit. We do our research prior to booking and generally are always satisfied. But, when we arrived at this cabin we knew we had found that gem. The cabin sits directly on the river and offers privacy that very few places afford anymore. The kind of place that doesn’t need curtains or blinds. The wrap around deck is amazing and offers covered and oncovered areas to sit and admire the river directly in front of you. The owners had to have put in countless hours to clear the land around the river to offer such a view while still preserving the beauty of nature that surrounds it. The river is slow enough in front of the cabin so you can take a swim and cool off if you would like. There is a boat launch/public access up river if you wanted to float down to the cabin….that was our original plan, but once we got to the cabin we said to heck with it. The cabin offered all the entertainment we needed….a small zipline, yard games, a walking/ATV trail. The inside of the cabin was immaculate and stylishly decorated. Some people open their home to you, these owners truly OPEN their home to you. I couldn’t believe the things they made available to their guests. They had a large screen TV connected to dish network. We were able to screen our phone to the TV and watch the Cardinals game each evening. Everything was great. I hate to write this review….I wish some things could stay secret, but I owe it to the owners for an awesome weekend. I hope you will have us in the future because we will definitely be requesting a booking again."
2018-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place
Really comfy
All the supplies for cooking meals are there.
Television is easy to hook up to iPad.
super clean, quiet, senic.
The river was so nice and lots of wildlife from deer when we first pulled in, to tiny field mice, and a frog. like the field mouse and the frog were together it was so cute. An ole owl that hoots right up till the sun comes up. I'm an early bird myself so I was sitting by the river to experiance all this. oh yeah and a beautiful woodpecker. I was one of 4 guests that stayed this weekend and this is my personal review. We all loved it."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We came to town for graduation, 3 adults, 3 year old & an 8 month old. This house was clean, well furnished & homey. I had an issue with a ceiling fan not working and I messaged Lane to give her a heads up and she offered to send someone out asap to fix it. It wasn’t a big deal so I declined but I did appreciate the offer! I had to message her a few times but every time she was responsive & helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"

We were visiting for the Puxico Homecoming. Weekend weather was quite warm, to our dismay there wasn’t an ice maker or trays to make ice! This would have been much appreciate. We did purchase a bag of ice 😏
The linens and beds were wonderful.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This home is beautifully updated while enhancing the original design and style. We enjoyed finding the old cutting board and outdoor phone that were original to the home. This host thought of everything including makeup clothes and those things that we often forget on trips like ponytail holders and toiletries.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved this ranch style home. The decor was beautiful and we felt right at home. The private back patio with fire pit was a very nice touch. We will definitely book again, if available the next time we go to Poplar Bluff to see our son and grandson."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is an amazing find in Poplar Bluff! We've stayed at many places in the area and this one is by far the best. First impressions, the place is so cozy and more importantly very clean. I didn't feel like I was staying in a place other people are in and out of.
In fact, my kid loved the decor in the house so much he wrote in the guest book that he'd like you guys to come decorate our house.
Lane was fantastic to communicate with. The one issue we had was solved so quickly. I also got to visit with her because before the trip she arranged to come by one morning while internet was getting installed and she was a delight.
We hosted a couple family members for a post-Christmas celebration and they all mentioned how nice the space was.
There's two living rooms, which was very ideal for kids. We could get some time away from each other while the chilled in one living room and the adults hung out in another."

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall it was a wonderful ! Was a little short on baking dishes and kitchen supplies. We had to borrow casserole dishes, larger pot, toaster, pie tins from family who live in area to prepare food for 9 people. We did buy and leave a few kitchen utensils as well as trash bags, paper towels etc. overall it was a great experience just a little short on supplies. We probably could have asked Carla but it was a holiday week and we didn’t want to disturb. This is not a negative review in any way.

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re going to be in the area, book this place without hesitation. All the other reviews are right, this place is a jewel! Our family absolutely loved our visit. It’s a great place to relax and enjoy the sounds of nature at night. The place was immaculately clean and comfortable. The kitchen is only minimally stocked with dishes and glassware, but the kitchen in the main house is available for use if you want to prepare food more complicated then a microwave can handle. The full breakfast provided for us in the morning was a pleasant surprised and very delicious. Every thing you might need has been thought about and the amenities are numerous. We will be back in future. Bring a fishing pole if that’s your thing, as the pond is stocked and is a fun place to drop a line."
2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The view of Mirror Lake was incredible. From the time we arrived to the time we left, the hospitality was top notch. When I booked the cabin, I didn’t know it was actually attached to the B&B they ran. When Becky showed us the cabin, she then asked us what we wanted for breakfast, we were caught off guard a little as she gave several options like pancakes, eggs, B&G, etc. She also gave us a few options for supper, but we already had a place in mind (Bread&Butter). When we told her, she agreed that was a good place to eat. If you needed anything, you could texted them, but the place was also private."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place on the water. Wildlife out your front door and on the patio. Great relaxing get away spot
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem, picturesque on its own and just minutes from gorgeous hiking... Becky can cook ! She made sure we found everything we needed, and definitely made us know we were welcome. I would definitely come back !"
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is AWESOME . I have stayed in TONS of Airbnb’s and these guys put so much thought and personal touches into the experience.

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property was as pictured and as described - very pretty, with calming colors and nice decor. Kristin is super responsive.
Bloomfield is a nice little town, and host provided recommendations for dining and other activities. While options in Bloomfield are limited, nearby Dexter has more options. Sikeston is within about 1/2 hour. We enjoyed the nearby town square and all the historical markers. Our reason for staying in Bloomfield was to visit the Stars & Stripes Museum, and for that, this was a perfect location.
Our only issues keeping me from giving it 5 stars are that the housekeeping person didn’t re-stock some items needed (we expected to have toilet paper and coffee for 2 people for 2 nights) and we had to work around a leaking bathroom sink - Kristin offered to call a plumber right away but didn’t want to inconvenience us by making us wait around when we had plans for the day. A stop on both ends of the barn door rail to keep it from sliding off would be helpful."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Great place. Clean. Well decorate. Comfortable. Kristin is a great host! Responsive, helpful and kind."

I work remotely and this was the perfect place to work during the week: quiet,swanky, fast & reliable internet, plenty of air conditioning, plenty of workspace, and a large fridge. I got a lot done in our 4-5 days staying there - even my laundry! Kristin was wonderful! She was quick to respond to all of our questions - even BEFORE we made a reservation (and a reservation on short notice at that).
This is a gem and it will certainly be our “go-to” from now on when we visit family in Bloomfield. We highly recommend the stay, it’s worth every penny. Bravo!!

The home is decorated in a modern boho theme throughout . You can definitely tell how much time and effort Kristin took to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. From the second you walk in the front door to the moment your sipping coffee on the back porch you feel that warm and cozy at home feeling! The home is well equipped with everything you need. We would definitely stay again . Thank You again Kristin for making our stay so wonderful during a chaotic time.

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"I came to watch a basketball tournament at Three Rivers College. The home is extremely private and in a quiet setting. The home is a bit dated, but clean and comfortable. The king mattress was memory foam and very comfortable. Definitely enjoyed the solitude."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was such a nice place to stay! My boyfriend was even allowed to hunt on the property!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Loved the house and property, very ideal for outdoorsy type people. Close to poplar bluff but just far enough that you’re out of town. Some good places to eat in town as well."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great for a family stay
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This place was mouth dropping Beautiful! SPOTLESS when we got there! Host was hopeful and they have the best cleaning crew on the planet! Thank you so much!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This rental was an excellent place for my family to stay while doing some travel work. It was a peaceful, secluded location with beautiful views. Waking up and being able to see right out into the woods was excellent. We had plenty of wildlife to see. Overall, it was a great place for us and will be used again while in Poplar Bluff."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place very peaceful. Only recommendation I would have is to get high speed internet. Other than than very peaceful and great place. Will book again

The decor is a bit dated. But otherwise all was great."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was wonderful! We were in town for a wedding so we didn’t get to stay too long at the house. I loved the big kitchen. The sunroom was beautiful with all the windows. And the beds were very comfortable! I also loved all the books laying around. Thanks for sharing your home with us. Patty
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Best rental I’ve been in. Beautiful place. Worth the stay!! Definitely want to stay again

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect for my weekend stay. Loved the scenery. Felt right at home ! 10/10 !
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, quiet and clean."
2022-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We strongly recommend a thorough cleaning of this house. We had severe allergic reactions while inside the house that noticeably cleared up outside the house. Non-stop sneezing, congestion, itchy eyes, and coughing. The tissue boxes everywhere were a nice touch but made us wonder if this has been a problem in the past. We noticed in the listing that pets are allowed and we are allergic to cats and some dogs. There was a strange smell in the house as if it hadn’t been opened in awhile. The smell of old or musty. The local host did not respond to my follow up email asking whether there were other people staying in the downstairs since there were lights on every night even though we booked the entire place. Quite concerning. The kitchen was also weirdly outfitted. We ended up needing to buy a pot and a spoon or two because there weren’t any. We also couldn’t watch tv because it said that the streaming services were already being used on too many devices, although not by us.
Other than these things, we enjoyed our stay and the property is quite pretty."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great Place to stay
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, and clean, spacious with nice views"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Enjoyed the privacy and there was room for our 33 ft trailer. Enjoyed the visits of deer, coyote, owl, firefly's and neighborhood dog."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jason and Ryan were responsive to our needs. I had asked prior to our stay about fishing options, and Jason offered lots of options available in the area even though there are no ponds on this property. The kitchen is so spacious with all that is needed for cooking. It is not far from Poplar Bluff and offered a serene and comfortable setting. There were books, games and a fire pit for family fun. We will definitely want to stay there again in the future."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good space for the money.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful location with an amazing kitchen and views throughout the house. We saw deer and the lightening bugs were out in the evening. If you are looking for a peaceful place in the country this is your place! The beds were very comfortable as well.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Greatly appreciated how clean the unit was. It was tastefully decorated and updated. Johnathan was easy to contact and very helpful. Would rent here again.
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"Seemed like we were 1st guests in a completely renovated apartment with all new appliances. All was very clean but no “homey” feel. No dressers and only one nightstand in our bedroom which ok for the overnight but not for several days or a week. We have paid less for a many more amenities.
M & I"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A good place to stay.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,went to see the eclipse and simply walked out the door and setup a picnic under a tree next door. Had a good experience all around. The nearby Lemonade Grill and Japanese Hibachi restaurants are both very good. highly recommend them both as well.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"easy to find right off a main road, but the noise is very minimal once inside so sleeping was a breeze. it was absolutely spotless with very clean furniture, the bathroom being especially clean was so nice. comfortable and modern with plenty of restaurants and activities not far from the apartment. i will definitely stay here again but would plan ahead for staying-in activities other than watching tv."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great apartment just off a main road. Easy access. Super clean and up to date.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an incredible, sparkling clean and convenient little place! My only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer…. But, we will be back! ◡̈"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Just as described. Super clean and very responsive host. Worked with me to check in early and the place was better than expected. The size of the place was a nice surprise, with plenty of room to spread out with privacy. Would stay here again!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jonathan’s place was great! Probably the cleanest AIRBNB I’ve been to yet. Would stay here again for sure.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,very nice place and was very clean!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very easy to get to and close to town. Host was very responsive if we had a question. The unit was very clean and had plenty of space for two couples to stay. My main criticism would be that the beds were not the most comfortable and the pillows pretty flat. Not a huge deal by any means, but could be a relatively easy thing to improve for future guests. Even so, I'd stay here again in the future."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Newly renovated apartment, clean, quiet place. Very well equipped. One more kindness was the oral hygiene kit and laundry room kit. Very good internet and all TVs with streaming. Highly recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jon was extremely accommodating and understanding and willing to work with me to resolve and error on my part. I enjoyed my stay and hope to use his properties in future visits.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This apartment was immaculate, comfortable, and modern! Our host was very quick to reply and answered every question and was gracious enough to help when I arrived earlier than expected 10/10"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay so comfortable and cozy
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was everything I expected and fit our needs perfectly. It was spacious, and i liked the location. The amenities were just as described. The host was proactive, responsive, and helpful. I would definitely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the perfect getaway, close to highway and many eating places.
Really easy to find and entry instructions are simple.
The house is all on the one level and easily accessible via one step so would potentially suit someone with mobility issues.
The house is is much more spacious than you would think in the pictures and everything is brand new.
We felt very safe in this location.
Beds were super comfortable and we had a very restful sleep. Would definitely recommend as very fairly priced."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Really clean and nice home. Did have some potential plumbing and leaking issues which I notified host of during stay that did not impact our stay overall. Troy was very kind and responsive and issued a partial refund for our inconveniences during our stay. If you do not mind the location of the home in the neighborhood, it is a comfy and cozy place to stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"loved the experience, will definitely be using this instead of hotels every time now!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Will book with Troy again. He was a very responsive host and his property suited our needs well.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place for the price and an extremely responsive host! Would definitely book again!
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"The inside was nice, things were clean and it has been updated. The beds were comfortable.
The outside of the house was fairly run down. The lock was very hard to use, both locking and unlocking.
The neighborhood was really rough: abandoned, boarded up house next door and several houses that were kind of scary. We were three ladies and when we were by ourselves we felt a little unsafe- even though nothing happened.
However, the price reflects this and I think for the cost it was a good deal. I would have wanted to know about the neighborhood before we reserved- that is why I am sharing that."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Will book with Troy again !!
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,We had an issue that require in person care . They responded immediately they were there within 10 minutes.Very friendly and courteous.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and spacious! Worked great for our family.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Troy's house, we were conveniently located next to where we were working. The house is much larger on the inside than it appears from the outside. Troy was a great communicator, next time we're in poplar bluff we will definitely request to stay again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay while visiting family member in the hospital.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Tha nk you. Will keep in mind for the future.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. You could tell it was all renovated
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was so spacious and clean and seems newly renovated. Beds were extremely comfortable!!! Troy was helpful and responded quickly. Our only disappointments in the 3 day stay were that the house is in a rather noisy, rundown neighborhood, and it had a sort of musty smell inside. We really appreciated the water filter under the sink for fresh drinking water and also the convenience of a washer and dryer. Overall, the house is set up very well for a multiple night stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time staying at Troy’s place. The home was spacious and had everything we needed and more. I was here for work, and since I work the night shift, quietness during the day is important. I was worried at first since the place is located in town, but I had no issues. It was storming a lot during our storming a lot during our stay and I didn’t hear it. I didn’t even hear my family up in the next room! We will definitely be checking availability next time we are in town!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My employees enjoyed their stay at Troy's Place, clean, spacious, and quiet neighbors. Would highly recommend, Host was very responsive and friendly."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very nice home. You can tell they are trying to update it. Definitely worth the price!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Well worth it.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice little spot on the river
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is absolutely beautiful, really quiet. You’re away from everyone. The indoor/outdoor speakers are amazing. My wife got to do a little fishing and even caught a bass out there she was so excited about it. We had a whole plan for our weekend but as soon as we seen our cabin we just stayed there and fished, stayed in the hot tub. It’s like all of our worries just floated away."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This home is absolutely amazing! The location is secluded with a beautiful view of the black river! The hot tub was such a nice touch and we throughly enjoyed in the evening. This home is located close enough to town and multiple hiking trails and beautiful parks! We plan to come back very soon!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at this new home next to the Black River was an absolute delight! It was the perfect spot for catching the solar eclipse with ample space and a rustic country vibe. The TV on a moving arm and sound system added a touch of modernity, while the Bluetooth connectivity and outdoor audio zone elevated our experience. The property's seclusion amidst stunning scenery, yet close proximity to town, was a winning combination. Highly recommend for a tranquil getaway!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved the decorating and family setting.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our provider was very pleased about the Airbnb and Lauren was willing to work with us.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the cabin was nothing short of delightful. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with warmth and thoughtful touches that immediately made us feel at home. The decor was tastefully done, exuding a cozy and inviting atmosphere reminiscent of visiting a beloved family member's house. Every detail, from the well-stocked bookshelves to the assortment of games and amenities, contributed to a memorable and enjoyable experience. The double bunk beds were a hit with the kids, and the sun porch provided the perfect spot for relaxation. It truly felt like the owners had gone above and beyond to ensure our comfort and enjoyment, with little touches like pre-stocked essentials and a convenient Wi-Fi QR code adding to the overall sense of care and hospitality."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Our stay was good. Exactly what we were looking for
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at this cabin. The whole place was amazingly clean and comfortable, with cool indoor and outdoor seating areas, well-equipped kitchen, spotless bathroom, and lots of spare linen/towels/bedding. Check-in was simple, using the nicely written instructions sent by the hosts the day before; check-out was also very easy, using the (also) nicely written handbook inside the cabin. Our kids loved the outdoor fire pit and hiking around nearby Lake Wappapello. I would highly recommend this stay - our family loved it."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Fantastic area and beautiful stay, well worth the cost!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the most thoughtfully decorated and well-stocked airbnb I’ve stayed in! It was truly so perfect - no complaints!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A great place for a father/son retreat. Relaxed and peaceful.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here on our babymoon and it was the perfect spot. Cozy, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. The kitchen was stocked with helpful essentials, the bed was comfortable, and there were multiple spots to lounge and relax. The state park nearby was also beautiful! A perfect relaxing weekend getaway!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Very well stocked and cabin layout was great. Fire pit was awesome! Would highly recommend!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As described; fun house in the woods very close to the lake; would stay here again!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren’s place was exactly as described in the listing. Very cute touches and decor and great amenities. The house manual and Lauren’s instructions were very helpful. The acorns and little branches falling in the metal roof on the our first night startled us, but we got used to it and slept comfortably. Despite some creepy crawlies, which we expected because let’s face it, your in the woods, we had a wonderful stay and would recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lauren was a very polite and responsive host. She always replied within minutes and was very helpful and kind! The screened in porch was easily our favorite part of the cabin, but we also greatly appreciated the seamless access to WiFi and our favorite streaming services! The cabin was quite clean for our stay. We enjoyed the proximity to Wappapello State Park, too. The Allison Day use area was fantastic!
There were a few things beyond the host's control that I would want to know if I booked. These things didn't diminish our stay too much, but are notable. We were not thrilled with the neighborhood. One home had broken junk and trash lined up along the road along their entire property line. The neighbor that you can see from the cabin had a very messy outdoor space within visibility, which kept us off the front deck. We also had an instance where their dogs followed us.
All in all, we enjoyed our time together, and I'm very thankful for the wonderful host that Lauren was!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,grate place real close to lake. vary relaxing and there was lot for my 5 year old to do from bord games to swimming and exploring. five star
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at this well stocked, comfortable cabin. Warm, welcoming, fun decor; nice use of space. Lauren has excellent attention to detail. The space is as described by Host and previous reviewers.
Lake Wappapello State Park swimming area is 8 minute drive.
The state park is lovely, picturesque, and not crowded; we can't imagine why it's not overrun with folks from St Louis. We did 1 of the hikes which was well maintained until the last half mile, then the waist high grasses covered the trail, tic and chigger heaven.
We are glad we found this cabin and this park; we'll be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything is exactly as listed. The place was clean and it even came fully stocked with essentials.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great weekend getaway here with our dog and baby. We hiked and checked out the beach at the lake. Lauren’s cabin was very cute and comfortable!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great family experience. The cabin feels more like a well prepared vacation home than a cabin.
I smoked steaks, pork steaks, brats, and cabbage on the provided grill smoker. The kitchen and house had everything we needed, including a first aid kit and tick removal kit, which was needed after our late May lakeside hike.
Kiddos enjoyed s'mores by the campfire and sleeping in the bunks. Our bed was comfy as well."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lauren's place was the perfect place to get away and relax in the peace and quiet. Loved sitting on the screened porch listening to the rain on the tin roof! Great place to stay! I would definitely go back if in the area!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lauren’s home was as beautiful as the pictures and was a great weekend getaway for my husband & I with our dog. We can’t wait to come back - and bonus, it smelt wonderful for a cabin! :)"
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,this was a wonderful weekend getaway. very peaceful and homey. easy driving distance to poplar bluff. kitchen was wonderful to cook in. beds were cozy and the living room was great for movie watching. we would stay again! lauren was very kind and helpful with our stay. :)
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay at the Hillside Cottage...the cabin was as described, and the layout was perfect for our family. Loved all the activities/games available for kiddos. Enjoyed our time at the cabin - very relaxing and peaceful."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very helpful and responsive.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house was very pretty and clean. It felt comfortable, just like as if we was at home. I just wish it would of been a warmer time to where we could of enjoyed the land and everything around it. It will be a nice place to rent once it gets warmer. Overall it was a great rental."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lauren's cabin is very lovely! It's wonderfully decorated and extremely cozy! Our kids had a blast playing on the covered porch and our son learned how to play chess. It rained all weekend so we weren't able to use the fire pit or hammock, but it looked amazing. We had a wonderful stay at her cabin."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is very cute, well-maintained, and cozy. We visited in the winter, so it was nice to sit by the fireplace, play board games, and watch movies with our family. The kitchen was well-stocked. The bedrooms were clean and spacious. The bed was a little firm for our preference.
The proximity to Lake Wappapello State Park is great. We went for a hike, enjoyed the beauty of the lake, and spent some time there. Also, it's not too far of a drive to Poplar Bluff, which has some good antique stores, shops, and restaurants.
The biggest bummer was the neighborhood around the cabin. While it's not really the fault of the host, the surrounding neighbors and homes leading up to the cabin are very junky and unkempt. Lots of trailers, trash scattered around, etc. Sort of ruins the vibe."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very charming, intentionally placed pieces made it feel like home. Plenty of room for our gang of 6. Can’t wait to go back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is so beautifully decorated and cozy! My family of 5 had a wonderful and relaxing stay. Lauren provided such an amazing selection of board games, toys and activities that my kids (ages 6, 9, and 10) had something fun to do every minute! We enjoyed watching a movie on the comfy couch, hanging out around the fire pit outside in the evenings and playing games together. The fall leaves looked beautiful from the screened in porch, so we enjoyed sitting out there for coffee and checkers or reading. The kitchen is FULLY stocked…I didn’t think of a thing I needed once I got there."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this little cabin in the woods. Beautiful state park close by for swimming and boating. Also great for staying in and cozying up with a book in the fall. Wonderful option for families. We hope to return!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked the Hillside Hideaway as a last minute getaway before school starts. Lauren was incredible and flexible with us. The cabin could not be more welcoming. It is so lived in and cozy - like a hug! We spent lots of time on the screened in porch playing chess and checkers. Our 6 year old son loved chess so much we had to order a set before we even left. Our two year old enjoyed the swing, the hammock, the playdough and so many other toys that Lauren has thoughtfully cultivated. We went hiking, fishing and swimming at Lake Wappapello State Park which is a short drive away and had a really good supper at Crabb & Company. It was wonderful to have uninterrupted time together. I am dreaming of a fall trip with my girls friends to this sweet cabin. It is such a lovely place to just be. If you need a getaway, the Hillside Hideaway is a dream!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cabin was cuter in person. Myself and five of my girlfriends, all in her 40s, spent the weekend away before school starts for our kids. Not only was the B&B cleaner than most we have been to, it was eclectic vintage in the Good way not the dusty grandma kind of way. The sheets were so soft. Also typically I have a fear of spiders at cabins, not only did I not see any but it was so clean that I wasn’t afraid of seeing any."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lauren’s cabin was perfect for a last minute trip with our family and dog! The cabin is perfectly situated close to the lake and state park. Lauren was very responsive to our questions and made us feel welcome. Lake Wappapello is a hidden gem!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Perfect relaxing getaway for our family of five plus doggo! Amazing space for kids and adults alike. We loved all the perfect and thoughtful touches and details. Hammock and fire pit were big hits with our three kids and they loved the bunk room. Games galore and just a super-well suited space for families. Lauren was an amazing hostess and we can’t wait to go back!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is all around the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in - very clean, well-stocked with everything you could need, and super cutely decorated. It’s convenient to the Lake Wappapello beach and several hiking trails and was a great place to hide out and relax for the week. We loved it and would gladly come back."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peaceful and well stocked cabin
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a great cabin! Nicely kept, decorated, and furnished. I was very impressed with the thoughtfulness that went into creating an awesome and welcoming vibe. I appreciated the amenities included, down to the tick kit and all the essential kitchenware. Loved, the screened sunroom and comfy spaces created both indoor and outdoor. The cabin was minutes away from a nice scenic trail and a nice marina for kayaking. I highly recommend this cabin!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I booked a last minute getaway, just to get a change of scenery for my family. This cabin was perfect for us and our two young kids (3, 5). There were toys and games, which were perfectly suited for them and they loved the novelty of playing with something new (rather then the toys we brought). Of course they also loved the bunk beds, screened in porch and outside space (hammock, fire pit). The place was cozy, well-designed and the kitchen was well-stocked. Nice touches included having charcoal for the grill and firewood on hand. If you’re a coffee drinker, there are a few different brewing options as well! Hiking and boating (if you do that) at the lake is about a 10-15 minute drive away (rough guess). If I had any complaints, there isn’t a dishwasher, so it’s just a bit of a bummer to have to spend so much time hand washing during a “getaway”… but also wouldn’t expect one in a cabin like this!
Overall we had a lovely stay and only wish the weather had been warmer so we could’ve spent more time on the porch in the morning and at night."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is very comfortable and welcoming for families and people of all ages. The cabin is in an idyllic wooded area and makes for a great, off-the-grid feeling trip immersed in nature—but not without modern (Wi-Fi!!) necessities. Would stay again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a special place. Some stays just have a feel to them, and this is one of those. It is an escape. Unplug from the world and connect to nature without sacrificing comfort ot modern amenities. Be sure to grab dinner at the Chinioa Landing. Amazing steak and homemade icecream."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great little last-minute, long-weekend getaway at this adorable cabin! The drive south to the cabin was easy, peacefully scenic and low in traffic (keep in mind that for maybe an hour on highway 67 approaching the cabin, there is little in the way of food and gas options, so plan accordingly). As others have stated, the cabin is CLEAN and well-stocked with cooking and baking equipment. We brought all of our groceries for the weekend, including a family-sized container of cookie dough, which we used to bake several batches of cookies with the kids. The colorful plastic kids’ dining items helped keep track of whose plate and cup was whose, and we didn’t have to worry about anything breaking. The cabin’s location is nicely secluded. It is not “off-grid” or “dogs can roam off-leash” level secluded, as there are a few homes in the vicinity, but it was definitely rural, woodsy and very quiet. We weren’t quite sure if there were hiking trails within walking distance (we didn’t want to pack everyone up and drive into the state park), so we spent most of our time around the cabin, reading books and playing with the fun games and toys that Lauren provided (the younger kids were entertained all weekend). We also enjoyed swinging on the saucer swing outside, and drinking coffee, playing checkers or reading a book or magazine (Lauren has some interesting reads scattered around the cabin) on the screened porch. Nights were quiet and peaceful, making s’mores at the fire pit and appreciating the stars, then coming back in and gathering around the fireplace- electric is so fast and convenient!!- and watching a movie (streaming and WiFi worked flawlessly for us). Hot water for dishes and bathing was plentiful, and the beds were very comfortable; we all slept uncommonly well. Lauren always communicated extremely quickly and thoroughly. Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Quaint and cozy! Perfect quiet spot for a getaway. Highly recommend for the area.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is lovely. Lauren thought of everything. Comfortable, inviting and perfect. Excellent hiking and amazing star gazing!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was everything we could have wished for and then some! The cabin is so cozy and well-decorated, we loved every little detail. It’s also so livable; everything was very dog (and probably kid!) friendly and the kitchen is stocked with everything you could need. We loved hiking at the nearby state park, and Lauren was a wonderful host. Can’t wait to come back when it’s warmer!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great little cabin. Beautifully furnished and well-stocked for a weekend getaway. Lauren was very responsive when we had questions. Check-in and check-out were super easy. We enjoyed it for a winter weekend, cozied up by the fireplace reading or making s’mores around the campfire. But would also be a fun home base for outside adventures."
2021-12-01,5.0,Group trip,We had the most magical and perfect stay. Everything was exactly as mentioned/pictured etc. It was the perfect weekend getaway for us 7 girls who were all perfectly comfortable in the super comfy beds. Lauren was very responsive when booking and truly created the most whimsical getaway space. Highly recommend.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay! The place is decorated really cute and had everything you could need for a weekend stay. We loved how big the kitchen was to cook a great Thanksgiving meal and spent a lot of time cozied up to the indoor and outdoor fires. We feel it is best accommodated by a single family as it says it sleeps 8 but 6 is the comfort level with appropriate beds. The host had board games available, a cute bar set up, treats for purchase, and laundry available."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very cute place and Lauren had thoughtful pieces throughout the house. Great location for outdoor activities.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,My husband and I stayed at Lauren’s cabin for a week and had a great time! Very cozy and comfortable! Kitchen had everything we needed for cooking! We loved watching the sunset from the screened in porch.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Can’t say enough-about lauren and this cozy cute cabin. Far away from all the noise and people. Just loved all the details and decorations- and the fire pit! Perfection
Lauren was a great host and accommodating- will be back for sure !"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time. The kitchen has everything you'll need, you have internet, the fire pit is huge and the grill is right there! Comfortable bed and just a lovely place to spend time. Highly recommend the hiking trails in Lake Wappapello State Park as well."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a priceless experience that far exceeded our expectations! The cabin is gorgeous and each detail so thoughtful. It had everything we needed, and Lauren was a fantastic host. We were rained in, and it was just the cozy, relaxing break we needed- we haven't felt this content and rested in quite some time. This place is a true gem!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lauren’s place was great! My partner & dogs enjoyed a relaxing Labor Day weekend. The attention to detail and availability of any needed supplies was the best I’ve experienced from any host. Would absolutely stay again :)
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our time at the Hillside Hideaway. Everything was very clean and well kept. Lauren was a great host who answered our one question within a few minutes of texting her. There were plenty of things to keep us occupied in the cabin. We really enjoyed having breakfast in the screened in porch and listening to music with the provided bluetooth radio. Lots of hiking trails close by as well as a great beach to go swimming. Everything we needed to cook our meals was provided as well as common spices. Highly recommended.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Lauren’s cabin was perfect for my girlfriend and our two dogs! The lake is a short 7 minute drive away and there are numerous trails close by. Lauren is great at communicating and made us feel at home! We look forward to staying here again soon!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We needed a place to view the eclipse. This was easy and pleasant. Low key. Clean. Misty represented the space well. Nothing fancy but easy! I'd stay again if I needed to.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,thanks for everything.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,thanks for everything.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Thank you for sharing your home. It was close to work so it great! little hard to find as first but read instructions helped out!
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"We understood there was no internet, we thought we had Ethernet.
We didn’t expect that we would not be able to watch tv at all. We felt misled.
The couch in the living room is the most uncomfortable couch we have ever sat on. The back door needs to be replaced, we were two women and a grandson traveling for the holidays we could see daylight through the door. It made us a little nervous. We planned a two night stay but left after one night."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I was a out of town visitor. Had vehicle emergency just passing through town. Misty got me right into into her place right away so I had shelter and was very flexible on dates while I waited for someone to come get me and my vehicle. The place was in the perfect spot at the right time! Thank you Misty! Your unbelievable!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Enjoyed our stay so much that we were able to extend for a few more days.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,10/10 plave to stay. For the price it was perfect for us and Misty was incredible kind!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The place actually looks way better in person it’s really cute in there comfortable beds nice blankets. Was a nice place to stay
2023-03-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"The price per night is on par with the place and location. There is a giant sign when you walk in that says the host isn’t responsible for stolen property or damage to vehicles. Which makes me think there have been issues in the past. Thankfully, we didn’t have an issue but every noise outside makes you get up to look out the window. The house is in a gravel parking lot right off the highway where they seem to store construction equipment. As I said the price per night is reasonable. But, the cleaning fee seems a little steep considering the place wasn’t very clean. There were cobwebs in the doorways, mud in the hallway, and hair in the hall bathroom sink. So, I’m not sure where the $100 for cleaning goes… lastly, there is a tv with Roku so you can watch Netflix etc. but, the internet isn’t fast enough to stream anything. So, that seems like a waste. I’m not sure I would stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This is the second time staying in one of Misty’s air bnb’s. The house was clean and just as expected. Close to just about anywhere in town.

2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Immediate (and patient!) response from host when I was confused about the check-in process, which was very helpful. Location is not a residential neighborhood and felt a little exposed, but we had a nice visit."
2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property served its purpose. I’ve stayed in many Airbnb and this one was lowest in quality. It’s a trailer which is not in the description. The amenities were sparse and low in quality. One of the bathroom’s shower/tub floor felt like it had a bubble under it. Each time I stepped it popped. Some of the electrical outlets didn’t work. Ants were in the kitchen. I left a glass of water in the kitchen. When I returned , there were ants in my water. For the price I paid for each night compared to the quality of the property, it was definitely not worth it!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beds are so comfortable!!!! Location is easy to get to anything in Poplar Bluff and nearby. Large tub in the master is nice for just relaxing in the evening. The split bedroom layout is nice to separate from the rest of the family also. Kitchen is stocked and we love that the unit has a washer and dryer. We have had some internet problems but Misty has always been VERY responsive despite the time difference. If you have multiple cars or in the case where we had a large moving truck and vehicle transport behind a pick up, the parking really is ample and easy to maneuver."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Kelly’s condo was exactly as described. It’s in a quiet area just a bit away from town. I felt very safe and was less than 10 minutes from food stores, restaurants, etc. Kelly was always responsive when I had questions. When there was a power outage, she sent a message in less than 10 minutes letting me know it was due to maintenance on the lines and would be back on shortly. The condo was clean and uncluttered, yet stocked with items commonly needed in a home. Very handy. I was also very happy it had a carport. I highly recommend Kelly as a host and this condo for a stay."

It’s located in a nice quite area close to town.
Bedrooms are large with very comfortable beds. Closets are big with plenty of storage.
Living room furniture is showing wear but it works.
Nice washer and dryer comes in handy!
Basic cooking utensils are provided, pots & pans. But if you do any baking you will need to pick those up.
Definitely would recommend Kelly’s place for long term stay. Kelly was easy to contact if you had any question."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved everything starting with the drive into the property which was a wonderful maze getting through. Walked through the door and it was a blast from the past at a look into the 70’s with everything matching the vibe aesthetically!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful, peaceful, quiet, perfect"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Fox Den was the perfect weekend getaway cabin. My husband and I enjoyed every aspect of this 70’s themed cabin and we had so much fun going over all the details and knick knacks that decorated the cabin. The surroundings were perfectly peaceful and we had everything we needed at the cabin already! The accommodations were so comfortable and we were able to relax and soak up all the coziness! We already plan on going back in the future!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Just... wow!! What an amazing space with tons of character! Kimberly has clearly put a lot of time, detail, and care into creating her cabin theme. She created a beautiful mash-up of quaint country and the 70's, with so many details that both make the space more cozy, beautiful, and on theme. I could go on and on about all of the things, but I will try to stick to a few of my favorites. I loved the farm-fresh eggs in the fridge with supplies and tools to make pancakes or waffles, and there was also a vintage-style popcorn maker, which was fun to re-experience. The outdoor spaces were well adorned with the hot tub on the back porch and the fire pit, lounge chairs, and grill on the other side. The record player in the corner was such a nice touch as well!
The usual vacation things were also of very nice quality... the bed and bedding were divine, the robes and towels were super soft, and the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries.
Highly recommend staying with Kimberly! :)"

Every detail in the place made it very unique and we could not have asked for a better place to get away. If you are looking for a spot to spend with someone, or by yourself, for a retreat I would definitely recommend the Fox Den! Kimberly was also a great host who answered any questions we had and was very welcoming!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I just spent a long weekend in The Fox Den, and we loved everything about this place. Mrs. Kim took such good care of us throughout our entire stay and answered all of our questions so quickly. She discovered there was a problem with the hot tub a few hours before our check-in time and called to let us know we had the option of staying in her other space while she and her husband got it taken care of. It was fixed quickly and she even comped our first night because of it, she truly went above and beyond for us all weekend long. This is the perfect place for a getaway and the boat ramp right down the road was the cherry on top! We loved this stay and started planning a trip to come back before we even left! Thank you for a great stay, Kim and Jeff!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a terrific time
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My wife and I just spent a weekend a couple months earlier at ""the roost"", Kimberly's treehouse rental and loved it, we had to come back. We loved ""the fox den"" just as much. The area is so quiet and peaceful giving us the away time we so love. Made for an amazing Valentines/Anniversary get away. The place was clean, well kept and had all of the amenities you would ever need for a home away from home."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,By far the best cabin option in this region! Loved playing Atari and loved the hot tub!! Everything in the space felt intentionally placed down to the last detail. You feel the loving welcome through the photos and somehow they still don’t do it justice. Totally worth it!!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved our stay highly recommended to anyone looking for a cozy get away.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,so relaxing and private!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kimberly made the stay at her place extra special!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Out of all of the air bnb’s that I’ve stayed at, The Fox Den was the most amazing experience yet. The cabin is absolutely beautiful with a 70’s aesthetic to top it off. Check in was super easy, the place looked exactly as shown, and I felt completely safe. This will surely be my go to getaway!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I had the best stay here at Fox’s Den. Kim was an amazing host and made sure to have instructions written out to everything. She also went above and beyond to provide everything for it to feel like a home. The decor was to die for! From the hanging swing all the way down to the Volkswagen tissue box. We really loved the added details of the 70’s memorabilia everywhere. Kim really put her heart into this place and it shows. The hot tub was such a nice thing to have after a long day. There was an Atari system included and we really enjoyed getting cozy and trying to beat each other in frogger. If you’re looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway this is the place!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing anniversary staying at the Fox Den. The location was serene and private with a wonderful hot tub. The theme was so fun and well done down to the smallest detail. Kimberly was a fantastic host, so kind and accommodating. We can't stop telling all of our friends and family about it. We hope to be back soon!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay at the Fox Den. From the moment we stepped inside, we were transported to the cutest 70s cabin. Every detail was thoughtfully curated to make sure we felt comfortable and pampered. The robes and slippers were a nice touch and we loved the appliances matching the theme. Kim met us on our way out and was a complete delight. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to coming back again soon!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Fox Den was everything and more that I needed for my getaway. Super private, gorgeous area, with all the amenities for me to cook a yummy dinner, or sit with my wine out by the hottub or fire pit. The place itself was just perfect, and adorably decorated and comfortable. Kimberly was very quick to respond always and really friendly, it made the whole experience that much better. Can't recommend enough!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was exactly as described and what we expected. It was so comfortable and peaceful in the neighborhood. What we really appreciated were the two large family rooms with TVs. It allowed a space for activity or TV viewing and a space for conversations. The beds were comfortable. I was extremely pleased with the cleanliness of the entire home. I would definitely stay here again.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our time there. It was a beautiful place and very comfortable. Thanks!
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,The home was clean and roomy and fit our group of 7 very comfortably. Really liked having the 2 family rooms each with roomy sectional sofas. That was nice since we were there for my son’s wedding and it allowed for some of the bridal party to come over and play games and visit with each other as well as other family members.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space for a good price. Updated. Has a very good home feeling
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,We would definitely go back. Really enjoyed the place
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Private and peaceful environment
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"When my family and I came to town to deal with a family emergency, we looked for a spot that we could afford AND would be as comfortable as home to help mitigate the stress we were all under. We found that and more in Carla's beautiful, spacious home. The kitchen is well stocked and the best part: TWO LIVING ROOMS WITH TV'S that made traveling with a teenager easier than ever!
Carla is also a stellar host. One morning halfway into our stay, we awoke to a problem with the furnace during a major cold spell. Carla not only started the process to get the furnace fixed ASAP, but she got another of her listings ready for us in the event she couldn't get the heat going again in a timely fashion. Fortunately, the HVAC repair person got it back up and running the same day, and all was well. I can't recommend Carla enough, and if you need a place to stay for an extended period in Poplar Bluff like we did, look no further than Stoney Manor!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Carla’s place was cozy, spacious and had lovely decor. The master bedroom was very convenient for us with the en suite, and we were able to watch some tv, cook meals, and check out some local eateries during our short stay. Carla was very responsive, (usually within 30 minutes) and the check out instructions were pretty simple as well. Definitely worth staying especially if you have 4+ people. Two big sectional couches could probably sleep a few as well!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for us to stay in Poplar Bluff. Very clean with all the amenities. Would not hesitate to stay there again.

The place was clean, spacious and very much like the photos. Appreciated the little welcome basket of thoughtful snacks and last minute toiletries! It’s a nice quiet location close to plenty of restaurants and shopping. Would absolutely stay here again! Thanks Carla!"

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our short stay at Carla’s house in Poplar Bluff while we rested a few days before continuing our extended road trip. There were a couple of unexpected glitches, but Carla was very responsive and able to smooth everything out quickly.
The master bath is not practical for those with any kind of mobility issues, so I recommend that you sleep in one of the bedrooms on the other side of the house.
That said, if I’m on the road again in the area I will be happy to stay at one of Carla’s properties."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I truly enjoyed our stay at Carla’s home in Poplar Bluff.

2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed at Stoney Manor while in Poplar Bluff for our son's wedding. The house was absolutely beautiful inside! Every room was clean and decorated so cozily. The kitchen was roomy and the two living room spaces were super inviting. The big, comfy sectionals were perfect for gathering. The bedrooms were wonderful and the beds comfortable. The location was minutes away from everything. We had an issue the first night, but Carla had it fixed promptly. Our family got to be together to share meals and moments instead of being separated in hotel rooms. Everyone commented on how warm and inviting the house was and how comfortable we all were during our stay. I highly recommend Stoney Manor to anyone desiring a family/friend gathering place in Poplar Bluff."

Very clean and comfortable- highly recommend"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful house! It was obvious that Shannon has put alot of care into this home. As soon as we walked in, we noticed how wonderful the house smelled. Ample space in each room - 3 nice-sized bedrooms. The kitchen was appointed with apple cider and hot chocolate, as well as coffee pods. My husband was sad that we weren't staying long enough to use that Pit Boss outside! Quiet area just outside of town - but close enough to get to where you need to go.
We have decided that this will definitely be our ""go to"" place when we visit Poplar Bluff!"

We just absolutely loved and enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Shannon’s place. The home was very secluded but really close to Poplar Bluff. You could tell they took a lot of care in the renovations.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really liked your place. The only thing I thought that would bemnefit a renter, is a solid sidewalk to the ramp for a wheel chair or a person with a walker. Nicely appointed. will consider staying there again. Would have preferred it to be a little closer to town, but it worked out."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We didn’t make it to Shannon’s place as we got caught in a storm but we really wanted to stay as it looks like a beautiful, comfortable place. Great communication and kind host. Will definitely try again I. The future."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We gifted this visit to our pastor and his family, and Shannon went above and beyond. She answered my many questions and made sure that they had the entry code plenty early. She even asked what their little guy's favorite things were and then left him a gift bag."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"I took a weekend trip with my son & his buddies. There were 6 of us. It was perfect size, and only 40 min to current river.. It was a perfect location for what I planned. I also enjoy hiking, and there is a trail pretty close that I was able to go walk while they hung out and was grilling supper. We do plan to rent the house again for when we plan another current river trip. I couldn't have been more satisfied. Shannon even allowed us to check in early."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Very clean and up to date. Happy we stayed here- one of the nicest airbnbs we’ve stayed at! Had all the kitchen tools we needed & clean linens. Random but shower water pressure was super good!! Also responsive friendly host. Beautiful nature surrounding the cabin. Wish I could move this house to Texas and live in it :)
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a perfect place for our family of four to stop on our way home from vacation. Very well-kept and clean, open and spacious living space, and comfy beds, to go with a quiet, off the beaten path location with a huge yard. There’s no wi-fi and even LTE connection is very spotty, but for a short stay that wasn’t an issue for us at all. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Nice house
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I loved this place! It was beautiful inside and we felt right at home. My 4 children and I stayed for only 1 night, but we would've stayed longer if we could've. The shower worked great, and it was nice to have the opportunity to do laundry before hitting the road again. My kids were disappointed there wasn't any wi-fi, but it gave us more time together since they couldn't have their faces in screens 😂. There were hiking trails right down the road that go for miles and miles, and we saw several turtles on our morning hike. I'd definitely come back for a stay if ever in the area again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Shannon's place was pristine and beautiful. Everything about it was as advertised. We loved staying there. Her home was a highlight of our stay in the Poplar Bluff area. We would stay there again when in the area. Thank you for the exceptional experience. We Loved It !!
Everything was easy and predictable (no surprises). Beautifully done home. The remodeling effort was very well done in every way.
Thank You Shannon !!"

She has always been very responsive to any questions you may have and always willing to accommodate with whatever may come up. Her places are very secluded quiet and peaceful, I would recommend staying at any of her places!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything is set up for your comfort, and you’ll need for nothing! Just like staying at your own home, there’s everything for cooking, like spices, condiments, waffle maker, deep fryer, griddle, BBQs…pebble ice maker and wine fridge etc! Amazing views, super private & cozy relaxing places to sit, sunbathe or enjoy the nights under the deck playing corn hole or lounging around the outdoor fire place. Every time I thought, “Oh, I need a…” I’d find whatever my need was. Comfy beds and luxurious bathrooms! 100% love the decor!! Gorgeous landscaped grounds with creative lighting…and a shocking lack of mosquitoes! We sat outside late into the night and got no bites!! One unexpected but much cherished feature was Tom the cat…so gentle and sweet that we looked forward to his company starting each day! Can’t say enough good things about how responsive our host was too! We would love to visit in the future and completely recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect and peaceful place for a weekend getaway in Missouri, ideal for a family or small group of friends. I highly recommend Kerri's cabin to anyone looking for scenic outdoor tranquility and a beautiful indoor setting where special care has been taken with every detail."
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed 10 Days at Kerri's Cabin. The home had every amenity and more. What you will enjoy most is all of the amenities of the home as we only ate out 1 time during our 10 day stay because being at the cabin was so enjoyable. Our resounding comment was it was so peaceful with the river being directly behind the cabin. If your looking for a place to unplug, this is your place! We hope you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks Kerri!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,absolutely amazing place to get away..well managed and taken care of
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First of all, this was the best air b&b we ever stayed. We came to the area for an event so the price was maybe higher but, for what we were looking for with 2 couples and the event, we could not have made a better choice. The house and peaceful quiet surroundings was Ideal!! Our host's personal touches was also very fun and thoughtful. We all agreed that we will try to come back with more time to just relax and enjoy the whole location. We feel the place is significant to visit without an event that brought us there. We'll be looking ahead to our calendars. Thanks very much to our hosts!"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Let’s start with, BOOK IT NOW! Kerri’s cabin is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for a secluded family getaway. When I say everything about this listing is above and beyond what your expectations are, I mean EVERYTHING. We were greeted with the most welcoming personal host, Tom the cat, my daughters enjoyed every second of Tom’s cuddles on the amazing back porch. The kitchen is locked and loaded with any spice/cooking need one would need for cooking.. on the Blackstone! There was no need to eat out because with everything Kerri provides there is absolutely no need. I could go on and on about how awesome every detail of this cabin is, but you need to book it and experience it instead yourself - you won’t be disappointed."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Book it. It will be worth it. You are going to be wowed. What a view, what a farm, what a getaway of serenity and relaxation. We walked the beach twice during our overnight stay and our littles absolutely loved playing in the water. We ate dinner at Lambert’s in Sikeston and snuggled in for a cozy night together. We quickly befriended Tom, the cat, and our family of four felt right at home with the wildlife inside Kerri’s cabin. Favorite touches: front porch swing, kitchen tabletop, vaulted ceiling low lights, upstairs shower, bobcat rug, and hot cocoa. Thank you, Kerri, for a lovely last night of our family vacation. We were rested and ready to head home after staying at your retreat."

2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"My family absolutely loved this place. It was very peaceful. The place was very clean and stocked with plenty of stuff. The private beach was a big hit with the kids and grandkids. Perfect place for the kids to swim in the water. The back deck was an great place to sit and relax, and watch the kids swim.

Kerri was very pleasant and helpful."

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had an amazing time staying here, the cabin itself and the surroundings are beautiful and secluded. The cabin was extremely nice and very spacious, a lot of amenities. We floated the black river- put in at Hendrickson and stopped right at the cabin which was super convenient and easy. I can’t say enough about this place, it was great. Kerri was very helpful with directions as the place doesn’t show up on the map well, and very responsive."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly one of best AirBnBs where we’ve stayed. Pristine condition. One of the cleanest places we’ve stayed. The kitchen was well provisioned with nice appliances and great pots, pans and dishes. Plus 3 (!) grills. We ate every meal In because there was no reason to go out. The bedrooms and bathrooms were ample sizes (loved the sunken tub for a good soak). The great room was ideal for hanging out. Perhaps the best feature was the wrap-around porch with spacious, comfy seating. We spent most of the day on the porch - lounging, reading, watching the water from the Black River. A perfect get-away. And, lest I forget, Tom the cat was an absolute delight. We really wanted to bring him home…"

,,,"Upon arrival, I noticed that the ambiance of the home was not as inviting as I had anticipated from the listing. This set an initial tone of unease for me. Furthermore, the gravel road leading up to the property added an unexpected layer of discomfort, particularly when considering nighttime returns.
A more significant concern arose when I came to understand that my primary point of contact was Ryan and not Jason, as I was originally led to believe."
,,,The house was not ready for the guest . Host cancelled my reservation
