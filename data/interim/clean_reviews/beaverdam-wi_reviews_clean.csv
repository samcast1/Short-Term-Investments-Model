2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Mary place was a great get away on the lake. We had a family get together for the holiday. Very large space for my family and comfortable sleeping spaces. She had all the amenities we needed for our lunch and a very large table for our gathering. The living room faced the lake and it was a picture perfect day with the sun over the lake. Definitely word book again to experience all seasons.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Valerie is the absolute best host!! I stayed at her place for six months for work and her place made me feel right at home.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a wonderful stay. Valerie was a gracious host and very responsive with good communication. Good location with easy access to our needs.

Nice little place!"

Communication with the host was excellent. The house is located in a very nice quiet residential area. We would stay here again.........A great place for breakfast is ""Our House 2"" with their homemade bacon and breakfast sausage. A good Friday night fish fry is ""Bayside Superclub""."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay about 45 minutes from Oshkosh. Exactly as pictured and described. Valerie was very quick to respond when needed. Extremely elusive cat.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Valerie's place was very enjoyable. The unit is comfortable and all necessary amenities are available in the rooms, kitchen and bathroom. WiFi is fine and locked garage is provided for the car. We stayed for a week and did not lack anything. The unit is newly remodeled and everything works fine. .I will come back to it anyday. Valerie communicate well and was very helpful on enquiries. Valerie 's place was 'super'."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cutest lake house with absolutely everything you could possibly need (including a goodie basket to welcome us). The kitchen is extremely well stocked for cooking, lots of fun yard and lake toys. Cute decor, plenty of space. We loved it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The stay was an absolute dream. The home is in an incredible location and with everything you can imagine you would need.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We highly recommend Lisa's home!! She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and was very responsive to questions and had great communication. The house was very clean and very well appointed. The walk down to the lake is easy and the dock was a perfect spot for fishing. We had a large family and the house was perfect for us. The bedrooms are on the opposite side of a large family room which worked out great. We had some night owls using the family room and you couldn't hear a thing from the bedrooms. Everything was just perfect and we are very grateful to have found Lisa's home for our family vacation!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Lisa's place was everything we wanted for our family get-together. Plenty of room to spread out and right by the lake, perfect for grilling and chilling. We appreciated all the amenities and Lisa's attentiveness to our needs. We'd love to come back again next year!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This grand old farmhouse has been updated, but the warmth has not been lost! Plenty to do, lots of relaxation to enjoy, plenty of room for our dozen adults and teenies.
Just the right distance from the towns needed for some support, but the lake house was a blast, with size and facility at its rural best!
Your new guests won't be sorry they chose this fine AirBnb! AAA+"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lisa has such a charming home with so many amenities! The house had everything we needed, including paper-ware, laundry, sunscreen and bug spray. We loved the beautiful location and spent most of our time out on the lake. The location is quiet and peaceful. Lisa responded quickly to any questions we had. We loved our time at Lisa’s!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I have never been to Wisconsin and had no idea what to expect. The pictures do not do this place justice. It was gorgeous. It was also one of the most well stocked Air B and Bs I have stayed in. My son randomly needed a sharpie, and there was a sharpie in a well organized drawer. Would stay here again and again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing! It was beautiful & incredibly peaceful with a great dock for fishing & comfortable deck overlooking the lake. The entire place was spotless & they supplied everything you could possibly need! There was even firewood ready to go in the fire pit & everything you need to make smores over the fire! Felt very comfortable & at home. Would highly recommend booking this place & will definitely be returning again!
2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Excellent everything
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"My sister and I have stayed at many Airbnb’s as we do love to travel… This was the absolute BEST! The amenities were plentiful! We always have to find a Walmart to stock up on things that are needed but not usually provided. We needed absolutely nothing but food here! We were welcomed to an amazing snack basket that included water. The place was spotless. A wonderful view of the lake just out the sliding doors. We even caught a fish! The beds were comfortable and beautifully made. So spacious and cozy. Wonderfully decorated. I absolutely cant say enough about this beautiful home. The hosts were responsive and all went so smoothly. I will definitely be a regular at this location. If you are looking for a relaxing stay with all the needed amenities and a beautiful view then this is the place for you. I will be booking again for the spring and summer. This is by far the best stay ever! I absolutely LOVE this place! My sister, her husband and my fiancé and I were very impressed."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a very charming cabin on a beautiful grounds that’s usually used as a wedding venue. Do be sure to read the description carefully, as it is on the rustic side. Perfect if that’s what you’re looking for. Consider bringing a sleeping bag or liner, as the flannel sheets might be a little itchy for those with sensitive skin. Also, typing the address into Google didn’t bring me to the right place, but typing in the name of the venue did. So just be aware of that. Google map estimates are also generally off for more out-of-the-way areas such as this one. Other than that, it was a great day. Joan was very helpful and available, and easy to reach. The view from around the cabin is beautiful, and there were trumpet or swans in the lake! Overall, a wonderful stay for a weekend getaway."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is adorable and charming and spotless. So quiet and serene- exactly what I was looking for.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is truly amazing. It's peaceful and picturesque. I immediately felt ""right at home "" when I pulled in at night since the lights were on in the cabin. It's comfortable and cozy. I only stayed one night and planning to return this summer. The hosts are responsive and thoughtful. It provides you an opportunity to go back in time when things were simpler"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay. The cabin offers a rustic charm yet close to home. Very clean and comfortable.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"There is not much else to say about the Springbrook Log Cabin other than it exceeded expectations in every way. Even in the dead of winter, the property is beautiful and if peace and quiet is what you're looking for, this place has it in spades.
I would love nothing more than to return one day when the trees are full and the fields tall. I expect it would be a sight to behold and an even more pleasant stay."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very quiet and peaceful place, a beautiful wooden house. Large territory, lake. The house has everything you need. We especially liked the fireplace. The toilet is outside, but it wasn't a big problem. Thank you for a wonderful vacation!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin is magical and can’t be fully appreciated until you walk through the door. A fire in the fireplace, cozy blankets everywhere, a bed you never want to leave and a great sofa bed! Then there is the porch overlooking the pond, barn, and endless farm fields.
Then, there is the nicest outdoor bathroom I’ve ever seen! It was actually fun to use, and added to the adventure! The cabin is simply gorgeous in it’s simplicity, but with all the supplies that make the stay so convenient. It was a bit challenging to find, but the host at the house was lovely and helpful.
I would love to return in the winter."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My only complaint was that I didn’t book this for longer. What a dream.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property and cabin!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Due to a happy accident, we had to find a place last minute and Joan’s place came up. It ended up being absolutely ideal for my wife and I, who love the outdoors and old buildings, historic cabins, and open spaces. It’s difficult to describe how delightful this cabin was for us. We actually loved the relative primitiveness of the outhouse and the well pump. The interior was absolutely wonderful, the loft and the bed were cozy and quaint, and the furnishings and gas fireplace just pulled it all together and made it perfect. We would absolutely love to stay there again! If you’re wondering about a shower or running water, the main house is open for guests to come and shower. So we took advantage of that as well, and had everything that we needed for a wonderful stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cabin was just the experience we were looking for! The cabin had to be the cleanest cabin we had ever stayed in with the best outhouse design we have seen yet! Everything was comfortable and we found ourselves soaking in the attention detail everywhere we looked! We were in awe of the beauty that surrounded us on the property and hope to return for a longer visit soon!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful cottage and location. Highly recommend!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing romantic getaway for me and my girlfriend. The property is breathtaking and the tour was incredibly interesting. Hope to make it a yearly occasion.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joan & her husband Bill went way above and beyond to make sure our stay was amazing! They helped to make sure that all of our needs were met and were such a great part of our adventure!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a unique and absolutely gorgeous property. We were impressed from the moment we drove down the cornfield surrounded driveway and onto the sprawling grounds of green rolling fields of nicely maintained grass and ponds with swans and pretty fountains. The 1850’s cabin with covered bridge was like a trip back in time to a fairytale land. The owners Joan and Bill were nice, accommodating and fun. Bill was even generous enough with his time to offer us a tour of the amazing venue, including the barn, kitchen and some other accommodations on the property., which we took him up on. We would love to come back and try the new Log Cabin in the woods someday! It wasn’t a problem for us, but do consider the fact that the property is quite a ways out in the countryside, and the cabin we stayed in has steep stairs that may be a challenge for some."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect and quiet little getaway from the city. We definitely recommend this spot.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You just cannot beat sitting in a rocking chair, on the front porch of a cabin, next to a pond, in a private setting. We had a very enjoyable time there, and we're glad we came."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Springbrook estate was by far one of my favorite ARBNB experiences yet!! Absolutely beautiful estate with ponds everywhere and a tranquil gardens!! We were visiting for my brothers funeral and was given permission for a late check out the next day to accommodate our funeral plans. It was a perfect oasis set in nature to mourn the beautiful man we lost. Absolutely perfect!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a lovely, tranquil and extremely peaceful stay—perfect for a getaway in rural Wisconsin. The cabin itself was perfect (exactly as described, very clean & comfortable, plenty of water provided). On top of that, Joan & Bill were extremely kind during check in and when running into them while on a walk touring the property—their hospitality and the kind people they are made it feel like we’ve known them for years. Highly recommend this stay, nothing but good things to say about it. Being able to disconnect in such a peaceful environment was so refreshing."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin was truly special. It was quiet and peaceful. I felt comfortable staying there as a single traveler, which is what is imporatant to me. Even though the cabin had no plumbing, the availability of a warm shower was perfect. I will definitely stay again. Would love to stay in the winter as well."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful setting, charming lodging. It was nice to sit on the porch overlooking the pond and it was a treat that there was wood ready to go in the firepit"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed 1 night for a quick getaway for my boyfriends birthday. Peaceful and beautiful grounds and very nice hosts! Easy check in, responsive to messages/texts and the cabin was exactly as described. Clean, cozy and well taken care of. The bed was comfortable and the linens smelled fresh! the front porch rocking chairs were great and the coffee selection was nice (kcup style) the cabin was cool and comfortable. Access to the toilet was 10 steps to the back of the cabin.
The wildlife was fun to watch and the peaceful pond was nice to view.
We did tour the grounds and venue just out of curiosity and it was stunning!!! I'm sure anyone looking for a fairytale wedding would love it.
It was a great combination of quiet and disconnected mixed with modern amenities. Perfect for a couple to take a night or two away! Naturally romantic and organicly sereen. We ejoyed our stay and hope to go back again someday!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The most serene place in Wisconsin & Illinois area. Perfect to unwind, contemplate or just relax. Beautiful swans and surrounding."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my third stay and it was amazing as always. A very peaceful, distraction free environment to rest and relax. Hard to believe I only drove an hour from home to feel transported to a simpler time. Thank you Joan ❤️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin was perfect! We had an amazing stay, and Joan was extremely kind and proactive in making sure we were comfortable and having a good time.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves a beautiful wood setting, with a creek. Beautiful place to take a romantic walk ."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin was so charming! Everything about it was very cozy, and the grounds are beautiful! The only downer is the lack of indoor plumbing, but the outhouse is insulated so it wasn't as cold as I expected. Another thing to be aware of is that they have an event space across the pond, so it didn't feel as secluded as I had hoped. Would definitely suggest going on a weeknight if you're looking for a quieter night. But overall, it's a really great experience."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful peaceful getaway
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot, a little pricey for not having a shower in the cabin, but everything else outweighs that. Very beautiful at sunset."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin is absolutely spectacular, so pretty, really unique with the loft. Everything is thought of for you in the check-in and our process, lots of life around the cabin (frogs!). The property it’s on is beautiful. I’ll be back here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This 1850’s cabin was the perfect fit and location for us while we visited the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge. We loved having the pond right next to the cabin. We saw some deer, a pair of green herons, great blue heron, swallows, blue jays, frogs and saw some sandhill cranes flying over. Their is also a majestic pair of mute swans on the property’s ponds. The covered bridge next to the cabin makes for a beautiful photo backdrop. Added bonus was the rocking chairs under the covered porch. Makes for a perfect spot for your morning coffee. The outhouse is super close, within feet of the back door of the cabin. It’s clean & easy to use. Showers are available in the main white house where you stop when you first arrive. Their is also a cabinet inside the cabin with some washcloths and hand towels inside. We will try and stay here again when visiting the Horicon area."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely gorgeous facility.
So peaceful, comfortable and homey!
Would come back again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,10/10 can’t wait to come back. So many little frogs hoppin around.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very warm and cozy cabin for someone looking for a step back in time without giving up most modern conveniences. Great porch on a little pond for watching stars at night.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The renovated 1850s cabin is in beautiful condition in a secluded area on the edge of a pond over the river on a wooden bridge and set in the woods. Very quiet and tranquil, beautifully maintained and decorated with some period pieces. Our tour by Bill of the amazing and huge barn made us wish we were planning a wedding or anniversary. They have thought of everything and they will be there for a long time. Don’t miss it!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rustic indeed - and lots of wildlife. Cranes, swans, deer...it was a pleasant stay!
As you might expect, you will need bug spray"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful log cabin just like Little House on the Prairie!! My husband and I will definitely want to return !!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a terrific find! A quiet, restful spot that allows one to step back to early days of our ancestors It is super quaint, very clean, very well stocked with everything you could need. Even though there is no running water in the home Joan had water in the fridge for drinking & hand washing. The outhouse is just a few feet out the back door. A bucket of water easily flushes the stool. The property is picturesque. If you are looking for peace, quiet, restful, nature, this is the place for you!
We went to Chancey's Bar & Grill just a couple minutes away & had really great food . This place earns a golden ticket!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Pictures d not do this place justice. Absolutely stunning!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for peaceful and quiet..an opportunity to force yourself to slow down and commune with nature…this is where you want to be!
Close enough to a large town that if you forget something you can go get it yet far enough that you will not hear another vehicle or person for miles.
This cabin was exactly as pictured and described. It was a perfect amount of space for two people. Cooking was easily accomplished indoors on the stove/microwave as well as at the campfire! We brought everything we needed because I was not 100% sure of what would be in the kitchen but they did think of everything down to a wine bottle opener! You do need your own campfire equipment though.
Being right next to the water was perfect and two trees held our hammock to enjoy the view!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect place!! We loved how quiet and peaceful it was. Even though there was an event that evening it didn’t bother us.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A lovely little spot, very clean and private."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a nice time staying overnight at the cabin! It’s a fun glimpse into what it could have been like living in a wisconsin log cabin next to a lake - with great modern conveniences such as electricity and a coffee maker ;-) It’s a great little escape and the grounds are just gorgeous. We brought our food and cooked it over the fire pit with our own cast iron skillet and had a lovely night by the water. Check-in is super easy if you follow the instructions which I really appreciate. Sometimes check-in can be a hassle but this one was great. Thanks again. Will return
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cute and cozy! Exactly what we needed for a weekend away!

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Quiet and cozy. We appreciated the fireplace, the extra quilts, the coffee, and the games. Easy check-in. Lovely place for us to reconnect as a couple."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My husband and I stayed here for a little winter getaway and it was wonderful! The cabin had everything we needed for a cozy night in and we loved this unique throw back in time experience.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had such a lovely stay at this cabin! A great place to disconnect in nature. The log cabin is really charming and the surrounding grounds are beautiful.
Bill was very kind and helpful when our car battery died.
The brunch on Sunday is highly recommended!
We will be back!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very interesting place to stay. We enjoyed the fireplace, the Wisco supper club, and hiking at the Horicon Marsh."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My cousins and I stayed here for an overnight to celebrate my birthday and we had an incredible time! The cabin and property truly felt like we were staying in a winter wonderland :) The cabin is perfectly cozy and warm, the fireplace is fantastic, and the views are a dream. My only note to future guests would be to plan ahead on meals the best that you can. There is an oven, microwave, and refrigerator, but without running water, doing the dishes was a bit challenging. It was all part of the experience, we just would have pre-cooked a bit more had we thought through that. Overall we had a wonderful time and are excited to visit again!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host & great place!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for a quiet, relaxing getaway."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved this cabin! We were super happy about how the outhouse had a heater keeping it warm in this cold weather. Very thoughtful

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you’re looking for serenity, beautiful grounds to walk around, some breathtaking views you will love Springbrook!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Loved the rustic beauty! We didn't mind the outdoor privy since we are adventurous. :)This place made our imaginations go wild thinking of people living in cabins over a hundred years ago. Beautiful setting and well lit too.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,You can publish my personal comments for this.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just a beautiful cabin , pictures don’t do it justice. We can’t wait to come back ❤️"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Came by myself for some reflection and solitude. It was wonderful, peaceful, energizing and just what the doctor ordered. Already booked another another stay with for a Girl's weekend! A gem in our backyard."
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Really enjoyed our stay at this cute little cabin. It was very clean and comfortable and everything was as expected. I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because it is a bit overpriced in my opinion. Besides that everything was great.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin is lovely and the views on the property are stunning! The farm has several other Airbnb’s and an event space so it’s not quite as secluded as you might think from the photos. Everything is spaced out so this didn’t take away from the experience. The cabin is very clean, has full electricity, AC and cable tv. The out house has a modern toilet with water and extra buckets of water to manually flush. The refrigerator was stocked with bottled drinking water and jugs of distilled water. Overall great experience!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay at this cozy cottage!
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We had a blast!! The setting is so beautiful and the cabin is a really cool throw-back to an earlier time. We'll definitely be returning.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect little get away
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great stay. Very quiet and a nice place to get away for a few days.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is an absolute gem and if anyone has the opportunity to visit Joan & Bill’s property, I highly recommend doing so! I spent all afternoon just walking around their beautifully landscaped historic grounds, daydreaming of times past . The hosts Joan & Bill were great company as well! ☺️ Thank you both!! Looking forward to coming back again soon! ☺️☺️"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was so cute. Lovely stay!!!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an absolute gem not far from home! You get the feeling you are truly “out there” without traveling too far up north. The historic grounds that the cabin are on are absolutely gorgeous! Joan and her husband went out of their way to ensure our stay was as pleasant as possible! We will absolutely be staying here again! If the cottage is a available, don’t hesitate to book it!!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was even better than we had hoped for! It was perfect in every way. Joan was very helpful and quick with responses. Would definitely recommend this beautiful place!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Everything about this stay was perfect! The cabin is even better than I imagined it to be. The view was wonderful and peaceful. We were really about to relax and enjoy being with each other. There wasn’t much service which was perfect to disconnect. It was a hot summer weekend, but the AC made it easy to sleep at night. You can’t go wrong with booking a stay here! Joan was super helpful and allowed us an early check in as well."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful stay!
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Relaxing place to getaway. The grounds are beautifully maintained.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Joan and her crew were very inviting and even came by to mak sure we knew we could reach out any time. A lovely little getaway that's not too far from people!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is magic. Only an hour away from Milwaukee and it feels like another world.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We rented all the Airbnb’s they operate during our wedding weekend on the property. Everyone staying had nothing but good things to say and we were so happy with how everything turned out. I would recommend Springbrook to anyone. The cozy cabin was an awesome ambiance to come home to after a long, exhausting wedding celebration. Will be returning for anniversaries to come!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"They were so welcoming and hospitable.
Awesome venue and the cottage we stayed in was perfect!
We will definitely be back!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful propert, glad we walked around before it got dark. The cabin was so cozy, even on a chilly spring night!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Would highly recommend staying at this charming cabin. The hosts have excellent communication and have curated an experience that is worth your time.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Unique and comfortable place! Definitely worth the trip and break from city and internet life!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A nice and quick trip from Gurnee, IL. Seating by the porch to watch the sunset right outside the cabin was my favorite activity. It's a picture perfect scene. We didn't have any issues with our sleeping condition or anything during our stay. The kitchen have stove, fridge and microwave which is great to store and heat up our food. The downside is they don't have running water or even water in a barrel where we can fetch water to wash our dishes. May be in the future that is something they can add on. They provided drinking water though, which we used a gallon to brush our teeth and wash our face :) All in all it was a nice experience!"
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mic better than photographed. The cabin was great and very cozy. It was clean, inviting, and much larger than it appeared in the photos. What I believe was once a two story cabin, has been converted into a loft which gives the living room at least 30ft height, if not more. This is a great use of the space and created a very open feeling. Great stay, highly recommend."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joan and Bills cabin in the woods was wonderful. It was within an hour of Madison, spent the second day at devils lake before driving home. The place was even better than pictured. The one negative is that there’s no running water but if you are going for a short trip you would be totally fine. They supply fresh water and we brought bottles too. The cabin faces sunset over their pond— add some good music and a glass of your fave beverage and it’s the perfect romantic night. The stars were insane . We woke up and walked down the road to catch sunrise in the field just outside of the woods. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay. The only thing I suggest is for a DVD player to be installed :) it’s the perfect place to cozy up and watch an old hugh grant rom if you’re just there for a girls night. Another thing, I suggest bringing groceries and a speaker— the town close by doesn’t have the most options if you’re looking for semi healthy. Overall— amazing stay. Would 100% come up again"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely cabin
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day getaway at Joan's cabin. The cabin was so incredibly charming - we loved the rustic feel but also appreciated the modern amenities like the tv and fireplace. Most importantly - the hospitality we received from Joan's husband Bill was incredible - after taking a wrong turn and getting stuck in the snow about a mile from the cabin, Bill found us and spent over an hour shoveling and pushing to help us get out. Our one night stay would have definitely been ruined if not for his kindness. That is the kind of hospitality that was never expected but speaks volumes to the kind of hosts they are!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Joan was very responsive during our stay! During a below zero night, the cabin kept us warm and cozy. It was such a great weekend getaway."
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The 1850's cabin was IDEAL for a night away, even in the bitter cold of Wisconsin winter (0 degrees!). The cabin was cozy, set in a beautiful secluded space, and adorably appointed. Despite the frigid temps the outhouse, which was only a few steps away from the cabin, stayed nice and warm with a space heater and great insulation. We would definitely visit again!"
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent! Very beautiful spot and cozy cabin.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin is beautiful and well maintained. We loved it!
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The cabin was exactly as described and Joan was an excellent host. My fiancé and I really enjoyed our stay at the quaint cabin with beautiful scenery on a snowy night. Zach Eshelman
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is awesome! So beautifully decorated and warm
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great cozy place! Relaxing spot to read and write. Definitely want to visit during the summer.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was the perfect place to escape from the cities for a couple days!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay very much. A great place to hit the reset button. We arrived late due to a gnarle snow storm but the snow added to a perfect secluded setting. We will be back!
2020-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great scenery, fresh snowfall, in a quiet setting. Joan was not wearing a mask when she invited us inside to her house to sign the guestbook, nor when we dropped off the keys. Nearby town has some fun things to explore and is big enough to offer take-out choices and retail shopping. A few cautions: The handpump outside was not working, so we were unsure how to replenish the water for the outside toilet. Cellphone data/service can be very low and sometimes non-existent."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My wife and I came to the cabin for a quick getaway and we wished we could have stayed longer. We both felt that it was a great place to reconnect with each other. It definitely gives you the feeling of being secluded but you also have the conveniency of everything you need within a 10 minute drive. We will definitely becoming back in the future.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was fun to experience a cabin with no running water and an outhouse! Pleasantly surprised that the outhouse was heated- a nice touch!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was very clean and so charming. Beautiful views of the pond and lovely grounds to walk. The gas fireplace added a nice glow to the room and kept us warm throughout our stay. Would love to return in the future!
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This cabin was amazing! We went when the first snow fell and let me tell you it made the setting even more special! The cabin was better than expected and the view of the pond was great in the morning. The hosts were very responsive and hospitable! We will be back.
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Snuck away as a quick, cozy getaway for our anniversary. It was perfect. Lights were on, very welcoming. It was just what we wanted."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful and peaceful.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The perfect place for a cozy weekend. Enjoyed every minute.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Me and my fiancé loved this place! It was very luxurious but yet affordable. In my opinion this place was under priced it was sooo amazing. Definitely coming again ♥️
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A modernized outhouse... you have to experience it to understand, but describes it perfectly. True delight all around."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,One of the most charming places I've been to. It was hard to leave. Book this dreamy place for your next vacation .
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cabin provided us a wonderful weekend getaway. As other commenters have mentioned, the inside was bigger than expected, especially the loft! Very cozy and the fireplace worked well for heat. Lovely scenery and always felt safe. My only suggestion would be to get some shades for the windows for privacy, but overall a great stay!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,If I could give it 10 stars I would. The whole place is so beautiful! The pictures do not and probably can not do it justice. Just Lovely!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cozy cabin is my all time favorite for privacy and ""me"" time. It has just what I need and nothing that I don't which helps limit distractions. The property abounds with glorious beauty and thoughtful care. Two beautiful swans graced the pond just steps from the cabin's door. The owner's passion for this treasure is evident, especially if you are curious about history. Each time I stay is such a pleasure, whether over night or just for a day."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This restorative stay was exactly what we needed. Just steps from the door, the pier with seats overlooking the pond was a delightful way to spend a lazy Saturday.
The bonfire and a brisk breeze kept the mosquitos away for a lovely, stargazing evening.
The cabin itself was delightfully rustic. It is exactly as described. Thanks!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The photos you see do not even come close to capturing how beautiful this place is.
The loft is much bigger than it looks. The ceilings are nearly 20 ft at the peak near the fireplace. Joan & the others I spoke to were the most helpful people. I had trouble with the fireplace my first night & they had someone over within 10 minutes to help me out. The aesthetic and charming details show in every angle of booking & staying here.
The property is so gorgeous & I hope to return soon."
2020-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a wonderful quiet location. If you want to get away . More of a glamping experience. Very rustic interior except for the tv, couch’s etc,. All the amenities you need oven , microwave, coffee maker but no running water ( but they supply that). Beautiful serene ground well maintained. Close to Beaver Dam and Horicon. A true quiet getaway to unwind!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was wonderful! The cabin is super neat and the entire grounds are lovely. The cabin had everything that my wife and I wanted--beautiful views, a pond, a campfire pit, and the electricity was a great bonus. It was a wonderful experience for us and I highly recommend it if you're looking for something a rustic/calm/peaceful vibe but still with some modern luxuries like electricity and AC. I'm pretty sure that my family and I will be back!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay if you love great views and love the sounds of nature! The cottage is such a cute place and has nice touches bringing you back to the time the cottage was built.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Joan was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. We had a great experience.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming, rustic cabin which we used for a video shoot. It's a great space. And Joan and her crew were lovely to work with. Very communicative and helpful!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As expected, we loved the cabin and the property! The sunset was beautiful over the chapel. Just lovely!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Certainly was what I expected and then some. Takes you back to time to be very appreciative for modern amenities we have today. Quick access to get grocery items in Beaver Dam. Will definitely want to go back.
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great weekend getaway for my friends and I!
2020-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first stay at an airbnb, and I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend and I had been looking to getaway for a weekend, and this place seemed perfect because it was secluded and quaint. We were allowed access to not only our cottage, but the grounds as well which was really nice. The cottage was great, and the view was incredible- it was very quiet and relaxing. The loft bedroom is definitely bigger than it looks in the pictures, and everything else was as pictured. We had some minor cleanliness issues, but nothing that took away from our stay. We were also provided a list of things to do around the area which was a very nice touch."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An unique experience to stay in a cabin with bones from over a century ago but updated to include some modern comforts without taking away from the charm. Great way to wake up close to nature and to see a Kingfisher swooping over the pond in the morning. Hosts are welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed. Would be a great place to stay for an overnight to Horicon. Sky was nice and dark, great for setting up a telescope away from city lights."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Kim’s place. Beautiful, clean lakeside home with all amenities you may need for a relaxing visit. Kim was always friendly and quick to respond to any communications. We visit the area each May and will be quick to book this gem again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had wonderful stay at this beautiful home. We were able to find it without any issues and got quick assistance from Kim when needed.
Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay...
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Really enjoyed our weekend here with our friends. We were able to play board games, make meals, and catch up in comfort - all with great expansive views of the lake. We would stay here again happily."
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Good place. Thank you
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had such a wonderful time on the lake! Kim’s place was fantastic for the 5 of us and I would highly recommend a stay here. Location is great, wildlife is abundant and the yard has plenty of room for outdoor activities. Kim’s place comes with everything you may need during your stay and she was an excellent host!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great bnb and great host!!
All you can ask for if you’re looking for an ice fishing trip"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for a weekend getaway right on the lake! The place has everything you need and more. Would definitely recommend.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed Kim’s place. It was beautiful, spacious and had everything we needed!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place for friends to stay for events.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family stayed at the Beaver Dam house for Christmas this year. It was a perfect setting to celebrate the holiday together. All the rooms were very comfortable. The house also has lots of spaces to sit and enjoy the lake view, even in the cold of December. The kitchen was well stocked with all we needed to cook throughout the week. We're so grateful to have found this house for our family celebration."
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place is amazing! The house is just as described (and I would said even better!), easy to find, really comfy, great for all seasons"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was great, open and lots to do even for all ages in 40 degree weather ;)"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always responded quickly and was very accommodating with check in times. Was so pleased with the stay that we are using it for multiple weeks!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We booked Kim's house for a weekend getaway with family coming from Iowa and Illinois. We enjoyed the location on the lake and the amenities provided. The kids (ranging from 4-15) especially enjoyed the arcade games and outdoor games. The house was tastefully decorated, very spacious, and comfortably fit 10 people.
We visited on a weekend that was cold and windy but it didn't stop us from fishing and enjoying a bonfire in the backyard. The house is a short drive to the town area and we were able to find another spot to fish and we also had a chance to visit a few small shops and eat at a local Mexican restaurant.
We had a few small issues that were quickly addressed by Kim but other than that, we really enjoyed the stay!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place. We were using it mostly as a place to sleep and eat while we were at a local event for the weekend but plenty of space and had all the right amenities.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Kim’s place had lots of fun amenities and was set up very thoughtfully. The lake view was beautiful and we enjoyed the family friendly space.
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is right on the lake — in summer and winter I think you’d have a great time on the lake! The view was lovely. We appreciated the four bedrooms and two bathrooms as well as the enclosed porch. The kids loved the game room and the toys. Lighting was good. The owner responded very quickly to an issue we had initially, and quickly resolved it. I would definitely stay here again. If you have a toddler, bring a gate for the stairway."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic home!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay! The owners were quick to respond to any questions we had and very helpful!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent accommodations in the shoreline of Beaver Dam Lake. The house is very spacious and a perfect spot for our gathering of 3-4 middle aged ex-Beavers. We will def look to stay here again for our annual get-together in BD.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place on the lake, Beaver dam is a great town with lots to do around the area…House is very cozy with lots of space, and games to play….We had a great stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The only thing wrong was we had to leave. our week went by so fast. Perfect for a family vacation. comfortable roomy beds, plenty of linens, tvs, kitchen supplies, games.
if you want to rent a boat on this lake call ahead. nice kayaks to rent from owner, nicer than mine! wonderful hosts! would highly recommend for a group. enjoyed every inch of this home."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,A beautiful home and location. Water views and access are amazing. Great gathering places in the home for the group to be together. Quiet neighborhood and lake. A great place to hangout and relax. Walkable to DT area and restaurants (@ 1 mile).
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay! Everything was stocked so well and perfect for a family getaway.
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Kitchen appliances and dinnerware were fine. Dining area table was good-sized but poorly finished and hard to clean. Bedrooms: Washable blankets would be a big improvement over the bulky comforters and space-eating decorator pillows. Adults using the full-size bed found that impractical. Bathrooms: Clean, plenty of towels. Water pressure and hot water were great. Green tub needs a non-slip surface, lighting and a shower head more that 6 feet high on the wall. Plus, we are not fans of a rental situation that uses shower curtains, for obvious sanitation reasons. Laundry area got great reviews. A TV in the game room would be a nice improvement. The garbage cans were half-full on arrival and overflowing by the time we left. Some instruction here would be helpful. Overall layout made it easy to separate the early sleepers from the late-nighters. We had a wonderful (dam-good?) time, the home lived up to our expectations and it is surrounded by friendly neighbors."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great long weekend on the lake! We enjoyed swimming, kayaking, and relaxing by the bonfire at night. The perfect place for a family getaway."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"7-6-2023
my family and I enjoyed this place. We caught so many fish catfish, bass,blue gill. Enough space and comfortable beds. lots of fun things for kiddos. we had children from 4 to 8 years old and they swam out in the lake with no issues! we saw the beaver dam must-skis out on the lake and their performance was amazing.
lots and lots of fireworks all week long and it was beautiful reflecting off the water!
enough storage space. only down fall is we had to leave:( 10/10 recommend."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,House is great. Exactly what we expected.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"really enjoyed our time on the water. Kayaks, paddle board and swim mat were enjoyed by all. the House was very comfortable and exceeded our expectations. I don't know if the lake was low but access to water for the kayaks and equipment was a little challenging, Overall it was a wonderful experience."
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Very comfy stay!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"I, along with some friends, were in town for a wedding. When searching for appropriate accommodations, we found Kim’s place and figured it’d be spacious and peaceful. However, upon arrival, this home exceeded our expectations. The rather large home boasted beautiful scenery in a quiet neighborhood. Our group stayed entertained in the game room, on the lake, and at nearby restaurants/bars.
As a host, Kim was very nice and hospitable. She responded almost instantly every time I messaged her or needed something. Furthermore, she kept the home neat and clean upon arrival.
All in all, we enjoyed our trip! 10/10 stay - Thank you Kim!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful family gathering and Kim’s place was absolutely perfect. The kitchen was supplied with all we needed to make all our meals from breakfast to dinner.
The weather was absolutely beautiful and we spent the most of each day on the water. We have kayaks but Kim has some to rent that allowed all of us to go together.
We fished off the shore and pier (catch and release).
I loved that cleaning supplies, garbage bags were supplied and it seemed just like home.
We made beautiful family memories!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a gem in Beaver Dam! Beautiful view of the lake, sunset and the perfect location in town.

2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Our group had a great time getting together and celebrating Christmas at this place. It was the perfect location to meet as everyone was spread out around the state. I’m sure it would be a great hangout in the summer with the dock and lake access as well!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Loved the house, the location, views, plenty of space, the video games were a hit! We want to come back in warm weather and do some kayaking."

2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"6 stars all across, since the highest I can go is 5. I’m afraid to list what we loved, as I might miss few things. Most importantly the house is very clean, perfect quiet location in perfect town, that has everything. But if you choose to cook , Kim’s kitchen has every utensils/cooking tool you can think of. We hope to make this yearly tradition to return next year!!
PS forgot to mention if you go with two families, plenty privacy/space for both."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a great property! It has ample bedrooms/bathrooms plus an amazing activity area with arcade games and a foosball table for family fun. The enclosed 3 season porch was amazing to drink coffee and look at the lake as well as enjoy the sunset.

2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great place to stay! Short walk away from Statz Ale House along with Thirsty Beaver for music, food, and drinks. Not far away from downtown if you want to go shopping or experience one of the local breweries. The house was very clean and had plenty of space to host a weekend getaway. The arcade games, foosball, and bean bags were a nice addition for a weekend of relaxing! Great being able to have a backyard that goes to the water's edge for taking out the kayaks and paddle board if you desire."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The location was surprisingly quiet when we visited - not many people on the lake, so we spent tons of time down on the dock. Great open spaces indoors for hanging out together and spacious bedrooms to accommodate a larger group!"

Bring your yoga mat for yoga by the lake. It’s amazing."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our time at the house in Beaver Dam. We had 6 adults and 3 children and the house was perfect for us all. Very clean and loved how the dock was in the backyard.
As we were leaving our grandson that is 6 years old started crying. He wanted to stay there ""forever"" because he loved fishing on the dock. While we can't stay there forever, we will be back!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a very nice spacious home with incredible lake views! Our group of 8 had plenty of room. The entertainment in the basement helped keep us busy when the weather didn't cooperate. Home is also located close to local necessities and attractions. The host was also very nice and accommodating.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fully fenced in yard. Very peaceful. A lot of thought went in to make sure the cabin is fully stocked for your needs. Just note this cabin isn't on the main lake and water isn't super clean. This is made clear by the location but wanted to let others know just in case. Our dog loved it and was in and out of it all day. Firepit was great as well.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The Ervin cabin was cosy and comfortable. Joan was very flexible and accommodating. I wish we could have stayed longer to explore the beautiful grounds.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute cabin on a gorgeous property. Host very nice and super helpful, 10/10 definitely will stay again"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely adorable yet rustic cabin stay with my mom. Tucked away in the woods from the festivities going on enough to hear the owl at night. Rustic charm, but with updated features. Spotlessly clean with out losing the cabin feel and modern appliances. Lots of space to spread out."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay would go back if ever in the area or passing through!

2024-02-01,4.0,Group trip,"Kim was very responsive throughout all our interactions, from when I had questions at booking a few months prior, through our stay and checkout time - she even brought over some extra toilet paper the first morning after we requested it on Friday evening! We had 10 adults staying for an end of winter weekend away. The sleeping arrangements were great, the beds comfy and plenty of towels and basic shower supplies. The kitchen was spacious for cooking but it was pretty cozy between the dining table and counter top seating for all of us to dine together. Over half of our group went out and hiked around the Horicon Marsh and had a great time doing that. The living room couch is very comfy, and the extra pillows and blankets were nice. We had to bring in extra chairs and use floor space to fit all 10 of us adults in the room to watch a movie, it was definitely doable, but the sturdy chairs were a little hard to sit in after awhile. Check in and check out was super easy! Thanks for hosting!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great time at Kim's place! Everything was just as described and it fit our large group perfectly. We had fun playing some of the board games provided as well. Thanks for a great stay

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for a girls baking weekend. It was super clean and smelled amazing upon walking in!! It definitely exceeded my expectations and was well worth the price for 7 adults and a toddler. One of the best things, a fan in every room! LOL Thank you for that 😊. But in all seriousness, this house was amazing and us girls will be back next year! The location is nice too, privacy and peace and quiet. Kim, thank you for being an amazing host!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed with family, and we couldn't stop saying how wonderful the house/property were for our visit. Kim was very quick to respond whenever I messaged her about checking in/out. The house was incredibly clean and peaceful. I hope we can stay again in the future because the location was perfect for our needs. It was an easy 15 min.-drive to Beaver Dam and the Horicon Marsh. We especially liked the Auto Loop and floating boardwalk at the marsh. It was a nice way to get the seniors in our group out in nature, even with their rollator walkers. I highly recommend the floating boardwalk! Thank you for having a pet-free place for those of us with terrible allergies to cats/dogs, Kim! Places like this are hard to come by these days and I truly appreciate it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! Perfect size, plenty of space. Would for sure stay again!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want to stay at a private beautiful farmhouse, this is the place to book. I love all the wood floors, the beautiful cozy rooms and how private the house is. The antique decor is the perfect addition to this house."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,We loved this Airbnb and would love to come back again. It’s peaceful with a beautiful view! There was plenty of room for our whole group. Loved the lots of small touches such as coffee and laundry supplies. Kim was a great host and very understanding when loosing a set of keys at a nearby wedding venue delayed our checkout time.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,What a beautiful home with peaceful surroundings. I would love to return. Everyone loved the home and surroundings. Kim was a very helpful and friendly host who responded quickly to messages.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim's place is a beautifully restored old farm house with modern kitchen and bath surrounded by fields and a view of the Horicon Marsh.
If you are looking for a peaceful and secluded place to stay, this is the place. It's close to Horicon and is easy to get to larger cities like Madison and Fond Du Lac.
Kim always responded promptly with any correspondence.
I would stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kim was great. She communicated way before check in. Had the place ready and communicated that to me. When I had a question she was quick to answer. Had everything you might need yet had so much space you didn’t get frustrated with clutter. All was wonderful from check in to check out. Didn’t worry one bit from start to finish. You might feel like you are missing something when you read what to do at check out but what she wrote is what she asks for you to do, and it was almost nothing. Look forward to be able to stay again in the future."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Great experience!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"A new property, so we took a chance despite few reviews. It was great! We got in early by request (a morning flight for most of our party), the house was very neat with thoughtful additions like laundry supplies, games, coffee, and Netflix. Five bedrooms, one with two doubles on the first floor, and the rest with double to larger beds on the second floor, and easily space to add sleeping bag/air mattress/port-a-cribs. Two full baths that worked well.
It's not particularly close to anything of interest that I know of, but we had a family reunion 35 mins away in Slinger; cost was a lot less for a home environ than hotel rooms 10 mins away so it was worth it for us.
Nearby marsh has multiple trails. Owner provides info on the trails and wildlife. Merlin ID identified 10 bird species on our first morning in 3 mins -- I love a hot coffee and listening to birds in the cool morning air.
Owner was very responsive."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a large group of nine that fit easily into Kim’s beautiful home. My family absolutely loved it. Kim was a pleasure to deal with, had great communication, and gave great recommendations. We would definitely stay here again. All the beds were very comfortable, and it was a great experience to stay in a real farmhouse surrounded by corn fields. Stay here - you won’t regret it!"
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,Beautiful clean home. Our family enjoyed our first visit to Wisconsin to visit relatives! Serene & peaceful! Kim is always responsive. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kim accommodated our Rugby team when we had no other option for an air BNB. We loved it so much if we come back next year we plan to reach out!

2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Kim is a lovely host! We absolutely loved her place and are so thankful for her! She was able to help us when we got locked on the roof (funny, I know) and was so kind and responsive! The house was wonderful for the 10 of us! Would 1000% book again!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Cindy and Dale’s place is wonderful! It’s a perfect place to relax and enjoy a serene lake view. Neighbors are quiet and it feels very private. The home is impeccably clean and all of your needs have been thought of. It’s honestly our favorite Airbnb we’ve stayed in to date. Don’t hesitate to book with Cindy and Dale. We look forward to returning soon.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cynthia’s home was perfectly peaceful and calming, right on the water! Private, even with neighbors on either side of the home, very welcoming! The inside was outfitted with retro fridge and microwave, comfy beds and lounging furniture, amazing gas stove and needed cookware/utensils for meal-making. She was also accommodating in allowing us to use the garage for my son’s bike and having a place for him to work on his bike was priceless. A true winner of a place! Closest gas station/market within 15 minutes was okay, once we got what we needed, we were set! The comfy-ness of the place was worth it!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cynthia was super responsive and made our stay special! We highly recommend this cute little cottage!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect cottage for a getaway! The home was very clean and comfortable. The views were beautiful. I recommend this to anyone looking for a private, scenic place yet close enough to local towns to easily get around."

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was good. The place was clean. The bed with the memory foam mattress is very comfortable. There are different floor levels, a step up or down into various rooms. Just something to be aware of if you plan on staying. We had a great family weekend here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thanks Cynthia for the wonderful accommodations. Being an overly busy person, i rarely have opportunities to travel and your cottage was the perfect getaway, even if it was for a short time.
Having lived in the area for much of my life, from waterloo, i forgot how lovely the surrounding Beaver Dam area is.
Thanks for the opportunity to stay in your lovely home!
Trevor"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time at Stillwater Cottage. The location was perfect and easy to access thanks to Cynthia's clear communications. Wifi was down the first day and she and Dale fixed it very quickly, which we really appreciated. The cottage was very comfortable and clean. There are small steps between several of the rooms, and some pet dander for anyone allergic to be aware of, but overall would certainly recommend!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place on peaceful lake.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cindy & Dale's place was a wonderful retreat to relax after a very long day of antiquing. They really thought of everything you'll need, down to pokers to roast marshmallows over the fire. My sister and I really enjoyed how quiet the area was. Even though you have neighbors on either side of you, you wouldn't really know it. The neighbors were friendly without being intrusive. We really enjoyed our stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"wonderful place, great neighborhood."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My dog, Gus, and I went to Stillwater Cottage to recover from the heartache of losing two other dogs within a month of each other. We needed a change of scenery and some solace. Cindy's place was so clean, and cute, and was just what we needed! The view of the lake was awesome and was exactly what I wanted & needed. She even had tie-outs for Gus so he could safely roam a little bit! I honestly hated to leave at the end of our stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice cottage on the lake. Very clean and well stocked. Enjoyed the 3 season room. Nice to have A/C on super hot days. Enjoyed the pier and being able to kayak off of it. The lake is huge. Quiet and peaceful. Easy to find. Also nice firepit in yard by lake.
Very enjoyable lake stay. Host is responsive and friendly, even let us come in earlier. :)"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at this lovely little lakeside cottage. We loved the screen porch and the fire pit in the evening with the beautiful lake view. We appreciated that firewood and marshmallow roasters were provided. Kitchen was well stocked. We loved visiting Beaver Dam especially Ooga Brewery! Twice we got takeout from local restaurants and had dinner there. We would come back again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,had our own boat dock at the house and the boat launch was only a few houses away. It was nice to get away and explore another lake. it was hot bout so coming back to cold AC was great!!

Stocked kitchen with all the necessities to cook meals, comfortable beds, lots of lounge spaces for families to congregate yet easy to find a quiet place to read and nap. Can’t wait to visit again!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin. Everything was neat and tidy, and the kitchen was well stocked with essentials. Checkin was very simple, and we were offered early checkin if it worked for us. When we first got the cabin, the temperature was quite low inside (59 degrees), but Kelly was quick to respond when I couldn't find heating details easily. We didn't get outside as much as we had hoped because of rain and wind, but the backyard and dock looked delightful. The master bedroom is quite small, so be mindful of that. But all in all, a peaceful stay."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and cozy. Love the view of the lake!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kelly has thought of everything. Very peaceful and relaxing stay.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Kelly & Joe’s Sunrise Cottage on Beaver Dam Lake. They were incredibly responsive and helped us book quickly after bad weather at our original destination was leaving us “flooded out” of our summer plans! We are so happy with how it turned out. Their property on the lake adorable, very well kept, and has an amazing backyard, including a dock perfect for lazy fishing. We caught a bunch of huge catfish with live bait and bobbers, and we were entertained by what we think were enormous largemouth bass or Northern pike frequently jumping from the water. Our 9-year old caught two channel cats bigger than her arm! What a trip. The amenities are outstanding!! LOVED all the yard games, tree swing, dock bench, and the kayaks they provided. The lawn furniture is all in great condition, and the fire pit is perfect. Beds are good, which for me is always something that makes or breaks and Airbnb. Kitchen needs met! Would definitely return. Thanks so much for hosting us!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family had a great time at Kelly’s place. We had a lovely welcoming package that started our vacation on a fun note. The kitchen was adorable!

We enjoyed fishing from the dock, kayaking on the lake, and trips to nearby towns for hiking and site seeing. Thanks for a great place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This cabin is so beautiful! Kelly was so responsive and helpful. We had a wonderful time eating out on the patio that overlooks the lake and having bonfires. The kids loved taking the kayaks out, and this mom loved the fact that my kids are old enough to watch them take the kayaks out from the fantastic dock.
It was clean upon check in, and the beds and linens were so comfortable.
You can see the incredible amount of care and thought they put into this vacation home, and I highly recommend staying here. Thanks Kelly!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cozy space with a great view. Good catfishing off of the dock!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a really nice cabin right on the shores of the lake. There was plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy, and the inside of the cabin was clean and comfortable. Kelly provides a notebook with useful information about the cabin and the surrounding area. Great stay."

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had a great time fishing, kayaking, and relaxing! Caught catfish right off the dock! Nice cabin in a great location!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at this cute, cuddly, clean cottage on the lake.
Perfect for a small family get away and will return on our next adventure in the Wisconsin area. Wonderful hosts."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful locations with beautiful views right on the lake..
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Really enjoyed our stay. Very nice home in great area
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our group's second NYE at Emily's place and we plan to continue the tradition. Her place is perfect for families and the kitchen has literally everything you could need.
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful home right on the lake, very clean and comfortable. Great layout with plenty of space.
I would definitely recommend and stay there again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you for sharing your beautiful family home. We had 11 family members here for a wedding and had so much space to spead out. Well stocked kitchen and comfortable beds!!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time. The lake home was great. We had beautiful weather and we were able to enjoy a fire by the lake.
The home was also very beautiful, we had fun playing games in the lower level to watching TV and relaxing in the living area upstairs.
The kitchen was well equipped and we enjoyed making meals with our family.
I also liked that each bedroom had a TV. Overall we enjoyed this home and Emily was available to help us with questions. She was an excellent host."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an immediate family reunion here for the weekend. It was very spacious and beautifully decorated. One family had the entire lower level with a bathroom and living space to themselves. My husband and I had a bedroom upstairs next to the bathroom and his parents had the master bedroom with bathroom. His father is disabled, so we appreciated the minimal stairs, open floor plan, and flat landscape for him to navigate safely. We enjoyed the kayaks and paddle board. We had some trouble steering the paddleboat, so be careful not to go too far away. It's not the best swimming lake, but you can. I sat in a tube in the water, and the kids swam around the pier. We were sad the pontoon wasn't available to rent. If we stayed here again, we would try to rent a boat. Great fire pit and views! It was so quiet and peaceful. We would happily stay here again and definitely recommend it!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,The space was perfect and as advertised. Home comfortably fit 12 people and had a huge yard for outdoor activities. Fire pit was right next to the water for a great atmosphere at the end of each day (brought our own firewood with). Kitchen was well stocked with pots/pans/utensils to cook for our big group. Would recommend to anyone with a large group who wants to take advantage of the property’s outdoor space.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Emily's beautiful lake home is one of the best homes we have stayed in, if not the best.
Everything has been thought out so well. It's very roomy but still has the cozy feel.
Access to the lake is a short walk in the backyard.
The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal and enjoy with your friends/family.
There are plenty of comfortable beds with extra pillows and blankets if needed.
The home was clean, and there is a lot of house!
If we ever go back to the Beaver Dam Lake area, we would most definitely book this home again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and organized. Beautiful backyard and lake!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful, spacious home in quiet neighborhood with very comfortable beds, well stocked kitchen (crockpot, toaster, coffee maker), nice selection of board games, puzzles & cards and multiple TV's and seating areas. The four season room was an ideal quiet place to read. Our family & dog enjoyed the huge back yard. The teenagers set up the badminton net (stored in garage) and played one afternoon. The lake was good for paddle boarding but there is not a beach area for swimming.
We did not use but the home had: a washer & dryer, paddle boat, kayaks, fire pit, grill, dog stakes and a second refrigerator.
Emily was very responsive to communication."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"I booked Emily's house as a Christmas present for my family. I was disappointed that the pontoon was not available. We did, however, have our own fishing boat, but the dock on the property was not friendly for our boat, and the boat slip was old and broken. The lake itself was very disappointing as it was only 3-6 feet deep. The screen on the porch door was ripped out and the door did not close completely. We had 3 year old twins that this was a safety issue so I had my son fix the screen and secured the door. We paid for the repairs out of pocket. I sent Emily before and after the pictures, and she did thank me. My dog got out when someone opened the door and ran two doors down and someone called the police. I explained the situation to the officer and he understood. We had both dogs on tie downs and leashed . This was all the first day, and after that, the week was great. The house was clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room for the six of us."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This was the perfect house to relax and make memories with my family!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful home with very nice amenities. Kitchen was beautifully stocked with all the dishes and cookware you would need. Plenty of room to spread out with comfortable beds and furniture.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had everything we needed. We noticed the pier did not have a ladder and mentioned it to the hosts and they had it magically installed without us even knowing. Wonderful fire pit. Beaver Dam Lake is a little mucky but that was no fault to the property. We brought our water shoes and the kids had a blast. The screened in porch is such a nice place to melt stress away.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,beautiful home with lots of space for a large group. The place is clean and there are kayaks and she has a boat you can rent. The only negative is that it is very difficult to get in the water. This is not a beach for little kids or elderly people. It is not a great swimming lake. The area by the beach to sit is lovely and has shade. Lots of room to play yard games.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was nice and it was clean. Beaver Dam Lake is quite shallow, so boating and fishing weren't what we had hoped for. We enjoyed the kayaks, but the paddle boat was broken and couldn't be fixed while we were there. Emily, as well as the property manager, were very responsive to issues and questions."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful time making memories with our family in your beautiful home! The house was clean, comfortable and had everything we could possibly need. I forgot my toothbrush and was happily surprised to see they had one for me! Also, very comfy beds! The views from the house are spectacular! Nice big yard and plenty of yard and board games to play. We definitely plan to come back!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,This is the 2nd time staying at Emily's. It is worth every cent. Can't say enough good things about our experience.
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,Great stay. House was everything they said it was. Comfortable and easy to find.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautiful home and place on the lake, so peaceful and very close to the wedding venue of Fat Apple Farms. We absolutely loved our stay!!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Excellent value very clean
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our 3 families loved staying at this property over New Year's Eve weekend. The space is very well suited for families with the 2 separate living room areas upstairs and down. The kitchen was better stocked with bakeware, utensils etc than any other Airbnb I have ever stayed in. We also loved having a fire outside and ice skating on the lake. We hope to be back again next year! Highly recommended!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay went very well. Everything was clean and there were more provided amenities than we expected which was nice. Bunk beds were a little hard, but overall our stay was nice and peaceful and we were able to enjoy the time we had there with our family."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful house
2022-12-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was perfect for our annual family get together. Plenty of room and very clean. Beaver Dam is a short drive away and I'm sure the lake is beautiful during the summer.
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,This house is in a beautiful neighborhood overlooking a beautiful lake! There are plenty of comfortable beds and chairs for a big group. The kitchen had everything you might need. Definitely a great find!!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place! View is amazing!
2022-10-01,5.0,Group trip,What a great place to stay. Nice rustic decor with tasteful. seasonal touches. The location was great for our group and the Dells were very close-but not too close. Sunrise over the lake was beautiful. Next time we come we hope to take advantage of the pontoon and water activities as well as the fire pit. The weather did not cooperate for us on this trip. Furniture was comfortable. We loved the ceiling fans! Communication with the host was great. Check in and out we’re quick and easy. We will be back.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home that is right on the water and is perfectly set up to take full advantage of inside and outside living. Emily was a gracious host and I would have no hesitation to stay there again!!!
2022-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Very nice place for family get together. Excellent communication with owner.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great house! Layout worked for our group, and kitchen was amazingly well-stocked for our cooking-in needs. Water sports were difficult as the entry area was rocky, and hard to maneuver. Would definitely book again."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Beautiful place in a great location. Place is very spacious and has a great cabin vibe inside. Would absolutely go back!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful home and grounds. We enjoyed our family get-together a great deal. Had wonderful rainy day playing Cribbage, cards, and Scrabble. Fun for all."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time at the house in Beaver Dam. The house was clean and beautiful. Emily was extremely responsive and helpful for the minor questions and issues that we had. Definitely recommend staying!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Amazing property with everything you need for a relaxing vacation:). Owners are super responsive to questions, and we had several;) Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice home, beautifully decorated with lots of room for all to have separate spaces. We had 8 adults & 4 small children and it worked great. Large yard for games and spaces outdoors to just relax or have a campfire. The guys did fishing and caught a meals worth of catfish for us. We would rent this place again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful vacation home, we loved the Northwoods Decor and the Pontoon Boat is a big plus to have available. Very Clean home with large yard for fun yard games. The property manager is very kind and helpful."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place is big enough for a growing family! We loved the pontoon, yard, home, neighbors, fire pit, kayaks, the well stocked kitchen the list goes on and on"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house on Beaver Dam lake was wonderful! So much space and so clean everyone in our group was happy with it especially the kids. So much room to run around and play in the back yard and in the basement made for happy kids and happy parents. The house had everything we needed for a fantastic weekend on the water. Seemed like we had the lake all to ourselves as there was very little boat traffic other than us on the weekend. The kids loved all the pelicans too!
Emily was a great host and very responsive to any questions I had. Check in and check out was very easy. All around it was a great experience and everyone really enjoyed the house. Thank you Emily."
2022-06-01,4.0,Group trip,Great place with an awesome view of the lake.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our family had a great time, plenty of room for everyone. The location is great."
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Nice place with a great kitchen and lots of beds. Also plenty of common space if you have a lot of people. Check out is a little early at 09:00.
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This lake house was gorgeous. Great location, clean and tidy. Slept all 14 of use comfortably and with some space for a few extras! Kitchen was great! The only down fall with the kitchen supplies was that we had to contact Glenna , the Property manager, to get more garbage bags and more pods for the dishwasher. We were only left with two of each. There are three bathrooms and they each had shampoo, conditioner, tooth brush, tooth paste and soap. We had 14 guests and only 1 roll of toilet paper per bathroom so ended up calling Glenna for more TP as well. The backyard was our home away from home. We ended up renting the pontoon boat for one day. We were told we needed to provide our own life jackets so I went out and bought some & came to find out they were there provided for us. That was something we didn't need to hassle with if we were told they were already there. Renting a boat for $190 per day would make me think those would have been included. Over all the house was beautiful. The property manager was wonderful & such a great help. The check in and check out process was nothing like we've done before. We had to contact the property manager 60 min before arrival and then 20 min before arrival. She met us at the property. She showed us around & had me sign more paperwork stating the condition of the hallways, room etc...When we were ready to check out at 9 a.m. we had to wait for her to then go through the home with us again. It would of been nice to check in and out of the home on our own (after all I did sign all the contracts before hand anyways) It was a nice property I just wish I wouldn't of had to contact the manager 3 times to come back with supplies that were not stocked. The check in process has to be easier."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed at Emily's place in May for a golf outing. We had 9 adults in our group. We were able to spread out with tons of room left over. The house is extremely clean and well stocked. We were able to grill out one night and use the kitchen for a full meal the next.
While we were out in the back yard we were able to meet the neighborhood dogs and some of the neighbors. Everyone was very friendly and pointed us to some good places to eat (Zigs pizza is awesome!).
This was a great experience and we are already looking to book again next year."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"We stayed for a weekend and had a lovely time. The house was very nice and very clean, there was plenty of space to sleep 14 of us, and the fire pit right by the lake was perfect at night."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"A very nice home which has been thoroughly and tastefully updated. And, it was perfect for our group of seven guys for our reunion as we each had a bed and we could've had a few more as well. The kitchen was fantastic. It had everything we needed to prepare some great evening meals. I can highly recommend this place."
2022-04-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a great space for a large number of people. It has a nice large kitchen to be able to cook. The view of the lake was so nice to see the sunrise. Would go back again if we are in the area.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anne’s place was a wonderful place to get away. Beautiful view from the balcony!! Her and her husband’s communication was great. They were flexible with my check-in time which was greatly appreciated!! Thank you both!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was great. Clean, comfy, lovely view of the lake and near downtown. We’ll be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We needed a get away for the night to get out of the routine of life and had a really good time! Anne and Jason were very accommodating for an early check in for us and even offered their fishing boat to rent for the day! They were close enough for us to ask questions when we had them but left us alone so we could enjoy each other and the time alone without the busy of regular life. The fire pit was available for us to use with some wood even!!
The space was clean and provided more than what we needed with walking distance to food and dessert! (check out the ice cream shop down the road!! My husband loved his root beer float - hadn't had one in years!!) Coffee was in the cup board so we were VERY happy about that for the morning.
If we're ever back in the area - we'd definitely stay again!
Thank you!!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Anne's place exceeded my expectations!! Easy and clean and beautiful. Couldn't ask for more.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Went to the property for Labor day weekend and it was great. Host was exceptional and close by ready to go with local recommendations and insights. They were clearly passionate about the town and looking to put Beaver Dam on the map as a tourist location. When we asked about the kayaks and fire pits near by they filled us in with all we needed to know and even provided us with wood to cook smores on. Was already a great place to stay and the host was asking for feedback on what they could do better. If I ever find myself in Beaver Dam again I would not hesitate to book with Anne again.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Pine Lodge Retreat. It is such a hidden gem! Beaver Dam Lake is beautiful area and the cabin was a wonderful lake front retreat. There were a couple issues with cleanliness but nothing that can’t be addressed and corrected. Brooke was a great host, very responsive and helpful! This place offers amazing opportunity for relaxation and recharging! We would absolutely stay again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was absolutely amazing! The lakefront was super beautiful, the cabin felt like home, and overall we had an absolute blast. Would definitely recommend this place and would gladly go again."

2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Brooke’s Pine Lodge was beautiful. My friends and I had a wonderful experience. The beds were very comfortable. The place was spotless and the views were very nice. It was a great experience and I am very happy to have stayed at their place. Additionally, it’s very accessible.
Only things to note, is the water that comes out of the faucet and showers. That is out of Brookes hand, but the water can sometimes smell a bit metallic.
Aside from that, everything was amazing and we had a great time"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Brooke was a great hostess, the home was very clean and well stocked, and the kids loved being on the lake."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This was a beautiful home on a great body of water. The house was very clean. Tons of room in the back yard and space to spread out along the dock. The hosts were responsive to all my messages. They had pea gravel in the water around the dock so we were able to wade around. Plenty of cookware was provided. Overall very happy with this stay it accommodated our group of 8 well.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Brooke and Aron were great hosts! Always responsive and happy to help.
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Pine Lodge with Brooke was amazing! The pictures don't do the view and home justice. Everything was clean, extra supplies were available and Brooke was available if we needed her. We enjoyed gathering down by the water and having a fire at night. Our entire group enjoyed the vibe this location gives out. The neighbors were also super nice! Brooke was a great host before we got to the house and was available to answer any questions we messaged her with. I highly recommend staying at Pine Lodge and allowing Brooke to host you. You won't be disappointed!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,our stay was amazing and wonderful we will definitely be back. One of the best places we've stayed in a long time A+++++
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"such a cute cabin! Lots of thoughtful touches such as beach towels, nightstands with built-in chargers, large ice cube tray in the freezer, printed info about the neighborhood, firewood, etc. We had a great time!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great place. Very clean, awesome spot on the lake. Having kayaks to use was a big bonus. Nice updated touches in the cabin while maintaining the feel of a family cabin on the lake. We had 6 people (4 adults, 2 kids) and we fit perfectly. 10 might be a stretch but technically enough sleeping spots for that many. Loved having dinner in the backyard on the picnic tables. Would love to come back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,The lodge was very cozy and had a great view of the lake. There was also easy access to the lake.
2023-05-01,4.0,Group trip,Lovely scenery! & great host!
2023-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved the location right on the lake with great sunsets, plenty of space for everyone, loved all the hooks for coats and towels etc ( a pet peeve when i can't hang things). The stairs to loft are steep but we didn't have any problems. We had a great weekend and would highly recommend! The family wants to come back again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything was as perfect as it seemed online. The location was incredible. Brooke - our host was very helpful and thoughtful. A very tidy and lovely Airbnb home equipped with everything you need. Thanks for hosting us. Would love to come back again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brooke has a beautiful spot on the Lake and didn’t miss any details. She was very kind and left us to a peaceful 4 days but made sure we knew she was available. Will for sure book with Brooke again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Nice little quiet cabin on the lake! Im sure it would be a great spot for a get away in the summer, or earlier in the winter for ice fishing. We found plenty to do in Beaver Dam and surrounding for the weekend. Brooke was quick to respond when needed. Would certainly consider staying again if in the area.
-Josh"
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,I would love to booked if she will have me❤️
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Love our stay in the Pinelodge Retreat Cabin. I love that Brooke and Aaron prepared a nice setting on the table , the happy birthday balloon and note and a lil bottle of drink. Thank you! I like that i was able to prepare meals for my guest on my birthday because they have all the stuff i needed for cooking like pots and pan, knife , they have all matching plates and cups, spoons, forks and knives coffee makers , coffee etc. When i often the fredge they also have prepared bottles of water which is awesome . Check bathrooms they also have provided shampoos, soaps and also they provided lots of towels to both bathrooms. But we only used upstairs for the most of the time. We didnt hangout in the basement . Wish there's tv in the basement or bedrooms for other people that like their own privacy and to just chill on one room. I also able to wash dishes & pots because they have the cleaning supplies also. Its awesome. My friends mentioned they might rent this place also🤗"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The home was very accommodating and very comfortable we enjoyed the days we were their and definitely would come back
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brett was very responsive and helpful anytime I messaged him. I loved the place, it is very large and had a “homey” feel to it. It’s above a bowling alley so I was a little worried about the sound. The only night I really heard anything was Saturday night, but not enough to keep me awake when I went to bed. I stayed there during a snow storm so wasn’t able to get out much, but lots of restaurants and things to do in the immediate area. I would definitely stay there again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay will definitely book again
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had personal circumstances that required a last minute stay in the area. Brett was very responsive and was able to accommodate us. He went out of his way to make our stay comfortable. The unit is just as described and convenient to many activities and attractions in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great stay!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Brett's place was clean and comfortable. We really liked the personal touches and fall decorations found throughout the apartment. The pictures do not do it justice. If we are ever in Juneau again, we will book here before looking anywhere else."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish I was sitting at a keyboard because I have a LOT to say. Mr Brett and his folks are outstanding hosts. Local knowledge is unmatched. No problem finding things to do around Juneau and it was one of the best vacations I've ever taken BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE!!!! Could go on and on but I made my point. Outstanding.
Much Love and Appreciation,
Some nobody from Texas"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Brett was super nice and the space was actually better than the photographs provided in the profile! Super clean space!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Being above a bowling alley i was a little worried about the noise but was suprised at how that wasnt a problem AT ALL. The place was clean and very spacious.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,no complaints!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, peaceful, cozy spot for a weekend getaway. Dan was very helpful, quick to respond, and flexible. Love that it is so dog-friendly! I’d love to stay again sometime."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a gem on Lake Sinissippi. I highly recommend staying here if you want to relax, unwind, and take in some fresh air. The location on the lake couldn't be any better. The cabin is cozy, quaint, and has everything you need for a peaceful getaway. There are tons of hikes within driving distance and the closest town is only a 10 minute drive if you need to stop in and grab something. The greatest advantage of all is getting to bring your fur babies with you. We hope to be back here again in the summer time when we can enjoy a dip in the lake!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great space to get away with a significant other. We loved walking around the lake, beautiful scenery. Very dog friendly. The kitchen was fully stocked which was nice. Spices, utensils.. they had everything you’d need. Dan was super responsive and friendly!
Would recommend!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The pictures doesn’t do justice to this place! Beautiful and cozy, brand new bungalow, spotless clean. The area around was great for long walks and sightseeing. Quiet and peaceful. We brought our two dogs along, they had so much fun playing in the front yard, which was clean and spacious. My husband pulled a several catfish from the lake, a nice surprise! We booked at this unfortunate time, when everything is starting to close for the upcoming winter, so the water toys weren’t available to us anymore, but still it was a nice three days of rest and recharge. Dan was a wonderful host. Communication was seamless. We will be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved staying here! We had a very peaceful and comfortable stay for the whole week. We enjoyed walking by the lake and kayaking. We will definitely book again when we come out to visit family.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"It's rare to have a place meet every expectation of the photos and they managed to exceed my expectations. Very clean, comfortable and decor was impressive. We appreciated the provided amenities, definitely above and beyond on all fronts. Both of us and the dog very much enjoyed our stay! We'd love to come back again some day, thank you for a wonderfully relaxing time with beautiful views and wildlife sightings."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at Dan’s place!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"What can I say, we absolutely LOVED this cute bungalow on the Sinissippi Lake! We brought all 3 of our dogs with us, our senior doggo who enjoyed taking snoozes on the porch, hammock with mom, and exploring the large yard and dock. Our other 2 dogs loved running around playing fetch, swimming, and having their own little spot in the bedroom to sleep at night. The neighbors were friendly, and it was just so peaceful and serene. Trust me, we did not want to leave!
Dan, the host, is so friendly, communicative, and thorough, and just wanted to ensure we would have the most relaxing and best vacay away and we did! We will absolutely be back and I've already recommended this lovely bungalow to our friends with doggies. The cute little bungalow was just perfect, with a very comfy king-size bed, the kitchen was more than we expected, and loved being able to grill out every night and have a fire pit to round off the day. We highly recommend this AirBNB and can't wait to go back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home is very comfortable and simple. There was plenty of amenities and towels/rags to use. Everything was easy to find and use.
Dan communicated before, during, and after the stay. His instructions were very thorough, easy to follow, and he responded promptly to any questions I had.
The yard is large, with a beautiful view of the lake. Our dog enjoyed being in the water.
This home was very inviting, relaxing, and just beautiful. We enjoyed our stay very much."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great visit at the cabin! Beautiful surroundings and lots to do (or not do) in terms of walking, enjoying the lake, building a fire, etc. - would highly recommend as a place to relax and get away for a few days."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time during our short stay! We loved the area and how accommodating everything was for our golden retriever.
We didn’t take full advantage of this place. It was a baby moon trip, normal me would have had the kayaks and paddle boat in the water. Our dog loved the open yard. I appreciated the cleanliness of knowing other people and their dogs have stayed here.
We slept good, a lot of air bnbs don’t have the most comfortable bed but this sure did! Thank you for a wonderful, comfortable, relaxing stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We couldn’t be happier with Corsa’s Pillowfort. The place was perfect for the 2 of us plus our black lab Beau. We usually board him but so glad they allowed pets. This is surrounded by water from each view and it was so peaceful and relaxing which is just what we wanted. Thank you Dan for sharing your home with us and making it so comfortable! Can’t wait to book again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"a beautiful and peaceful place to stay. we enjoyed the early morning sitting on the porch and listening to the frogs croak etc. really very lovely. also a very comforting space for our dogs to play in the yard with us. We loved watching the water and a bird that stood in the distance fishing all morning. Really felt happy and relaxed

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our time in this little lake house. What a treat to be able to bring our two large dogs with no fuss- not the normal experience for airbnbs! We loved sitting on the porch, letting the dogs swim, and walking around the lake. The space was super clean and just perfect for the two of us and the dogs. Such a lovely stay for a few relaxing days."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful time at Corsa’s Pillowfort! It was right on the water with a beautiful view. Our dog Bella loved being able to swim and sit out on the deck with us. It was a perfect place to relax and spend time outdoors. Dan had top notch communication and the home had everything we could have needed. I appreciate how dog friendly it was!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dan is a great host, very responsive and helpful! Also the house is very cute and was perfect for what my dog and I needed."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the area, the home and the lot. It’s just a bit closer to the next door neighbor than I anticipated."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the bedroom with the glass sliding door overlooking the huge yard. Had an amazing storm that I enjoyed. Dogs were comfortable in the space and also enjoyed the view.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,One of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been! My dog and I will be back next year for sure!!!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful location, amazing views of the lake and very quiet. Very clean place, plenty of room for the 2 of us and thankful for the amenities. We enjoyed sitting on the dock in the mornings and easing into the day.
Our only challenge was the lack of communication about the road construction around the house. We rode our bike there for the Harley Davidson celebration. All the roads leading to the house had signs saying there were closed. The way our GPS took us was over a road (hwy 60) that was in the process of being torn up to be repaved. The miles of large, loose gravel, uneven terrain and large bumps and holes in the road were unsafe to ride on and caused damage to my bike. Unfortunately we had to take that road once, until we were able to find a better way. The “better way” added an extra 20 mins, each way to our commute to Milwaukee. If this had been disclosed to us upfront, prior to our arrival dates, we would’ve found a different place to stay."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Fan was a great host! The little house on the lake was perfect for us while attending a wedding nearby.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"we loved this little gem. so peaceful, great location with things to do. we will definitely be back."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Fantastic get away spot enjoyed the property and especially the paddle boat and also the sightings of many deer within the area and our dogs loved it too so relaxing and enjoyable can’t wait to go back again
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was the perfect little getaway where we could relax with the beautiful surroundings and the dogs could swim! The place was so so cute and clean. We couldn’t have asked for a better host, Dan was great! Thank you for sharing your place with us and being so accepting of our furbabies we had a blast!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan's place was amazing! I have nothing bad to say about it! Our dogs really enjoyed it too. We were private and everything was in the cabin we needed. It was the perfect distance from our place in Chicago to get away without driving too far! Thanks again for everything! I can't wait to stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dan is a great host! He answered any questions I had quickly. The bungalow was the perfect place to relax with our dog. We can't wait for our next visit!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved this private and beautiful little space. It felt like we had an entire lake to ourselves it was so quiet! And Dan fussed to make sure we had everything we needed and then some. We will for sure stay here again and hopefully soon! Within minutes from Horicon Marsh!
,,,"Booked this place and was a couple hours late. Drove up only to find a bunch of a wedding party walking around the cabin and porch. After they dispersed we tried to find the key which was not in the spot it was supposed to be. We went to the office, no one there, lights off. My wife and I had been driving for 12 hours, were exhausted and decided to move on. Host originally agreed to a refund then changed her mind because we only booked for one night and didn't qualify and said we didn't look in the right spot for the key. Didn't bother messenger while on was on the property because earlier communication took most of the day or the next to respond. Pretty property but crap communication, service and rude host."
