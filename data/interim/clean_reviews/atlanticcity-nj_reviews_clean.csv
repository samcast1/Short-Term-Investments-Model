2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it was a great place to stay
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, the neighborhood looked a little sketchy but the inside of the place made you forget what the outside looks like . Beautifully decorated , and the host was so friendly and responsive . Would definitely stay there again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I will rent this airbnb again if we have another volleyball tournament in Atlantic. The apartment is between Showboat and Ocean‚Äôs Resort. It is a 7 to 10 minute walk to the beach from Ocean‚Äôs side. The host is very clear with the instructions and the unit is exactly as described probably even better. The only downside is probably the parking slot if you have multiple cars since there is only one reserved spot for the unit so we ended parking one of the cars at Ocean‚Äôs but it has been communicated before hand by our hosts and they even gave us options. Overall, I highly recommend to those who is looking to stay in Atlantic City."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I have stayed at this property a few times before and consider it a home away from home.

And, we appreciate that the host are readily available by email or text for any questions. For my family and I, our overall stay experience was great! üòÉ"

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Went fir a basketball tournament on AC boardwalk. Loved location that was right across from OceaCasino and Boardwalk. As a walker, we parked car in the lot out front and then on last day moved our car to Ocean garage. The place was immaculate. Beds comfortable. The shower in second bathroom was very nice. Kitchen fully stocked with pots and pans and dishes. There is a Keurig so suggest bring your own k cups. Also plastic wrap if you need that. Furniture is very nice and 3 tvs.
Hist was very responsive. Outside steps and walkway could use remodel bur inside is lovely. A little road noise but we put on our own white noise and it blocked out outside sounds and a little loud talking from neighbors.
We loved the place and will defistay there again next time in AC."

I started to get nervous when a few of the other mom‚Äôs were talking about how bad theirs were and how bad the area was. Let me tell you‚Ä¶.This place was GORGEOUS!!!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place. Looks like the pictures . I close to everything and enjoyed the stay.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second stay at this unit managed by Cozy Cohost. Mr. Paul, their representative maintains in touch with the guest. He also responds back immediately if and when I've had a question.
The unit is comfortable and well maintained. The photos are extremely descriptive of the unit.
I would and do recommend any units managed by Cozy Cohost to others seeking comfortability, a peaceful environment and that home-like feel.
Five Stars across the board."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Good location, charmingly decorated. It was quiet and easy to get to the places we wanted. My only comment is that there was no bathroom on the first level. This should not be a deterrent to most people."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as the name says. SUPER COZY apartment. Perfect location, Clean home with every amenity you need, overall the best air bnb in atlantic city if you are looking for a relaxing stay in a beautiful home. Owners are very attentive & respond to any questions or concerns. No complaints, will stay again 10/10."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had the pleasure of staying at the property for four nights. The premises were pristine, comfortable, private and extremely relaxing.
Mr Paul the representative for Cozy Co-host responded immediately to any questions I asked regarding ""how to lock the front door"" to an unexpected "" short term power outage"" .
The property reflects the photographs on the Airbnb website. The stay was extremely enjoyable. There was enough space for my guests and myself to relax in comfort without feeling as if we were on top of each other.
I most definitely would and already have recommended not only this property but other properties managed by Mr Paul and the Cozy Cohost organization to my friends.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect for a few days of remote working. Everything was as pictured and described. And the heat worked very well as it was a cold week in AC! We would definitely consider other Cozy Cohost properties in the future.

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was just as described. Walkable to casinos and the beach which was very convenient and made for a great trip. Very nice and updates amenities in the apartment. There are strict rules regarding trash take out to keep bugs away but still a number of fruit flies and other bugs when we were there. Otherwise a great experience!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Home was very clean and just as pictured. Our Host was responsive to all my inquiries. Located about a block and half to the Boardwalk and beach All amenities as if it was your own home. I would definitely stay here again.

Space was super clean and everything worked. Highly recommend this space to others."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,As beautiful as the pictures showed. The location to the beach and Casinos was perfect. Right next door to the new water park too. Reserved parking for one and close by self parking for our second vehicle. We were a family of four along with two grandparents and there was room for everyone. Would definitely recommend for a family or girlfriend‚Äôs weekend. Looking forward to booking again in the future.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved how close it is to the beach and boardwalk. It is the perfect walking distance. The inside is comfortable and we felt safe. Everything was exactly like the pictures. The parking lot could use a touch up as we had a hard time locating our spot, however we still loved the night vibes from the balcony. Would definitely come again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Great location for going to the boardwalk and casinos.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at Cozy Cohost Willow Breeze. The place is brand new. The decor is on point. We love the modern boho vibe. Let's talk about the location ‚Äì it couldn't have been better! So close to the boardwalk, beach, ocean casino, and showboat indoor waterpark. The place was clean and tidy and had everything we needed for a great stay. The host was super friendly. Paul responded very quickly to our message and solved the issue promptly during our stay. I would highly recommend this place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place if you are heading to Atlantic City but don‚Äôt want to stay in hotel. Just a block from the Ocean Casino and a quick walk from the boardwalk. The apartment is perfect. There was plenty of space and had everything we could have needed. I would definitely stay here again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was absolutely great! the house was beautiful. the only problem was the deck door was so hard to open but other then that it is absolutely wonderful. The host was amazing!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place was great - just as described. Very clean and furnished nicely. It's about 2 blocks from the boardwalk which is very nice. Although there is only one parking spot, there is a parking garage down the block that only costs $10 to park in. The host was very responsive when we needed something. Would recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the space. Right across from the Ocean hotel and the beach. We walked to the beach every day. I highly suggest to get up at 4:30 am and walk to the beach to view the sunrise! We really appreciated the washer and dryer, perfect to throw our towels in after the beach. Loved that the fridge has an ice maker (not all places do.) My daughter & fianc√© loved the chess table, they got some games in before bed. The kitchen was spotless, appliances all new and working. We were provided enough towels, beds & furniture were clean, and the host was very responsive. The only minor issues were the sliding door to the balcony was difficult to open. And the parking space got a bit flooded in the rain, but I understand this is out of their control and not their fault. These are minor and I won‚Äôt take away any rating for it. These are definitely not something that would deter us from booking again, we loved the place. Definitely would stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Location was perfect! Just the right size for 6 of us to have girls trip. Everything in working order. Would definitely consider this place again if back in the area.
2023-07-01,4.0,Group trip,"Clean close to the boardwalk,casinos and amusement park
Great stay"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Excellent stay! Great design, thoughtful touches, very clean and comfortable with excellent communication."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very clean and comfortable condo that is very well equipped with everything that you will need. Nice appliances, televisions and a refrigerator with an ice maker. Also, a nice full size washer and dryer that we didn't use. Convenient location in front of the Ocean Casino, so it's a short walk to the boardwalk. The only issues would be the sliding door to the deck is extremely difficult to open and the outside of the property could be much nicer. This is really a condo association issue, but it should be addressed. There was trash laying around in the yard when we arrived, but the next day, one of the homeowner's (I'm assuming) started to clean it up. I would recommend this rental."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The unit was exactly as described. Cute and modern, and we loved the furnishings. When I messaged the host we received an immediate response. I wish the pool had been opened but I completely understand that‚Äôs an HOAs issue. The weather was terrible when we were there so swimming wasn‚Äôt an issue. The unit is right behind the Ocean Casino and boardwalk and it‚Äôs a 5 min walk to the beach. It was a great location, great unit and exactly what our family needed. I highly recommend it! Thanks for providing a great place to stay!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I would definitely be staying at this Airbnb again when I go back to Atlantic City.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice and clean home. So many amenities that came in helpful. Location was near boardwalk and was very convenient.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, host were very friendly and the place was clean overall!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unit was very clean and location was close to beach/boardwalk. Kitchen was nicely furnished. Both bathrooms are located upstairs as on suites. Outside of unit was a little run down, but felt safe."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy house. Well located. Clean. The pictures show how the house is. Recommended forma quite stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space is perfect. Walkable to AC Broadwalk and close to casinos. The home itself is beautiful, decor is very nice and well thought out. Stocked with everything you need from utensils, appliances and very comfy pillows, bed sheets, etc. You cannot go wrong with this space, trust it has everything you and your group needs and then some. You will be very satisfied and beyond happy you booked this place."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best place to stay at
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I are teachers who wanted to get away for spring vacation; this place was perfect. It‚Äôs across the street from the Ocean casino and the Boardwalk, and a short walk to a variety of other attractions like casinos and the Tanger Outlets. The space was clean and cozy and exactly what we were looking for."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was beautiful while inside. Everything was as described, bathroom, kitchen, living room, balcony etc was very clean & organized. I contacted the host about an issue & they came right away & fixed it. I have no complaints about the house itself, BUT the neighborhood was a different story. We didn't feel safe as we heard neighbors moving around and walking and it felt as if they were in the house with us. It scared us especially at night. One of the nights it rained and the parking lot was flooded and we couldn't get to our car as there was water flooded around it so we had to stay in. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would book again as it was a beautiful house. I can't blame the host for the neighborhood. It is Atlantic City after all. Thank you for hosting us!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The stay was absolutely the best. Great hosts and amazing hosts. I would definitely recommend this place to other people and stay again.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here for my boyfriend birthday weekend and he loved how clean the house is and how close it was to the casinos .
The host were amazing!!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! The apartment was nicely decorated and the location was close to the beach and boardwalk. It was kept very neatly, there were very cute dishes in the kitchen! We did however, see a few ants on the counter when we came in. The dryer is also located near the kitchen smoke detector and it went off a few times as our laundry was running, so as a warning to other guests, don‚Äôt be alarmed by this. Also, one of the bathrooms has a tension rod and when we woke up it had fallen, it was easy to put up, but did eventually fall again (totally fixable, just be careful). Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this adorable apartment!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the place and the area in general. Looking forward to coming back!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We typically stay at Oceans when we visit Atlantic City, but the room prices this particular weekend (really, most weekends) were very high. I checked out Airbnb instead and was so glad I did. This unit was steps away from Oceans, and with lots of newly renovated, clean, bright space (2 beds, 2 baths), we were very comfortable there. We had an assigned parking spot and could see our vehicle right out the window.
Admittedly, the outside of this condo complex isn't going to grace any magazine covers, but the ""Cozy Cohost"" couple is truly transforming the interiors of the units they've purchased.
Also, I tend to communicate a lot with my hosts, and they were such a pleasure to deal with - responsive, helpful, and committed to the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Best spot in atlantic city
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My first stay at an Airbnb and I most say this place on the inside was very nice, welcoming and cozy! The outside can definitely use a major upgrade especially with the nice buildings apartments directly across the street from it! But once inside you tend to forget about the outside until you go outside! Overall this was such an awesome experience. I will definitely book with Cozy Cohost again!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean and comfortable accommodations. Host was very accessible. Immediately adjacent to Ocean casino and just a few blocks from Hard Rock. If you are heading to either this is the place for you.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I want to start off by saying that this was one of my all-time favorite AirBnb stays!
Decided to surprise my boyfriend with a quick staycation to Atlantic City and was looking for a cozy home for us to relax for a few days and this unit more than exceeded my expectations.
The layout of the place was absolutely gorgeous, even down to the intricate and cohesive details, the flow of the interior decor did not go unnoticed. The stringed balcony lights were also super cute.
Very comfortable beds with extra linens/pillows, plenty of washcloths/towels, you got an iron/ironing board, cups/glasses, full kitchen, washer/dryer etc. literally anything you have in your home, it's here! We didn't need or want for anything.
Best part was Paul and Ashley being SO helpful and kind before, during, and after our stay. They were so accomodating and truly made us feel like we were at home.
Don't think twice about booking this location, it's everything you're looking for and more. You won't regret it!"
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this place! The pictures provided are a true representation of the unit. The entire unit is very clean. The hosts have decorated it well. The furnishings are clean, new and well kept. The place has such a comfortable feel. The kitchen was spotless (not sure I have ever experience that at any other airbnb). The unit is within walking distance of so many restaurants and casinos. We were going to the Hard Rock for a concert. This unit was so convenient for that and way more affordable than staying at the Hard Rock. The exterior of the building could use some updating but other than that this place is near perfect. We would stay again! Also, the host responded quickly."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I just stayed at this location for my boyfriends birthday weekend and it was amazing. The place is nice, decorated beautifully, clean and the hosts and friendly and respond quickly. We really felt at home for our stay this past weekend and everything we did was close the the Airbnb. If you‚Äôre staying in AC I would definitely book this place !"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful stay at this beautiful Airbnb, and would love to stay here again if given the opportunity, they had such a beautiful place and the pictures did not compare. We love the design and the layout of the area and whatever we needed they were there to help!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is so adorable! It felt so cozy, which made it easy to relax inside while we stayed. Was super clean and organized!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was very responsive. The Airbnb itself was clean and very relaxing. We will differently be returning.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and cozy
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My only complaint is the exterior does the interior no justice. When we pulled up I instantly started thinking ‚Äòthis looks like a bad idea‚Äô but once we got inside, we were very pleased. The decor was very well put together and the cleanliness of the place was great. This was our first time booking an Airbnb, and because of our great experience we would definitely do it again. And we will use this place again also."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good location. Very homey feeling. And clean.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Perfect stay. Place was very clean, same as pictures. Comfortable and great location. Stayed with a toddler and an infant and it was very comfortable"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Optimal location for AC if you want to stay in a more quiet safer area. Convienent as well, very clean. We enjoyed our stay entirely, no complaints here and the price was fair!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Looking for a spot in Atlantic City can be scary! I loved this location! The building itself is being renovated in some areas however that did not affect us at all. The condo itself was lovely! Our hosts answered us immediately with any of our questions and concerns. The kitchen is just perfect and beautiful. New appliances and a washer and dryer! The living space is very calming and aesthetically pleasing. The bedrooms were also very comfortable and clean. Literally the only thing I would have wished for was a full length mirror in the bedroom. That is a minor issue that was more a preference. We stay in AC once a month for work and are always looking for places to stay. I really hope we get the opportunity to stay here again! :))) THANK YOU
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We enjoyed our stay very much in this newly renovated unit, with super comfortable new furnishings, decor and beds. The host was quick to communicate and the location was superb - right across from Oceans and easy walking distance to the north end boardwalk, beach, Hard Rock, great restaurants, amusement ride pier etc. The 1960s building is undergoing a transition with many units being rehabbed. By we were never interrupted by construction or felt unsafe the whole week we were there. A new water park is slated to be built just across from the condominium complex, and the whole area will be that much more family friendly when it is. We would definitely stay here again and appreciated everything the host did to make our stay comfortable and special :-)"
2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was at a great location, easy walking distance to the beach and to the boardwalk and the Ocean casino. We enjoyed our stay here and Paul was a very communicative and helpful host. I would definitely recommend this place!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy Cohosts are amazing hosts. Their communication and care for their guests is exceptional. We were able to get into the location with ease and enjoyed our stay. The home was clean, spacious and matched the photos to a tee. The area was safe, quiet and serene to wash all your concerns and stressors away. We will definitely be back and would like to personally thank Cozy Cohosts Marla for a tremendous stay."
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"beautiful place. Modern style, the view is amazing, host help a lot with instructions. great place overall."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great views and tons of natural light made this an oasis from the typical Atlantic City energy.. One mile from the Ocean Casino / Boardwalk made this location ideal for a quick getaway. Located about 10 minutes from the Seaview Dolce for dinner/ golf.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing location. Highly recommend staying for a weekend getaway. Process was easy and can‚Äôt wait to go back.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The environment is good. I hope the curtains can be improved. They are too bright.
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had an amazing time with the airbnb. The first to have three floors and enough bathrooms.
Pros: enough bathrooms for everyone to shower if someone takes it. Has essentials for bathroom. Kitchen has seasonings and also many pots and pans and utensils as well as dishwasher soap, and dish soap and sponges. Trash bags enough to last us days
Cons. Some bathrooms do not lock. No curtains to cover sunlight. dishwasher doesn‚Äôt dry or completely washes dishes . Third floor locks do not work. Not enough blankets.
Would definitely come again! The hosts and cohosts were especially helpful and fast in replying and made us feel very welcome. Don‚Äôt miss out on this beautiful home!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,The stay was amazing and I did not want to leave that view. I'll definitely be booking here the next time I come back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host were amazing. We had a medical emergency, and the host was so gracious and accommodating.. The place has a beautiful peaceful view, where you can sit and watch the birds, etc. Loved the modern aspects We would definitely stay again."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a family of 6 and we enjoyed our stay. All areas were spacious, including the living room.

We would definitely stay here again, when we come back to Atlantic City."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy Cohosts were wonderful hosts! The place was very beautiful and cozy. Right across the street from Oceans casino which was very convenient. The hosts were very kind, generous and very responsive to us. The space was very convenient, cleans and comfortable. They offered great amenities and provided helpful things such as makeup towels, bathing soap, extra paper towel and toilet paper, cleaning products etc. which allowed for convenience for our group. We will absolutely book again and recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful, affordable and comfortable place to stay in Atlantic City!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was described as listed. Host reached out several times to make sure I was okay. I like that each room had it's own bathroom. Location was great and area was peaceful. Kitchen was updated but the furniture and upstairs bathrooms were dated but everything was clean. The foam mattress felt great but the pillows were way to soft.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay here and so did my family. The space was nice and clean, and we especially enjoyed having separate bathrooms inside each room!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot, listing was just as described and close to casino and waterpark. Host was very responsive, would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My recent stay at this Airbnb was fantastic!

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was my first experience in that area of AC. Living area was clean, but I thought the furniture was outdated. We were older ladies so the steps were a little much for one of us. I did not notice when I booked that it was located on the 2nd floor. For future reference please indicate the level."

Very close to beach, boardwalk, Ocean‚Äôs Casino, and Showboat Waterpark & Arcade. Only complaint is there are no curtains or shades over balcony doors so at night if lights were on you could see in some of living room from the parking lot below- no big deal as the area was not busy. Overall we would stay again!"

2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The house was as described. Short walk to the beach/boardwalk. The hosts were responsive. We canceled our stay early due to ants all over the house when we woke up. The host made it right and refunded the rest of our stay. Unfortunately, we were unable to find a place local for 5 people on short notice so we had to cut our AC trip a little short. It did rain the night before and the hosts claim the ants are common in AC after it rains, but they were everywhere. They offered to send in an exterminator that day, but Ididn't want my kids in there afterwards. Other than the ants everything was as described and it had plenty of space for the 5 of us."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, well renovated and very close to the boardwalk.
Beautiful sunrise and sunset.
Small courtyard in the back convenient for dinner outside..
A restaurant for lunch/dinner right next door, excellent bagel (multiple flavor)
Only downside, if the 2nd bed is used in the living room and tenants from above arrive at a late hour, you are awake every time for sure, the door is right next door and zero soundproofing. Audible from the room also but less.
My experience, 2 nights without problem because alone but last night(Friday), the tenants of the 2nd came back at 3:15 am, 4:10 am and 5:25 am!!!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Truly wish I had found this CozyCohost beauty months ago! Perfect location to easily access the many work sites I visit in the city. The owners make you feel so very welcome and are attentive throughout the entire stay. The architecture and decor of the condo remind me very much of the Queen Anne style homes of the trendy part of town where I grew up.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just like pictures! Host was very accommodating & quick to respond!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I love it I felt right at home. I enjoyed my birthday and Thanksgiving, and I would definitely definitely book with them again.."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was exactly like the pictures and the location was great for walking to majority of places. The place was easy to get to and spotless when we got there.
There was an issue with the wifi which was out of anyone‚Äôs control but when i contacted the host they answered right away and the issue was resolved as soon as possible.
I would definitely recommend this place. It was the perfect place to have a nice relaxing getaway."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The place was really nice. Looks like they recently renovated. Was a quick walk to the boardwalk and some of the Casinos. Everything was hassle free and they put in extra effort when it came to answering questions and handling our stay. We would book a place with them again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed my stay here. It looks just like the pictures and is very clean. The kitchen is also well stocked with dishes/pots etc so you can cook your own meals. The bed was also very comfortable. It is probably less than 3 min walk to the boardwalk/ beach. Would definitely book here again.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our two night stay! A lot of great restaurants around the area. Plenty of parking on the street!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a short stay here while visiting family nearby. It had everything we needed for a comfortable experience. The bed was also very comfortable. While we weren't looking to spend time on the boardwalk or casinos during this stay, it was a very convenient walk to those places and I imagine a great spot in the warmer months!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a comfortable stay, very very cozy!!
would recommend this location as an ideal place to vacay! cozy co host your great!!!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a pretty, tastefully decorated, newly renovated, well equipped apartment. It is an easy stroll to the boardwalk, and a short drive to excellent restaurants. It worked very well for me for a three night stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Place was great. A definite hit for someone looking for a lowkey, but nice place. Way cheaper than staying at the hotels."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great. The home was nice and clean, it was a block away from the board walk and 10 min Uber to Tropicana and other hotels. The hosts were great and checked in everyday to make sure everything was perfect. I would go back again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For the cost, the place was beautiful, the charm of a 100 year old row house, but appointed with a full modern kitchen, and modern bedroom and finishes. Plenty of dishes and glassware were provided, and we even made use of some games that were available since we weren't allowed to swim in the ocean. The area itself is not in the ""happening"" part of town, but that didn't bother us at all. The location is right next to a beautiful lighthouse, 2 blocks from the boardwalk, and just next to a delicious bagel place. We were out and about both day and night and we never felt unsafe.
I will say do your own research as far as dining goes; the hosts were kind enough to provide a book with recommendations, which we used the first night, but found it quite mediocre. There are many MANY options, especially if you are willing to drive a little.
All in all, I would stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Seaside Suite was honestly one of the nicest Airbnbs I've stayed in. It was very clean, well decorated, and generally very comfortable for our weekend. The unit was modern enough where it counts while still having a classic old beach house vibe. The location was great as well. The inlet neighborhood was very peaceful compared to other parts of Atlantic City, and its only a couple blocks from Ocean Casino and the boardwalk. Hot Bagels next door is a great classic breakfast spot and very convenient to have so close-by. The hosts were also quick to respond to any messages, although there werent any real problems to require much attention during our stay. I highly recommend this place!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a perfect place to stay for an AC trip. Great location. You can catch the sunrise and sunset from the backyard. Gorgeous clean house. Perfect for a single or couple. There is a unit upstairs, I would ask if it was occupied first if you mind noise. Super safe neighborhood, walking distance to the boardwalk and beach and just minutes from all the casinos. Great communication with the hosts, they respond back right away. 10/10 recommend."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,For my first time on Airb&b I couldn't ask for a better first location. my family and I are extremely pleased and happy. we will definitely be going back every summer!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great !
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My son and I had a great stay at the Seaside Suite! The place was clean with new appliances, removed from the crowds and bustle of being too close to the Atlantic City crowds.

I would recommend staying here for anyone who wants a cozy and relaxing stay in the Atlantic City area without all of the loud noise and big crowds. Thank you Cozy Cohost!"

The inside of the apartment was beautiful and looked just like the pictures. Spacious and comfy.

Very convenient location, the boardwalk is 2 only blocks away and Tropicana is across the street with a few restaurants and shops; however, nights are actually not noisy. There is paid public parking right behind the building. The host is very welcoming and friendly. We came with a 4-year-old and it worked great for us."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great! There is plenty of room. Plenty of closet space. It was quiet. Loved the welcome basket of snacks and wine. Do wish there were a little more frying pans for cooking breakfast. We got the Air bnb so that we could cook breakfast, so that we didn't have to eat out every meal. We did manage to cook breakfast. A little bit more instructions on what to do with the towels, trash, etc. But overall, great place. I would definitely recommend this place. We had a couple problems and once I messaged i received a response. It was very comforting and put us at ease."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay. Kitchen lacks in some cooking supplies, but everything else was great! Super convenient location, in a secure building."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"ShaSha is a very good host. The location is good in terms of beach access and the Tropicana Casino next door, but it is pretty loud at all hours of the night.
The house layout was just right for our family, but the second bedroom got very warm if you closed the door.
The kitchen is nice for occasional cooking, and the gift basket of snacks and wine was a nice bonus. A few more dishes, utensils, and kitchenware would be a nice add.
This was certainly a better option than staying in a cramped hotel room at a casino for a similar price."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"100% recommend this for your trip to Atlantic City. The location was a few steps away from Tropicana and very close to the beach/all of the restaurants that AC has to offer. The place looks exactly like the photos and was very clean. Was welcomed with gift basket of snacks, water, and slippers. My only recommendation is a second air conditioner in the other bedroom, however, the host provided a fan which made it more comfortable. Would definitely recommend this place, enjoyed the stay"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing place very clean and comfortable for my family. My only recommendation it‚Äôs to put another AC in the second bedroom‚Ä¶. But other than that everything was great a minute walk from the boardwalk and a minute walk from restaurants. And Shasha was very responsive and answer all my questions. Than you again I will definitely book again for my next time in Atlantic City
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A cozy stay and very accommodating!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"All I can say is the home felt like I was at home. The place was just like the picture. I was very impressed. What got me was the slippers at the door, the snacks, the two wine bottles, and the card for my birthday from the host ShaSha LLC. I felt very comfortable and the area was extremely close to the Tropicana hotel. I will definitely book again! Thank you sooo much ShaSha LLC for the best birthday experience at AC."

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my stay at Aquamarine in AC!! This place was great! Very clean, comfortable and relaxing. I have no complaints. Incredibly easy to find the entrance and it was right in the middle of all the entertainment! It's literally foot steps away from Tropicana so super convenient. Parking was available on the street, and I had no issues finding a spot. The host was lovely and very responsive. Next time I visit Atlantic City I will be booking here again!! Loved this place and I definitely recommend booking! You won't be disappointed."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This AIR BNB WAS IMMACULATE & UNDOUBTLY ONE OF THE BEST AIRBNB'S IN ATLANTIC CITY THAT I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. The apartment is VERY CLEAN and well taken care of and totally worth the price. If you are contemplating what Airbnb to choose in Atlantic City, I say look no further BOOK NOW . First off I was not expecting such a clean, quiet modern space for the price asked. Secondly, I could not have asked for a better host. Check in was very easy and the host communicated and made sure I was comfortable. I HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb
I was in town for a concert and needed a place to stay rather than stay at overpriced hotels and this Airbnb exceeded my expectations. The apartment had 2 bedrooms, with 3 comfortable beds. The d√©cor was modern , VERY CLEAN and COZY. The apartment had all the amenities that I could ask for, from freshly washed towels to bed linens to kitchen and bathroom essentials, you name it. The neighborhood is just like the quintessential Atlantic City neighborhood. The location was great as well, Its literally steps away from the Tropicana. We opted to use the parking at the Tropicana which was superrrrrrrrr convenient. If you‚Äôve visited Atlantic City before you know how AWESOME having this is because HERES A MAJOR HACK, if you hold onto your receipt when leaving the casino you won‚Äôt be charged another parking fee AND you can use the same receipt at different casinos as well.
All in all, I totally recommend this to anyone needing a place to crash, whether that is tourist, someone briefly visiting the neighborhood for an occasion, students or families like mine. Absolute 5-star accommodations and reasonably priced for single travelers and groups! ShaSha has changed my perspective of staying at airbnb‚Äôs and have set the bar high. The customer service exceeded my expectation and deserves way more than this great review. Thanks!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was extremely nice and updated, we booked it shortly after it was newly renovated and it did not disappoint. Above everything else the clean accommodations, location and great price was more than I could ask for The listing is also in a very nice area where it is also very easy to get to a variety of destinations as stores and entertainment are really close by. I come to Atlantic City frequently so I am happy to have found this Airbnb. The Tropicana hotel is super close . I had no problems with street parking, however when casino hopping I used the Tropicana parking facility and the ticket I received from them, which was great because parking was one less thing we had to worry about. We would definitely recommend this place and quite honestly book here again. The host was patient, friendly and very much accommodating. Also a great communicator with a fairly quick response time, big plus!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One block from the boardwalk!Centrally located in the action. One block from the boardwalk! Right across the street from the Tropicana casino. Easy access to restaurants. Clean, comfortable and accommodating. The host was quick to respond to any questions. We received a lovely gift basket upon our arrival.
There are some things to keep in mind. Although the unit is newly remodeled the building is older. There is public parking, free and paid, on the street, but can be hit or miss availability. There is always parking in the Tropicana parking garage which is right across the street."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I dont know where to start.. the views was amazing, the stay was clean, the place was secured, and right on the boardwalk! Atlantic palace was close to the ferris wheel, resorts & the hard rock casino. I would 100% stay again, the minute you walk in you‚Äôre stunned by the view. Although there‚Äôs two beds, I don‚Äôt think more than max 3 people should be staying here! 10/10
Recommend, id come back again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stayed two nights at this location and everything s okay, nothing to complain about. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for!"

Definitely recommend booking !"
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"At first I had some hesitation about staying outside of a hotel in AC because of AC‚Äôs reputation.
But I have to say this experience was great. The room is cleaner than many of the casino hotels I have stayed in. There is security at the front desk, the doors are locked after a certain hour so i was able to feel totally safe in this city.
My big thing was the bellhop service was amazing! Something that I use to have to walk with my luggage from the parking lot through the casino floors. Here they took our stuff to the room and out of the room and it was such a smooth process.
Also all the staff in the front were super friendly and always willing to help.
Will be staying here again on our next visit."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The condo was on the 17th floor. Beautiful view of the boardwalk and the ocean!
Picking up the key and the parking pass was easy & the instructions were clear. The condo was super clean, the beds were both absolutely very comfortable! The kitchen had everything you could need and the bathroom had a lovely jacuzzi tub.
We only wish we could have stayed longer!
My only complaint was that the AC unit was loud, just like it said in the listing. I woke up in the night to it rattling - and I discovered that the rattling was actually just the door to the controls. I stuck a tissue in door to prevent it from rattling and went back to sleep. It‚Äôs easily remedied if you get stuck hearing the rattle.
The stay was lovely, location can‚Äôt be beat. You can walk to the beach within steps.
We were pleased that the condo was quiet all night - no sounds of partying to disturb us! Overall great stay!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I am over the moon about this location! I went with my stepdaughter and her cousins (teenage girls). Check in was easy, hotel security was friendly and helpful and amenities are fantastic. The room is beyond perfect! We planned to cook breakfast sandwiches and lunch cold cuts to save money and they had literally everything we needed there to cook with; they‚Äôve thought of it all. Response time to questions was within minutes. The jacuzzi tub in room and the amazing view was really just the cherry on the sundae. We will absolutely be going back!! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,All was well. We came for a week-long getaway from Central PA. Pleasantly surprised that the Atlantic City Airshow was happening during our stay. We were cozy watching the jets perform from the window‚Äîa wonderful view of boardwalk action.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for the Tidalwave Festival. Location is as perfect as we didn‚Äôt have to travel the streets of Atlantic City because the resort had a boardwalk entrance. We were very close to our event and it made the trip even nicer. Wagner was always quick to respond if I had questions and was helpful in making us feel comfortable. Bed was hard so I was a little skeptical at first because I have a bad back but the bed ended up being perfect that I didn‚Äôt wake up with pain in the morning. Plenty of blankets for both beds. Kitchenette was perfect for our stay. I suggest taking advantage of the bell hop to take your stuff from the street to the condo and then calling at the end of the trip to take your stuff back down to the roundabout. Bell hop made check out so easy by holding the elevator when he came to pick our stuff up that we bypassed all the full elevators of people trying to get down to check out. Well worth the tip!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was great Already and the fourth time me and my wife are staying at Atl√¢ntic Palace

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! The view was outstanding and the hosts were very responsive. There is a food option located within the building so I never had to travel to get breakfast. The boardwalk and beach were right there. Honestly it was everything they promised. The only word of advice I can give to future guests is to write down your streaming service information to log in once you get there because you must provide your own..but hopefully you're not inside so much that you need to watch tv! Would def stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is really nice place !!! Very good location, clean, comfortable. I would definitely recommend to all of my family and friends."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spectacular view and convenient location. Host was responsive but there were just too many reminders, and the KeyCafe system did not register our key drop off. And we didn't realize we could use pool. Perhaps more info about restaurants, particularly for walkers!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This condo was a great space with a remarkable ocean view. Everything matched the photos and descriptions, all was well cleaned, and the beds were very comfy! The air conditioning wasn‚Äôt locked at a certain temperature like many beach rentals, so that was a huge plus!
The host provided very thorough and clear instructions and directions on everything, on multiple occasions, which was just extremely helpful and showed how much care they put into the experience.
While we were at the beach, the host let us know the cleaners finished our place a bit early and we were cleared to check in, which was great. I know it‚Äôs rare and unpredictable for peak season early check ins, but this showed the host was really on top of things!!
The gym was simple and small but clean and had just what I needed. The pool and pool area were fabulous.
The building and parking staff were very friendly and helpful, too."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this was the most perfect and peaceful place to have a getaway at. The view was amazing and the beach was literally 5 minutes away because we‚Äôre on the boardwalk. The place was super clean and the hosts were super responsive and clear with instructions. I will definitely be booking here again! I cant wait to go back, thank you for everything."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay was wonderful! The apartment has an equipped kitchen, bedroom with a super comfortable bed and bathroom with hot tub.

Host was always super responsive and friendly. Thanks for sharing via multiple channels (AirBnB messaging, emails, ‚Ä¶) - very personable and caring.
Advices for other guests- use InstaCart for groceries (eg water bottles, fresh fruits, instant noodles, snacks, ‚Ä¶) - CVS and ShopRite as sources (there isn‚Äôt AmazonFresh deliveries there), and UberEats to get food deliveries around the clock.
Parking- above level 3 in the deck, it was easy to get great parking spaces.
Thanks again, host! Loved our stay there."
2022-12-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Unsuccessful getting into the room. The card swipe did not work after several swipes. Went downstairs to security a few times for help. They advised they really aren‚Äôt supposed to help being that we aren‚Äôt hotel guest and are with Air BNB. He eventually said he‚Äôll reprogram our key himself. As we weren‚Äôt sure what to do and the host hadn‚Äôt responded back yet and we needed to be somewhere. After security reprogrammed our key we went back up still no success. The host responded back at this time and advised it is sometimes hard to unlock the door ‚Äútry to swipe the card and push the door hard and sometimes it takes a few swipes‚Äù. We tried no luck. At this point becoming very frustrated. We went back to security and he too now frustrated along with us came to room and had to fix.
The tub had a disgusting brown residue on the bottom. Was not able to wash in room.
Heat didn‚Äôt work, slept in hoodie while it was 30 degrees outside.
Overall a wasted trip"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The room is real people. I know the pictures & maybe the price seem too good to be true but it's real!
The building itself had a ton of fun things to do on the 3rd floor including an indoor outdoor pool, game room & spa! Wonderful experience & if you stay here buy some bubble bath & run the jets, you won't be disappointed! Only critique is give the room about 2 or 3 hours to cool down as it was a little hot when we first got there but it cooled down eventually."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"AMAZING STAY!!! We had a great stay and plan on staying soon, it is everything we thought it would be plus more!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay for a great value! Quiet building when compared to staying at a hotel like Tropicana which the party lives on all night. Great diner on the first floor and the palace is right on the boardwalk. The location is about 10-15 minute walk from hard rock casino and about 25 minute walk to Tropicana with a lot to do in-between. They have a spa if you like , room included a jet tub and views were spectacular. I recommend you take the hour tour through the ripleys believe it or not museum right next door, we went as a young couple but would be great for kids. The room was better than hotel rooms like the Tropicana which we had family staying at, there is simply just more to do at the quarter within the Tropicana which has 40+ stores to shop. Definitely will be back in the summer months to enjoy the ocean!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,easy check in and out!

Clear instructions, easy check in/out, and the hosts responded very quickly. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in the area."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Description was accurate, clean, and easy access to boardwalk. We went during a bad weather time so the view was not clear but overall was cozy and nice.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great Stay
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice room excellent view
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The view was beautiful, the bed was so comfortable and we felt safe at that location. The room was very clean (although it did smell like cigarette smoke) but still giving a 5 star rating because it was a great place to stay.
It was nice to walk right out to the boardwalk. The Hard Rock is close which was really convenient for us. We used the fitness room and got a great workout in. The parking garage was also a plus.
Our first morning we needed a toaster, salt & pepper and oil (which were on the list of amenities) to make brunch but they weren‚Äôt there. I contacted AC and he contacted his team. A lady brought the items up a short while later but by that time we were done eating.
Some helpful tips: There‚Äôs a jacuzzi tub which was definitely a plus. If you plan to use it to relax, pack bubble bath and a blow up neck pillow. The view from the bathroom is awesome.
If you‚Äôre a coffee drinker bring coffee and filters. They had instant coffee and a coffee maker but no coffee to brew.
Our key card stopped working and the gentleman I talked to was very friendly and helpful getting us a second key. We don‚Äôt know why it stopped working because we kept the key away from credit cards and cell phones. Triple check your placement of your room key."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,best place to book
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place, just what we needed for our little getaway weekend."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Atlantic Palace was amazing. The condo was clean, stylish, well-equipped, and in a great location.

Will be staying with Ac and Wagner again!"

We had an enjoyable stay. Book this place."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I only stayed overnight as I was just in town to shoot photography, but I had a great stay! The place is just as described.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful spot in an interesting location. Close to all casinos but far enough from the madness. Private gated entrance leads to an outdoor hallway, leads to the room. Really felt comfortable here, great coffee / tv, great shower. Found a 4K Fireplace channel on the tv. Would stay again"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great location! I loved the decor!! So well doneüíó! However, location is everything! The owner knew that when she picked this spot and she has a winner! The fact that she is right across the street from Kelsey‚Äôs Restaurant is perfect. Parking is is convenient due to the paid meters in the area! And almost 2 blocks from the boardwalk!! Otherwise we will refer this location to friends and family and use this spot again!!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We went to Atlantic City for a short 2 night trip and we were SO happy with this place! It was so clean and very cutely decorated.

If we come back, we would definitely stay here again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Anne's place was absolutely PERFECT for my stay in AC for the weekend. I was coming up for a music festival on the boardwalk and not only was it a 3 minute walk at most, I had the perfect parking spot every day. Not to mention it's next to a Mexican bakery and I was able to buy morning pastries for me and my friends. The space was comfortable, stylish, homey and the perfect place to crash after a long day on the beach. Would stay again!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Inside, this place is just amazing, exactly how it looks in the pics. Everything was extremely clean. Very helpful and proactive communication from Anne with recommendations when we needed. Provided Starbucks KCups for coffee, loved that!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at Anne‚Äôs place! Place was just as described. Clean, updated and SECURE. Also, walkway leading to property was well lit. Something I appreciate. Everything needed for a weekend getaway was supplied. Bed and pillows weren‚Äôt the most comfortable , but after staying in many hotels and now AirBnB‚Äôs, what beds are? Lol. Wanna great nights sleep, bring your own pillows. 1/2 block walk south to Kelsey‚Äôs and 1 1/2 block walk south to Boardwalk and casinos. Plenty of restaurants in the area.
However, if you go just north, atmosphere begins to change a bit. There are a few local undesirables roaming the streets late at night. Being from Philly, it was not an issue but may be an eye opener for others. Just a heads up.
All in all, great place to stay and when in AC again, I keep an eye out for Anne‚Äôs place!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,definitely on my next trip we try to stay on this place and 100% recommended.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great stay at this Airbnb! It was absolutely adorable inside. From the outside you would never know it was there. I felt right at home staying there. I went to the boardwalk a couple of times which was a very short distance. Lots of good places to eat all around. I did some walking around town, some parts looked sketchy but I never had an issue. I would definitely come back to this Airbnb if I found myself in Atlantic City again."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Me and my fianc√© booked this Airbnb for my birthday weekend getaway. This place was the most amazing Airbnb I‚Äôve been too. We had so much to do within walking distance. The newly remodeled bathroom had my heart. The host got back to me in a quickly manner. Also upon checkout at 11 we asked could we stay a little longer and the host allowed us to do so. This trip was amazing and the amenities as well. When we visit Atlantic City again we will definitely be staying at this location again. üôÇ

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just as described and perfect location for the Boardwalk. Will stay at Barbara's again in the future.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed here for two nights for a concert. The Airbnb was generally pretty nice - easy check in. There were a few stains on linens and bathroom floor mat had been left on the toilet seat when we first arrived, but not a big deal. Parking is a bit difficult to find, but overall the Airbnb was nice and convenient, right in the middle of town."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome stay definitely would stay again.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stay, responsive and helpful host"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay for a few nights if your visiting the area. Super close to the beach and board walk. Would come back again if I‚Äôm in the area!!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was perfect for a little getaway
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Good stay
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The stay was amazing! Thank you for everything Barbara.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Same as the pictures,smells good.clean and comfy place to stay.view of boardwalk from outside seating area.parking will be tricky at night if you are planning to be out but overall great stay!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean and comfy.
Felt safe.
Walkable, steps away from the boardwalk.
Would definitely book again!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect place to stay for our quick trip to AC!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment was spotless and in a great location, just a short walk to our show at the Hard Rock. Barbara was very helpful and thorough."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Barbara‚Äôs place was great! Excellent location. Literally a 30 sec walk to the boardwalk and super close to Caesar‚Äôs and the Tropicana. The apartment was so clean and smelled great upon arrival. Instructions were super clear. Would definitely book again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Place was amazing! Close to everything and the location was fine to me ! Would definitely stay again! The airbnb looked just like the pictures! There were snacks left in there which thank you!!!!!! But over all 10/10 would recommend
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This airbnb stay was one of the best experiences i‚Äôve had so far! Everything was as shown in the pictures. The host was very responsive and respectful as well. The room was very clean and comfortable. A little noise can be heard from the neighbors but overall, this is a great place to reside for a vacation to Atlantic City, NJ!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The apartment is small, but we expected a studio and it was well priced when all of the hotels were tons more. The location is very close to the beach, but sadly, Atlantic City is a little bit rundown, and this location is a part of that. Once you get inside of the apartment, everything is renovated and clean and new, with amenities we needed for our quick trip. Unfortunately, I did not feel safe walking where our place was at night alone. Owner was lovely, allowed us to check in early, and parking was not difficult. Will probably not stay there again, but more because of the neighborhood than anything wrong with the actual room/owner."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks Barbara I had a great time and relaxed with ease on my trip!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"came here with my boyfriend for a kid free weekend to Celebrate my 27th birthday!
it was cute and close to the casinos
nice porch with nice view
just perfect for the two of us
made me wanna plan a AC trip with the kids next year
uber around there was fast and great
thank you !"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Yes, appears bigger than the photos but room was extremely clean. We went to a show at Broadwalk Hall and it was literally next door. Beach and Broadwalk was steps away. No issues with neighborhood, if you've been to AC everything near Airbnb you see is what you see on the Broadwalk. I have no complaints and would stay again. It was affordable and private. I never felt unsafe and parked in the lot near the side of the house for $10 overnight and at 10am before check out a spot opened in front of the house and I parked without parking pass. The room had snacks which was another bonus."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This little apartment was perfect for a solo getaway! Updated, comfy, well-stocked, and impressively clean, this place was very well put together. Access to The Boardwalk is at the end of the street, and provided an easy walking route to several places for food, entertainment, and extras."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Ms Barbara was wonderful, very accommodating, responsive and kind. The place perfect for my husband and I. Less 5 mins walk to the boardwalk. We enjoyed every bit of our stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great option to the giant casino hotels in AC.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice apartment, very clean, and kept well. Checking in was so extremely easy and the apartment was exactly as shown in pictures. Beach was in such close walking distance it was amazing. Parking was difficult to find but we found a spot in stayed it. We met some nice people on our trip and would definitely go back again!! Barbara was extremely helpful and made our stay very easy."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thanks Barbara. We had a great time. Hopefully to you soon. Take care you and your family
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for a little getaway. Barbara was so friendly & responsive. We enjoyed our stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We booked this stay when our original plans were changed. We booked it last minute and Barbara responded right away. As others have stated the area seems a little sketchy but we never felt unsafe and it's so close to the beach. Parking was a little tricky but not impossible. We got there late and had to park in the tropicana garage overnight. During the day, if you get there early enough there's plenty of parking opportunities on the street during the week. Overall, an amazing stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great apartment for 2. Very clean and had perfect amount of room for all of your needs. Host was very nice. overall great place
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great! EXACTLY like the pictures clean and cozy . Unfortunately not in a good area at all. Barbra was great with communication and so great ! ‚ô•Ô∏è
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,the room itself was exactly how shown in pictures and very clean however surrounding area is very sketchy
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Barbara's place was great, as advertised, and saved me last minute after an in-person cancelation elsewhere."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay here. Upon arrival we had the easiest check in and even managed street parking the first try. The apartment was perfect for us two and was incredibly clean and comfortable. There were plenty of amenities and snacks provided for us by the owner. The location is perfect and just a minute walk from the beach. We spent a great amount of time on the boardwalk as it was almost next door to us. Parking on Bellevue Ave was less difficult than we anticipated but the forewarning from the owner helped us be prepared. Towards the night time parking becomes full and you‚Äôll likely have to pay for 12 hour parking at the lot next door, but it wasn‚Äôt hard to park in the morning when other residents leave for the day. We felt safe being next to the boardwalk, and at night we spotted some of the cats that wander the beach and boardwalk when it‚Äôs quiet, which was a treat. We had a great stay here and would return for our next trip!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I had an amazing time with my partner and we are definitely coming back! The place is just as described and the pictures don‚Äôt do enough justice. The location is just seconds away from the boardwalk and the beach. Me and my partner enjoyed our stay as it was small and intimate which we both loved. Thank you Barbara for helping us create lovely memories at your place. :)
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was Saturday night so options slim. Small place, parking hard but nicely appointed. I forgot parking pass and she let me overnight it back and was nice about it."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Barbara was very welcoming! Check in was flexible and she even let us check in early! Nice place right off the boardwalk.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This efficiency is literally steps from the board walk. The building is clean and quiet. The unit is clean and has everything you need for a weekend getaway. The neighborhood is not the best but no one bothers you.
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and nice inside. The downside is you can hear every squeak outside, one night we had loud neighbors who seemed to be fighting which made it uncomfortable. Host is very quick to respond which is great"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Barbara‚Äôs place was amazing. I went for a concert on the boardwalk. It was walking distance. The place was very clean. I would definitely stay there again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,such an amazing place to say! clean and a lot to do :)!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walking distance to literally everything ion Atlantic City. Walk fought to the beach, casinos and restaurants"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,First off i just want to say the apartment was VERY NICE AND VERY VERY CLEAN and it was very peaceful and Very comfortable the boardwalk was literally at the end of the block and the casino was less than a block away so i didn‚Äôt have to drive which was a plus the patio was very nice and it had chairs which is another plus but me and wife didn‚Äôt get a chance to sit out there cause of rain and we spent the whole evening into day at the casino lol and i want to thank barbara for all the complimentary items left in the apartment for us that was really nice/sweet & most importantly barbara is a AWESOME host fast response for each question that i‚Äôve asked and i will definitely book this apartment again! Thank you Barbara for giving us the opportunity to book this apartment! ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüòÅ
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I absolutely love it. The apartment was really cute. Well equipped and clean. I would definitely stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I loved it, I want to go back"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love it here
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect spot to stay in AC, especially if you are going to a show at Boardwalk Hall as it is only a few minutes away by foot via the boardwalk. Super clean and comfy efficiency stocked with everything you could need. Don't roll the dice on another place; book this one!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Located steps from the broad walk / casinos/shops/ restaurants. Very roomy and comfortable.
2023-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Barbara was extremely friendly and accommodating. The space was nicely furnished and close to Boardwalk Hall.
We had a great time!"
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara‚Äôs place was very nice inside even though it was a lot smaller than than the pictures made it seem and the neighbors we had upstairs were extremely loud and stomping up and down the steps all night and day and yelling, they kept the main door open until about 3-5 am which definitely made us nervous and the main door and our door had the same combination which also made us a bit nervous but overall this was a pretty good place to stay and it was very close to the main attractions on the boardwalk
She also left snacks and drinks along with bathroom products which were very nice to have with us on our stay and she provided great communication with the check in information and included a free parking pass for our trip:)"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The spot is well equipped for a smaller apt. Completely enjoyed my stay and would stay again! Had to spend the night for a work trip and it was perfect
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"great stay Barbara is quick with responding, the location can't get better, the studio is adorable, check in was a breeze"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"All the reviews are right! Barbara‚Äôs place is exactly as pictured. The most clean airbnb I‚Äôve ever been to. I felt so much more comfortable here than at a hotel. She had a few little snacks, bottles of water, extra blanket in drawer, an iron, blow dryer, soap, salt/pepper, tin foil, microwave, and so many little convenient things. We only were here over night to sleep, however it is the perfect spot for two people for any kind of AC trip. Steps from the boardwalk where the beach is, so perfect in the summer. Air conditioner worked nicely. Bed was so comfortable and so clean! Parking is the only issue but as long as you plan ahead, you can make it work. Would absolutely stay again!"
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This airbnb is aligned with the description. The bed is comfy and it's a minute to the boardwalk. As everyone else says no parking more than 3 hours so we parked at the Tropicana at a 5 minute walk (20$/24 hrs). Barbara is a fast communicator and very accommodating so we were very grateful for her kindness and support.
The negative to our stay was that we did bring ear plugs and in spite of that the downstairs neighbor had a couple's fight from 1-3 AM that made the walls shake and felt like we were in the crosshairs of their quarrel. Just noting this for transparency, we probably could've called in a noise violation, but really just wanted to go back to sleep."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean very well kept place and the host was very helpful and easy to reach a great stay that I would recommend to anyone staying in the area
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a great location and a great place to stay. Had everything we needed.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Super cute apartment, and we loved the location- boardwalk right there, casinos within walking distance. We really enjoyed the snacks and bottled water. Great weekend getaway for a couple!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Barbara‚Äôs apartment was perfect for our one night stay. Extremely clean and updated. In walking distance to every venue we visited. I appreciated Barbara‚Äôs quick replies to my messages as well. Great stay!
2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Overall a cute place to stay with quick access to boardwalk and beach. Barbara is great at communicating and left extra snacks and toiletries we appreciated.
Save yourself the drama / extra money and don‚Äôt park at the lots at the end of the road.
Also Uber has weird drop off and pickup point for this address just be aware for wait time charges"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Communication was perfect and the place was cozy. Whenever we had any questions or needed to update our reservation Barbara was quick to get back to us. Steps away from the boardwalk üíï
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly what she says on the description. However, it‚Äôs overpriced for the size. Location is perfect tho."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can't say enough good things about the host and this gem of a property! Even the smallest details and amenities are provided. The efficiency is so well appointed & no space is wasted. Steps from the boardwalk. Safe..secure. We parked & the trop, walked & used uber..be mindful esp late nights, you are in a city. Great cost for the location. Perfect for two people."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place near the boardwalk!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Barbara was AMAZING!!! Our other host canceled right before we got to the room so I texted Barbara and asked her how soon the room would be ready and she responded almost immediately and said that the room was already ready for us to go inside!! She provided us with snacks and drinks which were amazing and the guy (I think was the neighbor) that talked to us outside on the little patio was very nice and welcoming.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great rental apartment just a half block away from the boardwalk. Clean and tidy upon arrival, easy self-check in. Parking options are limited, may need to park a block or two away if parking overnight - can get pricey. Easy walking distance from restaurants, beach, casinos, and shopping."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Convenient location for the beach. Also a short drive to Ocean City which we spent some time there as well.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We needed a spot for a night in AC- super easy to check in and Barbara was very clear and helpful!
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location is very close to the beach ( 2 minute walk ). Very amazing for a couple to stay at looking for a beach getaway. Barbra has a porch where you can sit outside and relax! She also has a foot cleaner when you get back from the beach it‚Äôs very handy and brilliant. I love this beach house and I am going to book more in the future!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect place that fit our needs for a weekend get away. It had a cozy atmosphere and vibe from the start. I love the 2 rocking chair on the porch that of course we took advantage of during our time. Location, location, location just minutes from the beach and great restaurants on the Boardwalk. The studio was very clean and provide sufficient amenities."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Apt was super clean and convenient for access to beach.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fianc√© and I enjoyed our stay here during BRT weekend and the neighbors on the left are extremely nice. The main issue we ran into during our stay was the parking because the parking on the street was only for 3 hours not over night. DO NOT go to the parking lot that is on the airbnb street nearest the beach on the right, they will price gouge you and are not friendly. The best parking we could find was at Tropicana (it is a couple blocks away but a nice walk) for a flat rate of $15 for multiple nights(you dont recieve a ticket when you go into the self park garage but you have to pay everytime you leave the garage).Once we parked our car there, we did not move until we check out of the airbnb a couple of nights later."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Good!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Short walk to the boardwalk and very clean and neat. Host is communicative and thoughtful.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Barbara is an amazing host! She‚Äôs got everything you need up at the apartment and has really fine tuned everything about your stay to be easy and helpful
2022-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice little spot, direct access to boardwalk and beachfront is a 2 minute walk max. Excellent communication with host, beware it is an apartment, so if you want privacy, this may not be the Air BnB for you."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs a nice and clean room. I like how everything is easy and clear. It‚Äôs convenient. Basically got everything you need! And the host was detailed about the information too, like parking, door code, WIFI password. You are well taken care of!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As described
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara's description of her Air B&B was on point. She is conveniently located right next to the Atlantic City boardwalk and her efficiency was very clean, modern and comfortable. She stayed in contact with me and made my stay very welcoming. I would recommend her home to anyone who was traveling to this area."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great trip to AC and easy to book last minute. Check in was incredibly easy, she worked on check in and check out timings with us, answered messages quickly, and the stay was perfect. My fiance and I had perfect amount of space. The place was really clean and had plenty of storage. She even had extra blankets ready for us. Can't wait to book again!"

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was awesome and Barbara was an amazing host. It was so accessible to the boardwalk and the Tropicana. Parking is tough in AC but that did not get in our way because we had an awesome place to stay. So wonderful! We would definitely book again ü§ó

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Steps from the boardwalk! Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better location. Place was just as described and very clean. Appreciated the water and snacks! We had a blast in AC casino hopping and walking the boardwalk. Barbara was a very communicative host and even let us check in a little early, much appreciated. We parked at Tropicana self parking for $10 for the two nights and it was easy peasy! Thank you for a great stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,beautiful place. make sure u find parking
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is the absolutely perfect spot to stay if you want to walk to everything the boardwalk and beach have to offer. We walked to the lighthouse, casinos, restaurants and attractions. The apartment is immaculately presented and has everything you need for a weekend getaway. Barbara is a great host who makes everything super simple and comfortable. We had a fantastic time and hope to be back."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great weekend getaway at Barbara‚Äôs place. Found this apartment to be very clean, comfortable, and perfectly sized for one to two people. The communication was super easy and quick - the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful. Would absolutely recommend to stay here and would definitely come back! Thank you Barbara for providing us with all the information we needed.."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We really enjoyed our stay in this lovely apartment. It has been newly renovated and it is very clean. Barbara is a wonderful host.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My stay in Barbara‚Äôs place was great! It‚Äôs a homie unit, her communication was great, and she worked with me and my friend on our special request. Location can‚Äôt get better, I would happily stay here again!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great little place for 1-2 people. Use the boardwalk or an Uber to get where you need to go. Parking is rough so just leave your car at one of the garages while your in town.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Book this little gem right away...pefect for a couple...close 2 the beach....studio had everything you needed
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place is smaller than I anticipated. Neighborhood was pretty sketchy at night but it is truly right by the boardwalk. It was worth is being that the boardwalk was the goal of my stay. Check in is easy. Parking lot just feet away, however you do have to pay for it. I had a good stay overall."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was clean and cozy. The boardwalk was close by and near attractions.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place. Has a ton of hidden amenities that I needed. Just the right amount of space. Would stay here again.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great apartment and location very clean and barbara was a wonderful hostess parking is a little challenging but we asked the owner of the lot on the corner if we could stay overnight even though there was a limit and he let us park overnight for the 12 hour rate
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,thank you so much! It was a great üëç experience like the last time ...
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was my husbands first time competing in the Iron Man. This was the perfect location. It's within an 8 minute drive to where the race starts, and the finish line was just a few blocks away on the boardwalk. Great for me as the spectator to stop in to certain points to watch and then head back to the apt for a restroom break or to escape the heat. The studio space was exactly what we needed. For parking, we ended up parking our vehicle at the Tropicana outdoor parking lot. The one right before the hotel. It was $20 for 24hr period. Will be back again for sure! Thank you Barbara for hosting us!"
2021-09-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This place is so convenient! It‚Äôs a one stop shop, located right off the boardwalk. The place is so modern, comfortable, and clean! Barbara communicated with us well during our stay. Would consider staying with Barbara if we visited the AC area again!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I stayed for one night and it was great. The apt is on the second floor and a literal one minute walk from the boardwalk where there‚Äôs tons of things to do.
The room gets nice and cool at night with the fan and ac that she has in the room which is perfect.
She also had complementary snacks upon arrival.
I only chose three stars for the value due to the location. although it is a one minute walk from the beach , the actual street itself is a bit sketchy, dirty and homeless do walk around at night other than that. This was a great stay."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place. It was very clean, cozy and comfortable. Excellent location and accessibility to the beach and boardwalk. I definitely recommend this beautiful place."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Strong Recommendation!
Had an unexpected challenge upon arrival but hey, when in the Service Industry, the unexpected happens. The owners of the building/ unit handled the matter like true professionals so for me that makes all of the difference in the world.
If the opportunity afford to self I would stay here again!!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time staying at your apartment. The location was great and only a very short walk to the beach and boardwalk.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quick access to the beach
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place is perfect ‚Äî exactly as described! It‚Äôs an adorable little getaway just steps from the Atlantic City boardwalk. There are several parking lots nearby (within a few mins walk) if street parking is not available (street was closed off for an air show when we visited). The apartment is clean and modern and comfy: everything we wanted for an overnight getaway. Host was prompt in responding to questions. It was a great trip!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean place, modern decor and amenities - newly renovated. So slow to the beach! Barbara was kind and communicative. Just be aware the cell service is pretty rough (I have Verizon), but it‚Äôs like that in this area. Certainly not the hosts‚Äô fault!"

parking lot 50 ft away were we were able to park the whole weekend for 20.00 a day . We never moved our car it was so convenient. The apartment was spotless and we didn't eat there but you could cook a meal if you wanted to . The bed was so comfortable we slept like logs . I would definitely come and stay her again .

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great listing to stay at. The listing is located close to Tropicana casino on a side street that gives you access to the boardwalk.

2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really liked the access to the active areas, but it was still a very quite location. Very clean and Barbara was a great communicator."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I have yet to give five stars all across the board in every area- until now. The only thing more amazing than this perfect little apartment, was Barbara‚Äôs communication throughout it all. She provided so much information throughout the process, that I didn‚Äôt need to ask any questions. But when one did come up, she responded almost immediately. Her apt was incredibly clean and cozy, and the bed was super comfy. It had perfect modern touches to the decor and great amenities as well. It was absolutely perfect for a little overnight stay for my girlfriend and I- while hotels and other air bnb‚Äôs were charging anywhere from 2 to 3 times the amount of Barbara‚Äôs place. I couldn‚Äôt speak more highly of this experience."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs supper clean and tidy, would highly recommend it"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Barbara‚Äôs place is amazing and she truly went above and beyond my expectations.
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Ideal location and super nice place! Definitely recommend! Barbara was an amazing host and was very responsive when we had questions. Will definitely visit again!
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara‚Äôs place is great. It‚Äôs well designed and decorated with all the necessary amenities. We cooked tacos one night, and the conduction plate heated up just as fast as a typical stove. There is a cute little cast iron skillet which made cooking even more fun and yummy. The only bummer (which is outside the control of the property and Barbara) is that the beach has a large eye sore ‚Äî an awkward semi-abandoned pier. The boardwalk was also a little dirty with very few people wearing masks. Especially during these times, I would recommend sticking away from the boardwalk and staying at the beach. The beach was not crowded and had plenty of space for social distancing. Overall, our experience was great, and we would return. Thanks again, Barbara!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing cozy, stylish, clean, great response time .. great host !!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The efficiency apartment is perfect for a couple seeking a convenient location for going to the beach!

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really nice location, right near the beach. the Apartment is nice, enough room, we had everything we need and inmaculate clean! Check in/check out were quick. Barbara was an excellent host and extremelly helpful, we came early and she let us check in 1 hr and a half earlier, we parked at the end of the street (Parking Pass Provided) a minute walk. We highly recommend!!
Thank you so much for everything.."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great getaway. The place was super clean and Barbara was always super quick to respond with all of our needs.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Barbara exceeded our expectations! We stayed in the studio overnight and it was perfect! The thought and attention to detail were appreciated. When you stay here you‚Äôll know what I mean.
She is not lying when she says parking can be a challenge, we parked in the lot at the end of the block which is a minute walk. We were not surprised by the area or parking citation because it is clearly mentioned in the listing.
I appreciated that she was quick to message back as well as touching base before, during, and after our stay. All of her directions and descriptions are clear and to the point. I would recommend Barbara‚Äôs place to anyone and we will definitely stay here again because our first experience left a lasting impression!"
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and cozy place. Right off of the boardwalk and beach so there‚Äôs always something to do. Would come back again and highly recommend!
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"All in all, I‚Äôd give it a 7.5/10. I assumed the studio was a bit bigger because of the pictures provided, however it served its purpose effectively.
I was not thrilled with the neighborhood as at night tons of homeless people congregate on the same block as the studio. However, they did not interfere with my trip at all, just stating it because if you‚Äôre a female or solo traveler you should know that.
Half a block from the boardwalk, so very convenient location in that regard.
Parking is stressful so plan ahead to park at the lot or use the parking pass provided but not moving your vehicle for the duration of the trip.
I probably won‚Äôt stay there again if it‚Äôs for more than a few days (weekend type thing) but for short stays I‚Äôd recommend it."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Immaculately clean and stylish efficiency. Cold a/c, comfortable bedding, and light blocking drapes helped us sleep well. Exactly as described. We found parking on the next street over and it was free, thanks to the included parking pass. Best value we could find in the area. Thanks!"

2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Barbara was amazing in her quick responses to communication and made special accommodations for our needs. Cleaners did a really great job making the space sparkling for us! We felt safe in that space and the efficiency was clearly well thought out in terms of making the most of the space. 10/10 would recommend!
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The place was lovely, and Barbara's communication was top notch. There are countless thoughtful touches and features in the room. I would stay again in a heartbeat."
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Barbara was such a great Genuine host, she continued to accommodate us and make our visit extraordinary! At the end of our trip, our car was unable to start and she tried her best to help out. A very kind person with a huge effort in pleasing her guests before and after. The place was clean, Right next to the beach. Everything was convenient and a great stay. 10/10"

We will be staying here again!"
2020-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is cute and cozy!!! The beach and boardwalk is a few steps away! It was super clean and Barbra is a great host. For the price this place exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be returning!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The courtyard met are expectations. Our room was clean and bed was comfortable. The air conditioner worked well the location was great. easy walk to the ocean casino. We felt safe walking to the ocean but on our return back to room we took a taxi. The place was even better than what we were expecting. would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great value for the location. One block away from the boardwalk and all of the fun things on the shore.
Car park could be a little more organized as it is only valet parking. Suggestion: Since you have to pick up your car from the back, there should be an attendant back there instead of having to walk to the front and then walk to the back. Small inconvenience.
Everything else was great though. Go to Perry's dinner on the next corner for breakfast! Absolutely delish!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great stay! at a hotel
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Really liked the place.
All the desirable places and restaurants near by"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Honestly, I wasnt quite sure what the experience was going to be given that we were going to Atlantic City. I will say upon arrival the space is very clean and inviting. The front desk staff is very friendly and attentive. Our stay was quiet pleasant and comfortable. The walk to the boardwalk and casinos is incredibly easy! This is the way to go when visiting Atlantic City. More affordable and comfortable than the casinos. Would stay here again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! It was quiet and clean. I would stay here again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice room for the price
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was GREAT and everything worked great. All white linen was clean and fresh. The staff was very polite. I will be beck. Oh and and it's just a block from the beach.
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This was my first time booking a hotel, + a name-brand hotel at that, via airbnb. It's actually the Courtyard by Marriott and you are a regular guest like any other. It was by far the most affordable on the whole strip and the area. Only 3 quiet blocks from the boardwalk and Resorts and some cool new restos and bars a bit off the strip. They even let me check in at 3pm, not 4pm. Very nice hotel. Great lobby. 24-hr gym but it's kind of small and hot so I didnt use it. No resort fee or pool. Front desk is very nice. Would like free breakfast but no one does that in AC. Area is generally safe, but some shady characters around, and that's just AC. (Someone pooped a block away so I noticed the aftermath of that on my way to the beach.) If you stay on the boardwalk, you really pay for it -- and lots of resort fees and no early check-in, late check out. Which I took advantage of. Also the even numbers-side faces the small streets and Bally's, Trop. Odd side faces Hard Rock, Ocean."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,great
2024-06-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"It‚Äôs okay. The hotel is definitely a little rough around the edges. They didn‚Äôt include any basic amenities, like shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower. We only had one small bar soap to wash hands with. Also, the iron did not work at all, and the ironing table was stuck open. The beds and pillows were fine, average for a hotel. The front desk was not willing to break a larger bill for me, and didn‚Äôt give any advice on where I could (their restaurant, local gas station, etc). Check-In also took some time, as there were ‚Äútwo‚Äù people checking people in (completely fine) except one of them was just standing on their phone, not wanting to check anyone in until the other coworker finally asked them to help with the line. Overall the hotel was relatively clean, just rough on the edges with limited amenities and mediocre customer service. If I had to do this process over, I probably would look elsewhere to book a room."
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Great place! Hope to stay again soon
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great stay nice place very clean!

2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very relaxing
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,You have to pay to park in a spot that doesn‚Äôt feel any more ‚Äòsafe‚Äô than parking on the side street. It was off season when we visited but it was not a space I felt I could walk alone. The boardwalk was fairly close but we decided to park closer.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent

2024-02-01,2.0,Stayed one night,"Parking lot was very hard to locate even with employees directions, room was decent but had a weird smell kinda like old clothes, we checked out the same night because of the odor. Room could use renovations and repairs"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A peaceful stay at a clean hotel. Not far from the board walk or the casinos but away from the hustle and bustle.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place stayed twice
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Had a great stay. We went to see a show at the Hard Rock casino and this location was only a 5 minute walk away and a MUCH more affordable alternative, since the show sent room prices sky high. Super convenient! And it was right between the show venue and our restaurant right down the strip. Parking was a breeze and I'm grateful bc parking was definitely an issue everywhere else on the strip. The room was clean, comfortable and generally as described. The best part of this experience was the customer service. My questions through the airbnb app were answered extremely promptly and completely (Jason) and in-person, I found April to be welcoming, helpful and accommodating. Overall a great experience. Happy to give my thumbs up."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We couldn‚Äôt have had a better location walking distance 1 block from Boardwalk , casinos, food etc. The parking was convenient and reasonable. We only moved our car once!
The staff was super nice, helpful and informative if needed . Our room was just as pictured on the Internet, and we were really impressed about the cleanliness !!!
We look forward to our next visit at the Marriott Courtyard Airbnb !

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Worth the money paid. It's a great place to stay during vacations... Would love to visit again
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This hotel is located in a city. So for people that are looking for a quiet suburban feel ; this is not the place for you. However, it was the place for me. It's literally 1 block from the boardwalk/ beach. The hotel room matched the pics from Airbnb. My 2 issues were :the room was right next door to the fire exit and you couldn't control the thermostat temperature. It wouldn't let me set it past 74 degrees . Yet, the room temperature always stated it was 74¬∞. I was cold at nite. The hot water was ok but not as hot as at the Hyatt.
There is a $50 a day hold on your card even if you book thru Airbnb, but they will take it off. there will be a hold on the parking fee but they will take that off as well. parking is currently $20 a day and the lot is behind the hotel down a narrow alley . the staff was üëçüèø!!!
All in all this is probably one of the best deal you're going to find that close to the beach that's decent. so I would stay again and book thru Airbnb again to get the best rate."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for hosting us! A great place to stay in the area where everything was pretty close in walking distance. The room was very clean and neat. I would stay here again when I visit Atlantic City soon!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,The try to charge a deposit of 150 every single night even though I paid 50/night deposit at check in‚Ä¶. Then after check out they tried to change me 86 then another 140‚Ä¶. Very shady‚Ä¶. Also they have a female security guard that‚Äôs very rude and makes you uncomfortable. She kept trying to figure out which room I was in and if I was really a quest and that made me feel uncomfortable because why do you not think I‚Äôm a guest?‚Ä¶. Their bistro is a joke. Very unprofessional and terrible food and coffee. Very very unprofessional‚Ä¶.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Quick check in & check out! Clean rooms and a 5 minute Uber drive to all the good casinos. We got back a little late at night and ate our Uber eats at the table in the lobby and it was very clean!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The bed was super comfy especially with the comforter and sheets. The coffee machine was easy to utilize in the room with coffee and tea and they have all the snacks and drinks you could want in the lobby which is lovely place to sit and enjoy. They also have a restaurant and bar in house which is a great plus.
The hosts were very pleasant and patient with me and other guests and made the stay an A+ experience.
I really enjoyed my stay here and will come back again when I'm in the area.
Thank You. ü´Ç"

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The neighbourhood was good as there was a Hard rock cafe just 2 block away.
But disappointed with service , they should atleast keep the first 3 water bottle per room, the charge of water bottle was very high.
The room was clean , but the matteress if you check below the cushions were some dust and hair."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing stay. Beds are super comfortable. No complaints.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Place was nice, easy to locate & staff was kind.
I was not so sure the linens were changed prior to our arrival. When I pulled down blankets sheets were wrinkled as though they had been slept in, both beds. I didn‚Äôt see any folds in the sheets and they were not pristine. Blanket looked very nice."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was a great place to stay in Atlantic City. I think it was about one of the best places.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Not my first time staying here and I must say they are very consistent! I love it here

2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Like most hotels in AC, there was a $50 security deposit that I didn‚Äôt see mentioned in the posting. We didn‚Äôt get the deposit back and I‚Äôm unsure why. The stay ended up being more expensive than anticipated with the extra $50. Otherwise it was a nice, standard hotel with basic amenities."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful time with my wife in this hotel and all were so kind and friendly. I'll be back next time. Thank you

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with courtyard. Jason was super nice, sweet, and very friendly and responsive. You can't beat the price for this room. Incidental hold is $150 for those who are curious but they take the $20 fee for parking out of the incidentals which helped us save a little bit. The area on the boardwalk was beautiful and the room was clean. We had a great view of the city and the beach and got local recommendations from the front desk. Overall, we will gladly come back and book with Jason again. Highly highly recommend. Thank you so much Jason for a wonderful stay!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Good hotel in a great location

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hotel location is walking distance from the Hard Rock Hotel in AC and the boardwalk. The entrance to the parking lot was a bit difficult to find at first, but the hotel receptionist gave us good instructions with how to get in. My recommendation is for the hotel to place bigger signs for the parking , they were really small. The hotel room itself was good , and you can connect your streaming channels such as Netflix or Amazon prime to the TV which I loved . Overall was a good stay! Would book again ."
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Atlantic City could be iffy, but this location was perfect for us and walkable to Hard Rock, a biggie for us this trip. FOREIGNER was playing:)
We were greeted by two polite staff, and were able to be checked in a few hours early!
Beautiful room, with very cozy beds.
Super clean and great hot water.
Very quiet surroundings.
Like one reviewer mentioned, bring your own creamer (unless you like powdered)!
We already talked about staying again!"

I felt safe and at peace even when it was past midnight. Sam was very nice and welcoming! There is very limited parking in the area, however, if you have the parking pass, you should be able to find a spot around the block, if not on the street. I honestly would like to stay here again if I come back to Atlantic City! It definitely was a great first experience!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great place to stay on short notice. will be staying again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Samuel has a nice honey comb hideout as I will say haha but it‚Äôs a nice place private entrance like your own home not too far out the way Walgreens on the corner and convenient stores will definitely stay again for sure and not to mention he‚Äôs very responsive and accommodating to your needs he‚Äôs alright in my book although we didn‚Äôt get to meet in person but I can feel his energy will definitely recommend anybody to stay there and the casinos are walking distance too
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"super convenient and comfortable stay at samuel's rather than a casino, which didn't appeal to us."

Ten outta ten would definitely stay there again.
Thanks Sam!!!"
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"The space matches the photos and description. Good location, including a washer and dryer, which we appreciated. With a car, you can comfortably park on the street.

You can walk or take a cheap Uber to all locals shops and restaurants. I think Lyft charged me $12 to borgata from the apartment. You can walk to Tropicana, ocean hotel or any others in vicinity. There's a Walgreens 800 feet away. Great location. Worth every penny. 3 air conditioners in the apartment. One in each room. Awesome spot."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for two nights for a girl's beach weekend and it was great! Everything we needed in a beach condo including being walking distance from beach, boardwalk, and Tropicana. Sam was very responsive and provided lots of great recommendations on what to do and where to eat around the area. He was even able to offer us a late check out which we thoroughly appreciated because the weather was not great on check in day so we were able to squeeze in a little more time at the beach! Overall an awesome stay! Thanks Sam!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"samuel's place has what is necessary, it is a clean and comfortable place and with privacy. The beach is 2 blocks away, many restaurants,pharmacy. I liked it. I felt at home. Samuel was attentive to everything the whole time."

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our second time staying at Sam‚Äôs place and we couldn‚Äôt be happier. Sam is arguably the best host I‚Äôve ever had!

Sam sent us some of the local restaurants and things to do that was near, that was very helpful. We would love to stay again next year and hopefully the weather will be on our side. Shout out to Sam for everything!!!"
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Sam was very friendly and welcoming
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sam‚Äôs place was absolutely perfect! I will probably stay there every time I‚Äôm in the area. I know that parts of Atlantic City can seem unsafe but not this area. I felt safe and cozy! Sam gave us lots of recommendations which we used, one being, delicious pizza from Geno‚Äôs :) Last but certainly not least, my dog did some damage to the couch. Sam was SO understanding and kind about the situation which I am very grateful for.
Great host, great Air BnB, 5 stars!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great experience. Very clean place. Sam communicated well and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was pleasant. Highly recommend!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This place worked out great for us having a tournament at the convention center. Location was great and the neighborhood was quiet. (Have stayed in the hotels before and really wanted something different) The communication with Samuel was great and made everything very easy. Would love to stay again for the next tournament.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay and the host was very helpful throughout my stay.

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed for only one night but had a great time. The house was very clean, had strong wifi, and a responsive host - what more can you ask for! Samuel was particularly awesome for allowing us the check out late. The location is less than a 5 min walk to the boardwalk. Would recommend."
2022-10-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for the stay!
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I went into AC for a wedding and decided to stay at an Air bnb since the check in was at 2 pm, vs 4pm. Sam has great communication. He let us know before hand we could possibly check in early (which we were able to) and let us know what to expect etc. He left detailed instructions about everything .
The apartment was very clean. We only stayed one night, but would have been a comfortable stay for long periods of time since there is a washer/dryer and a small kitchen.
The apartment was close to a the tanger outlets and about 10 minutes from Bally‚Äôs and Caesars, and the boardwalk. Very convenient‚Ä¶
Sam is also a very passionate plant person, which is awesome in my book!
The only con was the parking. If you come home late expect to park and possibly walk a block. It‚Äôs a quiet street, and was unsure about walking at night but it seemed safe. Just make sure you read street signs, use your parking pass and your car will be ok. The other option is park, check in and then Uber to your destination (parking at the casinos are $10-$25 anyways)."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay. Everything in the air bnb was ready and prepared!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was great while staying with Samuel my wife our puppy and I were really happy with the place was very clean easy to ge there and great location close to everything we would definitely be coming back and staying there!
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fantastic location, room and host ! ! ! The location is central and easy walking distance to the boardwalk. The place itself is spotless and very inviting. Sam, our host was extremely patient, friendly and answered all my questions and communicative before and during our stay. I would highly recommend Sam‚Äôs place and even consider coming back next time I‚Äôm in the Atlantic City area."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little street level apartment that is close to beaches and boardwalk. It had everything we needed and Samuel was great with communication.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I along with another couple were in town spending one night to go see a comedy show. After looking at what felt like every hotel in Atlantic City, and realizing that we weren't going to find something within our budget for the night, I decided to give Airbnb a try. This was my first time booking a room with an Airbnb. I found Sam and Serj's apartment listed and it looked like the perfect fit for our short stay. So after booking through the app, Sam reached out to me and was so welcoming and this put my skeptical mind at ease. This whole experience was terrific!!! From start to finish. The apartment was beautiful. Great location to the beach, casinos, outlets, etc. Sam and Serj made the check-in and check-out effortless. And also provided a list of restaurants and things to do during our stay. All 4 of us were so impressed and loved everything about this experience including the ease and hospitality. I one thousand percent recommend booking with them. My husband and I were talking about booking Sam and Serj's apartment again and staying longer next time we come to AC. Thanks again for a wonderful experience!!!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks for a great stay.

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We always love our stay with Sam and his wife. They never fail to go above and beyond. We have been coming back to stay with them for over 3 years now and will continue.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and cozy quarters, with almost everything you could possibly need, with the exception of a toaster. Samuel was great at communication, and let us park in front of his driveway when there was no other alternatives, in order for us to feel safe, as we were two women traveling alone in a somewhat challenging neighborhood (parallel parking is a must, but free with the permit he lets you borrow). Nice area in the back to sit with all his beautiful plants. Directions and recommendations were clearly marked. Samuel let us have our privacy, and didn't bother us once."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, well-equipped apartment with plenty of room for four adults. The space was better than described and shown in pictures. Within blocks of the beach, restaurants and shopping, it is a very convenient location. Host was very communicative and helpful!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sam was very helpful, providing us with suggestions for places to eat in the area and responding quickly to any questions or requests. The apartment was clean and comfortable, providing a pleasant base for our exploration of A.C., Ventnor City, & Margate City."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was perfect for Julia and me. The beds were comfortable - she left to use the other one when I snored too loud - and the amenities were appreciated, even if we didn‚Äôt get to use them (like the beach chairs). It was a quick walk to the Boardwalk and restaurants like the Salvadoran restaurant we checked out. The wildlife habitat was an interesting surprise and much more than a place for my dog to relieve himself. Not all properties we‚Äôve looked at had cable TV so that amenity was especially appreciated.
We wished we had more time to spend and will consider staying at the home when planning future trips to Atlantic City."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Sam is amazing host everything thing was well thought. Clean home, location and parking permit provided by Sam made our stay pleasant."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Can‚Äôt knock the hospitality from Samuel or from the fact you‚Äôre walking distance to the beach, but I found the location itself to be a little underwhelming. Samuel kept a very clean unit, but the street itself had two couches on the sidewalk that looked like they were actively being used, a smashed flat screen TV on the sidewalk, a significant amount of broken glass that we had to carry our dog over, and overall just a lot of trash/debris in the street/sidewalks. I don‚Äôt say this to be nit-picky, but I think it‚Äôs an important expectation for other guests to have prior to arrival. We arrived earlier in the afternoon and were able to find a parking spot right in front, and it was convenient to have a parking pass provided by the host.
Aside from that, we thought that everything in the unit was nice and being able to do laundry and use the provided beach chairs was a perk."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location. Very clean and quiet. Sam was very helpful, offered suggestions for food and entertainment, and was very accommodating."
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We stayed one night at Sam's apartment. We were on a road trip from Washington to New York with a stopover in Atlantic City. The apartment is located on the ground floor, within walking distance of the Boardwalk, but still at some distance from the ""center"" of the Boardwalk. Nice that all amenities are available. Very clean apartment. Fortunately, there is AC available because without it can be quite hot. The AC does make some noise, which along with the street noise can be annoying for some. Parking in front of the door with Sam's parking pass is ideal!"
2022-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Samuel was super communicative and helpful.
The apartment met all our needs for this stay."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Samuel was very acomadating. We enjoyed our stay.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was so clean & cozy. The neighborhood is pretty rough, as in I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be outside after dark, but inside it felt just like home. Comfy beds, and they made sure that their guests had anything they need."

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Samuels Place Was Everything I Needed. I Booked A Stay At His House For My Very First ACFW Show And I Decided To Come A Day Early Just To Make Sure I Wasn‚Äôt Rushing. As Soon As I Arrived He Was Very Helpful He Even Made Room For Me To Park My Car Which I Thought Was Very Helpful. He Suggested Places To Eat (Especially Since I Came Late And Wanted A Burrito) And Even Let Me Know About The Fireworks. Overall I Had A Peaceful Experience, Which Was What I Had Booked For. 10/10"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Samuel has a very cute and comfortable place. The parking is a little dicey but he was very helpful and we were able to get a spot. His place is within walking distance of the beach and outlet mall.

The apartment is exactly as depicted in photos (they do live upstairs but you'd never know they were above you) nice space, clean, conveniently located to Beach/ Boardwalk (legit 3 blocks away). Sam helped with everything from directions, suggestions for dinning an entertainment an any other questions in reference to A.C. that we had. Parking right out front of Apt.

Samuel was within a text reach and answered any questions we had.
We cant wait to rent again real soon.
Tropucana is a 5 block walk and it's safe to walk late at night. I did it at 230 in the morning.
Entrance way is lit by sensor lights as you approach the apt at night."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What absolutely perfect place to stay when visiting AC! Samuel went out of his way to make sure that we felt comfortable and welcome. He was there to greet us upon arrival and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. He's a wonderful communicator and responded to any inquiries almost instantly! The apt is super comfy and the memory foam mattress was the perfect ending to each day. If this place is available when are searching for somewhere to stay, look no futher than Samuel's place and I promise you wont regret it."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,They were very nice & they answered right away. I love the location of the house because it's close to the casinos. The house was very clean and neat. Only thing is the parking. There was no where to park but other then that it is a great place to stay. Would definitely stay here again. üòä
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We truly appreciate Sam‚Äôs hospitality we felt just like family! It‚Äôs not often you get that welcoming on Airbnb!!! The house was perfectly described!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sam is great, so understanding, helpful and communicates flawlessly. The location is convenient to enjoy the casino/shopping scene but it's away from it as well.

visiting my aunt and decorating the place for my girlfriend and friends since it was her bday! not only did he say i will let you know but he let me check in a few hours early at 11! Sam checked on me and gave so many suggestions as to where to eat at etc and btw the two ice cold mugs in the freezer were an amazing touch!

2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This was a great stay if looking for a quiet stay off the mainstay of AC but close enough for a walk to the boardwalk.

I would highly recommend a stay here when visiting AC!

2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sam‚Äôs place is clean and just blocks from the boardwalk and beach! We loved using the beach chairs and walking to the beach.

Sam is full of great recommendations and checked to make sure we had everything throughout the weekend. Would stay here again!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Sam was a great host for our little family vacation. The space was clean, well-maintained, and close to the boardwalk/beach.

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at Samuel's place so much! The attention to detail in the apt was commendable, every time we needed something, it was there & it was so neat, tidy and clean, plenty of outlets & nightlights in all the rooms & 2 locks on the doors, locks & blinds on all the windows, it felt very safe. We enjoyed complete privacy while also receiving regular messages from our host, just checking on us and making sure we had what we needed, kindly and unobtrusively. When we first arrived he messaged us that he had arranged overnight parking in a neighbors driveway for us in case we couldn't find street parking close enough! We had no trouble parking on the street close by within the range of the permit he provided. On our last night in AC it rained heavily, Sam messaged us with movie theater suggestions and how to instruct food delivery if we stayed in. It was just a really nice experience! The only thing to know is that the ceilings are low, the beds are full size, spring mattresses & this is not a party pad, the hosts do live above and request that noise is kept to a minimum, (which was fine by us). I had only ever stayed at casino hotels in AC before this and I'm so glad we were unable to book a hotel room and ended up at Sam's place!"
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The airbnb was just as described and Samuel was a great host with plenty of recommendations on what to do while we stayed there. I definitely recommend staying here if you plan on going to Atlantic City.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 Highly recommend!!
My boyfriend and I came to AC for a weekend trip and we couldn‚Äôt have been more satisfied with booking Sam‚Äôs place! Sam was very communicative before our trip and made himself available even during our stay by giving us some suggestions of things to do. Checking in and out was completely simple and hassle free. The space was impeccably clean and orderly and had all the essentials you may need. It is so conveniently located close to the boardwalk and beach. Sam was such a warm and welcoming host and we are looking forward to staying here again!"

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"For anyone looking at Air BnB‚Äôs in the Atlantic City area, I would strongly recommend staying at Samuels place. Samuel is an amazing host in every sense of the manor. He is a thorough communicator and extremely accommodating. He keeps his place extremely clean and takes pride in its cleanliness. Samuel goes above and beyond to make sure he is meeting his guests expectations. He communicates with you throughout the weekend giving you suggestions for places to eat and things to do in town. He is readily available at almost all times of the day to answer any questions or accommodate any requests you might have. The place was advertised accurately and we can not express in words accurately enough how clean his place is. Sams place is located in a great location just 2.5 blocks from the beach and isn‚Äôt far from the center of town. I was extremely happy with my stay and would recommend Sams place to anyone looking to stay in Atlantic City for a weekend. I will definitely be re-visiting in the near future."

,,,"My sisters and I met in Atlantic City in December 2023 to attend a concert and selected this Air BNB because it had two bedrooms and 3 beds and looked nice. However, when we arrived, we were extremely disappointed. First, we were not comfortable with the neighborhood and did not feel safe. The building is an old, large apartment complex with many units. The outside was covered in scaffolding and the inside was dark, outdated, and in need of maintenance. We had trouble accessing our unit at check-in and sent a message to the host, also asking where to park. The host did not respond and was not available to answer our questions. Inside there was an overpowering scent from numerous electric air fresheners (one sister has asthma), disappointing ""plastic covered"" mattresses, subpar appt. Despite having paid for two nights, we unanimously chose not to stay in the unit and paid for two hotel rooms instead. I asked for the cleaning fee back. She refused. We will not be back."
,,,"The fact it was no parking, roaches, noisey windows screens not the right size for windows disturbing the sleeping all night!, smelled like smoke in the Whole building!
Stop trying to scam people too!
You lied and said items were taken out of you apartment which is false!
I provided ALL my things for myself! I used 2 bandaid and peroxide you lied and they were stolen! I had my own spray you lied and said it was stolen! I had literally brought my own kitchen items! And left things behind to help you with you mediocre kitchen supplies and you lied and said I still a wine cup I literally had paper cups, plates, utensils, paper towels, pots pans and a air fryer! Never used or removed any of your stay and if I did it‚Äôs still there! Stop trying to lie! And the fact it smelled like Cigarettes in the whole building in a little bit in the and apartment, and you have roaches humble yourself!"
,,,Go somewhere else not like the pics
,,,"I went there to check in I was asked to provide a card I don't use cards only digital ones
I was told my kind wasnt welcomed there and they kept my money
