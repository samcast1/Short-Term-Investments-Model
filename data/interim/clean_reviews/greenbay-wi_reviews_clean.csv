2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a cute place !!!! Perfect for the weekend! Went with my spouse and parents to a friends wedding . Close to plenty of shops and food . Private . Games so fun! Very family friendly! Area was nice quiet and safe . Pictures match . Loved every bit of it ! Cute bunnies every where!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The location of this home was perfect! The neighborhood was quiet with a large park down the block. We don’t have little ones but the park had lots of room to play and a splash pad for the summer months. Convenient to be minutes from downtown GB and Lambeau Field. The games in the basement are such a fun touch and the fireplace outside was great to hang around. As described, this home is smaller but still more spacious and private than a hotel room (with 4 people) and for the week we stayed, much more cost effective! Also, Tracy was wonderful as a host and quick to respond—we wouldn’t hesitate to book with her again."

Tracy was always available and answered instantly when we reached. The address is lite up so you can see the house number anytime of day. safety lock for a safe feeling knowing the always locked behind us, super ease of access as the renter. The game room in the basement was super fun with multiple games including our favorite of all the games light up airhockey table! We are one well rested family. With two more appointments planned in Appleton in the coming months we plan to rent this home again. One happy family!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The little house did not disappoint! We were in town to watch my oldest son play hockey. The hockey team stays at a different hotel from the family so I opted for this cute Airbnb so our toddlers wouldn’t be cooped up in a hotel room.
The kids loved the arcade area in basement. We made meals and watched movies. Slept in with the black out curtains. Visited the children’s museum one day just a short drive away. Comfortable Home away from home. Will definitely stay at one of Tracy’s places again when in the area!

We didn't use the arcade games, etc, as much as I thought we would, but it was nice to have those things there. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house. quiet neighborhood. thanks Tracy!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at Tracy's home in Green Bay was an amazing experience. My dad, a huge Packers fan, got to see his first game at Lambeau (a 20 min walk from the house) and coming home to Tracy's house was great. Great recommendations for nearby food, everything you need in the kitchen, including Keurig OR standard drip coffee options. The downstairs game room was a lot of fun. Great spot to spend down time. There are convenience/liquor stores no more than a 15 min walk away, and plenty of delivery options as well. If I were ever in GB again with a small group, I would definitely try booking this again. Tracy also went above-and-beyond in securing a portable chess set that we could play outside.
Thanks again for everything Tracy!"

There were also 2 washers and dryers available for our use. Tracy provided us with ideas of things to do in the area and great restaurant options. Check in and check out were easy and efficient. We highly recommend staying at one of her places. She is amazing and if we are in the area again, we will definitely choose her! She is awesome!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The little house was just what we wanted for our trip to GB and to explore Door County. Husband and kids loved the game room downstairs. A/C worked great when it was 90 degrees outside. Laundry in basement means I don’t come home with loads of laundry to do. Tracy was very quick to respond to our questions and friendly too. Everything in the house was clean, updated and nice. We hope to return soon"

This place was so cute and comfortable, you can tell she takes pride in her houses and make them as comfortable as possible. Her communication it took no time for her to respond to anything and she would check up on us to make sure we needed anything or if we were OK I have stayed at many Airbnb‘s and this is by far the best one. Thank you Tracy for such a great stay and we will be back"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Close to Lambeau Field, this location has everything you need for a trip to Green Bay. It is described as little, but it also packs a big punch.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Tracy from the beginning was amazing and very accommodating when we surprised our parents with this trip! She gave us amazing instructions and was on the spot if we needed something. Her house was sooo cute and a perfect home away from home when we came for the game. We were right next to Lombardi avenue and there is an amazing grocery store just blocks away! Mason brothers! We would love to stay here again! Thanks Tracy!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Tracy is a very proactive host who made sure everything was set as soon as I booked (and she even offered tips on hosting when I'd mentioned I hope to do the same). I arrived at the tail end of once-in-years blizzard, and Tracy made sure things were cleared on time and that everything was in working order. The home itself is exactly as described. I'll be honest: I didn't read about the amenities too carefully, so my kids and I were happily surprised to find air hockey and foosball in the basement, and I was grateful for a well-equipped kitchen. The neighborhood is cozy, and just a few blocks away is the last Red Owl grocery store out of what had been over 400 stores! Of course, the stadium is just a mile away, and the mall is not much farther. Overall, the ""Little House"" is a great place to spend with a couple of kids, and I wouldn't hesitate to rebook."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was perfect for what we needed. We could walk to the Packer game and the massage chair was very nice. Tracy was a great host and communicated well.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice location and gives you everything you need.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy's house came as advertised, and exceeded expectations! My friend and I traveled to Green Bay to experience an authentic game day, Lambeau experience! Tracy's house more than helped us fulfill that experience. The house was perfectly situated in a quiet neighborhood within a pleasant walking distance to the stadium and provided a great 'home base' for us for the weekend.
Tracy was extremely easy to coordinate with, making the check in/out process simple and seamless. The beds were extremely comfortable and allowed us to rest up and expend maximum energy watching the game!
As an avid football fan, I've always heard that you should attend a game in Green Bay. I can now attest to that sentiment, and can also say, stay at Tracy's house if you're looking for the true Lambeau neighborhood experience. Even though my beloved Patriots lost, I couldn't have asked for a better experience or a better place to stay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our family of 3, and the air hockey table was a kid favorite. There is a park right down the road, and the hosts are wonderful.

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a great, well-located house, and the host is very responsive and communicative. It is a small home, but perfect for two or three people to stay for a few days. It has all the comforts of home. Definitely better than a hotel (unless you absolutely must have room service).

It has a really nice park right by and you would easily be able to walk to the stadium. Beds were comfy, plenty of choices for watching television if it's raining.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is AMAZING.
Getting there, the location at first was a little odd when you arrive being it’s at dead end and there is signs that say “no motor vehicles.”(But, it’s just because the driveway is next to the right , it’s the trail to Pamperin park, this beautiful place you need to go wander around, and If you have kids, they would LOVE the playground. ) But the whole place was perfectly clean, cozy, and you could park in the garage! They had a fire pit and chairs, even firewood! A big, beautiful serene back yard and they have a charcoal grill (didn’t use it but was a great option) They had the kitchen perfectly stocked with whatever it was you needed to cook a full meal with, I honestly didn’t eat out one day in the 3 days there for one meal because it truly was a perfect kitchen! And the main bedroom had an extremely comfy bed and also a huge plus, a washer/dryer and I actually did a few loads which was great! I honestly would love to stay here again! 10/10 stars!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jody was very accommodating and communicated well! The house was adorable and perfect for our day trip to Titletown and Bay Beach. The room set ups were nice as it was two adults and two children (5&6). Already looking to stay again.
Most air B&Bs make you do a ridiculous amount of cleaning (strip beds, wash dishes, take out garage, etc.) and it was refreshing to only have to worry about dishes and towels before heading it."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family stayed at Jody’s cozy home over the weekend and were able to enjoy some kid- friendly activities in Green Bay. The home is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood, but yet it’s SO close to everything. Love the new, modern kitchen and bathroom !! Jody recommended a Mexico Lindo and Gallaghers for Italian and we ate dinner at both…. So good!! We were able to use the home’s well equipped kitchen to make breakfast and lunch there. Woodmans and meijer are minutes away. If you have kids, make sure to take a short walk to the new Pamperin playground! It’s super cool. I would recommend this airbnb to anyone I know ! Thank you again :)"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot to call home base for exploring Green Bay :) The pictures were 100% spot on and the place was spotless. We didn't use the back yard but it looked like there was a bonfire pit - maybe next time. Great location and close proximity to good restaurants and shopping. Love the area, I could see coming back in the winter to watch the snowfall from the front window. We saw a few deer and turkeys during our stay, they'd literally walk right across the front yard! Great stay and thanks for the hospitality."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Jody’s place was clean and stylish with all you need for a comfortable stay. We immediately took a walk in Pamperin park which is adjacent to the cottage.

We went to the Green Bay Packer game (which is only 10 mins away) and Jody offered to give us a ride and show us the hot spots of Green Bay! Jody’s home is beautiful, and clean. The Kitchen is stocked with pots pans and cooking utensils also spices! We had a blast!! Thank you for everything!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wedding at the Thornberry golf course and this location was amazing and full of thoughtful amenities from the hosts. Quietly tucked away and an absolute go to recommendation for this area!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a great place! Perfect for a quick trip!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice place! One of the nicest I’ve stayed at. It has a walking/biking path right out the front door too which was really cool. Hosts well are very responsive to questions and welcoming.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place near a big public park. She sent me the info with all the details and had helpful notes on our stay.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a wedding. This house was absolutely wonderful. Everything was clean and so organized. I loved the style of decorating. We'll be back.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably one of the best Airbnb’s I have stayed at. Extremely clean, newly renovated European style. The owners were super great to deal with as well! Well worth the stay!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very cute place to stay, nicely updated and clean. The walk to the park is safe and quick along the trail that goes under the freeway right from the house. Would highly recommend!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was GREAT!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was absolutely lovely! It was so much cuter than I could have expected. This was actually my first time using Airbnb, so not going to lie, I was a little nervous! The trip was a birthday treat for my boyfriend so we could see a concert. I thought it would be fun to have a nice weekend away from being a big city.
The tiny house was modern and very clean! I wasn't expecting it to be so well stocked with kitchen stuff and bathroom stuff. Even little things like an umbrella being there in case it rained was just lovely to see around.
Having a bonfire pit is always a nice touch to me, but it was extra helpful that Jody had some things to help us start the fire along with wood.
Not only did I appreciate the interior of the home, but I wanted to shout of the exterior too! Sure, it is cute, but also having that bright yellow door really helped with finding the place! lol.
Luckily, I had no issues and was in no need to contact Jody, but between the airbnb message system and by providing her phone number she also made it very comfortable to contact her should something come up- which I highly appreciated.
Thanks again so much for the stay. If we ever find ourselves in Green Bay again, I know where to go."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is as stated. Beautiful, quaint and perfect for a small group. Beautiful location, scenery and wonderful walking paths close by."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing level of detail for making us feel welcome. Fresh flowers! Glassware in the freezer for cold drinks, bottled water, amazing spice selection - too many things to list!

Nice, quiet spot in a cute neighborhood."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"House is exactly as described/ pictured - really well laid out, clean, and well-furnished. Our family of 4 had a great stay - enjoyed the backyard and proximity to park. The beds and linens were really nice and comfortable. Would definitely stay again!"

2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home! Very clean and the owners were great!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cute little house right by the park! It was perfect for 4 people. The house feels luxurious - there are lots of special touches and you can tell a lot of care went into the design :)
2021-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jody’s Pampering Cottage was perfectly located, being easy to get to ... but also somewhat secluded and private. The house is beautiful, the beds are comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place is great! Jody is a fantastic host and helped us so much! Everything is so comfy and clean, it’s the perfect home away from home. Our stay definitely exceeded all of our expectations!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The tiny house is a beautiful place to stay! I highly recommend staying here, whether it's for a short or extended time. It has everything you need, and the location is perfect. I took advantage of Pamperin Park trails, the local amenities, and cooking my meals instead of eating out all the time. During my three-month stay, I would call it my second home and look forward to my next extended stay in Green Bay and Jody's hospitality."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,This was the cutest little house. I really settled right in and enjoyed my time there. I will definitely stay again if I'm ever in town.
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my first AirBnb experience. I didn’t know what to expect at all but Jody and her husband made this experience great. They were able to help me with every question and request I had. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend their service to anyone. Great hosts!!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The accommodations were perfectly clean. The kitchen was well-stocked and easy to use. Everything was decorated in a modern and chic way. A very cozy stay in a quiet, tiny house."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,What a cute and cozy place to unwind after work- a home away from home indeed! The hosts have really equipped the house to provide convenience and ease :)
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A perfect smaller home with all of the amenities that you will need! The home was super clean (which was a big factor in us choosing) and there were no doubts that the owner took thought into what an make for an enjoyable stay. The location is close to the highway making for easy travel throughout the area. Factor in the large private backyard and firepit along with all of the modern updates - it makes this home a no-brainer! Especially when you will get more bang for your buck here compared to a hotel!
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a great little home extremely close to Pamperin Park. Jody was wonderful and able to accommodate a late request which really helped my family. I highly recommend staying here.

Jody is a great host she communicated very quickly and I highly recommended this beautiful Green Bay Gem."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Jody's! It's just like the pictures - comfortable, clean, plenty of space for our family of 3 to relax, cook meals, watch movies, etc. We also loved the proximity to the bike trail and park nearby. Jody made sure to let us know about a local outdoor event going on where we could still practice social distancing, so that was an added bonus!"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We fell in love with this little house and the yard was to die for! Plenty of outdoor private space! Great privacy and everything you need right at the house. Everything clean and stylish.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,I hate to give a good review because it may not be available when we want to go back. However I do have to give it 5 stars. It has everything. We would go back. Awesome place private and still close to everything. Jody was always available and responsive. Would recommend it but not when I need it. Lol
2020-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Ehren and Jody were absolutely great. They went way above and beyond to help us out after a freak accident with my vehicle and boat being struck by lightening, so much so that they salvaged our trip. Ehren and Jody are very attentive and have a great little cottage I’d recommend to anyone. Great place, even better hosts!"

She left us two bikes so that we could ride down to the park near the home. She even lent us passes to the quarry beach. The house is in a great location and we would definitely book a stay here again in the future."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time here. Jody left two kayaks and two bicycles for us to use and this was all we needed for a great weekend. The house is basically on a creek and right next door to a park. We also used the fire pit and grill. It is near a highway, just as an fyi if you're looking to be more removed from cars. We really enjoyed staying here and hope to be able to return!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very helpful, quick responses, very clean , this the 1st time I went to an air bnb and they had groceries in the refrigerator hygiene products and hair products lol I loved how peaceful it was also thank you 😊"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place
2020-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,The place was wonderful and so were Jody and Ehrin. The house was very nice and the short walk to a nearby park was a real added bonus. Highly recommended.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The tiny house in the park was fantastic. Very clean and stylish with everything you needed. It’s in a great location with easy access to Downtown Green Bay. The hosts were awesome and made sure we had everything needed. We will definitely stay there again.
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage house has been updated & the amenities are numerous. Spacious kitchen and the beds are very comfortable. The attached garage is a great perk.
Neighborhood is very quiet. Perfect location to stay if attending a Packers game, as it's a short 10 min. Uber ride to Lambeau.
The entire house was very clean."

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The best place for a stay in Green Bay. Our family enjoyed our weekend at Jody’s place when we came up for a Packers game. Everything was super clean, comfortable, and convenient. The beds were comfortable, and having a full kitchen was a great convenience. We picked up some food at the grocery store down the street and were able to cook for ourselves, rather than eat out for every meal. The bathroom was spotless, and the whole house was recently updated. The garage was perfect to park in with the snow. We absolutely will stay again if in the Green Bay area. So close to everything. Thank you, Jody!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"First off, Jody and her husband were both very helpful and super friendly!
Location was perfect. Quiet and right by a beautiful park.
Clean. Spacious. Was bummed I didnt get to use the fire pit outside but will definitely use it next time!
If you like to cook like myself, you have pretty much everything you need to play chef, even spices!
Will definitely come back."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was fantastic and perfect for our group of 4. It was only minutes from Lambeau, offers walks in the park right outside the door with no driving required, and was in a quiet location. The updates were done perfectly, in a modern style, maximizing the use of the space. Every update was very nicely done. I would definitely recommend staying here for a group of 4 or less, and I would love to stay here again next time we're in town."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay in Green Bay! Convenient to Lambeau Field. In a lovely and quiet setting. Bonus of a garage! A small cottage, but the space is beautifully designed with everything one would need. Very clean, well organized, comfortable and cozy. Highly recommended!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A bit smaller than expected but totally my fault. Loved everything about the place, didn’t care for the living room part as much since it was so tiny."

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay and fantastic hosts. Easy to communicate with and they were both super helpful with our needs. The house is very clean and super cute + cozy. It’s also close to a great park right next to the house if you need some fresh air! Thank you Jody and Ehren!

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you are looking for a great stay in the Green Bay area, look no further. Just choose to stay here. The cottage in the park is perfect in every way. It was sparkling clean and the hosts thought of everything. It's a completely updated and cozy space. We had our two teenage girls with us and the space was perfect for the four of us. The park it is located near is beautiful and we enjoyed our walks on the path. We will definitely stay here again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the best Airbnb I have stayed in. Extremely clean, newly renovated, and comfy beds! It has everything we needed - and more! We were less than 10 mins to Lambeau Field for the Packers game, but in a quiet neighborhood backing onto a park. When we return to Green Bay, we will come back here!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, Loved it!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Jody was a fabulous host. I rarely give 5 stars, however this was perfect."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jody's house! The home was beautifully decorated, very clean and the kitchen had all the amenities needed to make our stay comfortable. Jody was wonderful about communicating and check-in was a breeze! Would definitely stay again!"

Absolutely love the space and all of the amenities. The location and its proximity to Lambeau Field was perfect. One of the cleanest Air BnBs I’ve ever stayed in!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Thanks Jody!"
2019-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Such a great fit for a weekend away! Tastefully updated with a large backyard and firepit, the cottage had all we needed for some much needed time away. In less than 90 minutes, you can travel to the top of Door County and spend the day hitting up the little downtown shops, wineries and state parks.
The house itself is nicely decorated, the bed was comfortable and all rooms were squeaky clean. Streaming services and WiFi were available but we didn’t use them. I would recommend this rental to couples and small families without hesitation."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Hosts are amazing, house is amazing, everything about this location is great would definitely recommend and will be renting in the future again!"
2019-07-01,5,Stayed about a week,Super cute little house. Quiet location. Loved it
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a truly fabulous Airbnb Jody has provided. She and her husband Ehren have created the most stylish, perfect place. We hated to leave.
The house is right next to an old park entrance. We explored the area daily; saw a wide variety of wildlife. Their deck is lovely and we often ate breakfast out there. They have thought of everything. Nothing is lacking. On top of their special touches, everything is shiny new. The home is beautifully remodeled. An extra perk was indoor parking in the attached garage!! The house is close to everything. We enjoyed exploring Green Bay, nearby towns and the bay. Ehren and Jody gave us many great tips on places to dine or visit. Mostly, we just loved this haven they’ve created. They are extremely kind and helpful. We’d love to visit again. Thank you two for everything!!!!"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was clean, organized and stylish. We appreciated the extra touches with flowers and the ready to use fire pit. Jody was very fast to respond to texts and she was flexible and helpful with check in and check out. The code lock for the front door was convenient and the home had what we needed stocked. I loved the robes, extra cozy blankets, and plenty of towels. The beds were comfortable. It would have worked better for a family with 1-2 kiddos instead of 3 professionals (one slept on the pull out in the living room) but it worked. One bathroom for three professionals also wasn't ideal since the bedrooms were so close together but would probably would be good for a family. The shower was small for our taller staff. I assumed it would be closer to something walking distance or near downtown (I am not familiar with the area) so we were a little surprised about being 10-15 minutes from places we needed to go. We learned a lot =) Overall we loved the house and experience. We need a slightly bigger space for our group but this would be wonderful for a fam,
Best,
Marina"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is a gem! It is a special well appointed house with special hospitality touches. All high end appliances and touches that make you feel like you are in a 5 star hotel. Our hosts were attentive and helpful with ideas of things to see and do around town. I would highly recommend this stay. When back in the area we will come back!
2019-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Perfect location and is close to pretty much any place in green
Bay"
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A modern getaway!!! It feels like a home away from home if your looking to book this amazing little home I highly recommended it
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jody's place is an amazing little cottage that is so beautiful and well thought out inside. Kitchen is amazing and wonderful to cook in. Bed is very comfortable and garage is nice to park inside . This by far the most comfortable and wonderful air bnb I have experienced. Hosts are wonderful and communication was quick and polite.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent home and Travis went above and beyond!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family had a great weekend in Green Bay. The attention to detail was fantastic from overall style of the house to the little extras like local beer and fire wood ready to go.
Thank for a great time that made us feel at home."

2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Perfect location for our visit to Lambeau Field. Clean, comfortable and inviting decor. Kitchen is stocked with all the essentials you might need. If the weather had cooperated, I would totally have made use of the backyard! Lots of thoughtful details. Thank you!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was probably the nicest Air B and B I've been to. Not only was the house super clean and homey, but everything feels very thoughtful - local beer in the fridge, a super easy check-in and friendly, helpful communication. I would highly recommend this place! Also, it ended up being in the perfect location, just a few blocks away from a friend's house, which made the stay so perfect. Would love to come and stay again for longer."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,Everything was great.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location and Travis was great at communicating with me prior to our stay. Would definitely stay again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Travis made out stay super easy and enjoyable! He has a nice house einna nice location. He had the things we needed in n his house for our stay. I would highly recommend his place and him as a host! We had to stay extra days and he made it super easy.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great Place! Host was amazing!!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I took my sister up to Green Bay to visit the neighborhood, as she is planning to attend the university in the fall. We were able to stay in Travis’s place, and we felt right at home! It is a rather nervous time for my family, as she is the youngest, so being able to feel not only welcomed but comfortable was immensely important to us.
Travis provided an elaborate packet with all of the information we could need. His communication was timely and compassionate, which I appreciated greatly.
We would love to stay again! Maybe in the summer when we can use the corn hole set he has in the yard, and walk around town a bit more freely!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for a weekend volleyball tournament. The house was exactly what we needed in our downtime. Travis was a great host. The house was immaculate and cozy. We would definitely stay again when we are in town next.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay was top notch! Travis was responsive and very helpful. The house was extremely clean and inviting. We were with guest, all of us agreed we'd thy to book this home again on our next stay in the Green Bay area!!
Thank you Travis!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first stay at an AirB&B, which Travis made very easy and positive. He was always friendly and helpful. His welcoming home is a charming mix of retro and modern, which I found especially inspiring! And it smelled so nice! We had everything we needed, with plenty of space to relax. The beds were comfortable and we had plenty of clean pillows and linens. I would definitely recommend. Thank you, Travis, for a memorable stay!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The place was great! Close to local attractions we were taking the kids to yet far enough away from the noise to get a peaceful nights sleep. House was clean, cozy, and comfortable. After a busy day it was nice to come back and relax together with the kids and watch a movie on Disney+ before bed. Travis was very responsive upon our arrival and stay. We would definitely stay again."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Travis’s place was more than exceptional and was the perfect spot for me and my family. The place was really comfortable for the 4 of us and Travis is a delightful host. We were in town for the Packers game and Travis’s place was in the perfect location for us. It’s close enough to easily walk to Lambeau yet far enough to not be disturbed by the packer fans celebrating the win afterwards. This was our first time to be in Green Bay and it’s now going to be a tradition. We’ll definitely stay here again.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't have enough adjectives to fully describe how great this was. Travis was very helpful and accommodating. The house was very clean and neat, comfortable and easy to find. Highly highly reccomend!!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, great location, comfy beds!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was, hand down, the most beautiful and most accommodating AirBnB that I have ever booked. Travis was a great host with a beautiful home and, in my opinion, a very great deal with all of the amenities and accommodations that were provided (and so close to Lambeau)! Being able to grab a cup of coffee in the morning and take a walk around Lambeau Field was a dream come true and something I wish I could do every single day. It's a great quiet location but just walking distance from everything you need in Green Bay! This will absolutely be my first check when another Green Bay trip comes across our plate! I can't say enough great things about this place and, specifically, Travis as he was such a great and responsive host who made everything so simple. Absolutely recommend anyone to book this as soon as possible to not miss out on this great house! Go Pack Go!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great space for attending a Packers game! Walking distance to the stadium, but tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. A very comfortable, clean space with attention to even the smallest details! Travis was great to work with. Very responsive and provided a thorough welcome packet with lots of information as far as local recommendations, the accommodations, etc."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis’ house was absolutely perfect! I’ve stayed in numerous air b&b homes and this house was the gold standard. Everything was spotless and the host was very attentive to any possible needs- extra toiletries, fresh flowers, local chocolates left on our pillows and local craft beer left in the frig for us. Although weather and time were not conducive to outside lounging, the back yard was lovely with a cozy patio and furniture.
Contact info and clear instructions for checkout was prominently displayed in the kitchen. I would highly recommend this home."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Travis and his wife keep a beautiful home in the heart of Green Bay. It’s as close as a “Four Seasons” resort that one can come by in the state of Wisconsin!
We will be returning and recommending this home to our friends and family.
Excellent work Travis!
Bob and Family"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We will definitely keep Travis's place as our number one Green Bay stay option!

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Walking into the house felt like I was walking into a interior design photo. It was very neat and clean with cozy usable space. We rented for the weekend to enjoy a Packer game. So easy to walk to Lambeau from the house. The Green Bay area was nice with lots of friendly people and a great game-day vibe all weekend. Travis was always responsive to questions and so easy to work with. Highly recommend!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stayed for a Packers game and the location was excellent. Quick walk to the stadium and the neighborhood was quiet at night. The place was very clean and stylish and cozy! Super well stocked kitchen and luxurious beds.
Travis was very nice and responsive!
Highly recommend"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I can't say enough great things about Travis' house. Everything was as described and more! We came into town from Texas for the Packers game and his house was the best location at the best price. Lambeau field is viewable from his front porch! The house was spotless and we had absolutely everything we needed to rarely leave the house except for a tour and the game. It had snowed a bunch and his house was super cozy and warm despite the temp being in the teens. We hung around, slept in in the most comfortable bed and had fun watching games on TV and playing cards at his kitchen table. Check out could not have been easier, either. Thank you, Travis! We will definitely be back for another game in the future and hope to stay again."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing location, close to both downtown and the stadium. House was clean and spacious, check in was smooth and Travis couldn’t have been more accommodating. Highly recommend staying here."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful AirBnb! Located in a quiet neighborhood with a lovely park across the street. There is also a market a short drive away . The home is fully equipped and Travis has thought of any extras you might forget when traveling , as well as coffee and creamer. The backyard is beautiful with a nice area to sit outside for dinner and a cup of coffee in the morning .
In addition, it is an easy walk to Lambeau and Titletown. Highly recommend this Airbnb if traveling to Green Bay."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Travis’s place was perfect. Close enough to walk to Lambeau, but still in a quiet neighborhood. We would definitely come back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place,close to stadium (definitely walking distance ). Very clean and very nice fenced in backyard with a grill to use. Great place to stay !"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Travis's place is great. We had a good time during our stay at Green Bay.
2022-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Description of house & location spot on! We would stay again. We have rented houses for years instead of staying in a hotel this was our first time renting a home that someone actually lives in and “moves out” for renters. It was kinda odd at first but Travis keeps everything so clean and welcoming you wouldn’t even know. Just thought it would be good to share so others are aware. Again we would stay again. Thank you Travis!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Travis’s home is a perfect place to stay if you are heading to Lambeau for a game! You can actually see the top of stadium from the front yard, and the 10 minute walk to get there is very easy. The home was clean and updated and Travis kindly included a bunch of travel size items in the bathroom for our use. It was great for our trip to Green Bay, and would definitely recommend to anyone heading to a Packers game."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and two young adult daughters travelled to Green Bay on December 24 - 26, 2021, to attend a Packer Game. We felt very lucky to find this gem! Travis was very easy to work with from start to finish. He was super responsive - prompt, informative and cheerful in his communications. The check-in and check-out instructions were a breeze. Travis also provided basic household information/instructions which made our stay very comfortable and stress-free.
We found the home to be just as described. We were impressed by the cleanliness, accuracy of the website description/photos, and the thoughtful details found throughout the home (additional toiletries, fluffy towels, comfy bedding, etc.). The kitchen was well stocked and included a Keurig, various cooking utensils and pots/pans – which was perfect since we ate our meals “in”. There was ample room for the four of us to linger around the table or hang out in the living room.
The house was perfectly located – a 15-minute walk to the stadium – and in a quiet neighborhood which was so relaxing after attending the game. We wholeheartedly recommend this home and its gracious owner, Travis!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The place was perfect!!! 15 min walk to Lambeau? Literally can't get a better location for a packer game. We had a small group, and were so thankful to find a small home nearby to host us.
Favorite perks: ✨ Beds were SO warm and comfy! Couch also comfortable to sleep on. TV ready with streaming services. The coffee available in the morning (and drinks in the fridge!) was the icing on the cake. Was super impressed Travis provided travel-sized bathroom items--things you'd probably forget or easily run out of on your trip. Definitely saved us a trip to a store. There's a nice patio area and yard in the back with a grill!
Travis was a great host! The place was so clean and so nice--the easiest and best Airbnb stay I've had! Will definitely be looking to stay here next visit. Thank you so much!!! 😊"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home in a great neighborhood. Would recommend, especially for football fans to have NFL Sunday ticket or at least the ability to watch football games at the house. That was our only bit of feedback... The house was very well kept and we felt right at home. Comfortable and nice! We would recommend to others for sure!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cottage is exactly why I prefer to book with people vs rental companies. They have put a loving and beautiful touch on each space within the house. This quaint cottage is adorable and I felt right at home.
Patience has gone above and beyond to make sure that you won’t need for anything. Fully stocked kitchen, bathroom amenities and anything I wanted for was there.
The neighborhood is quiet and I felt completely safe while still only being a short drive from downtown.
I hope to stay here again in the future, it is one of my new favs!"

The lower bunk bed is full size, with the upper being a twin. The shower has a double shower head, with a detachable handle with hose that is long enough for younger kids. The addition of the baby equipment is nice, and there's some folding outdoor chairs in the corner if you want to sit out on the patio. The appliances are pretty new, and all work very well.

They had a blast down there which gave us time to relax upstairs. The bedrooms were well appointed and the kitchen was well stocked with everything needed for cooking. The neighborhood was quiet and a short walk to Lambeau and Titletown. It was a great experience that we will never forget.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Everything was as Marcy advertised. Marcy was extremely kind and responsive to every detail. The house was extremely clean, the kitchen was very well stocked, every detail was thought through in the house from light switches being labeled to comfy blankets to snuggle up in. The game room was exceptional and provided hours on entertainment. The location was extremely walkable to area attractions. We will definitely book with Marcy again when in the Green Bay Area. Excellent experience."
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,The house was great and served our needs well. Kids and parents really enjoyed the game room!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house has it all! The kids had a great time in the arcade, and some of the adults too! Instructions were great! Kitchen stocked to make you feel at home. The beds are very comfortable too. Close to Lambeau and Title Town."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Marcy’s place was amazing for our Valentine’s Day weekend away with our 2 dogs! Marcy was very responsive and answered any questions we had within minutes. The house was spotless and the bed was super comfortable. The location was perfect- we were close to both the stadium and the casino. The fenced in backyard was very convenient for letting the dogs out. We will definitely be back!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Game room super fun!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is amazing. Marcy has decorated it beautifully and it was so clean. The location was amazing. Marcy is such a great host, available and so accommodating, even when asked to help some young volleyball ladies beat the blizzard and check in early so they could play this past weekend. I highly recommend choosing this house when traveling to Green Bay. Why risk a bad experience… this HOUSE and HOST is a WiNNER!
AND… how bout those Packers! GO PACK GO"
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Very nice place to stay and in a very convenient location
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful home to spend a little NYE getaway at. So many activities provided to keep all ages entertained. The area is so nice and quiet while also being so close to restaurants, stores, etc. Definitely keeping this place saved in my Favorites."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"Nice little house. Great location. Everything you needed. Marcy was a great host, available 24/7."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,We had loads of fun in the basement rec room. Great place for family members of all ages to gather!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Really cool place! Super comfortable beds/rooms, warm cozy environment. Downstairs game room was an absolute hit with our kids! Something for everyone. Very cental location, everything is within a few minutes. 10/10 would recommend. We looked a lot a ton of houses and so glad we picked this one! Marcy was very responsive and friendly. Huge backyard, will have to come back when it's warmer out to get to enjoy it!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location in general but even better if your going to a packers game. House was clean and super nice. It snowed while we visited and they had the walks and driveway cleared for us. Game room is awesome! Hopefully will be back next year.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Highy reccomend!!! Friendy and response hosts. Clean house with modern updates. Close to Lambeau, events and restaurants. The finished basement with SO MANY games for the kids eas the icing on the cake!! Definitely saving as a favorite for our next visit."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This house was so cute and felt so cozy! Marcy did a great job of telling us exactly what was needed for check in AND check out! It was so fun to play the fun games in the basement, a good reminder that we are still kids and can have some fun! So peaceful!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very short walk to Lambeau field stadium and surrounding restaurants. The house is Packers themed, and has a great family hangout game room across the entire basement. Feels like a great staging place for all Packers related. Everything is new, and the house seems very recently renovated. The host couldn’t be any more responsive or helpful. Internet connectivity is excellent."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a great time staying here! The host was also great!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"OMG - we were blown away from the moment we walked in - something for everyone - you walk in to a lovely lounge room - you could tell it was loved and cozy - the bedrooms were big enough for our family to feel space (not easy with three growing boys) - and of course the downstairs games room which the young and young at heart all had a blast in.
Marcy was on the ball the whole time - always accommodating, answering every question, making lots of recommendations - ""How can we make your stay perfect"" was the phrase that stuck with me - believe me this is one to make sure you book for those special family getaway weekends or travels - we loved it"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved the location! It was super easy to walk to Lambeau for the game and also to enjoy some of the bars/restaurants near the stadium. The host communicated quickly whenever we had questions. While I am giving this 5 stars, the largest downside to the house is that it is very old and that there is a smell that bothered a few of us. We were there for a few nights and could even smell it on our clothes when we got home."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Marcy’s place was ververy beautiful inside and out very clean and lots to do felt at home ❤️
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stay with our 2 grandsons. There is something for everyone to do. Plenty of space. Easy to walk or drive wherever we want to go. It feels like our home away from home.

Plenty of space for the kids to play and have relaxing time when they wanted to take a break from games. The beds and pillows were very cozy. Definitely recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Had wonderful 3 days at Marcy's ""Green Bay Packer"" themed home. Everything was perfect! She thought of everything that one would need for a pleasant stay, especially for families. The grand kids LOVED the games in the basement AND their own private""cheese"" room. They thought you fixed it up just for them! My husband and I, daughter and son in law enjoyed the extremely comfortable beds! TV's ??!!!, my goodness, in every room!!! What a luxury. Unfortunately did not make it to the outside for that bonfire. Next time. Let me tell you, it was a pleasure to be able to walk from Lambeau to your home instead of sitting in that traffic, or be in a loud small hotel room! Thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your lovely appointed Air B and B. GO PACK GO!!!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome place, awesome host. Plenty to do for all ages. Kept our 11 month old, 2 year old and our 10 year old more than entertained. Not to mention all the fun we had ourselves!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was literally our home away from home!
This is a Packer themed house that is tastefully decorated and designed, and SO clean!
We are a family of 6, and have kids ranging in age from 21–10.
There was something for everyone in this home!
The things that stuck out the most to me was how CLEAN everything was!
Everything felt “fresh.”
It was nice to cook meals, throw in a load of laundry and have the beds all be so soft after long days of hanging out at Lambeau Field and Titletown.) (This home is less than a 2 minute drive to Lambeau Field and easily walkable).
Marcy was super accessible and accommodating. She reached out to make sure everything was going well and to see if we needed anything. So appreciative of that!
Our family will definitely look into staying in this house again so we can rest our CheeseHeads!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Marcy was so easy to get in touch with! The house was perfect for my family. My son LOVED the game room. They also had toys for him to play with, along with my 10 month old. Would definitely stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Book this right now!! We are seasoned airbnb-ers as both travelers and hosts. This house tops our favorites list!!
Marcy's place is new and sure to be successful. She had beautiful decor, the basement is full of fun and games for both kids and adults. We stayed with a 22 month old and a 3 month old. Highly recommend for kids as there's plenty of space, including a fenced in back yard!
Marcy definitely has an eye for design as everything was very aesthetic, modern, and has everything listed and described to a T.
We can only hope to have the opportunity to come back and visit for a Packers game-day!!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an absolutely fantastic stay at this Airbnb! The place had every amenity we could possibly want: from coffee and snacks to a stocked kitchen and all the toiletries you could need. The attention to detail was impressive, with comfortable mattresses, ample sitting areas, thoughtful placement of hooks and charging stations, and even cleaning supplies readily available. Brooke was also quick to respond and flexible with accommodations.
The off-street parking was a great convenience, and the home itself was beautifully decorated. We were so inspired by the decor that we took photos to use as inspiration for our own home. We wish we knew where the owner found all the interesting pieces!
It's clear that a lot of thought and care went into decorating and hosting. We've stayed in many Airbnbs, but this one is definitely one of our favorites. We hope it will be available to book again on our next visit. Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,3,Stayed about a week,Clean out for the most part. Lots of little gnats frying around & there was a mouse in the entry way. No air conditioner

Thanks Brooke!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We have been to Green Bay so many times and this is by far the most beautiful and perfect place we have stayed at! We will be back!!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place was so chic and I loved staying! Lots of natural light if you wanted it and lots of plants to bring life into the place. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants a good location near downtown Broadway! Easy to get to everything I needed and also more.

The trip was too short! Certainly, would stay another few days!
Thank you for your hospitality. We fell in love with the Greenbay Area. Visited Lambeau Field for the 1st time! My daughter attended her high-school graduation in Appleton! I'm one proud dad! I thought I was a lake person until we visited Point Beach State Park and Sheboygan this week! Thank you again! We will definitely stay at the Green Door Green Bay Packer house again! Five Stars! *****"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice little place. Perfect for us! I cooked for every meal and the kitchen had all the pans and utensils I needed.

2023-04-01,4,Stayed over a week,I was here for an extended stay while working in the area. The home was extremely clean and cozy. The neighborhood quiet. Home was as advertised via pictures. Garage is available for parking if needed. I enjoyed staying here. The home was very clean and comfortable! My only complaint was a total lack of snow removal during a 2 day winter storm which resulted in me having to shovel the driveway each day before and after working 12 hour shifts. The area received 6+ inches each day so it was impossible to get out or back in without clearing the driveway. The owner stated his regular plow guy was on vacation and his college age back up was on spring break. The owner did offer to pay for an uber but I was not confident I would be able to book a ride after work given the weather conditions so I declined. A snow removal company did arrive around 1am on the second day but only cleared the sidewalks as I had already shoveled the driveway upon my return home that evening.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"I had an extended stay at this adorable and cozy house. House is located in a quiet neighborhood and very convenient to a multitude of stores and restaurants. Bellin Hospital and St Vincent hospital are a 5 minute drive. The home was spotless upon my arrival, there is a keypad for super easy entry. I was able to park in the garage in case of snow or extreme cold. Eric kindly texted a few times the first few weeks to make sure all was well. I enjoyed my stay here very much and would stay again!"

2022-12-01,3,Stayed with a pet,Great location!
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,This cute little home in a nice neighborhood was so much better than staying at a hotel. We had plenty of space. The home is small—but very clean and very cozy. We never really had to communicate much with the host—which isn’t a bad thing. Instructions were well written and clear. We really didn’t need to reach out for anything. The Alexas throughout the house were neat. The kids thought they were great! Would stay with this host again for sure.

I thought the beds were comfortable and the location was great! Eric did a great job of communicating with me and leaving information in the house. This was probably one of the easiest Airbnb's I've stayed in as a result.
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,Had a fun stay here. The basement is super cool.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Quaint little house… perfect for our one night stay! The smart technology in every room was an added perk! Would definitely stay again! Beds were comfy! Our son stayed in a big boy bed for the first time!
2022-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable place to stay in a good neighborhood.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a great Green Bay retreat! It's tucked in an adorable neighborhood close to the stadium. Everything was as described with even more personal touches added in. Our family of four and two fur babies stayed for the weekend and were very comfortable. It was extremely cold outside but Eric even checked in and made sure we got inside okay. we would definitely put this as a ""must stay"" for the future!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was really great. Well located on a quiet street. We went to a Packer's game and it was about a 20 minute, very pretty walk to and from. Eric was a great host and was very responsive to our messages. Getting in and out was a breeze thanks to a keypad on the doors. Wish it was warmer to enjoy the outdoor seating - next time!"
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,Great house and hosts! Checking in was super easy. The place was very clean and cozy. I would highly recommend.
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"100 % recommend - We had the best time! Wonderful hosts and great home! Clear communication and instructions started our stay perfectly. The house was clean and prepared on arrival. We loved the garage access for our car, and the door locks were smooth/simple. Loved the tech - thermostat, Alexa, Sonos, TV, lights, record player. Great music library provided, and easy wireless connectivity to your phone. We stayed just us two the first night, and our friends came the second night for the Packer game. As a bungalow style rental for 2, and as a game day rental with friends, the house was equally suited for both. We hope to make it back and stay here many more times in the future!"

The complimentary popcorn was delicious, beds were quite comfy, and so close to Lambeau field."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a very nice beautiful place. There is a little welcome platter in the kitchen that can be seen when you first walk in with a hand written card, few drinks, and snacks! So cute and amazing. They were understanding and patient with me and continued to communicate with me after we checked out because when i had accidentally left a bag there. A lovely home!

We spent most of our trip out and about, but when we were back at the house, it was fun to hang out in the basement bar. There's a dartboard, a bunch of records and CDs, and an Atari, which were nice touches. It was also nice to have a park around the corner to take the dogs for some exercise. Would gladly stay again on a future visit to the area."

House was very clean had everything we needed and wanted. Beds where good, water was hot. We had two teenagers and three adults and we all enjoyed the stay. Great location and just a great place.
I always post something that I didn’t like or would have liked to see. So here it is my wife wants a TV in the bedroom. That was the only complaint I heard all weekend.
We have this place 5* and would stay there again no questions asked.
Thank you for the great stay."

What really surprised us was how QUIET it was! If you look on a map, you'll see it's near major thoroughfares and downtown, and you might expect it to be noisy. IT ISN'T! We live in a small town in rural SW Wisconsin, and this place rivaled ours for how quiet it was.
We loved the accommodations! The couches and bed were comfortable and everything worked perfectly. To be fair, we ate out the night we arrived and were on a REALLY tight schedule in the morning, so we didn't use the kitchen, but the things we did use worked perfectly. Next time we need a place to stay in Green Bay, Julie's place will be at the top of our list!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Julie’s communication was excellent - it’s just a shame we never got to meet her in person. The apartment is spacious and clean, with all the facilities you need, including a variety of snacks and treats left for us which was much appreciated. WiFi is pretty good, although a bit slow at times. There are a lot of steps up to the apartment, which was ok for us but should be noted if this might be difficult for you. The location is fairly close to the centre of Green Bay, although we did end up driving a few miles to find a decent restaurant.
Overall, it’s a great place to stay."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was our second stay at Julie's home. It's always like coming to your own house. Her bathroom is stocked as though 4 females live there - various shampoos and lotions and pretty much everything a person has in their own bathroom. As before, nice little snacks in the kitchen, coffee, tea, etc. One thing that is beyond Julie's control is the state of the streets in her neighborhood. They are horrible. Potholes, huge bucklings, crevices, etc. You have to go very slow or you'll knock something off your car. Otherwise, the neighborhood itself is nice and peaceful."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great private apartment in quintessential Green Bay! Great location: 13 minute walk to the game day shuttle, close to downtown and good eats. The memory foam mattress was sooooo comfortable!! There were even some snacks to boot. One thing to be aware of: the shower was really small, and would likely be pretty uncomfortable for anyone living in a larger body.

Kitchen was on the smaller side - with 4 sitting at the table (which would need to be moved from the wall) - there wasn’t much wiggle room around it.
Basement having the foosball table and bags was a nice touch but as most basements are - the cement walls wasn’t the style we wanted to hang out in.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an awesome place to stay especially if you are going to Lambeau Field! Owners were very friendly and responsive! It was so much better than a hotel! Clean, taken care of and beyond better than a hotel! I highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! Ashleigh thought of everything when creating this space for guests. She was very accommodating and responsive. Location was great and close to many restaurants, Lambeau field, and stores. The house looks recently renovated and decorated. If we are ever in the area again.. we would definitely stay at Ashleigh’s again!
Fit our family well."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Ashleigh was an amazing host. House was decorated perfectly and she was extremely responsive and flexible with me!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,excellent service and beautiful place
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jami is an amazing hostess. Her place is immaculate and she has thought of every detail.
She uses her communication to gather intelligence in order to provide the best customer service possible.
Her place is comfortable, well decorated, she makes good use of her space, she provides snacks, the appliances and furniture are in great condition, and her responsiveness is the best I’ve seen.
Without doubt, Jami is the best hostess I’ve had in my Airbnb experience and I’m very picky.
The place is in a historic district and from the outside it would be hard to appreciate the gem it is on the inside.
One must access the unit from the back and the unit is in the basement but it doesn’t feel like it.
Jami’s place provides a similar experience an archeologist may have when discovering an unassuming entrance to a beautiful treasure.
Jami blessed me during my stay by providing information, goodies and amazing customer service.
Highly recommended."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jami was the most gracious, friendly, and welcoming host. From the moment I booked her place, I had asked if there was a blender in the kitchen; if not, I could bring my own. She said she would ensure there was one in the house. She ended up bringing her own Ninja into the house! She left me a handwritten note telling me fresh farm eggs were in the fridge and prepared a basket of goodies. Jami also cut fresh lilacs for the kitchen and the bedroom. All the personal touches could not have been more wonderful. I felt right at home at Jami's place and she made me feel like family. If I could give Jami 100 stars I absolutely would!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cannot say enough good things about Jami. She was a wonderful host, exceptionally friendly and went above and beyond with everything from booking to checkout. Her place made me feel comfortable right away, very inviting and cozy. I loved everything about my stay and Jami herself. I cannot recommend this place enough!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Thanks! It was lovely. Appreciate the snacks & and water too! Very cute & comfy place.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I stayed at Jami’s apartment for 4 days while visiting family,
The apartment is perfect for two or a small group and is lovely. It is clean and well stocked and has generous amenities.
There are about 8 steps to get into the place. The hosts helped with our luggage so these were not a problem. It is a basement apartment, but there are plenty of windows and light.
Jami was a wonderful and welcoming host
who was available when we had questions.
We would definitely stay here again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautifully designed apartment in a historic building. Felt completely relaxed.The host Jami was incredibly welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure our comfort during our stay. The rooms were beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean, with all the amenities we could possibly need. Great place to stay right in the heart of Green Bay. The place is within walking distance or very short drive to the Fox River Trail, Lambeau field, mall, hospitals, gas stations, restaurants etc. We couldn't have asked for a better experience and will definitely be returning in the future. Thank you for a fantastic stay!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I came up from Milwaukee for a conference, and got to be the first to stay at Jami’s place. It’s a pretty cool pad to hang out in! I walked in and was greeted by a lovely welcome note from Jami & Kevin, some snacks and bottled water, and they even had the lights on for me, which was really nice. And, listen, as a curly haired girl who had limited space in her overnight bag, THEY EVEN HAVE A DIFFUSER WITH THE HAIRDRYER. If you know, you know. Everything was fresh and comfortable, and it was easy to find, easy to park, and all around a charming hidden gem. I’ll definitely be back next time I have to come up to Green Bay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was as described. Tracy went above and beyond what a host should! If there were questions, she was spot on with her response and resolutions. If you are in the Green Bay Area, this is definitely the place to be. Thank you for being a great host!
**Across the street is some shopping and close to everything you need!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house. Nice area. Shops across the street if you need anything. Very close to the stadium, could walk to it if needed. Tracy was very on top of keeping in touch with us during our stay. I had a question at one point and she replied promptly. If we're in the area in the future we will stay here if available!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was an amazing stay . It’s a charming beautiful and comfortable house in a nice neighborhood. Tracy the nicest person to deal with . I’ll definitely stay there if I had to go back.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,"location was great.
Tracy was a great host.
Thanks!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Came into Green Bay for football game. Convenience of the free bus right across the street made it so easy to get to the stadium and back after game. Tracy was great with communication and checking in to see if everything was alright and making herself available if anything was needed. Will definitely be staying at this property again next time we come into town for game. Thanks Tracy!!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, good location, host is very accommodating"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Impressed!
Tracy has great proactive and timely communication. Awesome parking and amenities. We love that this place was very clean, upholds their pet free policy very well, and did not use any artificial fragrances in the home. All the rooms are spacious and have good black out curtains. If you like a mattress on the softer side like we do, we found the beds real comfy and bedding super cozy. Anything we needed was accessible in a 5 minute radius - even a farmers market across the street! This airbnb is one I will definitely be coming back to."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a last minute business trip and Tracy was super accommodating. Quick to respond and the place was great.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was wonderful and responsive. The place looked like the picture and was very clean. There was ample parking. This was great for a Green Bay getaway. Not only did we get to explore Green Bay, but it wasn’t actually too far from Peninsula State Park. We actually drove up there as well when we came to visit. Overall, I would highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Perfect spot if you’re in Green Bay and close to almost everything in the city.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time!! Very clean, spacious living area with exactly what we needed for our trip. Excellent location - nearby lots of coffee, shops, and convenient stores. A quick 5 minute ride to the stadium and a 45 min walk home if you want to avoid traffic/high Uber fees! Tracy was amazing and confirmed our reservation ASAP so we could snag this last minute trip to see the packers!! She was very proactive asking if we had any questions, making recommendations, and was always super responsive. 5 stars!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy was an amazing host and this was an awesome place to stay for a Packer home game weekend. Tracy was extremely proactive with giving out info regarding the AirBnB, and was very responsive to messages and answered all of my questions with patience and kindness. She made everything easy, intuitive, and seamless, we were able to enjoy our stay in privacy but I felt as though I could reach out to her at any moment with a question and she wouldn't hesitate to help. The king-sizes bed is AMAZING and the free shuttle to Lambeau right across the street was the cherry on top. We would happily stay there again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect for my family, well stocked with utensils for meal planning
Comfortable beds, Tracy is a very caring host and ensures a perfect stay"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home and location. The home was very clean and comfortable. It is a couple of miles from Lambeau Field, which we toured:) Green Bay is a nice small town with great people. We had trouble figuring out the TV, but Tracy gave us instructions on how to use and offered to come over, if we were unable to figure it out. It was easy peasy:)"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at this house. Great location only 2 miles from Lambeau with a free bus stop to the stadium across the street. We ended up walking home after the game to avoid traffic which was an easy walk. House feels much bigger due to a good layout and a large kitchen.
In addition to great location and nice place to stay, Tracy was by far the best Airbnb host I’ve ever had. She let us check in a little early and stayed in contact with us throughout the stay making sure we were happy and see if we needed anything. And contrary to many hosts, we didn’t have to completely clean the house after paying a cleaning fee. Simply standard be a good human and clean up after yourself type stuff and that’s all. I can’t wait to come back and stay at another Tracy hosted property :)."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice Airbnb centrally located in Green Bay
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tracy went above and beyond in helping us. She gave us tips and found information when we asked for her help about the area and things to do.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Tracy's place is great. Entire house, 2 bedrooms. Very private and secure. Felt saft at all times. Parking is exceptionally good. TV and wifi and AC also very good. Location is the best. Close to a strip mall and fast food across the street. Close to Walmart, Sam's Club, Fiesta Grocery. Lambeau Field is also close. I stayed here for a month and loved it. Larry"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"amazing home. very clean, just as described in the ad. once you're in the house and the door shut, you hear no traffic Tracy was an amazing host. always answered my questions right away. Will definitely be staying with her in the future"

2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything listed and more. Tracy is an awesome host! We are from California and did not know what to expect visiting Green Bay besides the fact that it’d be super cold. Tracy not only gave us advice on what to pack. But also gave us current weather conditions, suggested restaurants in the area for our family to dine at. She truly made it the best experience we could’ve had. This house was in the perfect area. Everything was literally across the street or in walking distance from us. We will most definitely be contacting her on our next trip."
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Had a great time at Tracy’s rental! It was extremely close to Lambeau Field and all other local attractions. The place was nice and well kept. Tracy was extremely quick to respond anytime we had questions. I’d definitely stay here again next time I’m in Green Bay.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Communication was great during our stay! Love that the house was powered by a keyless entry. The location was super quiet but close to shopping to grab anything you may need. The bus for the Packers game is across the street, but we ended up walking and it was not a bad walk. The only thing that my family mentioned was they wished the beds were a little more comfortable. Nevertheless, would stay here again if in town again!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Don’t let the location scare you. Great value for the money. Price equitable to a hotel room with more space, privacy and a well stocked kitchen to make your own meals. Close proximity to wherever you need to go in Green Bay and the surrounding area if you have a car. Will stay again."

This was my first time using Airbnb and the experience exceeded my expectations a million times over!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice unit. Extremely close to shopping areas, downtown Green Bay, and beautiful parks. Lambeau field is very close and easy to get to, a not to miss attraction. We were in town for the Nascar race at Elkhart Lake a comfortable drive by any means. The unit is stocked with most kitchen necessities. There are two large bedrooms and ceiling fans in almost every room. We were in Green Bay over the July 4th holiday and enjoyed the great city fireworks display and the various local citizen displays.
Tracy is interested in your enjoyment and communicates every detail you will need. Regular checkups by Tracy ensures your time in the unit meets your expectations.
We were not disappointed in this Airbnb experience, our 5th total.
