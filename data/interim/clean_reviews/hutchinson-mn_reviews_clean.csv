2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely wonderful place. The space is decorated in a way that puts you instantly into a calm state. The host was beyond fantastic. I loved the binder that had all the information plus a few pages about her family. It made me feel so welcome.
I had to leave early bc of a family emergency & I didn‚Äôt know if I did all the things instructions said to do. Michaelee was so understanding & kind about it. I will be staying with them again & again & hopefully again!"

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is our second stay at the Treehouse and again, we left extremely happy and relaxed. It's just the perfect romantic setting for a couple to stay. Or perfect for a single person to relax, study, pray or just rest. The room and outdoors have plenty of different spots to just chillax! Michaelee has created a wonderful hideaway. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for somewhere to do a solo ""metreat"" and recharge and Michaelee's place was absolutely perfect for that purpose. The table was perfect for a small puzzle, the Turkish lamps perfect for reflection and journaling, and my new mission in life is to recreate the perfection of that glorious bed. Added bonus that Michaelee and Tim are both so lovely."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Participated in the local mud girl event & found Ma‚Äôs treehouse was a nice place to shower, get laundry done and rest in a unique, clean & sweet little oasis. Although the location did not offer much by way of entertainment, nature or restaurants we did find a nice beach at Baylor Regional Park/observatory on Eagle Lake in Norwood Young America, MN (15 min drive west). For dinner we found a popular Japanese steak house called Tokyo Grill in Hutchinson (15 min drive east). On the our way home we enjoyed coffee & breakfast at Logan‚Äôs Pass in Cologne, MN as it was the closest coffee shop open on a Sunday that wasn‚Äôt a chain.
If you are passing through this area definitely check out Ma‚Äôs Treehouse!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was amazing. We were in a local town for a tractor show and was having difficulties find a place to stay until I tried Airbnb. This place was out of this world awesome and it cost less then a hotel room would have, plus it was so much like home. Thank you for letting us have a great weekend. We will be sure to come back and refer our family and friends."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The sweetest little Airbnb we've stayed in for ages -- really a surprising gem! It was so quiet and welcoming, with a lovely feeling of being in the trees and that wonderful scent of cedar. We were in town for a family wedding and it was a treat to come back to the ""treehouse"" at the end of busy days. Michaelee and her son Justin were so responsive and helpful -- we loved pedaling around town on the bikes they lent us."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Totally cute place made for a very relaxing stay. We were looking for a place to ""get away"" from the big city and this was the perfect place. It felt like we were out in a forest!
Our host was a terrific communicator and a very nice person. It felt like we stayed with family."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The bed was really comfortable, which is pretty rare in Airbnb's from my experience. The place was super clean, and the easy to get into."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Daughter and I had a wonderful overnight stay at Ma‚Äôs Treehouse! Drove up from Chicago‚Äîand chose this accommodation bc of its proximity to St Cloud and Minneapolis. Very glad we trusted our instincts and chose to stay here vs staying in a motel‚Äîso much more comfortable and pleasant! Be sure to read Michaelee‚Äôs story in the binder‚Äîyou‚Äôll feel that much more at home!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful little Airbnb. We enjoyed our peaceful stay. Clean, comfy and cozy. The host was so responsive and kind. Super easy to check in also. Had a cute book of local recommendations that she put together! Very helpful!"

10/10 would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Michaelee and Tim's was great! it was exactly as described, the host was very friendly and responsive, and the place was peaceful and quiet. The pillows and mattress were also very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ma‚Äôs Backyard Treehouse was an absolute delight to stay in! It felt so peaceful, like being out at a cabin without giving up the benefits of being in a small town. The place was beautiful, the amenities were perfectly as described, and the host was super friendly! I would gladly stay there again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful and relaxing stay at Michaelee's place. We used the place as a launching pad for ziplining in Henderson (highly recommend!), exploring the backroads of the Minnesota River Valley, and going to Minnetonka. Michaelee went above and beyond to make sure we had a comfortable stay."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely enjoyed every minute staying at Ma‚Äôs Backyard Treehouse! My husband and I came here for our anniversary. We were greeted with such generosity and kindness during the whole duration of our stay. We enjoyed the space to grill and go to the fire pit at night. They went beyond their efforts to make sure our stay was pleasant. I can‚Äôt wait to go back again soon. üòä
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The space was very nice and well appointed. You can tell there was alot of thought put into its decor and how it functions. I was able to cook all of my meals with the kitchennette set up. Michalee was friendly and warm. From the pictures posted I thought it would have been a more rural setting, but the house is right in town, just a couple blocks off of the Highway. I couldn't find any walking paths nearby that were actually in nature - every path was next to a busy road, and there was pretty consistent vehicle noise from the nearby busy streets. I utilized the space for a spiritual retreat on zoom, and the interior had a nice vibe for that purpose, as well as being reasonably priced. I just wished in my breaks between sessions I could have enjoyed more quiet, natural environments nearby. Overall a busier environment than I anticipated, but pleasant none the less."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We throughly enjoyed staying at Ma's backyard treehouse! Such a cute place and perfect for our weekend getaway being in a friend's wedding. Thank you!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a relaxing getaway, and this wonderful place delivered! Cozy cabin-feel, with luxurious accommodations. The bed was SUPER comfortable, the bathroom/kitchen facilities were top notch and beautiful. Honestly, I didn't want to leave. Michaelee was very flexible with our schedule, and her husband Tim was generous to the max! They treated us like family. It was such a treat to wake up with the sun peeking through the curtains, then have coffee and watch the sweet birds that visit their outdoor space. Peaceful, serene, joyful, safe, were what I felt while there. Fantastic family restaurant less than 5 minutes away. Hutchinson is a short drive, but I have to admit I enjoyed being in Glencoe, at the ""treehouse"" more than anything else. Can't wait to visit again."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a beautiful stay at Ma's Backyard Treehouse! It was such a peaceful little place that was cozy and provided opportunity for the solitude I was in search of.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect spor for me less than a mile from my job site! incredibly affordable for the value, especially since there's hotel in Glencoe. Great private space!

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely and peaceful weekend getaway at Mia‚Äôs treehouse! Michalee was a very friendly and gracious host who made us feel right at home. There was even a yoga mat, candles and oils available to use - such a sweet surprise! It was the perfect place to take some deep breaths and refresh for the week ahead. Would recommend to anyone looking for some tranquility and a cozy stay :)"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Another amazing stay at ‚Äòmama‚Äôs treehouse‚Äô! Will most definitely be back!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Need a cozy place to relax and just get away for a little? This place would fit that bill! Definitely recommend and would stay againüòä can imagine it would be gorgeous in the summer!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a PhD student getting ready to take exams, and I stayed at Michaelee's place so I could get away from the city to have a studying and writing retreat. The ""treehouse"" was cozy and comfortable, and Michaelee made sure that I had enough tea to get me through it!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Only great things to say about my treehouse stay! Very appreciative of Michaelee!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,She was amazing! I can't even explain in words the way she went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable!

They are incredible and I'm so happy I had the opportunity to meet them and stay at the lovely treehouse! I highly recommend!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Michaelee was very friendly and made us feel very comfortable! The place was extremely clean and super cute! There were some taxidermy in the garage that took us by surprise üòÜ. Loved the space and the vibes of the whole place! I would definitely stay again!

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Highly recommend this spot! So peaceful. So pretty. Great hosts!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Michaelee and ""Ma's Backyard Treehouse"" in Glencoe are simple magical. I had an amazing stay at the treehouse and would definitely recommend it. Michaelee and her family are superb hosts and they have thought of everything. My experience was on a whole other level of awesome sauce and I will always remember my stay with fondness and appreciation. The treehouse decor is beautiful, the ambiance is so peaceful and tranquil. The grounds are enjoyable and gorgeous. Glencoe in general was an awesome place to spend some time. The townspeople are so genuine and friendly and there are several good restaurants and boutique shops. Don't hesitate, book today!! üíñ"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What an unbelievably awesome space Michaelee and her husband Tim have created! They have literally thought of everything you could need. And if you do need/want something more Michaelee is very quick to respond to requests and fulfill if possible. We stayed for my husband's birthday. It was a very relaxing and restful time. The space just lends itself to relaxation and rejuvenation. We will definitely be back as a couple. And for myself, this will be my go-to spot when I need a place to go for the night to have peace, quiet and time alone in prayer. It is perfect for that and so much better than a cold, corporate hotel chain. Trust me, book a stay here and you will be glad you did!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had such a great stay! Everything was provided from shampoo to coffee!! Would love to stay again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The backyard treehouse was such a nice stay. Everything was well thought out and you could feel Michaelee‚Äôs hospitality in every detail of the place.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Such a wonderful & comfortable stay in Michaelee‚Äôs treehouse!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kelli's place is absolutely adorable, spotless, and smartly furnished. What a wonderful find and we will hope to be back again. Several bars and restaurants are within walking distance (and a wonderful vintage shop is across the street!) Enjoy!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Kelli & Chad were wonderful hosts! My phone died (with all our bnb info, contacts, etc) and Kelli went above and beyond to get the info to me. We had a problem with the TV not connecting and Chad got his Tech guy on it right away. Both hosts were absolutely wonderful and made our stay very pleasant. The unit is stylish and equipped with everything you could possibly need. When we come back to MN I know we would like to stay here again. PS, try the Krispy Krunchy chicken at the Marathon gas station a block west, sounds crazy but it is REALLY good."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very spacious and big. More than one would expect at an Airbnb. Loved it.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had some family from out of town come down to help us work on our new place and needed a place to put them all up. It was a perfect location only being about 5 minutes away and very cute and clean! They felt right at home! Would definitely stay there again.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Stayed here as a travel nurse. This place is wonderful! Comfortable beds and furniture. Was surprised by the soaking tub upstairs too! Host is very responsive. Would definitely recommend !
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I spent four nights here while visiting family over Thanksgiving and couldn't have been more comfortable--it was particularly helpful having a full kitchen full of cookware/dishes to make some of our favorite holiday foods versus having to travel with them from home! We loved the natural light from all the windows and it will be ever better when it's not winter. My husband found the beds to be very comfortable, but I need something much softer for physical reasons, so it was nice that they also have a high quality air mattress because that worked out well for me. We also won't travel without our two dogs, so it was great to have the extra space inside, as well as a beautiful area for outside walks and exploring. We honestly felt like we were staying with family, but more relaxed because we had our privacy, and the area was extremely peaceful and safe. Natalie is an excellent host and we'll definitely be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you‚Äôre looking for a 2 bed, 2 bath place to stay in the area, look no further. This place was fantastic!

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The host was east to communicate with. Lovely home. Beautiful surroundings. Very nice space. We had a family of 5 and out 2 dogs.
Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A very lovely and clean space. We loved having our own building, especially having two young kids. The host was thoughtful and accommodating to our needs. Since it's in the country and we were traveling in the dark, maps used on your phone weren't super helpful at finding the place. The host emailed directions beforehand and we were able to find our way with ease once we got close to the property using her directions."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place with modern updates
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Natalie was a great host. It was hard to find the house at first with the maps not bringing us to the right place but not their fault hopefully maps will get it together and fix it but she was super responsive when we needed additional directions! Definitely recommend and would stay again if we were in the area.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was very nice and quiet, great for relaxing. GPS lied to me I have seen it so this to other stores, follow easy instructions provided by host very easy to understand and follow(the gps service may get it together though and fix the problem that‚Äôs on their end).

2024-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"This was a splurge for us but we are already working with the host to reserve a weekend next year! This place is the nicest AirBNB ever. It‚Äôs a dream and had so much more than we even expected. The kitchen is stocked with anything you could need, there are plenty of linens and towels, the game is room and second tv room meant that lots of people could do lots of different things when it was raining, and the paddle parks, dock, and campfire were all gorgeous and super fun when it was nice out."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here for a Thanksgiving celebration with friends. The house was perfect for our group. There was a lot of space to spread out, as well as a great common area for us to come together and play board games, eat, or watch a movie. The game room in the basement was also a nice addition. Our kids loved the air hockey table. The kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, pots, pans, spices, condiments, etc. Everything was clean and comfortable. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice getaway with plenty of space for your group!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Down to the ziplock baggies, the house was equipped with everything you forgot to bring. We also loved the decor, comfortable beds, cleanliness, and lake views. I celebrated my birthday and all of my guests agreed we‚Äôll have to come back. 5/5 recommend."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A beautiful, peaceful retreat. The house has the most beautiful views of the lake through tons of windows and a huge deck.

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"The Wolf Lake escape was the perfect spot for our couples staycation! Plenty of space for numerous couples and so many fun games to play for the perfect night in. We were greeted with the greatest welcome gift bag! Although, it was quite chilly outside there was still fun use of the private dock and sauna! Everything was labeled and we had everything we needed. It was a little difficult to regulate the temperature in all the rooms. One of the upstairs rooms was extremely warm and the basement bedroom was pretty chilly but we grabbed extra blankets and made due. It was such a fun location for a Fall getaway, but with all the amenities, I imagine it would be the perfect Summer spot!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,Very happy with the place everything was as described!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful private location. Excellent hosts!!

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,excelente casa...
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place to see my relatives in and around Glencoe
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,very nice home and we felt very comfortable.... thank you....
2024-05-01,4.0,Group trip,The house worked out well for our needs. Needed to extend stay after booking and Tracy was very accommodating. Nice neighborhood. Charming house. Having a half bath in master was nice especially for an older home.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Honestly, the place was really nice! Quiet area with quiet neighbors. Couple of good bars to walk to. For the town it was exactly what I expected.
Microwave is possessed.
Tracy was an awesome host! I blundered the reservation on my end and she swooped in and saved the day for us!! Very helpful and very accommodating. Above and beyond for sure!
My only negative was the price. It‚Äôd be great if you split it with 6-8 people, and it could fit that! But the vibe and neighborhood and location makes it hard to think of a scenario for that many people to need the space. The only reason it was worth the $$ to us is because of Tracy being an awesome host. Knock $100 the place and it‚Äôd be worth it every time."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"While visiting family for Christmas, we decided to stay at this house rather than stay at a family member‚Äôs place. This house fit what we needed perfectly! The house was very clean, there was plenty of room for all of us, and it was a cozy little place to stay for us! I also appreciated that the home was pet-friendly. The kids loved having their own rooms, and they also enjoyed the chess board in the living room. It‚Äôs nice having a whole house to stay in vs hotel rooms. We were very happy with our stay here!"

2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This place made me feel like a kid at my grandmas! I loved the old school charm. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs particularly great for small kids (2yo), not really much for them and no gates. Otherwise it was a great place to have for our weekend in town.
The microwave is definitely a mystery. It has a mind of its own lol"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We very much enjoyed our stay at the spacious four-bedroom home. I was glad we brought a fan to help keep things cool (I‚Äôm a hot sleeper). The microwave definitely has a mind of its own but works great once you figure it out. This is a great house and a great location and we very much enjoyed our stay glad we booked it.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Love the upstairs patio!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great stay! Plenty of room to host a group having four bedrooms, well equipped with everything we needed and great walkable location. We stayed here as my sister got married at South Glen Farm in Glencoe."

2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Our staff enjoyed our stay very much! A very well kept property! Tracy was very pleasant to talk to and always responded in a timely matter.
The only feedback we received - the house could have used a couple fans to circulate the air a little better. Also, one of the bedrooms did not have any furniture in it besides the bed. A bedside table to dresser would have been helpful in this room.
Thank you very much!"
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,

Washer and dryer on the property too. Tracy also has a book for guests to view of things in the area and a cute guestbook to sign. This house is adorably decorated, quiet neighborhood and located roughly 50 mins from the Mall of America. Tracy is also quick on communication, we will definitely stay again. Thanks Tracy for everything!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing time at the Glencoe House. I stayed with my 2 sisters, husband, and 1 year old son. We each had our own space but also common space to spend time together. The bedrooms were bigger than we expected and had plenty of space for our belongings. The kitchen had everything we needed to make our own meals but we appreciated the local restaurant recommendations for a few of our meals. Tracy was always quick to respond to any questions we had. Checkout expectations are clear and very reasonable. We look forward to staying again!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Booked same day for my husband and son to stay for two nights. Can't really review this location as they actually stayed at the Shoreline home of our host. Tracy graciously offered her home at the lake instead. Guys said the house and hosts were great! Glad it worked out.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had a great stay at the Glencoe house. The house was as listed and we enjoyed our stay. We were in town for a family funeral and a group of cousins stayed. They house was the perfect size for the 6 of us with a great outdoor patio for us to sit and enjoy our time together. We could walk to Main Street with food and drinks. We recommend Tracy‚Äôs home to anyone renting in the area. Another note: Tracy responded really quickly and was very accommodating to our needs. Thanks again for a great stay!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was exactly the restful trip our hard-working farm family needed to get us through our busy season!
The house itself is gorgeous, with plenty of room, even for our family of 6.
We liked the bright and open living room and kitchen, with an unbeatable view of the lake.
The kitchen had everything we needed, allowing us to cook 100% of our meals. The master bedroom and bathroom were cozy and private. My kids really enjoyed the bunk beds in the other rooms!
But most of all, we absolutely loved being able to go out and fish right on the dock any time we wanted to. We had surprisingly good luck, too. We caught some really nice sized bass, some panfish, and even a little nothern! The lake was really, really quiet. That little lake is one of the best kept secrets of Wright County!
We all agree that we'd love to come back again. Thanks for providing a get-away we'll look back on fondly."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Loved this place! Perfect home setting to relax and unwind after a busy day.
And a great start having breakfast and coffee there.
The only downside was it was a little hard to find in the dark!
But we hope to return next year, same time!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Very clean, large space. Lots of room with things to do. Enjoyed the patio! We walked to town and spent time at the local festival. Very accessible"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Karrie's place was one of, if not THE most well appointed Airbnb I've ever stayed in. She has thought of EVERYTHING! The house was very clean and just as described in her outline. The spaces are all very comfortable and easy to fall into a home sort of routine once you're here. Karrie went above and beyond to help my team with extra things needed onsite and we will definitely be staying here again when we're back next year. Don't miss out on staying with these loveliest hosts in a super clean and comfortable place!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"No hotel rooms were available for the week of our family gathering. The only place available that could accomodate our group of 9 was Dan and Karrie's Airbnb. The house is located in a new development neighborhood. Attractive and safe. Plenty of parking. Our hosts left us a lovely welcome note. Inside, the house was spotless and spacious and allowed us to spread out. The beds were very comfortable. We also appreciated the modern amenities, including having an up to date laundry on first floor."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely stay in Hutchinson. Kerrie‚Äôs place was lovely, clean, and comfortable. Great communication and very welcoming. The grill looked nearly brand new, and the kitchen was very well appointed. Foosball was the highlight, and a good ping pong tournament was a close second."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had to come into town on short notice for a funeral so we stayed at Karries place with my wife, two adult kids, a DIL and 2 grands. As a AirBnB veteran, I‚Äôll say off the bat that this was the most responsive and communicative host we have had. We had zero house issues to address but rather a couple of personal issues and she was responsive and supportive of solutions that accommodated both of us. The house is HUGE. Very accommodating. My granddaughters (11 and 5) immediately made friends on the street as this is a family friendly neighborhood. Elks playground is very close by had lots of family‚Äôs present. There are several restaurants and shopping establishments close by. If you have kids, I recommend the pizza ranch close to the Walmart. (No affiliation). We come to Hutch on a regular basis for family and are glad to see this come available (the hotel selection is weak here at best). I look forward to staying with Karrie and Dan again in the future."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wes was so awesome and very helpful in all aspects. I very much appreciate his neighborly attitude and helpfulness. Went out of his way to help us out. Very grateful.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay!
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay in Glencoe. Older home but just what I needed while working in town for a month. Wes was extremely responsive and helpful! He was also very flexible with last minute changes.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean place and nice staff! They showed us right to our room and made sure we had everything we needed. Perfect for what we were looking for.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you the Nobles
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay was great and we were really just looking for a place to crash at night during a family reunion. We did have to plan around coming into town picking the keys up for check in, which is not the end of the world. Some drinkware or plates would have been nice but the place was more than worth what we paid for it. Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic place to stay, will stay here again. Loved the location. Apt was exactly as picture, very clean, lots of little extras. Beds were very comfortable and the curtains shut out all the light from the street. Host was very proactive and responsive with communication."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very nice! Thank you.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little apartment that had lots of thoughtful touches, snacks and refreshments on hand, well stocked bathroom with fluffy towels, and comfortable beds. Everything was as described or better and the hosts were very easy to work with. The area is also very nice with many shops, restaurants, and parks easily within walking distance. We would highly recommend."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very nice location. Peaceful and relaxing.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was beautiful and very clean. It had everything you could possibly need from extra TP to extra towels and soft throws! It was easy to find and clear instructions on how to enter. I didn't have any ""interactions"" with them as they were proactive and questions were answered before we even asked! Highly, highly recommend! :)"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My business partner & I enjoyed our stay. It was very convenient
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had an issue with one of the appliances second day of our stay but C. was quick to respond and resolve the issue very timely in a manner that was very helpful and acceptable to us.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Would definitely stay again when in town. Preferred the rear entrance from the deck. Typical road noise but great location in town. Near Dunn Brothers for easy breakfast and across from Dairy Queen for a nice treat! Plenty amenities supplied by host! Overall great experience!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Private, comfortable, very clean. Had everything we needed. A bit of a walk up the stairs and some road noise but definitely worth. I would stay there again."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Enjoyed staying downtown in walkable distance to shops & food.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect home away from home for a relaxing weekend. You could hear traffic outside but it wasn‚Äôt anything extreme and nothing a noise machine couldn‚Äôt drown out. We were able to walk to surrounding stores despite the cold temperatures. There were an abundance of towels for the bathroom and we felt right at home. Everything was clearly marked and that is always appreciated when staying somewhere other than home especially lights. Out of 4 ladies we all forgot shampoo and conditioner and the host had everything we could have needed! Communication was excellent, we parked where we shouldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt get scolded, I appreciate the communication. They even checked to ensure we were put before allowing the cleaning person to come into the home, even after our checkout time. I feel that was very respectful of our privacy.
We may have to make that our annual meet up spot.
Oh and I love how the place was decorated!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute condo with an unbeatable location! We stayed in January with below zero weather, but the property was toasty warm and comfy. We will definitely be back!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"C's place is comfortable and well furnished. The check-in instructions were clear and easy to follow. Less expensive than any of the local hotels, and much more welcoming."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"C‚Äôs place had great aesthetics! Modern meets eclectic. We stayed for the weekend while participating in an art show. This location is 15 minutes from Dassel/Cokato and even closer to a nice winery.
Keep in mind that this is Main Street Hutchinson, so there is some noise from vehicles as expected. That should not deter you from staying in this really great space!
Water and beverages in the fridge were a huge plus for us since we were so busy out and about with friends. There is a coffee shop just kitty-corner if you like that, but C‚Äôs place has plenty of coffee options as well!
We wish could have spent more time here!
In conclusion, if you need to attend a wedding, a family reunion, visit friends, or discover the Hutchinson area, I can‚Äôt say enough how much we enjoyed this space!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very few places we've stayed in had it all.
Plenty of bottled water
Great coffee selection
A lot of towels
Plenty of toilet paper.
Beds were great and comfortable
Easy Wi-Fi instructions
This should be a model for how you run an Air bnb"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in Hutch that is easily walkable to everywhere in the downtown area. Clean and modern. Great value for the money.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Hutchinson- this Airbnb was super cute! As noted there are stairs to climb to get to the space. We personally found the back deck stairs easier to unloading and packing up the vehicle.
Beds are comfortable, shower has decent pressure, love the feature of the heat lamp for the shower. The place is well stocked - host is responsive we were going to run out of dishwasher soap and one of the remotes needed batteries and the host dropped off same day.
Do note that if you plan on shopping around the town many of the stores are closed Monday and Tuesday, a good handful are also closed on Wednesday.
Walk down the river in the parkway and there is a conservatory! Such a fun surprise to see a group of deer, fawns and bucks right at the fence!"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"In the area to visit family, staying at a hotel for a family of 5 was getting expensive. As a first time Airbnb user we loved being able to have space to actually live while visiting."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I adored this apartment! Very clean and nice amenities. The owners were very responsive when a need arose. Would definitely stay here again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay at C‚Äôs place! The apartment was cozy and had everything we needed. With the location being on a main road, it made life easy to walk places but loud when trying to sleep. The queen bed faces the street and you hear every car and 18 wheeler go by. That was the only negative. If your pet is sensitive to sound this might be an issue. Regardless, I‚Äôd still recommend this Airbnb as it was wonderful to bring our pet. Fantastic value. The pottery studio around the corner was also a bonus."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful place to stay in Hutchinson!! The kitchen had everything we need needed to cook meals, including plenty of pots/pans/cooking bowls/utensils ect. There was also a great selection of seasonings to use. The bathroom was large and beautiful. We loved the heat lamp in the bathroom! Loved that there were plenty of towels. The beds and pillows were comfortable and we rested very well. We were getting to town a bit earlier than the 4pm check in time, and the host allowed us access an hour early, which was GREATLY appreciated. I would absolutely stay here again!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a great experience staying at this Airbnb. The location was convenient, hosts responsive, and amenities were exactly as described. The only note I have is that main street in Hutchinson is surprisingly lively at night, and the walls of each bedroom, facing the street, are rather thin - so it was pretty noisy at times. However, once you get used to that, you'll find your stay pleasant and enjoyable. I would absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in town."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay in downtown Hutchinson! Great hosts and location!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thought maybe there could be a window covering over the kitchen and living room windows. Bathroom tub drain was a little slow, could be slightly clogged. Overall we had a very wonderful time. Everything was so nicely stocked. We‚Äôre looking forward to a return visit already."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay in Hutchinson! This is the most walkable location you can find in town, right above some thrift shops, a plant store, and across the street from a coffee shop and bars. The listing is just as described, and is much larger in person. We loved the ease of the stocked kitchen, and large kitchen island while cooking our own meals. The living room was perfect for lounging and watching our TV shows on their Roku. The velvet curtains were great for blocking out light in the bedroom, and the bedside lights and mini shelves were perfect for nighttime reading. The host was super responsive when we needed an item, and parking was great in the back entrance. Wish we had stayed in the summer to enjoy the sunny back patio! Would definitely recommend."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This loft was absolutely perfect for a girls night in Hutchinson. It is conveniently located to shops and restaurants. The place was inviting, cute and cozy. Far better than staying at a hotel. We would definitely stay here again. The only suggestion I have is to update the listing to reflect the actual bed sizes of 1 full and 2 twin/singles vs. 1 queen and 2 full beds. Otherwise, we were very pleased with our experience!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this place and everything about it. The hospitality and warm welcome was very appreciated. Travel to the area once a year and this will be my first choice.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a hidden gem. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was just steps from the parking spot and boom you feel like you are in a secluded retreat. As we sat on the deck the eagle perched 30 feet away. The birds glided over the water and the squirrels quarreled in the trees. The tent stayed nice and toasty through the night as we tended the fire. We opened up the end of the tent to look right over the water as we were cozy in bed. It felt like a fairy tail. Easy access, super close to stores and a million miles away from our cares. We can‚Äôt wait to stay again. It was a little slice of heaven."

Inside it was pristinely clean, welcoming, perfect amount of amenities, comfortable beds, etc. Outside, it was easy to get to, super easy to get to all the surrounding towns for dinner or treats, and it was on the most serene acreage ever! Jon is an excellent host- he proactively reached out to us and he responded immediately when we replied. A+ stay- we highly recommend! And Waconia is only like 9 min away and could not be cuter and more fun for a little MN stay-cation."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed there for work. It was awesome thank you
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would recommend staying at Jon's place.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We recently stayed at a lodge farmhouse for a Christmas holiday family get-together with parents and it was absolutely beautiful. The owner had clearly put a lot of thought into decorating the place, and it truly made the holiday feel special. They even had a stunning Christmas tree, which added to the festive atmosphere.
Not only was the lodge farmhouse aesthetically pleasing, but it was also equipped with everything we needed. This made our stay incredibly easy and pleasant. The owner had thoughtfully provided all the necessary amenities, ensuring that we had a comfortable and convenient experience.
I highly recommend this place to others and can't wait to come back again next year, this time during the summer. The beauty of the surroundings combined with the excellent facilities made it an unforgettable experience. If you're looking for a peaceful and charming getaway, this lodge farmhouse is the perfect choice."

2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The rental was cozy, spacious, and very clean. The lodge type decor is tastefully done. The kitchen has everything you need to eat-in or entertain. Living room furniture, 3 beds, and linens were very comfortable (love those cozy white cotton sheets)! Even though the lodge is close to Hwy 7, we could not hear any traffic noise. The location is a beautiful, private, quiet, farm type setting. We saw breathtaking sunrises, sunsets, and a sky filled with stars. We will definately stay here again in the near future. The host, Jon, was superb."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jon was a great host and the property was beautiful. I grew up not far from here, Jon made me feel like I was back at home."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It's a very nice place to stay. The hosts were responsive to our questions and concerns. We would definitely stay here again if it's available for upcoming trips. Others have commented on the stairs and the noise of being above the street. We didn't notice any noise as we were gone during the day. The stairs are steep but manageable. Those with knee issues may have some difficulty as there are 25-26 steps.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was absolutely gorgeous! We stayed over our wedding weekend so my bridesmaids and I had more than enough space to spread out and get ready. It looks exactly like the photo's. We did have issues finding the door but it was our misunderstanding on where to look for the door, we went to side of the building vs the front. We'd absolutely stay there again!!"

2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Large charming historic loft space
2024-02-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"The studio is decorated beautifully and tastefully. The location is great-walkable to restaurants, boutiques, independent theater, library, river trail, and a few parks. It is located on Main Street, which is also MN Hwy 15. That is important to note because you will hear traffic, including many semi trucks and other loud delivery vehicles all day and all night. If you are a light sleeper, this may not be for you. I was disappointed in the ""cleanliness"". I don't want to discourage others from staying here, so I will address details with owners in the hope they can improve on pre-checks before future renters. I likely won't stay here again mostly based on the street noise-just a personal preference."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Second time staying at this adorable loft-style apartment. Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else when visiting the area. It‚Äôs cozy and comfortable. Everything clean with special touches that make you feel at home.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cost of hotels in Hutchinson was surprisingly high, from what I expected. This was a reasonably priced alternative and in a great location to access the two best restaurants in town, walk through the park, and visit family nearby. The traffic noise on Main St was noticeable, given the overall quiet of the setting, but the tradeoff for this location was worth it to me. Very clean and comfortable. Extremely nice amenities."

Once in awhile could hear people talking in the rooms on the other side of the wall, but nothing crazy, and the dog was a little loud when we would drive up, but seemed friendly and when we got up close he calmed down once he knew us. It was a good experience and we would go back if we were in the area again! Thanks Jessi!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful stay! It was exactly as described. Nice hobby farm with several animals. The dog is big but very friendly. It was really peaceful.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Everything was perfect as usual and we're so grateful to have found such a wonderful place to stay with our dogs (or even alone) while visiting family in the area. Jessi is by far the most welcoming AirB&B host that we've encountered and goes above and beyond to make sure that your stay is as comfortable as possible. The location is picturesque (surrounded by woods and farmland) and feels extremely private for being a guest suite--a million times better than a hotel! Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home and making our stay so comfortable.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We pulled in later than anticipated and we were able to get in to the house without issue. The day was extremely hot with high humidity so the room was warm but we didn‚Äôt book until late in the day. The air conditioner in the bedroom helped cool that room and I just pulled the fan that was in the closet out and it did the trick. Slept well.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Jessi‚Äôs. Such a peaceful, gorgeous location. We felt right at home. Our 8th month son had the best time petting the goats. We would definitely stay again."

Your farm animals where a delight, the nature and wild animals also made the stay comfortable and entertaining. I really needed to disconnect from every day life, an your place was nicely accommodating for just that. I think my favorite part was no cable and barely any reception, I don't watch TV and I didn't want to be disturb this weekend ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you're in need of grounding and recentering yourself, Jessi's place is highly recommended. Thanks again, take care!"

The entrance is private and the surroundings are so quiet and peaceful. A very thoughtful touch was the fresh eggs and bread in the fridge! We had a delicious breakfast.

Bring mosquito spray!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Hosts were very welcoming and friendly. The Airbnb was very clean, welcoming and there were eggs all ready in fridge for us!

Goats and chickens are fun for the littles. Make sure to bring some type of mosquito repellent. Would definitely recommend."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay with Jessi was a tranquil and cozy one. The pictures don‚Äôt do the space justice, as it‚Äôs clean and cozy and comfortable- a home away from home. It was an incredible experience. Jessi was friendly and responsive to any messaging, and her directions and instructions were clear. The animals were adorable and friendly! Being tucked away into magical little woods down the lane from a lake make this stay such a neat little experience. Thank you for blessing us with your amazing hospitality, Jessi!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice guest suite, in a very nice country setting. Farm fresh eggs were a very welcome touch. Always responded in minutes to any questions."

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you so much for hosting me! This place lives up to the name - it was an incredibly peaceful retreat for me. The place was easy to find & navigate.

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The beds were comfortable, even the pull out couch bed! There were plenty of extra blankets and a space heater to help us warm up after skiing. The instructions to get in and where to park were spot on. The friendly dogs were a wonderful treat. Marty was friendly and responsive nearly immediately when we asked questions. He even offered to mail my son's phone charger."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was my first ever Airbnb stay, so I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. Jessi had great communication prior to arrival. We arrived to a greeting party of animals. There was a slight issue at check in (I was locked out), but a phone call with Jessi solved that very quickly. The place was clean and as described. Perfect retreat. My daughter and I had a daddy daughter weekend. After getting settled we headed to the local ski hill for some evening laser light tubing. The following morning as we were loading out, Jessi was tending to her other animals and took my daughter on a tour with the goats and chickens. Thank you Jessi for a wonderful time. We would definitely stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved Jessi and Marty's place. The scenery looked like a postcard. It was private, clean, had everything we needed and more.

I'd definitely stay here again."
2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"We had a nice stay there. Very quiet place to morn the death of my son. Was very pleased with our stay except it's quite chilly in there. There was one portable heater which is hit or miss if you can get it to blow hot air. Definitely could use 2 safe style portable heaters. Everythingseemed to go great until after we left.......Jessi tried to make me pay $50 for a new queen matress pad cover but we never even used the queen pull out. After airbnb sided with me, Jessi then put in a money request for $40 for ""additional services"".
The fresh eggs were great and I brought other food with me so we could have a nice big breakfast each day.
Oh and she also said it took 6 hours to clean the airbnb. I really find that hard to believe.
Hope this is helpful."

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a nice, cost effective place. It has a bunch of books and videos to watch, but no cable TV. So, if you want to sit in a cabin and watch cable, this isn't the place for you. It's near a number of fishing areas in east central Minnesota, so if you like to fish, this could be a good place to use a base. Jessi had put some fresh eggs from her hens in the unit for me to use for breakfast. You'll see the chickens from which they came when you drive in, so you know they're fresh and home grown."

2022-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"I enjoyed my time at Jessi's place! I spent one night here just to get away from the demands of regular life. The soft clucking of chickens was a warm welcome, and the puppies made me smile. The space is thoughtfully laid out, and much care has been taken to make the space welcoming and cozy.
Due to the configuration of the space, only one wall has windows - one in the bedroom, in the entry door, and the bathroom. This wasn't an issue once it was dark, but my personal preference is for LOTS of windows. and the kitchen/living area was a bit dark for my taste. The space also has an access door to the garage, which surprised me. It is lockable, but I would have preferred a deadbolt vs. just a doorknob lock.
The farm fresh eggs were delicious, and the body care products in the bathroom were high quality. I appreciated finding one of my favorite authors on a bookshelf, especially a book that I've had on hold at the library for a looonnng time.
I did hear the dogs off and on throughout my stay, including a couple of barks during the night. Also, since the space shares a wall with the garage, I heard someone driving away just after 8 am. I appreciate the consideration that was shown by not exiting the garage earlier.
All in all, I appreciate having a reasonably priced option for a getaway this close to the Cities."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A great place to go when you just need to get away from it all, for a bit. Relaxing, quiet, and removed. There‚Äôs nothing like the country. The room was cozy, clean and welcoming. The essentials you need for cooking are there which is nice. Lots of good books and some other things to do. The dogs are very welcoming and adorable!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just as advertised! It was a great place for the relaxing night we were hoping for. Thank you!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,what a perfect little place for a weekend away. fresh eggs were super good. and my dog loved it too. definitely recommend.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The most comfortable Airbnb I have stayed in! I unfortunately was not able to see much of the surrounding area due to travel times, but the host communicated clearly and the housing itself was superb."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you for your prompt responses and for a quiet, relaxing place for us to kick up our feet and enjoy ourselves after a long day.
I loved looking out the bedroom window in the morning and seeing all the birds scurrying around the feeders and wood pile!
Thank you again for the wonderful stay!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very charming and cute place- honestly the pictures don‚Äôt do it Justice. Check in was super easy and just as promised in the checkin notes. Bring your own water if you‚Äôre well water adverse but it wasn‚Äôt a problem for us. Wifi worked awesome for us, nice TV/DVDS and Blu-ray player. Free breakfast items in the cabin were great - eggs were cute and delicious. Courtesy of the chickens on property which were adorable and friendly. Great bird watching - we look forward to coming back in the summer months to enjoy the lakes. Highly recommend."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location! The dogs were more than friendly. I didn't get a chance to visit the chickens, but their eggs were outstanding and waiting for me in the fridge. The kitchen had many utensils and spices with a full fridge and oven. Very quiet outside, but close enough to many dining options. The Wifi was more than good to stream YouTube TV to my firestick on the flat-screen TV. Noise was minimal other than the friendly furry alarm detection system - a good thing to have in the woods. For you city folks, the water is well water so you'll experience something new. My only ""complaint""? The sink was dark...until I realized my tall butt couldn't see the light under the shelve above it. I will definitely be returning to this gorgeous retreat!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, cozy, and comfortable. A great place for a getaway."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was in the area for my son's wedding with 2 of my young adult kids. I was grateful to find a clean and comfortable quiet country place to stay during our busy weekend. It's a good value. Convenient location a few miles from town. Jessi & Marty are friendly and helpful hosts who were very quick to respond to any needs and questions I had. The guest quarters are located in the back of their home but its situated so that it feels totally private. We could only hear slight bits of activity from the main part of the house, contrary to other comments on that. The sweet friendly 11 month old puppies stay in their fenced in area and barked every once awhile but not that much. I adore dogs so I like to hear them doing their canine thing. I'd love to stay there again if I'm ever needing to come back to the area. Thank you for helping to make our stay very enjoyable by providing all the comforts of home."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My 2 dogs, husband, and I loved this place! Cute little space with everything you need and then some. I travel for dog sports with my mutts and this was so much nicer than bringing them to a hotel (and honestly, cheaper!) There were lots of little snacks, coffee, hot chocolate, fresh eggs with some milk and bread for breakfast. All the sink and shower products you could need. Lots of outside space for my dogs, which we hope to take more advantage of when it is warmer and their paws don't freeze.ü§£ You definitely can hear everything being attached to the house, but I still much prefer that to the several neighbors and hallway noise of a hotel. Communication was quick and friendly every time. I will definitely be back!"
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"No WiFi absolutely no service at all I could not even make a call the water smells like sulfur very strong took a shower and I smelled just like sulfur, their dogs bark non stop"
2022-01-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"They have dogs and they bark a lot no WiFi service at all no cable tv, the water smells like sewer so bad it makes me nauseous I can‚Äôt use it to brush my teeth"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this is an amazing place, and amazing people who make you feel right at home! the location is one of a kind, close to everything one could want but nestled in the country where time stands still and nature is alive! I recommend the stay, its everything and more! hands down best place ive stayed!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,this is the nicest cutest place in the whole area and has everything and more! make sure to take in the quiet and Minnesota at its finest I recommend not passing this up!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Lovely place. It delivers as advertised.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a sweet tucked away spot that has a little woods, a little farm, and a little water view. It was very reasonably priced and exactly as advertised."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I have stayed at a lot of Airbnb‚Äôs over the years and this is by far one of the best. Jessi and Marty go out of their way to make you feel at home and comfortable to enjoy the space and property. We ended up coming here on a whim and Jessi had the sofa bed set up for us along with fresh farm eggs, bread and milk in the fridge. You can tell she thinks of every detail in making the space comfortable and just like home. Amenities far exceed most Airbnb‚Äôs I have stayed at and there‚Äôs even games and toys for kiddos. The space itself is very clean, eco-conscious, and cozy. We all slept great, there were plenty of blankets and pillows, and the room temperature was comfortable. Communication with Jessi was quick, friendly and informative. She is so beyond accommodating and made us feel so welcome. Great location for peace and quiet yet still close to city areas, wifi signal is strong, and one would be content just hanging out at the property with the chickens and a nice fire going."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Jessi's. As others have said, the walls were thin, but a noise machine is available if you find that helpful. It was great to have a full kitchen, and we loved the variety in the books and movies selections, as well as all there was of life to watch outdoors!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute and cozy space. I had quick and clear communications with Jessi. Will definitely stay here next time I‚Äôm in the area.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay for animal and nature lovers! Our dog had the time her life investigating every little smell while we enjoyed the campfire. Our hosts were very thoughtful and friendly and they leave fresh eggs from their chickens available for guests and have plenty of eco-conscious choices throughout. I will definitely stay again in the future if I'm in the area!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The space was cozy and very clean. Perfect for a little getaway from the twin cities area! The space has its own entrance but is attached to the hosts' living area- leading to occasionally overhearing noise. Still was a lovely experience! Just helpful to know just in case you're interested in something truly remote.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Jessi‚Äôs place is just as described- a rustic retreat. It is very quaint and quiet, offering a little bit of country and nature. We were in the area for a wedding and our stay at Jessi‚Äôs was perfect. Very clean with nice amenities provided, including farm fresh eggs!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We had a wonderful stay.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jessi's apartment Was a nice quiet getaway in the woods. Well stocked and equipped is anything you need. Including a shelf full of books that has something for everyone. The decor made it feel like a cabin stay that made you feel like you're in Minnesota.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place for a quiet getaway close to the cities. The fresh eggs for breakfast were a pleasant surprise! I enjoyed hanging outside with the chickens. üôÇ Recommend a quick drive to visit Crow River Winery-excellent pizza and a nice patio.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place is a unique out of the way space. The host has taken the time to create a very relaxing & environmentally friendly experience. It‚Äôs very clean & a great value.
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Stayed here two nights with my 80-something parents while visiting relatives nearby. It's not so much ""rustic"" as it is ""cozy"" in my book. Quiet and peaceful setting off the beaten track, but only ten minutes or so from town, so quite convenient. Appliances were up-to-date, as were the cooking utensils, and everything worked as it should. The bed was quite comfortable; the sofa bed less so, but nothing unexpected. The room temperature was comfortable enough during some chilly nights, but we couldn't find any way to adjust it if that was desired. Plenty of hot water and a very nice shower setup. Wi-fi signal was strong enough for our needs; not sure how it would work for streaming hi-def video. We could hear a bit of noise from the rooms next door through the walls, but not enough to be problematic. Farm-fresh eggs were in the fridge for breakfast, and you might even be greeted by the chickens that laid them! Jessi is very environmentally-conscious, and most of the products provided reflect that fact. Great value for the price we paid. I'd be more than happy to book this place again in the future."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space in a great location with a great host!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The space was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with dishes and utensils. Communication was excellent which made check in a breeze. I loved watching the chickens foraging in the nearby woods."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very cute and quaint place! We we're able to see woodpeckers and an hummingbird just outside the door!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a wonderful, cozy place to retreat from the fast-paced world. It's quiet, scenic and a real gem. Jessi is a gracious host who takes great care to make her retreat comfortable for all her guests. You'll love it!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. Worked well for our family of 4. 8yr old and 4 yr old slept on the pullout couch!
2021-08-01,4.0,Group trip,"Nice, quiet place for us to stay. Would definitely go back if we're looking for a place to stay in area!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great accomodations and peaceful setting. Their rooster and hens are an added treat to watch while sipping on coffee.
2021-08-01,5.0,Group trip,This is a quiet place off the beaten path and just what we needed. It is small and accommodated the 5 of us tightly and well. It had the tools we needed to feed and care for our family. We would stay here again.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a peaceful and quiet AirBnB. Our family of three stayed here on our way out to Western MN and found it to be the perfect place to stay the night. Jessi has added lots of personal touches and transformed it into such a cute soacw. She was very responsive and helpful when we reached out to her. Highly recommend!
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful, clean, organized, environmentally friendly!"
2021-08-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,It was a very quiet and cozy place and a great place to get away from it all
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The guest suite was very clean, nicely decorated, and ready for us when we arrived."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,üëç
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super cute, clean and convenient! I stayed while visiting family nearby and it was the perfect retreat for peace and quiet from an old farmhouse filled to the max with several other loud families! Fresh eggs and the quality skincare products were a bonus!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Lovely little retreat and jessi is great!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Easy to collaborate with. Clean and scenic. Nice attention to comfort in kitchen items and bathroom product.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We chose this little place for its location along our route home from Indiana to Washington State. It was comparablein price to a hotel but way more relaxing. The bathroom was very spacious, clean, and well stocked. The full kitchen was also cleaned and user friendly. Beds were worn and had a lump or two, but our evening was comfortable overall. The breakfast of fresh eggs, bread, milk, butter,and oatmeal was a lovely start to our day. My kids loved the chickens and the dogs. We will look to stay here again."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place that puts you in the middle of nature but the comfort of a roof over your head! Small space that makes it cozy and relaxing.
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,A place apart from the world. Very quiet. Good birding watching and biking.
2021-06-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place has great potential‚Äîhelpful host, large room, well appointed kitchen, fast internet (25mbps), but our stay could have been better:
1: bed has uncomfortable noisy spring mattress (also note it‚Äôs only a double, too small for many couples).
2: host requires guest pets be leashed (we didn‚Äôt have any), but host‚Äôs 2 large dogs run free ‚Äútraining to guard the property.‚Äù Whenever host is out. They are large very friendly puppies that like to get physical, and they followed us over a mile down the road on a walk. Host did keep them inside after we informed her of the problem.
3: walls are paper thin‚Äîwe could hear every word of the host‚Äôs conversations, and assume host could hear ours. Quite a bit of household noise too. We slept with ear plugs.
4: the room is decorated tastefully, but 2 decorative tiles fell off the kitchen wall in the middle of the night at different times, waking us with a crash."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jessi provided everything I needed. Peace and quiet, singing birds. Great breakfast choices. I will plan to return the next time I'm in the area."
2021-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jessi‚Äôs place was very clean, comfortable, and well stocked with breakfast food, dishes, coffee, blankets, pillows and bathroom soap and shampoo. We had 4 people stay but I think it would be most comfortable for 2‚Äì3 adults. Jessi is very helpful with communication and easy to contact."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary for one night. We arrived later than expected, but we still got to enjoy the many amenities this cozy space offers! We loved the farm fresh eggs and bread provided that we used to make French toast in the morning. Cute patio outside to enjoy meals at or read and relax! Very quiet and peaceful at night, and we woke up to birds chirping. A lovely country gem. Jessi was also very accommodating and helpful when we had questions or requests. We wish we could have stayed longer and hope to come back in the future! Highly recommend!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at the Peace of Nature Rustic Retreat was simply amazing! Jessi is a wonderful host. We had a chance to meet her and talk, and she's a fascinating lady. We loved her two dogs, too! We appreciated the fact that she is into conservation, like we are. She has reusable cleaning towels in place of paper towels, and she recycles. There were lots of nice touches all over the suite. She says it's a work in progress, but we think it's pretty great now! It's in a secluded area, so it's nice and quiet -- no noisy cars or trains going through. Just the sounds of nature. I wish we could have stayed longer. We were passing through the area, and her Retreat was a perfect place to stop for the night. Thank you for everything, Jessi!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely spot! Jessi was very communicative and the place was a perfect stop as we drove through the area. Beautiful area around the home.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This retreat was just what I needed. My Continuing Education even was moved online and I needed to be away from the office (both at work and at home) so I could really focus on the learning. The only distraction was the action at the suet feeder! It was wonderful to be surrounded by woods with a great view of the pond and I appreciate Jessi's dedication to renewable resources.
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place is so beautiful and relaxing!! Jessi was so nice!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Amazing place I stay a week I'm so happy with my election very clean and Jessi is amazing host
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great spot! We were just staying for one night but it was very clean and comfortable and the check-in process was easy. As a heads up, I think the private unit is attached to the rest of the house so you can hear between the walls but it didn‚Äôt bother us at all. Loved the little touches of the reusable paper towels and the included breakfast! Thanks again!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jessi has really made a nice, cozy place here, highly recommend for anyone who wishes to have a quiet retreat. Wonderful amenities, breakfast, and eco-friendly touches."
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Lovely place not far from towns. Visited family in the area and this little place was perfect and was a great location for my parents and I. We stayed a week, and frequented hutch/Glencoe/Dassel/ Litchfield/Waconia area to see family and explore. Love the apartment area and watched a few movies and had pizza in the kitchen to relax. It got cold a couple days and Jessi took care of us and notified about heating options and whatnot. she was very good at communication overall. Love the peace and quiet of the country and love the birds!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great experience! So nice to have a dog friendly space to be able to travel with our dog. We especially loved the earth-conscious reminders and touches. Beautiful space!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Cute place. Would go again.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Jessi makes the place like there's a kind and caring Mom right around the corner
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"fun spot, great books. curious about their expansion in the future"
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was really cute. They are a new Airbnb so they are working on things to make it perfect. The sound barrier between the suite and the house wasn‚Äôt great which is the reasoning for 4 stars rather than 5. We know they‚Äôre working on making that better so we‚Äôd definitely book again in the future!
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"This is a neat little place tucked away off the beaten path. We decided at the last minute to go away for the night, and Jessi worked with us to make that happen."
2021-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Wonderful, small, humble abode tucked away from the sounds and lights of the cities. Plenty of activities nearby and a close distance to the Twin Cities make this a perfect getaway for when you just need some peace and quiet."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is an amazing, hidden jewel. The accommodations were beautiful. We only wish our stay was longer. Jessi and Marty are excellent hosts."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It is an amazing place to stay! Jessi and Marty are excellent hosts! It was peaceful and restful. We only wish we could have stayed longer.
2021-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,We had a great stay. Quiet. Clean. New construction.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very nice and cozy home.....
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Being a baby boomer, I loved the decor. One whole wall was all windows with a beautiful scenery beyond. The small touches like snack food was very welcomed. The kitchen had everything you could want or need. It was well equipped for any kind of weather. If I visit the area again, I would definitely reserve it again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely awesome! The atmosphere was great and everything was so comfortable and convenient.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay while visiting family nearby. It was quiet and peaceful. We had everything we needed and the hosts were wonderful.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed over a week,Very nice quiet and clean!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Spectacular Stay!
We stayed a week at the Cozy Mid Century Guest Suite and couldn't have been happier. If you are looking to stay somewhere in the area, my advice: DITCH THE HOTEL with their lack of amenities and give this place a try. I guarantee you will be just as thrilled as we were with that decision.
This place was HUGE, the pictures can't quite capture how large and welcoming the rooms actually are when standing there in person. The feel and decor was on-point. My mom loved loved loved seeing all the throwback pieces you guys have so thoughtfully placed. I wished they still made fridges and ovens like those! They are amazing
The air was fresh in the entire place, no musty, no smoky, nothing but a perfect place to rest and relax. The beds were soft and comfortable as were the sheets. Any amenity that you can think of has already been provided.
Don't be scared of the term ""breezeway"" , you aren't walking through someone's living room or ""bumping"" into the owners. It's very private"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"It is rare for an experience to exceed expectations when expectations were already pretty high based upon the airbnb ad. But our expecations were indeed exceeded! Very nice people, accommodations and town."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Was everything I was looking for, nice and quiet, good location, very spacious, and easy to get to. If I were going by Cokato again I would stay with Trevor and Heidi‚Äôs again."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, cozy, clean space for our family get-together. Well decorated with vintage pieces. Everything you need in all rooms. We would definitely recommend this space!"

2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Great stay, clean and responsive hosts!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Delightful Air BNB. Furnishings were a fun look to the past. Communication couldn't be better, prompt and well-explained. Large and spacious accommodation in a beautiful setting. We were there to visit family and the hosts were kind enough to take pictures of us with the lovely outside backdrop. The owners are very personable, told the history of the house and a little of their lives in the binder left for guests. Everything one could need is available. If you're looking for a place in Cokato, this would be a fabulous choice. We'll be back. Thanks for everything!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved it! So much space ‚ù§Ô∏è
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay. The hosts were very responsive and accommodating and the vintage decor was unique. The neighborhood felt safe and quiet. There is not a ton to do in the area but we were there for a wedding so it was okay. Overall it was nice and great for the price.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are visiting the Dassel-Cokato area, this place is the perfect haven. Tons of space. Hosts are great communicators. Loved it! I will be back."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This a great place to stay. Very spacious, clean and we loved the mid century decor. I would highly recommend staying here!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have asked for a more perfect place to stay! This home had everything and more... from very comfortable beds to something as small as ziplock bags in the kitchen or night lights plugged in throughout the house! I truly enjoyed seeing all the antique furnishings and other items along with the paintings. The vintage stove and refrigerator stole the show! I also have to give an honorable mention for the patio area and surrounding garden. We were able to enjoy the view even while inside the house because of the big glass beautiful windows. I also should mention that although I didn't have small children with me, there was plenty of books and toys for the children to enjoy. I hope the next time I visit the area your home will be available to accommodate me and my family!! Thank you again for opening your home to this wonderful service."
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"The place fit our needs exactly and was perfect in every way. Special little touches like luxury hand soap in the bathroom and vintage decor added to the charm. The on-site hosts couldn‚Äôt have been any more helpful and friendly. Although Cokato may not be the most exciting destination, if you have a reason to be in the area or just want a quiet and peaceful retreat, this is the place to stay."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trevor & Heidi were responsive, flexible, accommodating hosts. Location was easy to find and instructions were easy to follow for entry. Thanks!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed Trevor & Heidi's place very much! The home was very spacious with great decor. It was quiet and relaxing, and the patio and gardens were lovely! Although our grandson was not with us as much as we would have preferred, they had a lot of toys and other amenities that made the home very kid-friendly. And it was in an excellent location for us to visit our family in the area. We definitely recommended it to our other family members."
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,We had such a great weekend at this place! They were so kind and communicated everything clearly. The place was immaculate and had tons of nice amenities including a full kitchen with everything you could need. They also had a list of recommendations for things to do in the area that was super helpful. Would definitely stay here again if we‚Äôre in the area!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a lovely place to stay with friends! Plenty of room for us all, and a really cozy vibe. Especially loved the mid century modern decor and kitchen.
Thanks again for a great stay!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a very comfortable and unique home in a quiet neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again! It was also one of the best equipped Airbnb locations and the hosts were very hospitable and responded quickly to questions.
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Delightful, charming, and cozy."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This is our second visit to Trevor and Heidi‚Äôs place and we have booked a third. That pretty much tells you how pleased we are with their place. We find it comfortable and efficient. We also very much enjoy seeing Bernelle and Larry and getting to visit and catch up with them. We have found a great place to stay and friends.üòä

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I LOVED my stay! It was the perfect little hide-away while I worked 12 hour-days under a pressing deadline. The view was glorious, and I enjoyed watching the squirrels in the backyard when I looked up from my computer. And in the evenings I was pleased they had Apple TV+, so I got to watch the first season of a new TV series I had been hearing so much about on the news. It was wonderfully peaceful. I really enjoyed the vintage look, but with all the modern comforts. It was truly glorious!"

And this home was a very pleasant retreat, and place to rest and relax when she became too tired. The peaceful presence in these rooms filled every space. Everything we needed was available in the kitchen. All of the comforts of home. And everything was so very clean! Larry and Bernelle are so very nice, and we look forward to visiting here again in the future."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,absolutely adorable we loved super friendly people took care of every detail you felt at home we loved seeing the squirrels we had a wonderful family trip
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful and inviting home! Our family loved the decor and antique furnishings. The home was very clean and well equipped with anything you might need. They had great wifi, nice smart tvs, and super comfy beds with a very spacious layout.
Self checkin and self checkout were a breeze. The scenery was so lovely and relaxing, especially during a snow storm with all the snow sparkling on the tree limbs and the squirrels playing in the snow. It's probably even more beautiful in the summer! This place was a perfect, relaxing getaway to bring in the new year, and the hosts made our stay even better- they were helpful, accommodating, friendly, and also respectful of our privacy. They even offered to mail us a charger that we left behind which is so sweet! Not to mention the yummy treats and personalized welcome sign! Thank you for an awesome 5 star stay! üåü"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Trevor and Heidi‚Äôs home was absolutely wonderful and a delight to stay in.
The home was tastefully vintage with big windows that allowed us to have a view of the beautiful snow scenery. They provide everything that you may need. There‚Äôs a washer and dryer, vacuum, hot shower, and even toys and books for kids to be entertained. They provide just about everything you may need in a kitchen as well (Tupperware, cooking spray and oil, non-perishable items, etc.)
Although you can hear the people living upstairs, the noise is kept to a minimum and they make you fully aware that they‚Äôre upstairs neighbors.
We look forward to staying here again on our next trip to Minnesota!"

,,,House is really small. There is not a good air conditioning system. The beds are subpar. The location is ok. Overall I would rate it a 2 out of 5 stars
