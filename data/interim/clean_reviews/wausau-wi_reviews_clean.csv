2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Daniel was great to work with. We asked to stay at the last minute and he couldn‚Äôt have been more communicative and welcoming. We loved his place and are already planning to return. It‚Äôs spotless and he‚Äôs made it so cozy and comfortable. The bed was cozy and he has thought of everything to make ones stay lovely
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay and very kindly friend. Take into account that the apartment is upstairs and there are a few stairs to get in, in case you are carrying suitcases or anything big. Besides that, we would say it‚Äôs one of the best places to stay in Wausau for two people."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute place, nice location, worked well for my stay.
I had inquired about a hairdryer and Daniel made sure that it was available for my stay.....very considerate!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Daniel‚Äôs spot is comfy in all ways: on your eyes, on your bum, and on your wallet!
Immediately upon entering the unit I was impressed by the amount and variety of well-kept houseplants.
Furniture is all clean, comfy, and stylish. The living room and bedroom windows welcome in beautiful light in the mornings. The kitchen is adequately stocked with basic equipment, dishware, and cleaning supplies. Native bathroom products of *all* scents are provided. Such a sweet touch!
Being able to sit in front of the large TV (and not have to worry about logging into my own Netflix account!) was a great comfort after a long day.
Daniel was very communicative and ensured we were enjoying our stay. The recommended restaurants and cafes are 10/10, too!
Next time I travel to Wausau I‚Äôll definitely try to book Daniel‚Äôs again."

He said if you need anything please let me know, I'm happy to help and you could tell he was genuine. The place is super cute, very clean and had everything that we needed. We didn't spend much time there as we came for a quick night with plans, but it was so cozy I wished I could have enjoyed the apartment more. He had nice little welcome info along with suggestions on places to eat, drink and play. There was great parking, super cute little yard with the private entrance in the back.

So close to Granite Peak + restaurants (lots of recommendations for food and activities in the welcome book).

Everything was SO clean and well organized, including easy-to-find items like an extra blanket. The host was communicative and very easy to work with! She was flexible with our very late arrival and offered to send a forgotten item to us (totally unexpected and so kind)!
It's a touch more spacious than the photos display, but I would say two people is the max :) The area was quiet and it was really easy to find and check-in. If we're ever back in Wausau for a night or two, this will be our spot!
Lots of stuff nearby, too!! We ended up getting breakfast at Tucknee Coffee. Breakfast snobs, we were nervous. It was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this little nook!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a beautiful neighborhood. We stayed here to do some snowboarding at Granite Peak.
I had the most relaxing time ever at this bnb! If you would like time to wind down after a long day, you can relax in the television area which is down the hall from sleeping arrangements. Plenty of room, plenty of pillows/blankets, and an awesome gas fireplace. This place is the epitome of a ‚Äúcozy‚Äù night.
Loved this space, will definitely have to come again for the next season. Thank you Doreen & Robert."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"We weren‚Äôt sure if we could find a place close to where our event was, but Doreen‚Äôs place was the perfect location. Although our stay was short, it was just what we needed- clean and cozy."

Not handicapped accessible.
Would select this home again if we needed this large of place again."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"My group and I had a great stay at Benjamin‚Äôs Airbnb. The house comfortable accommodated 9 adults with the 5 bedrooms and the spacious communal areas allowed everyone to hang out comfortably. Ben was also super flexible with our check in time, allowing us to check in early and he also reached out the morning after our first night to see if there was anything we needed for the house. That level of commitment to ensuring his guests had a great stay was incredibly appreciated, and I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to come back or refer others to this location. Great host!"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Great house and it fit our two family's needs perfectly. Plenty of space for all of us to gather after skiing. We do this every year and would definitely stay there again.

It is spacious and has comfortable beds, great closet space, and lots of amenities. Finding a home with three bathrooms is rare, but it was extremely helpful for a group of ten getting ready at the same time. Benjamin was prompt and helpful in his communications. I would highly recommend staying here."

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,I highly recommend Ben's place to anyone staying in the Wausau area!

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Benjamin is a great host! He was very swift on answering my questions and honored any requests I had. The house is huge and beautiful. The space was more than enough for my party of 10 people. I‚Äôd say the only thing that I found a bit too much of a hassle to do was having to access the garage through the inside of the house. I wish there was a passcode provided for the garage so that we didn‚Äôt have to constantly send a person out to go inside the house just to go through the door that leads to the garage to press a button to open it. Other than that, I was satisfied with my stay."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Good host, good house, good stay."

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,This Airbnb was an amazing experience to spend 2022 Christmas in with my family. We will always carry these memories made during this trip because of this house and how well it accommodated my family. Ben was extremely nice and also was flexible in letting us in a day early due to the Arctic winter storm. I‚Äôd definitely be booking again. The house had everything we needed and more!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family recently made a trip north to Wausau WI and were fortunate enough to use the 1611 home for our vacation, we were pleased to say the least.
This is only the second time we used a large vacation home for a trip, but we found the location and the creature comforts perfect for a large group. The home has numerous TVs perfect for when you have 20 somethings along with the - group and it‚Äôs supported by a strong Wi-Fi system that allows multiple users to connect even while gaming!
The hosts were excellent at checking in to make sure everything was OK, and we had no problem checking into and out of the property. We can‚Äôt recommend this location strongly enough, if you are in need of a large home in the area and want something centrally located and comfortable, look no further!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Benjamin was a great host and the house was perfect for what we needed. We had a large party and it accommodated us well with the number of beds that we needed. The only thing we did notice was that we had to stagger our shower times a good bit because we ran out of hot water, but that‚Äôs to be expected with a party of 11. Otherwise, the house was incredibly spacious and immaculately clean. Definitely recommend and we will be staying here again when we visit family."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I had family from all over the US meet for Thanksgiving. The kitchen was the best equipped I have ever seen in an Airbnb. We came equipped with dishes to cook the meal just in case but were able to use lots in the kitchen as well. The dishwasher wasn't working, but we were able to split up the washing up. The house had different gathering spaces, so we could break off into smaller groups as we wished but gather for game playing as well. All in all, a very nice stay.!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We truely enjoyed staying here. The kids didn want to leave. Beautiful tourist destinations nearby, especially during fall. The kitchen had everything we needed from spices to utensils to cook a scrumptious meal. Spacious for a big group."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brandy was an extremely friendly and host, very easy to talk with. My travel plans got delayed which was going to put me in their late. She reached out to see if I would need anything and was willing to go to the store to pick it up and put it in the apartment for me. Anytime I had a question she answered very quickly if not right away. I would highly recommend staying at her place and would stay there again. Her place is right off a main road, and I thought the traffic might be an issue, but it never was as I am a light sleeper. If you rent her place you will be extremely happy that you did."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We booked two nights here while visiting relatives. At the last minute we also needed to bring our dog. Brandy was so responsive and welcoming and the apartment was perfect.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I stayed three nights and everything was beautiful! plenty of firewood for bonfires, nice little dock to enjoy the lake, and the home had pretty much everything you could need. Everything was clean and tidy. There were clear instructions to find extra bedding, med kit. etc. Plenty of great suggestions for food or things to do in the area. This place was close to everything, but far enough away you didn't feel the busyness of the city.
Maddie was very friendly and responsive with any questions we had. We would definitely stay again or recommend to others!!"
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,It was a very enjoyable mini getaway for my husband and I.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved our stay!! Beautiful little cottage that was perfect for two. Peaceful and quiet and the lake view was incredible. The sunrises were gorgeous. Restaurants that Maddie recommended were great. Great parks to explore as well. Shopping was very close. Wish the weather was a little warmer and fish were biting, but overall it was a perfect getaway to relax. Hope to go back this fall."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Maddie‚Äôs place! The home was comfortable and spacious with all the amenities you could need. It felt like a home away from home and our host was very hospitable from the start. Maddie was very proactive and responsive to messages throughout our stay. The location was very private, peaceful, and intimate. The views of the lake were beautiful to wake up to and look at throughout the day. We really enjoyed the small town vibe surrounding us and there were plenty of stores and places near our apartment to pick up any essentials for our stay. There were also great local stores, restaurants, activities, and outdoor activities for us to explore during our stay. I wish we were able to stay for a few more days, but the memories made will last a lifetime! If you want a private peaceful place to stay for relaxation I couldn‚Äôt recommend Maddie‚Äôs place more. I hope to one day return to this wonderful stay and create more memories. Thanks Maddie!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Maddie's lake house was a beautiful, peaceful spot, surrounded by nature - perfect for a relaxing weekend away. We skiied at Granite Peak during the day, but enjoyed morning coffee curled up in cozy chairs in the sun room overlooking the lake and warmed up by the fireplace in the evenings. It's an idyllic spot - close (10-15 min) to Wausau, skiing, state parks, but removed enough to provide a tranquil home base.
Maddie was very responsive to questions and the house was spotless. I'd highly recommend this house. We're considering going back in the summer when we can use the kayaks to explore the lovely lake."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay. We appreciate having such a nice rental.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was nestled perfectly between Mosinee and Wausau. This allowed for easy access to our family as well as the area gym and great restaurants. We did not spend a great amount of time at the house but the time we did we enjoyed! The fireplace was an added bonus.
We would certainly return in the future!
Thank you Maddie for your warm welcome and detailed instructions for the home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,This is very nice and special place I will be staying again

Space is really well taken care of."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked a quick overnight to celebrate our anniversary and soak in the Fall color. Maddie was so thoughtful and left a bottle of wine!

It was centrally located to visiting the local sights and just perfect for our needs."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute place! Calming decor & we loved the smaller size since it was just 2 of us. The gorgeous view of the water made it super peaceful too. Very responsive host. A lovely stay!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay and the beautiful views out all the windows. The home was very clean and uncluttered and there was a pretty bouquet of flowers to welcome us. Our dog enjoyed going for walks along the golf course and we enjoyed looking at the amazing homes and views. Hope to stay there again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a great time at Maddie's. The place was nice and clean. Well decorated and very well kept. It was a great setting, right on the lake.
Unfortunately, it rained most of the time we were there so we couldn't take advantage of the kayaks or SUPs. Maybe next time.
Maddie left a list of some local restaurant recommendations that were spot on! We really enjoyed our trip. It was a nice weekend getaway."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect little retreat, loved being so close to the lake, waking up to the morning mist on lake is such a peaceful memory.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My wife and I stayed with our dog at Maddie‚Äôs riverside home for a nice weekend away in the Northwoods. The location was exactly what we hoped for with easy access to the highway but a quiet location on the river. We enjoyed spending the morning in the shade watching the water and kayakers going by.

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Very nice location close to everything but with the way the property back up to the river you feel like you have your own private spot. The surrounding area and views of Granite Peak (especially at night) made for a great place to hang out at the end of a long day. Looks like it does in the pictures and has a nice layout. Would recommend this place!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic spot. Pete is very receptive and the place was super clean. Also, it included items as if you were staying in a hotel and firewood for the fire place!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our time at Pete‚Äôs. The view of the water was wonderful.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our restful stay at Pete‚Äôs place. Our favorite was the fireplace. Kept us cozy and warm. The kitchen is well stocked in terms of pots and pans etc. If you cook with spices, you‚Äôll need to bring them. But overall, a great find. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed staying at Pete‚Äôs place. From the minute we walked in the door, we felt right at home. The kitchen was well equipped and we enjoyed the lake feeling and the views. Excellent little cottage for a family ski trip to Granite Peaks!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"An updated, but classic cabin-style lodging with a fantastic view! Very cozy and comfortable, in a great location. Granite Peak is minutes away; the downtown area of Wausau with its' selection of great restaurants is even closer. We really enjoyed our stay; it will be our first choice of lodging for any future trips to the area!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great host and place to stay! It was very cozy, comfortable and clean. Pete was very clear in communication, and once we arrived everything was laid out well.

We would love to come back and will recommend to family and friends!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pete was a great host! Lots of great information. He was very quick with his responses and super helpful. The place is in a great location. I loved sitting on the couch looking out the windows at the river. The fireplace was awesome and the cabin is well stocked with anything you might need. The beds were super comfortable and the linens - wow!!! Towels - fluffy and soft, sheets - amazingly comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. It was close to everything in town but we felt like were were out in nature."
2023-10-01,4,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay. The location was excellent & view out the back of the river was wonderful! Very bright & light home. The fireplace was great & all appliances & heat worked great! Loved the neighborhood . We had a bit of rainy weather so the the fireplace was especially nice after a day of hiking & exploring. JSYK, for those with allergies like me, there were several air fresheners spread around the home. We simple moved them to the basement & it was warm enough to open the windows & air things out. I'm sure Pete would have removed them had I inquired beforehand. While we were there, there was someone living above the garage, although we had no direct contact, there was work activity going on in the parking area just outside the bedroom in the mornings which initially made for some accidental & awkward moments getting dressed & showered .hence the blackout curtains. We just rolled with it. Pete was available & responded promptly to any ques we had."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great to be so close to downtown but yet felt like we were secluded in nature. Very comfy beds and living room.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very private and cozy stay along the river. The place felt right at home and matched the description. The fire pit outside was the best to enjoy a fall evening. Pete was a great host to communicate with as well!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hidden Cove cottage lived up to its name. The cottage with a view was surrounded by trees, painted gray and white, clean and neat, inside and out.

We had everything we needed for the lake and had the bonus of both an indoor/outdoor fire pit (as described in the listing)! It was perfect to be right on the lake as we brought our own inflatable kayak; hiking/walking attractions were within 8-10 mins driving; and our favorite personal touch was Pete‚Äôs binder full of restaurants/attractions/groceries, etc. overall relaxing and enjoyable stay!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family spent a long weekend, plus a few days, at The Hidden Cove Cottage to could ski Granite Peak. As soon as we saw the lights on the Slopes as we pulled into the driveway, we knew we chose a good spot! From the outside, the Cottage appeared basic and small, but that initial appearance is deceiving! Thanks to a well laid-out floor plan, the space lives much larger than it actually is. Despite the simplicity of the external architecture (which matches the surrounding neighborhood), the contrasting black and white modern d√©cor inside brings a sense of elegance and prestige. The Kitchen is appointed with all of the tools and equipment necessary to prepare every meal...all in like-new condition. The towels, linens, and bedding (mattresses/pillows) were all high-quality, clean, and comfortable (well above what most hosts supply).
Finally, Pete! He was in almost daily contact, ensuring we had all we needed...and he kept us stocked with wood for the fireplace. We will be back!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great little house with more amenities than I realized in a quiet, quaint neighborhood. The drive to it is nice, and it‚Äôs tucked into a residential area so it feels very comfortable. Other fantastic things about this stay were the clean bedding, fairly clean, and other unexpected things like supplies for baking, tea and coffee, and just an overall warm feeling to the house. The shower is roomy and thankfully tall for my 6‚Äô6‚Äù boyfriend, and the water pressure and temperature were amazing - better than a hotel! The beds weren‚Äôt the most comfortable, and there is a mildewy smell to the home, but there is a large enough bed for a tall person and a candle and room spray make the smell livable. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives. I would definitely stay here again! üòÑ"

He was also so kind and gracious about helping me meet unforeseen circumstances and I really appreciated his graciousness and understanding. His place was pristine and it was easy to feel like I was at home. I also loved the area. Rib Mountain State Park is so beautiful and a must see.

I will always stay here when I visit Wausau if it's available."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great lower level unit, with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Close to downtown and the local hospital.

It felt like a good space. Within walking distance of Wausau sights, activities, & restaurants, so we did not have to look for parking to attend the art fair (September). We were delighted to find Minocqua Brewing presidential beer (Biden Beer and Kamala Stout) around the corner at Downtown Grocery, to the amusement and enjoyment of our families. I highly recommend Jeff and his lodging(s)."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"My friend and I had a great stay at Jeff's place-‚ÄîI was so grateful for the large couch (futon) to serve as a second bed and for the soft , comfy bedding supplied. With the bedroom having a sink/counter, that made it slick for us both to get ready in the morning. The spacious common area was pleasant to be in and just right for us. Jeff was also very responsive and accommodating to questions I had. The location near major streets and not far from highway entrances was also handy for arrival/departure and for our Mosinee outing. I would definitely stay here again!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location for everything. This home is right between downtown and Rib Mountain, so virtually endless options for restaurants and shopping as far as Wausau goes.
I needed interim housing for a work move and was here for a few months. Great neighborhood for walking my dog, and plenty of space for when my adult children came to visit.
I sincerely appreciate Analee‚Äôs responsiveness and care with all the local touches in the house. I‚Äôve come to consider Wausau my home, and that‚Äôs due to feeling at home here during my stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The main reason we picked this site was the option to cancel 24 hours before checking in. It‚Äôs very convenient to the ski resort and grocery stores. The neighborhood is very quiet. The heated bathroom floors are wonderful. The mini library sitting room is cozy. Although we did not bring our dogs, its obvious that this is a dog friendly place. The price is reasonable, it‚Äôs the additional fees that increase the expense. We had to leave very early so we didn‚Äôt clean since we had paid for cleaning. Next trip we will compare with other apps for a lower service fee. Taxes are unavoidable. Overall we had a great stay!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Thanks Analee, you made our stay very much appreciated"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very nice home for two couples and our dog when visiting for a ski weekend at Granite Peak. In a neighborhood with many houses close together but it was quiet and we rarely saw anyone walking around or driving past. What a nice surprise that both bathrooms had heated tile floors! There were a few finishes in the home that could have been completed such as trim pieces and adding a lock on main bathroom pocket door but overall this didn't affect our stay. The host had great attention to detail and everything was comfortable and cozy. Would definitely stay again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable! Host was welcoming and had good communication. We enjoyed our stay.

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,it'd a decent place
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed for the weekend and could not have been more relieved that we chose this place. From the beginning, Mai, Xao, and her team were responsive, respectful, and very understanding (as this was my first time booking an Airbnb). They were all very clear and informative and answered all of my questions. When we got to the house, the place was warmed up and felt like home! We loved the simple designs and bright lighting (although there were a few many unknown switches). Everything was provided as described in the listing and we were very well accommodated as we had everything we needed in the house. I would recommend this spot for any newcomers to the area, like we were."

2024-03-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Mai was quick to respond to my questions prior to arrival. I was very disappointed with the lack of cleanliness; bathrooms had hair in sinks, downstairs shower looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned at all. There were food remains in the kitchen sink. I still had to pay a cleaning fee, despite arriving to this. The neighborhood is a little interesting and seems on the verge of unsafe. I will say bedding and towels were clean, and the downstairs bed was comfortable."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mai is very responsive and polite.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mai was so responsive and accommodating! We loved our stay at this cute little house, it had everything we needed."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Mai and Xao were amazing hosts with a beautiful and simple home. i loved everything about our stay ü´∂üèª
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mai‚Äôs place (according to my husband,, my son, and my daughter-in-law, since I was unable to go) was cozy and clean. It was easy to find and get into. The neighborhood is what you would expect in any small-home neighborhood in the U.S.. with some neighbors being cleaner and neater than others. One big plus ‚Äî Dunkin Donuts is right down the road! Also, Mai left bottles of water and snacks at the place for us. We will try to stay at Mai‚Äôs again the next time we‚Äôre in Wausau! Great stay!! :)"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"very nice, comfortable place to stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first time using arbnb, and it was wonderful! Great communication, super easy check-in and check out, very clean, and definitely felt like home away from home. If we find ourselves back in Wausau, we will definitely see if this little gem is available. The kitchen was very set up well with everything I needed to cook for my family of 4. The olive oil and salt and pepper was a nice touch. üëå"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place was very clean and had everything we needed for our weekend stay in Wausau! Mai and Xao were super helpful.
2023-10-01,4,Group trip,"Great value for the price!
We have never experienced such great and awesome communication from hosts! Mai and her family were very responsive to requests ( provided extra pots and dishes for family meal, accommodated unexpected changes to number in our party).
We loved and were grateful for the coffee station, water, garlic, and some farm eggs.
Would love to stay again when visiting Wausau/ Steven‚Äôs Point area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed to hike in state park. Great location for getting to park, downtown , other attactions. Looked like photos. Liked the two story with bedroom and bath on both floors. It was decorated so cute and and was cozy and homelike."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I grew up in tomahawk but moved away after high school. My husband and 2 kiddos (2.5yr and 11 weeks) came out for a friends wedding and to visit family. If anyone in your family is a light sleeper you may want to find another home. We didn‚Äôt mind that the house is older and had very squeaky floors, thankfully our kids are deep sleepers. We stayed for 1 week total and would definitely stay again. I do recommend for the host to provide more towels! We didn‚Äôt ask for more because it wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker but we each only had 1 towel for the entire stay. I‚Äôm sure Mai or Xao would have provided more had we asked. We didn‚Äôt get in until 11:45pm and had easy access to the home. There was 1 bottle of water in the fridge and again, although not a deal breaker I may recommend more water be provided, only because it was too late for us to leave/stop with the kiddos.
Overall we would definitely stay again and I believe Mai and her family are truly great host who care about their airbnb business ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The place was clean and looked like the photos. Wished there were more dishes to make a bigger meal but it all was doable. What you see on the photos is exactly what is there so limited on dishes. It is an older home but it is well taken care of! The fenced in yard is great for if you do have a dog! All in all a nice place and close to stores, restaurants, parks, etc.... We visit family monthly in Wausau so we are always looking to stay in the area! Thank you for the stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Amazing!
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,James and Anna were amazing hosts! The property is beautiful and we absolutely loved our stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This was the second time staying at James and Ana‚Äôs beautiful home, and once again it was amazing! This place is awesome. It is right on the water. Whether the water is frozen over or not it‚Äôs still gorgeous. We have been there during both seasons and you will see wildlife pretty much on the daily. James is very responsive, and very friendly. When I message him he never makes me feel like anything is a bother. He even let us check in an hour early on the day we got there!
Thank you again for making our stay amazing. Even though both times haven‚Äôt been for the happiest of reasons I‚Äôm happy we didn‚Äôt have to stress over anything having to do with our stay."

I can‚Äôt thank them enough for their help with all my questions! I‚Äôll kind of miss touching base with them about my check in date, I feel like I know them now! I‚Äôll definitely be back!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"James and Anna were great! They responded quickly and were so friendly.
This house exceeded our expectations. We were in town for a funeral so not such a fun visit but this house gave us a beautiful sanctuary to come back to.
There was a living room with a tv then a nice sitting area that is perfect for reading and drinking your coffee. There is also enough room to do Yoga. I did it in front of the back door while seeing the beautiful wildlife walking by. We saw so many deer and squirrels. üêøÔ∏è
Highly recommended! Thanks James and Anna your home was Amazing!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Our stay was fantastic as third guests. The amenities were great, the location was convenient, and the host was incredibly accommodating. Overall, a wonderful experience!

The living room, with 4 recliners and big TV was a perfect place to relax. The kitchen and dining space were great for preparing meals, drinks, and for playing games.
The kitchen should be stocked with a few more plates....other than that, everything we needed was available."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely stay! Hosts were very responsive. Everything was so clean! So many amenities including makeup towels, sound machine in every bedroom, coffee, satin pillowcases and extra blankets for each room. The entire home was cozy. The hot tub along the lake at night was absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. Our kids had a great time fishing on the bank and taking the canoes out. Highly recommended!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great time. It was very peaceful, it was a beautiful home, they had many board games to play with, and all the amenities were great. My kids enjoyed playing hide and go seek and there was plenty of room for them to run around. The hosts were kind, friendly and always responsive. The home was clean and organized which is always a good feeling. I definitely would recommend it here."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Ive only wrote one other review like this... I dont want to tell everyone how great the stay was. Cause then it gets harder for me to book the days that Id like to stay again. But in all seriousness, this place (and hosts) are as good as it gets. Beautiful place, clean, great location and quiet. Will definitely be staying here again."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our 2nd stay at the House on the Hill and was just as enjoyable as in 2022. Again all went smooth and with no hitches. We appreciated Joe's friendliness and the cleanliness and all the homey decorating touches in the house. Besides the great place to stay, we found alot of fun things to do in Wausau - a great winter get away!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Joe has a very comfortable place, close to town but kinda out towards the country. The place was clean, cozy and reasonable. Joe was very responsive and no issues whatsoever. Would stay again and recommend for sure."

Especially liked the surroundings, Keurig coffee maker and flavor options, and the turntable and records to play (nice touch)! We had a bonfire one evening and Joe had everything there like he said he would! We are definitely coming back and we highly recommend this location. We also saw deer, turkeys and a red cardinal out our window."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Joe's place is simply amazing! It's close to downtown Wausau but just far enough out that it feels like a secluded cabin in the mountains. Inside the place is extremely comfortable and clean. We'll definitely stay at Joe's place again. Thank you!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This condo was spectacular!! Very clean and new with some cute touches that brought in a classic feel (a cool turntable with older records and a restored sewing machine!).

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The House on the Hill was awesome. Super cozy and private, while still being close to everything. Joe was super quick to get us dugout after a big winter storm. The storm kept us from using the fire pit and balcony, but it would have been great with how close the neighborhood deer came up by the house. Will definitely be looking to go back next time we're in the area visiting Granite Peak."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A must-stay for a couple visiting Wasau! Let‚Äôs start with the place itself: It was spotless. It was well stocked. It had great accommodations. And the view? GORGEOUS - especially off the back deck.
Now let‚Äôs talk about the host: Joe was kind. Responsive. Went above-and-beyond.
Overall, an amazing stay and we plan to stay here again for our next ski trip to Wasau!"

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Joe‚Äôs place was perfect! Communication with Joe was seamless and super easy check in. The place was super clean, cozy, and had everything we needed. About a 10 min drive to Granite Peak and less than that to everything else. The book with recommendations in the kitchen was great, especially for us not knowing the area. We loved Red Eye Brewing and next to that is a cute coffee place called Tucknee Coffee. We will definitely stay again next time we are in Wausau! Thanks Joe!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything more. It was clean and comfortable. It was in a peaceful setting. Snow covered fir trees provided a captivating view.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just awesome!!!! We came up here to ski for the weekend and loved it.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jesse‚Äôs loft was a great place for us to test drive Wausau as a future home. We enjoyed a walk in the park close by (which was suggested by Jesse‚Äôs guide book) and felt right at home in the space. It had everything we needed and is such a clever and creative use of space above the garage. Beautifully crafted space with just enough room for us all to enjoy. Major bonus that it‚Äôs pet friendly (with a fenced backyard) and separated from the house! Our dogs loved the peace and quiet of the separate loft and backyard access. Much better than a noisy hotel. Thanks again Jesse for a great stay!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place for dogs
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Clean and spacious. Location was quiet and convenient. Space had the basics stocked. Pots & pans were in great condition, which isn't usually the case at most Airbnbs. Hot tub was nice to use on a cold fall day, although be aware that it is located right next to the host's house, so if you're shy just keep that in mind. We still felt plenty relaxed in there! It was nice having a garage to park the car and the work on my bike before the Ironbull bike race. Host was friendly."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lovely place, perfect for what we needed. I‚Äôm incredibly appreciative that they allow dogs.

We enjoyed the local woods to run our doggo. We enjoyedRib Mountain-Eau Claire of the Dells and Barker Stewart Island hikes! Our favorite new hang out is the Whitewater Music Hall.
Hosts are very responsive and helped make our stay great! I would consider this a hidden gem especially for the price!"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,The only thing wrong is that the hot tub is right next to their house. When you sit up by the fire area it is cozy but you can see the family inside of their house. We didn't feel comfortable using the hot tub as it was so close to their house and patio. Everything else is wonderful there.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Amazing host! Needed a place to stay last minute due to car troubles and they were very responsive and went above and beyond to ensure I was taken care of and offered to help out with my car. Would HIGHLY recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This loft was cleverly made above a full garage and open design. Its perfect for 2 people and has a small kitchen and nice living room area as well as closet space. The backyard is nice and has a patio area for guest use.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jesse was an amazing host. We had to bring our 2 small dogs and they had an amazing fenced in back yard and he was accepting of them.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Staying at Jesse's place was an excellent experience. One couldn't expect anything better. The lovely apartment was spotless and the neighborhood peaceful. It is close to restaurants and shopping areas. We don't stay at hotels with our dog because she feels compelled to alert us to every squeak in the floor or door closing. We don't rest and I'm sure the rest of the guests aren't thrilled either. At Jesse's place our pooch was quiet as a mouse and we slept great. We would be delighted to stay there again.
Mary Alice"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great place to come ""home"" to every night after a full day of activities around Wausau. it was great to have a fenced in yard to let the dogs run a bit too. I will definitely try and stay here on my next trip to Wausau!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet and peaceful stay. Easy access to things around Wausau. Bed was very comfortable. Keep in mind that it is listed as a ‚Äúloft‚Äù so the bedroom is separate, on the other side of a half wall , but it doesn‚Äôt have a door to the bedroom . Was no problem for us but just good to know for other guests planning .
Wonderful stay !! Thank you Jesse."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We were in town for 3 nights for a wedding but we brought our dogs so the wedding party hotel was not an option.
Everything was easy and clean. We had 4 adults for 2 nights plus 2 dogs. The fenced in yard was fantastic as our little one likes to get the zoomies.
We had everything we needed. We didn't cook there but there were supplies. Plenty of blankets. We had a parking spot in the garage. If we needed anything, they were super easy to communicate with.
We left a dog toy and they let us know which we're very happy for. It was an old one but our youngest dog loves it a lot so we were able to go back for it.
We would definitely stay here again.
Even with 4 adults and the pull out couch in use, we managed to have plenty of space to move around each other."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I stayed at Jesse's air bnb for a midweek getaway. We were able to bring our dogs which was so accomdating. The girls had so much fun running in the safety of his fenced in backyard. We had a picnic at Marathon Park and walked along the river. Chopstix had great bourbon chicken for a quick meal to go. The Great Dane let us bring our dogs on the patio while we sampled their brews and menu. I definitely wish we could have stayed longer. As soon as we walked into the loft it felt like home. Definitely would stay again whenever we come back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice place!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, great location, and great to have a heated garage! Just be mindful that the bedroom is only separated from the living room by a wall not reaching the ceiling and no door.
It was missing a few kitchen basics like seizors, zip lock bags, cutting board and oven backing pan. And it only had salt and pepper which is fine, I was glad I brought my own olive oil.
Otherwise it was a good place. I never got to meet the owners who lived next door, so, I hallo from them would have been nice. But may be they were respecting my privacy."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,Jesse was awesome to work with. This was a last minute booking and he was really great about communicating. The loft was perfect for what we needed!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jesse‚Äôs place is great! Exactly as described. We‚Äôve stayed here multiple times and will continue to stay here whenever we visit the area. The large fenced in yard is also a huge hit with our dog!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. First time in Wausau and it was a solid town. Came up to ride granite peak and with garage access and a hot tub, it was perfect for me and 2 of my buddies."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,This cozy loft made for the perfect weekend stay! Our pup loved the fenced in backyard and the hot tub was truly magical in the snow.

The atmosphere was quiet so the dogs felt right at home. The garage was also very nice as we had an ice and snow storm and I did not have to scrap it every time I used it. Very grateful I could be with my husband for his surgery and still have my dogs so close that I could care for them too! Thank you Jesse!

But once we figured it out, we were surprised at how spacious the loft was. A comfortable night sleep and we recommend walking over to the After Shock Bar & Grill (7 min walk away) to grab a drink from Nancy!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,I planned a weekend getaway with my little family to go white water rafting and stayed at Jesse‚Äôs Airbnb. I was so happy to see how clean it was. Such a cozy open space layout. Down the street from Botanic Gardens and near a variety of restaurants. We enjoyed the jacuzzi and letting our beagle run around in the enclosed yard. On the first night my husband needed help turning on the Jacuzzi and Jesse came right out and even offered him something to drink. We would definitely stay again if they would have us.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Well maintained loft in a quiet neighborhood with everything you need for a comfortable and cozy stay. Loved the custom cabinets and doors!

2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wausau was just supposed to be a stopover for me, but I really enjoyed my quick visit and Jesse‚Äôs comfy cozy place is conveniently located near everything. I enjoyed visiting the nearby Monk Botanical Gardens and getting food and groceries was no problem. While close to town, Jesse‚Äôs place was in a safe and quiet neighborhood with everything I needed to relax in between driving days. It was rainy and I didn‚Äôt use the outdoor space, but it looked really nice!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great loft apartment, exactly as advertised. Very clean, well-maintained space that was perfect for my short, solo stay in town. I was only there to crash for one night's sleep while in town for the whitewater park, but it would have been a perfect spot for a longer stay. Close to town, nice, quiet neighborhood, plenty of space, comfortable bed. The only thing that was a slight issue for me is that I think someone might have had a pet cat or dog in the apartment not too long before my stay, and I am quite allergic. I knew this was a possibility going in though -- it is advertised as a pet friendly place, which I think is great (many places don't welcome furry friends). Allergy meds worked well and I got a good night's sleep."
2022-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Jesse was a very welcoming host, promptly answering any questions we had. Our accommodations were clean and the neighborhood quiet."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A great, comfy place to stay!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, comfortable, quiet and easy! Very nice stay."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wausau is a middle meeting place for a friend and I so we met here. The space is so cute! I am currently raising a service dog and was happy there were no issues to bring her. They have a wonderful back yard they is fenced in so I was able to take her out and play with her. We also felt very safe walking in the neighborhood. The place was clean and comfortable and just the right Amazon t of space for the two of us to scrapbook for a few days!
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect place to stay for our weekend getaway! It was very clean, stocked with anything we needed and Jesse was great at communicating! We‚Äôd recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Wausau area!"

2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"The loft is super comfortable in a very quiet location. Minutes from the hospital and downtown areas. Loved having a heated garage during snowing spring evenings and access to the remote garage door opener. Owner very quick to response to issue with door lock. Bed is super comfortable, too! Full kitchen was great to store and prepare food for the week!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Super great stay! We had our dogs and it was perfect with the big fenced in yard for them to play while we chilled in the hot tub from a long cold day of snowboarding.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable house!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,That was the second time we stayed at Jesse's place. The experience was great and the loft and service were impeccable as always. We can recomend this place to stay for everyone and Jesse as a superhost.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Hosts were quick to respond. Loft space with heated garage was perfect for our foursome family and two dogs, ski weekend. 10-15 minutes away from everything. Quiet neighborhood and cozy loft space. Perfect spot to rest your head after a long day on the slopes."
2022-02-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"The loft was alright. Definitely get your bang for your buck and it was very clean and had all the basic essentials. However, the ‚Äúprivate hot tub‚Äù wasn‚Äôt very private it was located next to the back porch on the far side of the owners house so we had to walk through the unshoveled path to the hot tub which is about 50 ft from the loft. Also the shower was disappointing‚Ä¶ water pressure too high, too small for my bf of 6‚Äô3 to fit properly, and only mens body wash & sauve shampoo and conditioner (which I won‚Äôt use). Someone parks in the garage right underneath the bed in the loft and it‚Äôs a loud garage door‚Ä¶"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great little place. Jesse was very quick to respond, accommodating, and helpful. Really good value for a place to stay while skiing for a couple days at Granite Peak."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place and location and awesome value for pet approved place too.
2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jesse‚Äôs place is very clean and well appointed. One has everything they might need and it‚Äôs a great stay. If one has questions Jesse is very kind and easy to communicate with. I hope to return. Thank you Jesse.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was our second stay at the Burek house and we felt right at home. The backyard is wonderful for the dogs and to just sit and enjoy the weather. My grandson was visiting a couple of the days and he liked running around in the backyard. We plan to stay here every time we come to Wausau. Beds are extremely comfortable. Aleksandra is wonderful and responsive and this was overall a great stay.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,Had a great extended stay. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I throughly enjoyed this home. It's cozy and clean.

The hosts thought of everything we might possibly need/want during our stay and had it on-hand there, easily accessible! All of the amenities here were just what we were looking for, and it truly was a weekend full of rest, relaxation, and quality family time together while visiting my mother-in-law. She was impressed too! And we slept so well on the memory-foam mattresses and super-soft bedding in the rooms on the main level (didn't need to utilize the bed or futons downstairs but loved that the home had multiple options for sleeping arrangements). You have a beautiful home here and we'll 100% be looking to stay here again anytime we visit Wausau! THANK YOU!!!!!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed our brief Stay
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,it actually has an extra bed in the basement which was also very nice.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Your space was perfect for my family and I. Including Daisy, my puppy. Daisy especially loved the fenced in yard, toy box and windows to watch the neighborhood squirrels and rabbits. As a runner and dog walker I loved the nearby trails. So beautiful. Was able to run to Duck island. One of my hangouts as a teen back in the late 70‚Äôs. It was a great space to decompress after busy days saying goodbye to my dad. Lots of places to sleep, perfect amenities, super clean. Close to groceries, great coffee, and restaurants. Thank you üòä"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Comfortable beds, clean place! The fenced in backyard was great for the dogs too."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Good location on quiet street but had dog hair all over the couch. Also had some trouble with the lock upon check-in. After travelling for 4 hours with a toddler, it was kind of a hassle to have to deal with an incorrect door code. Luckily the back door was unlocked for some reason so we were able to get in without waiting the hour that it took the host to respond. It would be helpful if checkout instructions were printed instead of sent via the app because I'm not always on my phone and don't really want to be receiving another message during my trip."

They had a leash, dog dish, dog food if you forgot yours, poop scooper, dog bags, and even a basket with toys in! Just amazing! We walked 4 miles each day and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful and there is a park, Schofield Park, almost 2 blocks away which we walked to! The park runs alongside the Wisconsin River! Pretty area! Both were very responsive with any questions and check in was simple! We loved that we could open the door up from the kitchen and let our dog out into the fenced in backyard and not have to go outside of the house at all! There is a patio table and chairs to sit at outside and there is a grill, but we did not use it at all! We definitely will be back, very nice place! Thank you!"

It was perfect for being able to walk our dog. We are SO appreciative of pet-friendly places, and this made our girl feel right at home. Cozy, comfy, adorable, and CLEAN‚Ä¶like, spotless. Crisp towels and bedding, Roku TV & Wi-Fi, full basement with washer/dryer, great kitchen with everything you need‚Äîice cubes made, ziplock bags, even dog bowls if you forget yours! Also close to anything you‚Äôll need like groceries, take-out, etc. We very much look forward to visiting again!"

It is an older home but they have made it feel a bit more updated, especially the bathroom that was pristine. Quiet walkable neighborhood. Great fenced in back yard for our dog. Cozy bed with a luxury feel and lots of towels! The kitchen literally had everything but the food! Loved sitting out back on the patio area. We did not use the garage but we would if there had been bad weather or snow. Much better than a hotel! Great hosts. Next time we will bring a peppy toy to share. :)"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very responsive to messages. She worked with me on whatever I requested.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We stayed at Yuliia's place last minute on a whim to visit Wausau. She was super quick to respond. Her place was in a great location to walk to downtown or to the local art museums. The place itself was clean, cozy and welcoming. Follow Yuliia's directions to the ally and it's super easy to find."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Family members gathered in Wausau for a stay including Mother‚Äôs Day weekend. Some stayed with our grand-daughter and her family who live in Wausau, and the rest of us stayed at Gary‚Äôs Airbnb. The airbnb was a very short walk from our grand-daughter‚Äôs, scoring very high for convenience. My husband and I slept in an amazingly comfortable king bed on the main level, while the others stayed upstairs (also very comfortable beds). They raved about the rooms, especially the beautiful master bedroom suite and bathroom. I did not go upstairs myself because of an ankle issue and the fact that the steps seemed too challenging for me, despite the sturdy handrails. Other, younger members of the family had no problems, dashing up and down. Gary mentioned the steps so we were not taken by surprise. The house was very well kept up, rooms were large, furniture was comfortable, d√©cor thoughtfully chosen, the kitchen well-equipped, and the porch great for hanging out. We will happily return."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"The home was warm and charming! The kitchen clean and had everything one would need to cook in! Beds very comfortable! Front porch was a delight to have your morning coffee!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very comfortable home with great living space for our group. Great decor with thoughtful amenities. Off street parking for our 3 vehicles. Appreciated the use of the garage for our bikes and hiking gear. Gary quickly responded to our questions. Very nice linens. A welcoming place that was really nice to come home to after each day hiking the Ice Age Trail.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,fabulous house. beautiful inside and out. my siblings and I had quality time together in a comfortable beautiful place. it was special. we will all be back and reserve this home again. Gary the Host is a super host.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The pictures did not lie everything you see is what you got. It was so clean! The beds were very comfortable. The house was very comfortable and spacious. I loved that it had 4 bathrooms! I also loved that pets were not allowed. I love animals so much and wish I didn‚Äôt have severe allergies but unfortunately for me that is not the case. It is very hard for me to find a place to stay that doesn‚Äôt allow pets these days so I end up having really bad allergies and can‚Äôt really enjoy my time away from home. This placed allowed me to enjoy my time away and feel like I was right at home.
The home owners also left a gift baskets full of snacks that my kids loved! If I were to stay in Wausau again I would definitely hope this home was available and I would definitely book it again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay, house was comfortable and quiet neighborhood was able to rest well after a long day of work."

2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Great spot to stay when heading to Granite Peak
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"A few days before our trip Carlos sent a message regarding check-in and instructions. When the date came this made it extremely easy to find the house, get in, then settle in according to house rules. We saw there was an attached garage which we thought would be very useful being it was winter when we took our trip. I messaged Carlos about using it and I got an immediate response. We were able to pull into a clean empty garage so we could unload our luggage inside. This was very handy throughout the trip. When booking this house the things that stuck out most were the location and the cleanliness, both of which made the trip very enjoyable. The location of the home advertised that it was a short drive to Granite Peak which was true and even on a snow day the drive was short and easy. Not only was it close to the ski hill but other places such as, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. We had a 5 star stay at this cozy home in Wausau WI, and I would absolutely recommend this to others!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The place was clean and spacious. The welcome snacks and bottled water were a treat. Would stay here again.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed here during the holidays while visiting local family. The home office was a bonus for the days i needed to telework.
The house is well appointed, very clean, and cozy. Beds were comfortable and plentiful (two of the queen bed rooms also have bunk beds).
The kids loved the huge upstairs TV and comfortable lazy boys.
They welcomed us with a gift basket of snacks and chocolates--above what hosts usually do.
Will certainly stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,We were thrilled with this house. The decor and size of the rooms far exceeded our expectations. I think it is the best AirBnb we have ever stayed at. The home has many new upgrades. My son loved the huge TV. He found the game room the day we left and wants to come to Wausau again just to stay in this house. I loved the detailed labeling throughout the house. Very easy to find items. Thank you so much!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,Great stay! Perfect for our family that was in the area for a wedding at granite peak!

Beds were wonderful, welcome snacks were delicious, and the location was excellent for accessing downtown. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house, clean and thoughfully stocked up. We all had a very comfortable stay, kids enjoyed the games in the basement. Will stay there again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family loved Carlos' place! He thought of everything - it accommodated our needs so well... AND it felt just like home! We came home at the end of a long day and looked forward to relaxing. Having bathrooms on each floor was a bonus and the fenced in back yard was great for the kids to play with no worries. Location is convenient for getting around anywhere in the Wausau and surrounding area as it is right off the main expressway. The neighborhood is quiet and well kept. We didn't need to use the basement, but it looked great for work and fun. I highly recommend this place and would absolutely stay there again. Thanks Carlos!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,good place for everything.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home was very clean and cozy. The decor really fit with the lake house theme. My wife and kids very much enjoyed fishing off the dock for sunfish and perch. You can't beat the lake view from the back porch and living room.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect spot to stay while visiting family. Home was just exactly what we needed to have a quiet weekend with a gorgeous backdrop. Loved the wide open space, tons of seating options. Would definitely consider starting again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,perfect place for 3 friends who had t seen each for over 40 years to reunite! The decor was peaceful and welcoming! I would recommend friends to stay here.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Extremely clean and well stocked. Local host was very quick to respond to questions. Would love to have kayaks or canoes available. Lake not suitable for swimming due to algae and seaweed but good for fishing. Enjoyed the county fair rodeo near by and Rib Mountain State Park.
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Had a wonderful stay at this home. Our guest contact Mercedes, helped us along the way. The house was clean, comfortable, and a great space to catch up with friends. We will for sure be back!"
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"The cottage was just what we need for a weekend ski trip. It‚Äôs located <10mins away from Granite Peak so it was easy to get there and back.
The Evolve team was easy to reach. I accidentally booked the stay for 4 guests but I reached out via email and we were able to add a 5th guest no problem. Later on I asked to add 2 more guests but the request was denied because the cottage only sleeps 6 people. I mentioned the 7th person had no problem sleeping on the couch for 2 nights but the request was still denied. While I understand I booked a place that said ‚Äúsleeps 6‚Äù, it seemed to me like a request they could easily accomodate to add one more person given they would just take the couch.
Even still, we had a nice stay and can‚Äôt really complain. The Evolve team was responsive so our friends were able to make a reservation elsewhere."
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Nice place to wind down after a day of skiing. Would return
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Such a pretty home with such a pretty view! Booked for a bday ski trip with friends and it was perfect. It was only 15 minutes away from Granite peak and right in the middle of just about everything you could‚Äôve needed. The book filled with instructions and Restraunt recommendations was so nice, as well as the little book you get to sign at the end of your stay. Water heater had broke last minute before check in, Host communicated everything and was so nice, was updated all the way through. Loved staying here would recommend and do it again!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great, updated home on the water. The location was quiet yet close to amenities."
