2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,House was perfect everything we were looking for. It was in a good central location and beautiful neighborhood. We will be back in November and will stay in this house again if available.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here! The home is spacious and has nearly anything you could possibly need. We were very comfortable, enjoyed the pool and the patio area. It’s a very quiet, nice neighborhood. Rhi is very responsive with messages. It was super easy to find and check in and check out. We will definitely stay here again!!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"great place, very spiffy and had all the things we needed. Would come here again definitely"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Lovely home! Safe peaceful neighborhood. Hope to return again in the future!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for this very special place, do not hesitate to wash everything is perfect"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very comfortable house in a quiet neighborhood. It was clean, light, and bright. The pool was delightful. The kitchen was very well stocked."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My friend and I were ending our trans-Atlantic cruise in Fort Lauderdale and drove to Cape Coral to meet another friend who lives in Ft. Myers. We were looking for a home with a pool, near good food and room for all of us. We found that at Dolphin Villa.
We found the home to be in very clean and working order. There was lots of places for seating and enough separate areas to relax. The pool is enclosed in a screen area and was an optimal temperature for swimming or floating around. There is a small refrigerator outside and a serving counter for any snacks.
One thing to be aware is that the Main Bedroom bed is very high and requires a step to get in and out of. It was ok for us but may be an issue for some others. The queen beds in the other two rooms are very firm but comfortable.
The owner really gave thought to coffee lovers with a coffee station that had everything you need to make a great start to your day.
We highly recommend Dolphin Villa."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home! Thank you for everything ☀️
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a lovely airbnb. Everything was great: location, cleanliness, and the overall space was nice and open. Master bedroom was soooo nice. The only downside is that there is work being done to the house next to it and it’s very loud out by the pool almost all day. Not anything you can do about that, but it is a damper on the pool days if that’s what you book it for. We still had a great trip!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. everything was as described. Would stay here again next time we come down.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I enjoyed this space! It was decorated lovely, and the pool area is lighted wonderfully for evening swims. The home is large with two areas to hang out, two kitchen table spaces, and a very large kitchen. Although we didn't cook or eat there, the kitchen is fully accommodating with many dishes, and accessories to cook a full meal. There were games to use, a radio for music, floats to float in the pool with, towels and some toiletries if you forgot to bring shampoo.
We didn't use the beautiful master bedroom and adjoining bathroom and shower as there wasn't a closet to hang our things, this is locked for the owners, but there are plenty of dressers if you fold your clothes. Instead opted to use the smaller of the rooms, with closets, near an additional bathroom which connected directly to the pool for easy in and out showers to support a clean pool. Definitely a great space for a family gathering.
Beautiful Home - Highly Recommend!!"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dolphin Villa was great for our family! The home was very welcoming and clean and felt like home. The easy access to laundry, the pool door leading right into the bathroom, a kitchen with everything a family could need and plenty of space. The family spent endless hours outside in the pool. The house had lots of beach towels, beach chairs, sand toys and a cooler for every adventure we took. The house itself was 5 stars, however we did run into some longer commutes to go into Ft. Myers because we had to cross over the river, so that might be something to consider. We would definitely book this house again and will recommend it to others."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was perfect! Immaculately clean with everything that you could possibly need!
2023-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"Cute house and good location for our visit with local family. Great layout and well, the pool, the pool, and the pool. Great to just get up in the morning and head out to the pool deck while the family each wandered out too as they started their day. Even a bonus that the neighborhood layout was perfect to bring my bike and get in a good number of miles while staying off main roads."

Kitchen has all extra appliances! There was a tv in every room (made rainy evenings easy). My kids loved the serving window in the kitchen and I loved that they didn’t need to track in pool water for a bottled water. I loved the courtyard entrance to the house. It was so inviting!

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,You can expect great things from Rhi's listings. This was a new listing when we booked but we went by the great reviews of Rhi's other properties to feel confident that this would be the same. We were not disappointed. The house was even better than we expected. The pool was wonderful. The neighborhood was great for morning walks. The location was convenient for everything.
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"This home is fantastic. The pool was perfect, even with the cold weather we dealt with. The house has everything and was perfect for our vacation . There were even beach supplies, sun tan lotion,chairs,cooler, and towles for us to use."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great AirBnB. I use this service a lot and this was, by far, the best. First off, it is a beautiful home - very clean and easy to keep clean. It's a wonderful neighborhood and not too far away from things.
It definitely has a more ""home-y"" feel since it is livable - it's not just a house with furniture and otherwise empty. There are a lot of useful things, cleaning supplies, extras, and good amenities. We flew in so we weren't able to bring a bunch of stuff that we needed for days at the beach, but they had it covered. There were beach towels, chairs, coolers, to-go containers, suntan lotion, etc.
The kitchen is fully stocked with supplies; pots and pans, utensils, etc. which was very helpful since we were there for about a week. They had extra toiletries like toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, etc. which were a lifesaver (I left my toothbrush at a hotel)."
2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place in quiet safe part of town.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I wish i could give more stars than 5 because Henela and the property were absolutely amazing. If you’re considering staying here i would stop looking at other places and book this one!
They had so many additional amenities, the place was beyond clean, i never once’s had concerns of hygiene or safety during our stay. You can really tell they put in a lot of effort to the quality of your stay.
The location is also perfect!! you have grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, literally anything you could need with in a max 15 minute drive.
I have no complaints whatsoever and will definitely be staying here again in the future! Thank you guys so much once again!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful place very easy to communicate and very thorough instructions!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Helena's duplex was great. The place was very clean and very well equipped with pots, pans, cups, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, ROKU Smart TV's, beach chairs and floaty ""noodles"". If you're looking for a comfortable, private place to stay that feels more relaxed than a Hotel, this is a nice spot. We never even saw the neighbors. Helena was very easy to communicate with and got back to us quickly.
The duplex is located right in the middle of Cape Coral and only a short drive from this local neighborhood strip. However, if you're looking for beach access, it's about 25-30 mins away depending on which beach. Totally fine, but having a car is must.
The unit was clean, comfortable, and well maintained. There were a few very minor fit an finish issues, but nothing that disturbed our stay and similar to any kind of stuff that you'd find in a regular hotel room. Would visit again."

I really appreciated that Hang has it so that you feel as though you truly are renting an entire home: you can control the pool, even access the garage with an opener provided!
The home was spotlessly clean, had a bountiful supply of towels, clean linen, well appointed kitchen, fantastic laundry and all round excellent - down to a fireplace and random wild bunnies in the backyard.
The bathrooms are all spacious, the rooms are spread out, the surroundings are so calm and peaceful. We felt truly rested and comfortable.

The pool and backyard were very useful and the perfect size. The one piece of feedback we would give is that it could use more toilet paper, paper towels, and trash bags. The first day or so were provided for, but we were there for 6 days and definitely needed extra. All in all, we couldn’t get enough of this place and would recommend it to anyone! It felt like a vacation within itself!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,The home is beautiful but our favorite part was the lanai and pool area. It was so relaxing.

2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"MUST SEE!!! We used the house as our base for a destination wedding in Sanibel and it was worth every penny. It was significantly cheaper than renting a hotel on the island and only a short drive to town where they have lots of restaurants and things to do. Irina is also a great hostess.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is very elegant as in the pictures. Very spacious and very well equipped. The pool is great, warm and for those who stay longer, I would recommend to rent a boat and park it in the canal in front of the house. We have been there with small children - it migh be scary that they might break something in this well equipped house with kids, but finally, the nice things are high enough and the kids understood very well to respect nice things. Regarding the Cape Coral, it’s very residential, you definitely need the car (or boat), but it’s a nice stop and change from the busy areas. And It was great to communicate with Irina - very quick response and precise. We loved our stay!"
2019-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Irina was the best hostess! She was super quick to respond when we needed her. The house was absolutely stunning, with the pool being our favorite spot. We will be back!"

My kids are already asking when we can go back!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A great place to stay! Very clean home with a great layout. Stayed with wife and 4 year old. Pool area is spacious and since the home faces East, the sun is off the pool by 6pm so dinner on the patio can be enjoyed without being too hot or blinded by the setting sun. Only 35 minutes to Sanibel Island Lighthouse Beach and 60 minutes to Captiva North End Beach (much calmer water, less wind). Very clear why Irina is a Super Host - responded very quickly to all communication. Already considering this place for a trip next year!"

It is perfect. The pool and lanai, the canal with a dock for fishing, the Jacuzzi tub, the huge walk in shower, the comfortable beds, the relaxing living room, the garage with opener, the awesome kitchen loaded with everything you need to prepare and enjoy a gourmet meal.
The list just keeps on going. She responds very quickly. The value of her home based on all the amenities is a pure steal!
Only two of us but could easily entertain a group of six!
Located close enough to get to all the major beaches.
Trust me you will not want to leave when the time comes."

2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Irina's place is really, really nice! My wife, 7 month old and I stayed here this week and really enjoyed it.

We vacationed there with two other couples and had plenty of room and privacy as all the bedrooms have their own bathroom.
We will definitely visit again!"
2019-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"We had an amazing stay at Irina’s place. The house was beautiful, clean, beds were comfortable, pool was great. A group of us traveled in for a wedding in Fort Myers and it was a very convenient location only about a 25 minute drive in.

We will definitely be staying here again.
2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a great home in Cape Coral. It was a beautiful and clean home with many upgrades. The pool was always very warm and enjoyable.

2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Irina’s place was beautiful and so well cared for. Check in was a breeze and location was fantastic! Irina responded promptly with any questions we had. We definitely plan on returning.
2019-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"Irina's three bed / three bath home is gorgeous, clean, and in a very nice neighborhood. Two of the rooms have en suites while the other bedroom has the bathroom just outside of the room. We enjoyed our stay in her home. It's a short drive to Sanibel / Captiva Island.
We planned the last day of our trip, which happened to be the nicest to hang out by the pool. Unfortunately, the pool heater was not working. The waterfall is how the pool heats and that water was the same temp as the pool water. The pool thermometer was not working either, so we could not see what the exact temperature of the water was at, but it felt to be around the 70s. I texted her about the heater not working and she was prompt to respond, however, she could not find a technician to come and look at it. She even offered to come look at it herself.
It was a bummer we didn't get to get in the pool, but the location was great for all the other activities we wanted to do!"
2019-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great house and location for visiting people in the Cape Coral area. Very clean and has everything you will need. even better in person!

2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Irina has a beautiful home in a beautiful location, I did not want to leave!! The house had everything you need. I would 100% stay there again."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The property is absolutely beautiful with lots of tasteful touches and was sparkling clean upon our arrival. The Jacuzzi jet tub was absolutely WONDERFUL so I enjoyed taking many baths during our stay. The weather was cooler than normal during our stay so Irina agreed to increase the pool temp for us for a nominal fee. It was totally worth it as the pool is great! The waterfall feature pours warm water into the pool when the heater is on. We didn't have a boat but I found the dock to be a great place to get some sun and do yoga while overlooking the water which is full of wildlife. I imagine fishing off the dock would yield very successful results. Another fantastic feature was the cascading sliding glass doors that allow you let the inside in if desired. Every feature/fixture/appliance was top notch and I would rent any property from Irina knowing that I'll be taken care of with her exceptional hospitality. Thanks again Irina!
-Amanda"

It's everything the photos show and much more. Irina was always one text away if we needed anything. We've spent our share in ""paradise"" ie: Caribbean, Hawaii and Cancun on many occasions and we feel this tops the cake. We were even married on Kauai's Northern Coast of Princeville. If you're looking at this home as a vacation option...... my question is, what are you waiting for? 😄"

We easily visited Captiva, Sanibel, and Ft Myers Beaches as they were quite close by. There was everything and more to cook with in the kitchen, and nice restaurants close by. We LOVED our stay and would highly recommend it. ~Diana"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Irina, thank you for sharing your home with us.

2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My family came to Cape Coral for a funeral. My initial encounter with Irina during such a difficult time was appreciated because she promptly notified us if she had availability and made our entire experience with planning accommodations stress free. The house is beautifully decorated, spacious and has anything you think you may need in a home. To save money my family was able to cook our meals but the neighborhood is close to restaurants, shopping and grocery stores. If I came to this area for vacation I would not even look for a hotel. I would definitely try to stay at Irina's home again."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"spent 5 nights at this location and it was great. Three nicely appointed bedrooms, two great bathrooms and a well stated kitchen and living room. I would suggest that if you are saying here, bring soap and shampoo. What was provided compared to other spots was at best minimal. I do not expect soap and shampoo to be at any rental, but having it at every previous stay made it feel expected. The outdoor space is great. A caveat to those using the lounge chairs around the pool: Do not lean back to far.
Great place, ould stay again for certain. My two demerits are minimal at best"

The property was impeccably clean and spacious. The private pool was a definite highlight, along with the screened in porch with the outdoor tv. The gym equipment in the garage was a great bonus, Check in was a breeze and had no issues for the duration of our stay.
Jonathan was incredibly accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. He also gave us recommendations on places to go in the area.
The locations was perfect I felt safe by myself when my fiancé went golfing. There are golf courses that are all between 10-30 minutes away. There is also plenty of restaurants (our favourite was The Jungle Bird Tiki Bar) and grocery stores in the area.
We highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway! Thank you Jonathon :)"

2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"From the time we checked in to check out, Brett was awesome and helping us with anything that we needed. It was the most beautiful place. I have rented on Airbnb and was worth every penny. I had brought my family down there for a mini vacation and it was beautiful, the surroundings, the sunrise, the Jacuzzi, the swimming pool, the spaces kitchen the bathrooms. I can’t say enough."
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing location , great host. Stunning view and back yard. We had a great time and the cage around the backyard helped tons with the bugs we were able to sit outside all evening . Pool stays clean at all times and no Bugs day or night."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. Somehow this home was even better than the pictures. The house is modern, VERY clean and bright. The location is convenient from the airport and beautifully placed on the waterfront. The massive patio was partially covered creating an amazing indoor/outdoor space. The heated pool was massive and great for swimming laps and a larger square area was where we played catch with the kids. The spa was perfect and easy to use. It heated right away and was the perfect way to begin each day with breathtaking views of the sun rising over the water. The sun has full sun until late afternoon (important to us). The dock with tiki hut was a great place for lunch and fishing and we loved kayaking around the bay. The kitchen was well appointed and the beds/bedding very comfortable. There was a separate suite with a large bedroom, private bath, expansive counter space & beverage fridge with a comfortable recliner. It was a privilege to stay at Skyline Dr and we hope to return!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Amazing stay all around. The place is gorgeous. We’d stay another night if it wasn’t booked by someone else. We did feel like 10am check out was a bit early and wished it was at least 11am or 12pm, but on the other side they do offer early check in when it’s possible. So can’t complain too much :) would definitely book again and for longer stay next time!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"This place was beautiful!!!! The house and the amenities were amazing.

Our kids spent most of their time in the pool/ spa, fishing on the water and kayaking around the lake. Everything was spotless, there was plenty of clean sheets and towels and we felt right at home within the first hour. There were tons of fireworks on New Years eve that made the night unforgettable. Brhett was a great host, who even drove over to help with a couple of extra beds for our kids. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet and close to the Cape Coral strip for dinner and bars. I would recommend this house to anyone looking to enjoy a great vacation in Cape Coral. A+ vacation!"

We booked the house to celebrate my wife's birthday with her siblings. Unfortunately, we lost their father the week before check-in. While we contemplated canceling, they decided this would be a great retreat to relax, recoupe, and reset.
We will definitely visit again."

Note that one bedroom is detached from the house and can only be accessed from the pool area."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home is stunning! The pool is majestic especially as the sun shines over the lake. The neighborhood is exceptionally quiet. The home has everything a large family needs and could want. Don’t hesitate. Book this property quickly.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Overall, we had a wonderful weekend. Together, we were 3 families, and everyone made positive comments throughout the weekend about the property. The view is spectacular. The house is very spacious and modern. The furniture in the living room is very modern but not practical for lounging, a little hard for sitting and watching movies but does look great. Everything we needed to enjoy the property was there, all cooking appliances, outdoor activities, water activities, etc. more than enough towels, chairs and floats for everyone to enjoy. AC was awesome and cooled the home wonderfully. The home was stocked with more than enough toilet paper which is always a plus. All TVs fans and lights were labeled and easy to operate. The beds were very comfortable. The master bedroom was missing blinds but the host came and resolved the issue quickly. Sheets could have been washed better so we did wash those again before using. Beautiful home and vacation spot for families to enjoy. ❤️❤️"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful stay! Very peaceful and beautiful location. The house was equipped with every thing you may need to have fun in the pool, chairs for the beach, a couple of paddle boats and even fishing polls!
Lots of great restaurants nearby and you don’t have to drive far for anything you may need.
I hope to stay again with my family in the future."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This house is truly spectacular, we were so lucky to find such a gem of a place!
It has a real wow factor especially the pool/patio area and the view especially at sunrise is so serene. Kayaking off the dock in the canal was a real bonus too…my husband and I made it all the way to the mangroves…about 1.5 hr trip, a great way to start the day!
The house is pristine and well equipped with very comfortable beds and with more than enough space for our extended family of seven.
Thank you Brhett and Teresa for being such gracious hosts and being so responsive….we can’t wait to return!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Amazing place, so much space… great pool for swimming in the morning with an amazing view. Only negative is that we couldn’t stay longer… if we are ever going to be in the area again we will make sure we stay longer!"

Bhrett and Teresa are phenomenal hosts. Responsive via text and proactive with recommendations.
My family was blown away and have already been looking at dates to book this home next year."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Have done over 30 rentals in the course of 1 year and it’s by far the best home. Brhett is so accommodating and the pics do not do this place justice. It’s a must a see
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We’ve frequented Florida over the last 10 years, staying at a handful of places from here, Naples and marco island. This has been by far the most amazing place! The house was stunning, the layout was incredible, kids had an absolute blast. We fished every morning and kayaked. We can’t wait to go back! Brhett was extremely helpful with everything!"

Recommended for quality and pricing."

He also kept in constant contact with us. The house was absolutely beautiful. My kids and husband could not get enough of the pool, hot tub and fishing off the dock. The area was also great for taking long walks each morning to take in the beautiful scenery. I would recommend this house."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stayed here with 3 generations of family for a wedding weekend age ranging from 18months to 67years. Beautiful space and serene location.

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We used Brhett's wonderful home as our base for a business trip to Florida. The home has isolated bedrooms/bath combinations, stylish and functional community spaces, and much more charm than a hotel. The back yard, with the pool and lake, is private and serene. Brhett is an attentive host, making our stay easy and enjoyable. We hope to be back soon!"

2023-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful place and the host was very responsive and helpful. Unfortunately, the internet went out during our less than 24-hour stay, and service in the area was bad to use a hot spot. As this was a work trip, this was very inconvenient. For this price, I also envisioned toiletries in the bathroom and coffee options available. We had a few pods for single-serve cups but no other coffee supplies (sugar, cream, etc.) For the short stay we had, we enjoyed the comfortable accommodations but wanted to provide that feedback for future guests."
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Brhett’s vacation property is a perfect getaway. Peace with amenities and next to the water is the perfect combination. Brhett was very accommodating and responsive before during and even after.

Everything we needed was there- beach towels, extra blankets, cooking utensils, coffee pot, detergent and dishwasher pods. Highly recommend!"

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Skyline Paradise was perfect! We had two families, a total of 9 people and had plenty of space. The kitchen had plenty of utensils and supplies to cook anything we wanted. The views are beautiful, the pool and hot tub area are resort like, you will not want to leave. The dock area is perfect for fishing, our kids fished everyday and caught a lot of fish. Anything we needed was within a 5-10 minute drive. There are two marinas about 5 minutes away that have great restaurants. Great location and home! I can’t say enough about how much we enjoyed this trip."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were lucky enough to book this ultra modern luxury vacation home on short notice. Such a spacious and clean place to stay! We loved the panoramic views of the open Gulf water from the bedrooms, living room and lanai. We ate our breakfast out on the dock under the Tiki hut each morning and enjoyed the fresh air. I loved how much seating there was, between the lounge chairs, the table outside on the lanai, the dining room table, the barstools and of course modern leather couches in the living room. This home is special because it has a mother in law suite that we turned into the kids area and it was nice and separate but still only a few steps away from everything. Restaurant, beach and downtown activities were on a short drive away. We loved our trip, and we will definitely stay at our Skyline Paradise Home again!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time in Henelas house, it is exactly as described, spacious and conveniently equipped. After 2 weeks into our vacation we definitely enjoyed the possibility to wash and dry our clothes in well working machines. Also the option to use the barbecue was very welcome for one of our meals. All in all: we can clearly recommend Henelas place, it’s a perfect centrally located hub to tour the region. Just one remark for visitors: the Ft. Myers / Cape Coral area still shows some reminiscences of hurricane Ian (only 6 months ago), therefore some beaches in the area still have to be cleaned and fixed before reopening. Please check out in advance if you are aiming at visiting specific beaches or islands."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great place
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great week at this location, with our family of 4. Nice quiet neighborhood and super responsive host. The pool worked great, after we got some working AA batteries in the remote on the second day and got the heating situation figured out. Few quick comments: We ran out of laundry detergent and hand soap. We were not able to get the main TV to work for family movie nights. It would not connect to the internet (which worked great). The other TVs in the house worked great. Some of the remotes were also out of batteries, which added to the frustration with trying to get the big one to work. Some of the pillows in the house were a bit cheap and inconsistent, especially in the beds with multiple beds. Host tried to fix what she could from afar."
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,"What a beautiful place! This was our first time renting from AIRBNB and we were not 100% how it worked. We were there for a family reunion celebration at my sisters located down the street. I would definitely return to this location and AirBNB. Sophie and Julia were very responsive, we did not hace to reaching out to them the whole week due to instructions left for us.
Thank you !
Nicole and Derek Horne"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice house, we tried to treat it as our own. No vacuum for a long term rental had to use a friend of ours. All the neighbors wish we would rent it all the time..some of the quietest neighbors they have ever had. Wish there would have been some written explanation of how to run pool and tv. Otherwise enjoyed our stay."

The house was very spacious, beautifully decorated, cozy and immaculately clean. The home had everything you could possibly need for a fun family vacation. Cape Coral itself is a very nice area, conveniently located near plenty of stores, restaurants, and specialty shops.. yet the home is tucked away in a very peaceful nook of the neighborhood.

2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"We loved our time here! A fresh, beautiful new home to hit relaxation mode and hang by the pool. High end linens, decor, amazing kitchen to cook in, grill area. Felt like a little pottery barn/ west elm home. Everything you need is thought of. There’s not a lot to do in this area, so rent bikes, book a boat, dolphin cruise or do a day trip to Sanibel or Ft Myers Beach. Thanks Angie for a great stay!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Angie was a fantastic host and her home was absolutely beautiful!! The pool was a huge hit and the location was peaceful. We saw lots of wildlife in the canal - including a dolphin. My husband loves to fish (catch and release) and he caught several different species. It was one of the best family vacations we’ve taken.
I also want to compliment Angie on how well she stocked the kitchen. I love to cook and had everything I needed. It’s nice to be in a kitchen with quality cookware and utensils!! I highly recommend Angie’s home and we plan to stay again next time we’re in Florida."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Five stars is not enough for this place! Beautiful home just like the pictures. Loved opening the sliding door wall and just walking back and forth in and out of the house. We felt like we were at our own private resort! The pool is big and clean. I love salt pools and this one especially as you barely notice the salt after feeling (if that makes sense). We were there the very end of Nov so the sun never hit the pool but it was still just warm enough to enjoy. We had a friend stop by to see the place and she loved it so much she is booking for her family visiting next month :)
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Amazing property! Perfect place to stay for an extended vacation. The home has everything you need and more. We will absolutely stay here again!

Thank you Angie!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wow! Wow! Wow! What a stunning home-absolutely beautiful in every way. It is heavenly. If you do decide to leave, it is to get groceries and come right back. Angie is incredibly responsive and helpful with everything. You will love it here!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Read all the reviews, then double it! Beautiful home with everything you need. The kitchen was wonderful with high end appliances. Bedrooms were very comfortable, great beds. We had a group of 3 couples, and it was hard for us to venture out away from the pool, the view, and the vibe. Neighborhood is very safe and walkable. We met many of the neighbors on our walks. Angie was a top notch host, very responsive and helpful. Our group was amazed how fast the time flew, and were sad to have to leave."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place and wonderful hosts. Pictures did not do the home justice and the waterfront setting was ideal. House has everything you need to have a resort-like experience. Angie was incredibly proactive in her communication and was a joy to work with anytime we had a question or needed some guidance. Pool was awesome and we enjoyed all of the home's amenities. Great experience for us during a long-term stay.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Angie's place is so gorgeous! Extremely high end furnishings and decor. Spotless. Very livable and comfortable even though it looks right out of Architectural Digest. Angie has thought of everything! You will feel right at home in this super luxurious getaway.

The house was immaculate, no clutter, modern, new and very clean. No detail was overlooked. Everything you could possibly need for our 43 day stay, even a Vitamix blender for our morning smoothies and margaritas!
Fishing right off the dock and a place to put your boat.
Angie was very responsive if we had questions or if anything needed didn’t work, it was taken care of right away.
We wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. Perfect!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Greatest host ever.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're reading this review, I assume you're considering booking here—stop thinking and DO IT! I visited Angie's house in Cape Coral with two friends, and we all agreed this was hands down the best AirBnB any of us have ever stayed in. After we stopped oohing and aahing at the house itself—the high ceilings, the furniture, the baskets of amenities, the gorgeous lanai & pool, the high-end appliances, and the beautiful decorations—we settled in to enjoy one of the most relaxing vacations we've ever had.
We stocked up on groceries, then spent most of the week just enjoying the space. We plugged into the gigantic monitor in the office and got some work done, watched TV on the enormous screen in the living room, floated in the perfectly-temperatured pool, did some grilling, watched a thunderstorm and sunsets from the comfort of the lanai, and did our best to pretend it was real life and we weren't only there on vacation.
You want amenities? This house has everything. I've never stayed at such a well-appointed AirBnB. We ended up calling it Wish House because every time we'd say, ""I wish there was a..."" the thing we were hoping for would appear. You want chip clips? Chopsticks? A meat thermometer? Sunscreen? Extra blankets? Ziploc bags? Waffle iron? Pool noodles? A full set of spices? You got it! Want to feel like you're in a spa? Go take a luxurious rainfall shower with the provided delicious-smelling soaps and then wrap yourself up in your big fluffy robe! Want to feel like a chef? Bust out your full set of Wüsthof knives, every single cooking accoutrement you could imagine, and get to it! Feeling ambitious? Do some yoga with the included equipment! Want to go to the beach? Angie has your back! We did a day trip to Sanibel Island, and were able to bring all the beach essentials—chairs, cooler, canopy, etc.
Additionally, our interactions with the host were excellent; Angie clearly takes great pride in this house and was always responsive and friendly in her communications. (Though since the house was so well-stocked and the guide book was so comprehensive, we didn't need to ask about much.) Angie, we can't thank you enough for this wonderful vacation!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"It’s the second time we stay there! The place is great, it’s perfect for a group or family. There’s a good amount of beds and bedrooms are very spacious."

There were no surprises or disappointments with this house, it is exactly as described and the photos were spot on. I will definitely rent again when I come back for a visit. I'm sorry the visit was so short, I wanted to stay longer! Thank you for a great stay!"

Fenced yard was a plus for our dog. Pool was clean. Home is on a quiet street. We saw beautiful sunsets from the pool area. Ft. Myers and beaches are 15-30 minutes away.

It was about 25-45 mins to any of the beaches we wanted to visit, quiet area and the pool was great to relax in and keep the kids busy. Our dog loved the fenced in backyard and we had a lot of fun walking through the neighborhood and spotting the little burrowing owls that have nests all around. We would definitely stay here again."

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,M husband and I stayed for little over a week. We have not stayed in a cleaner vacation home! Jose was very responsive and stopped by to make sure the pool temp was ok and to drop off a garage door opener which we really appreciated! The pool was crystal clear and at a perfect temperature!! We will definitely recommend Jose’s home to our family and friends when they are traveling to Cape Coral.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Nice cozy place great pool. Great value! If your in Cape Coral I definitely recommend
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay at! It was raining all weekend so we had to stay in for most of the time and there were no complaints from me and my family. I wouldn’t mind coming again.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Everything was amazing honestly Beautiful Home and AMAZING salt pool 🙏🏼
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jose was a great host..!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed at Jose's place for my husbands birthday . it's 30 mins from Ft Myers Beach, but Cape Coral has a lot of restaurants, and this location is pretty central to where you need to go. You will need a rental car if you plan to go to the beach and out. Everything really closes at 10 or 11 pm. We're not big going out people, so the house location with the pool was great to take it slow. While the neighborhood is quiet and quick access to FT Myers beach, and the restaurants on the drag that can be 5-10 min drive.
The house was clean and simple, which is all you need. The pool is great. I
wouldn't say 100% private, but at least 90%, there isn't a privacy fence on the back end but fine if you're in the pool. the pool cage is great, no bugs.
I 100% would stay here again and in Cape Coral for a chill relaxing
trip. It was our first time here, and I hope Ft Myers and the islands can rebuild after Ian. This area is a gem."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great getaway, area close to everywhere we needed to go"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home was absolutely that, a home! It had wonderful homey touches that made us feel comfortable and relaxed. Jose was a wonderful host and proactively texted us the morning after our arrival to check how our first night was and if we needed anything. Jose was very quick to answer any communication from start to finish of our stay. The pool was beautiful and warm. It has a great location and quiet neighborhood that is close to shops and restaurants. Will definitely look to stay here again! Thank you so much for a wonderful experience!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jose is a great host , his house was clean beds were soft, defiantly a 5 star home. Jose always kept in touch and i would recommend his house to anybody looking for a quiet getaway in Cape Coral."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It’s was great
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jose is a superb host, communicating was quick and easy and he asked how we were and if we needed anything during our stay. The area is quite from neighbouring houses and the locals are welcoming and friendly. Although there is a little road noise is in the background it did not drown out the amazing variety of birds singing in the garden. There is an abundance of beautiful wild life in this little area .
The villa is huge and has everything catered for. We had a clean pool that is north facing and has the sun on it all day long. There are plenty of pool toys and an outdoor BBQ. The pool area has a small area to sunbathing all day and the rest is covered for that rest bite out of the sun. You do need a car to visit places but not necessarily if you want to just chill by the pool in nice surroundings. Captain hooks sushi locally is amazing food. I would recommend this villa for a quite chilled break for non partying people."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jose is definitely a super host, very quick to respond, and super helpful. Nothing was a problem.
The property is clean and has all the amenities in a quiet and friendly neighbourhood. It felt like a home away from home. Jose would definitely be our first choice for all future ventures to the area."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had a great time in this lovely house! Everything was wonderful! Thanks Brhett for making us feel good in his clean, quiet and tidy house!"
2024-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Bhrett was a good host. Terrible sulfar smell outback which made it hard to enjoy the pool and hot tub.
2024-05-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,When I go away I like things to be easy. No instructions on how to run the pool and hot tub. A lot of annoying bugs around the pool.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely open floor plan, great pool and spa, responsive host. I would definitely stay again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Spacious , clean , safe, comfortable . One of my favorites so far ."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This location is a well-worn, no-frills stay that gets the job done. We found the place to need a little TLC and extra scrub, but other reviewers' high ratings suggest that our perspective might be too persnickety, especially given that Bhrett, the host, is very proactive and responds quickly to questions and feedback."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Everything perfect, very friendly, helpful & accommodating. Great house with nice warm pool. We had very relaxed days 😀"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The house was a great fit for my family.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, spacious home!! Gorgeous pool and relaxing hot tub! Loved the tub in the master bedroom and the kitchen layout! Brhett was extremely accommodating and easy to work with! Would highly recommended and will definitely book again!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Brhett’s rental was very comfortable with our children and grandchildren. The pool, spa and outdoor dining area with TV was a huge hit as we spent most of our time outside.
Kitchen is very well equipped for meals prep.
Beds were comfortable and lots of extra linens for extended stays.
Car rental like he says is ideal so you can drive to beaches and attractions.
Brhett was very responsive- we only had one small issue and it was dealt with immediately!
Close to restaurants and grocery stores. Really close to miromar outlets - quick 30 minute drive.
There are beach towels and pack and play as well as linens for that as well as a high chair. Very helpful when you have grandkids coming.
We enjoyed our time and would definitely rent again!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thank you for the prompt response and communication. I give you a five star for customer service!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful house in a safe neighborhood! The living room is spacious and comfy. Mostly everything is super clean. The pool and spa were amazing, but the tree coverage is minimal. You will see straight into the neighbor's backyard and they will see you. They also had a pretty raucous party with loud music until 1 am on our first night. We weren't bothered, but something to keep in mind if you don't like loud noises. The bath towels were the only thing to give me pause with a mild smell and washed out look. Given that the host asks guests to start a load of towels/sheets before leaving to help the cleaning lady, I worry that the previous guests might have forgotten to use detergent or hot water. There are too many variables with how clean the sheets and towels might be due to asking guests to start the laundry, and I would rather know they were washed by someone who has a standardized practice. This task also seems odd to give to guests given the high cleaning fee. Overall very nice stay."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tranquil Palms is awesome. Big enough for larger family, honestly loved everything about it! Clean, neat, very easy check in. Excellent communication, everything you need is right there. The pool and hot tub was THE BEST!! We truly felt right at home!

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Tranquil Palms was located in a quiet neighborhood. With a pool with lions spitting water and small waterfalls creating relaxing background noise. Loved the dining table on the veranda for eating meals. the furniture was extremely comfortable and the TVs were plentiful. We watched a couple football games on the giant living room tv and honestly nicer than a sports bar. Super close to a grocery store and the kitchen was fully equipped for cooking in. We had some of the best sleep we have had in a long time. Brehtt was extremely responsive when we had an issue and it was resolved when we returned from our adventures that day. Strongly recommend staying at Tranquil Palms

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Brhett was very responsive to our needs. On our first night, we could not find the wine opener even though it was in the drawer Brhett indicated. By 8 a.m. the next morning Amazon delivered both wine and bottle openers to our front door."

Some different games to play for entertainment and general kitchen items make cooking a meal easy."

Took a little longer than anticipated to get to beaches, etc due of traffic."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Jeffery is a great host. He's very responsive and friendly. Before our trip, I inquired about an air fryer, he said they didn't have it. But when we arrived, we found a brand-new unit in the kitchen. UNREAL!! Personally, it's so much easier to cook with it vs the stove, so we were excited. The place was beautiful, comfortable and spacious and it has a good size pool. We had a blast. I can definitely see myself booking with Jeffery again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jeffery was really great with communication and checking in to make sure everything was good. The house is in a great location, very short boat ride from the house to the main waterway. Overall a great experience!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"We had a wonderful vacation
at Suzy and Jeff's house!
The house is well equipped and was super clean!
The pool with a cage is great and offers great privacy. We often used the kayaks for tours into the big bay. The highlight was that we were accompanied on one of our tours by a manatee family!
The location of the house is also excellent. There is a good Publix supermarket 3 minutes away. If you need more, you can drive about 15 minutes to Del Prado and have a huge selection of shops.
If the chance arises for us we will come back.
Thank you Suzy and Jeff for a great BBQ!
Greetings from Germany"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stayed with my family for week. We thoroughly enjoyed the pool. The kitchen was stocked with all the necessary cookware and we put it all to good use! Jeffrey was quick to respond to all my questions. We even left something behind and we’re able to get it back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It was a great vacation. The pool is very clean and always warm water,very nice , we loved it in it. We enjoyed the kayaks with a few light oars and a nice view.

We plan to return very soon ."

Jeffrey we can’t thank you enough for having such a beautiful place to stay! We honestly wanted to be at the house more than the beach! It was CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, BEAUTIFUL, PEACEFUL, & better than we could have imagined! We will definitely be back again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This home was wonderful for our multi generational family trip. The 7 of us had plenty of room to sleep and the pool was amazing! We would definitely stay again!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The house was exactly what we wanted and we were able to use the dock, too!! Jeff was very responsive and checked in regularly to ensure all was well. By far, one of the best vacations and experiences we’ve had with an Airbnb house!! Thank you Jeff!!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had such a great time at Jeff’s place. We brought our 10 month old son and there was a pack n play and high chair to use, which helped a ton! The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, and the outside grill was great to have as well. There were kayaks to use to explore the canals and we wish we’d gotten around to using the fishing poles. There were plenty of towels for the pool, bath, and beach, and the bath towels were so soft haha. We were so shocked at how close Rotary Park was (right at the end of the street) and we really enjoyed walking there with our son to explore the trails and play at the park. We spent most of our time relaxing in or by the pool, and our son loved it, as did we! It was so fun to be lounging in the pool with a view of the canal right there, and the pool had full sun practically all day. We had a question about the pool when we got there and Jeff responded so quickly and made sure we had everything we needed. We def recommend and hope to return!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Jeffery’s place was wonderful! Even complete with a pack n play and high chair! That alone takes a huge stress off of traveling with a baby. The location was drivable to beaches, but we mainly stuck to the parks this time. Rotary Park at the end of the street was perfect and super close! We fished out back most nights and spent most of the days in the pool. He was a wonderful host and checked in on us a couple times during the week. I really appreciated that type of open communication and willingness to help!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Felt at home the moment we walked in. Great location, peaceful area and everything you need for a relaxing vacation.

It had everything we could have ever needed plus some. Our kids loved the pool, as did my husband I. We also enjoyed kayaking through the canal's. The communications was too notch. Unfortunately Hurricane Ian hit while we were in this home and Jeff and Suzy checked on us often and have kept in touch with us since. We had to abandon some stuff due to loss of our suitcases and they said they would get it back to us. Thank you so much for your hospitality and caring hearts! Whenever we get brave enough to venture to Cape Coral again, we will be back for sure!"

Jeffrey was a wonderful host. He made sure that we had everything we needed.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home! Perfect for our week stay in Cape Coral.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Jeffrey's Pelican home was beautiful! The pictures on the website do not do it justice, it is a gorgeous home fully appointed with everything we needed. The location is so wonderful on the canal, with boat dock and lift, it was only a few minutes to the bay and out to the ocean for a day of fishing or a sunset sail! The pool was beautiful and had all the fun toys, pool floaties and noodles. We used the kayaks to take a tour of the canal and out to the causeway, which was a great treat! Covered patio was a great spot for morning coffee, overlooking the beautiful landscaping, palm trees and the canal. Jeffrey answered all my questions so quickly I was so impressed by him, he is a super host! Our family loved it so much we are already planning our next trip back!! Thank you so much Jeffrey for a week of fun Florida memories that our family will treasure. ❤️"

Great communication throughout our stay. They planned for everything so we didn’t have to worry about running around and finding items for all of the different activities we did while in the Cape. We didn’t want to leave and are already planning our next stay!
Highly recommend staying with Jeff at the Happy Pelican!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"My husband, two adult sons and I stayed in Jeffery's place for 8 nights. This house was very clean and offered wonderful amenities - a heated pool, a dock with kayaks, and a Smart TV in every bedroom, living room, and patio. Jeffery communicated often to check how we were doing, and was very responsive when we had questions. The location of the house is great - close to Publix and many great restaurants. The host and the house are both outstanding. I highly recommend this place and we would stay here again whenever we are in the area. Thank you so much, Jeffery!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This house could not have been better!! We enjoyed every part of our stay here. The beds were comfortable, the space beautiful and it is close to everything. We especially enjoyed the outside space, dining under the covered screened in porch was so peaceful. The dock and the view was beautiful and it was so quiet. We are already planning another trip!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,What a perfect house in a gorgeous location!
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Happy Pelican was just perfect! It was immaculate and very homey. The beds were so comfortable. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to make our own meals. The pool was very clean and inviting. The pool area was comfortable and a great place to start our morning. We will be happy to return.
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Very friendly
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What an amazing stay we had at Jeff’s property! My three children enjoyed the pool. Jeff and Suzy thought of everything when offering their home for people to vacation in. The pictures listed doesn’t do this property justice. Highly recommend staying here if you are going to be visiting this area of Florida!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is in a great location. We were in Ft. Myers for a PG Baseball tournament and the house was within 30 minutes of the many different fields we used. It was close to restaurants, the beach, and the historic areas too. The house itself seems newly renovated with stylish furniture. The beds are VERY comfortable with plenty of pillows. The patio area faces east so it's shaded and cool in the afternoon. My kids enjoyed kayaking and fishing on the dock. The pool was kept warm and comfortable. There were extra beach towels & rafts by the pool. One note, the pool has ladders for entering & exiting the pool rather than concrete stairs. We had no problems using the ladders, just an FYI. There is a fully appointed kitchen with plenty of dishes and cookware. The host is responsive & helpful. We enjoyed our visit to the Happy Pelican and can't wait to return."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We just returned from our trip to Cape Coral, FL and had an amazing time! Jeff and Suzy's home was beautiful with three bedrooms and two baths which was perfect for our family of four. The photos don't do this gorgeous home justice it is far more beautiful than the photos. Whenever we are looking to stay at a home, one of the first things we look for is cleanliness and this home had just that. We enjoyed the heated pool very much. It was huge, very clean and well maintained and because it was heated we used it anytime of the day we wanted to. Lots of pools noodles, and various pool inflators, our kids enjoyed it. The patio was great with a huge TV which we enjoyed watch while taking a break from the pool and relaxing. We used the barbeque grill which was very conveniently located near the pool. We enjoyed using all four bikes to ride around the neighborhood in the evenings.
We were pleasantly surprised that all rooms including the patio had smart TVs, cable and capabilities to rewind and fast forward while watching. I love the open floor plan which made easy flow from the kitchen to dining room to living area. Jeff and Suzy really put a lot of thought into what guests would need while vacationing in their home. The kitchen was well stocked which everything you will need to use to cook meals, we enjoyed using the glassware dishes, pots and pans and utensils, since I was doing most of the cooking I enjoyed using this kitchen everyday, it was my happy place.
Jeff and Suzy were extremely responsive with any question we had leading up to and during our stay. They were very helpful, friendly, respectful and polite. Suzy reached out to us to informed us of Tropical storm Elsa which was approaching and offered to help with accommodation if your flight got canceled and sure enough our flight was canceled. It was very comforting to know that we didn’t had to panic as result because the we had already discussed accommodation with the host, it was less stressful as a result of that communication. Jeff even suggested another airport that we can consider and his advised helped because we got a flight from that airport much sooner.
The location was very close to everything that anyone will need while on vacation, also very close to Fort Myers as well. This home and location was perfect us and we can’t say enough about it. Also, the neighborhood was very clean with well manicured lawns, bike lanes and beautiful homes, the neighbors were very nice and friendly. We would definitely stay there again and would also recommend this home to anyone/family who needs to just have a great and relaxing time away. It was truly a home away from home."
