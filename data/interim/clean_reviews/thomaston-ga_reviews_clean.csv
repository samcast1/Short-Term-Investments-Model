2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Thanks for all the thoughtful touches. We were in Thomaston for my husband’s 50th Highschool reunion and knew we didn’t want to stay in any of the hotels. This place was wonderful.

2023-08-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Nana's Retreat was great except for the pool that was advertised and pictured as clean and clear water was anything but. The inside of the home was very clean and well maintained. Check in instructions were very clear and everything was easy to locate. I loved the thought to have extra towels and linens ready for guests. Other than missing out on enjoying some pool time in this hot Georgia weather, everything was hospitable about Nana's Retreat. Hayley was very easy to contact and she did inform me of the pool having issues the day before check in. I was under the impression it was still swimmable, but unfortunately due to recent heavy rains, it absolutely wasn't.
If you're looking for a clean place to lay your head for a night or two with a friendly host, then this is the place."

They have a spacious place, sweet decor, kindly offer snacks and the bed is cozy. You’ll appreciate this stay!! We were in this town for family. Wishing I was back at The Country cupboard & deli eating some of the best food again and snuggling in this sweet apartment.

I was in town for my father's funeral and it felt like I was staying with family. It was exactly what I needed instead of a cold hotel room. Yet, the amenities of a hotel are there including complimentary coffee, snacks, and toiletries. If it hadn't been January, I would have taken full advantage of the lovely pool/bar area. For my first AirBNB experience, I'm so glad I chose Hayley and Nana's Retreat!"

The place was sparkling clean and Hayley left out some wonderful refreshments for us. She was so quick to respond to my messages too which made the process so much better.

We had an extremely unique situation that brought us to Georgia as we were there to adopt our newborn son. You would have thought that Norma and Tom were his grandparents. They were extremely sweet to us as new parents and to little Myles. We had a number of great conversations and were lucky to have such a cozy place for our new family to bond.
If we find our way back to Georgia, we will find a way back to here."

If we are ever in the area again, we will definitely request to stay there again!
Hayley was very understanding when we had to leave a couple days early due to finishing our job earlier than expected. Hayley is not on site with Nana, but handles all of the logistics. She was quick to respond and answer any questions we had.
It really was a pleasant stay! Thanks again!"

They are gracious hosts. I would definitely recommend Nana’s place."
2018-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super sweet hosts and a gorgeous, clean home to boot. It was located in a nice, quiet area with shopping, a movie theater. dining out, etc. not too far away. There were plenty of standard things (towels, hand soap, shampoo)and some thoughtful additions (razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, pots to cook in in the kitchen, actual dishes to use,bottled water, soda, coffee, and.. ICECREAM! :-) included in our room. And there were fireflies that came out at night which I adored, having not seen them since I was a kid. There was also other wildlife in the area which made it a very enjoyable and refreshing stay. Definitely book it if you're considering!"

The apartment was very clean and well-kept and was well-supplied with necessities, plus extras I was not expecting! Nana and Tom, the homeowners, were very gracious and met me when I arrived, made me feel welcome, and said to let them know if I needed anything or ran out of something during the week I was there. All this in a nice, quiet neighborhood - great place to stay!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a local event and were very excited to find Hayley's place as there were not a lot of options locally.

The dam was being repaired during our trip but that didn’t matter because the property had a second pond that was a short and easy walk. We spent most of our time there with our dog. At night, we were able to see the stars and hang out by the fire! Wayne was extremely responsive to anything we needed and was the cherry on top of this entire trip. We are so glad to have booked with them. HIGHLY recommend!!!!!"

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location of the property! Totally quiet, mainly to hear the rustling of the trees and birdsong.
Still, it was a big shock when we looked into an earth hole and not at the lake upon arrival. A note that it disappeared from a dam some time ago would have been nice! Since we actually came because of the lake.
We made the most of it and still enjoyed our time very much. Morning and evening watching the deer and taking the chance to make a campfire at the fire pit.
The house is rustically equipped and the pets are allowed is not to be overlooked."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Overall we had a great stay! We were bummed about the little lake being drained but understood that was fully out of his control.

The location was beautiful and so peaceful. Having coffee on the porch Saturday morning was lovely - we saw deer running in the nearby field and ducks in the pond. The location is only 5 minutes from Woodbury's sweet little downtown, where we ate breakfast and lunch, plus did a little antiquing. We were in town for a friend's wedding at Wild Daisy Farms, which was also only 5 minutes from the airbnb. We couldn't have asked for a lovelier weekend and will definitely be back soon."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,great stay
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Spent the weekend here to marry the woman of my dreams. Mr Wayne was quick to respond and met us at the cabin when we arrived. He gave us a great list of places to eat locally and showed us a nice walking trail around the pond behind the cabin. It did rain most of the time we were staying here which wasn’t a problem since the cabin is so relaxing. We sat by fireplace and just watched the rain out the back porch windows. Mr Wayne made our stay feel right at home and even left us a bottle of wine in honor of our wedding. We can’t wait to make this cabin a yearly tradition.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The A-frame cabin on horseshoe pond was absolutely perfect! If I could stay here all the time I would. My boyfriend and I came here with the pups for a shooting tournament the next town over. It was the perfect mixture of quiet, privacy to allow the pups to run around and swim all day, but also close enough to the grocery store and a few restaurants. I highly recommend this place and Wayne was very welcoming."

Would absolutely recommend!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at the A-Frame Cottage on Horseshoe Pond was absolutely amazing! Wayne was a great host who was always available to answer any questions we had during our stay. He even offered to take us to a better fishing location if we didn’t have any luck in the pond, however, the fish in the pond were plentiful and my children and I caught many during our stay. The area was quiet and secluded away from any road traffic and noise. The cottage was clean and well maintained with everything you need for your stay. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to just get away from their busy lives and relax."

The pond was very relaxing and its was so peaceful just looking at the water. These were the best hosts that i ever had with airbnb, because they were very responsive.The landscaping around the cabin could use a little tlc and beautifying, but outside of that,it was a great place to stay and i would highly recommend staying here. Will be staying here again really soon."

Nicole was prompt with communication. Great option for a few days! Good place for the grandkids!"

We both loved the location, the property, the things to do, and all the animals! There are parks, home style cooking, and antique stores all very close. We enjoyed walking the property to befriend the animals, play horseshoes, and use the firepit. Very quiet and relaxed and a great place to unplug for a little while."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this place because we had to attend a wedding nearby so we were more drawn to the convenience of the location (relative to the wedding) more than anything else, but wow, we were blown away at how comfortable the cabin was compared to our expectations. Such a cool, relaxing, and peaceful place to stay. We’d love to go back and be able to take full advantage of the beautiful and unique surroundings.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Stillmeadows is a beautiful, peaceful place. It's a charming, rustic cabin updated with modern amenities. After spending the day on the trails at Sprewell Bluff Park, it was a treat to come back to sunset drinks on the dock of the pond before cooking dinner in the full kitchen. The bed was soft and comfortable. We will return if we're in the area."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect for 4 of us. We used both bedrooms downstairs but still had the twin beds upstairs available. We immediately went to visit the animals. All very sweet. The owners pups were so sweet!! And Mr. Cat spent every night on the outside chair. He was adorable! Beds were super comfy, nice bed sheets, and super cozy. It was in the 30’s outside, but we had enough blankets to keep us warm. Everything in the home worked, and everything was clean. We really enjoyed the fireplace so much! Owners were awesome to work with. Super responsive and super nice!"
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great country place to go and relax! The fishing was great! And the artesian spring water was refreshing! The beautiful white ducks hung out with us while fishing.

We would visit again.
Amy and Jamey Harrelson"

Our grandkids, 3 years old and 1 year old, loved the petting animals (mini donkey, mini horse, and mini cow) and feeding the ducks in the pond. Nicole was nice enough to allow us to have a few family members over for lunch on Saturday before the wedding. We would definitely stay there again if in the area and highly recommend it."

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Rustic cabin in the woods, with farm ""pets"" nearby and very close to Sprewell Bluff park. Don't expect modern or fancy, and it might get a bit hot on summer days (has A/C, but with limits), but otherwise a great choice if you like simple and old fashioned. Our family of 6 was comfortable and the hosts are great communicators and available nearby if any problems (there were none)."
2022-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"Had a fabulous stay! Nicole has thought of everything, you’ll want for nothing. We so enjoyed spending time in the cabins, exploring the property, and spending time with the animals :). We also loved being close to Sprewell Bluff Park and Thomaston.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Our stay at Stillmeadows Cabins was wonderful. The 1885 cabin was so fun to stay in and loved all the decor that went with the cabin. The cabin was very clean and comfortable and exactly what was advertised for the cabin. My family was there for a wedding at Frog Hollow that was just down the road, so the cabin was in the perfect spot for this. We loved fishing off the dock and walking to see the animals on the farm. We were greeted everyday by Mountain, the big white dog. He spent lots of time on our front porch and back deck. We loved our stay and will definitely come back and stay again when we come to see our family in Georgia. Thank you Nicole for making our stay a great one to remember."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Want to get away and relax? This historic cabin is in a wooded setting and close to kayaking on the Flint river and hiking Sprewell Bluff state park. Enjoy the animals on property from bunnies to ducks and a donkey or try fishing in the pond. Have coffee on the porch in the morning and image life in a simpler time.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rustic cabin with comfortable beds, comfortable couch and great location. Internet is a little slow, but I think that’s normal for this part of Georgia. Quiet and camping feel, but with showers and kitchen. My only recommendation would be to clear away the cobwebs inside. We enjoyed our stay very much."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely one of my most favorite places to stay. The pictures do not do the property justice. It is a beautiful setting with peace and quiet and the most amazing hosts. My dogs swam in the pond, we took several walks and it stormed my last night but the rain on the tin roof was exactly what the doctor ordered. I cannot wait to visit again."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Cabins were very cute. The pond behind the cabins was easily accessible for fishing and very pretty. Everyone slept comfortably between the two cabins. Would highly recommend for a group stay in Thomaston.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved this cabin and the location. Just a short drive from Sprewell Bluff Park and downtown Thomaston. Enjoyed fishing in the pond and seeing all of the farm animals. My nieces adored this place.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The best! They are sweet and the property is super clean.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I immensely enjoyed my stay at the cabin. I found it clean, comfortable, and very relaxing. My biggest prior concern was Wi-Fi because i had to work during my stay, and the Wi-Fi signal was excellent throughout my stay. My only grouse would be that the bunnies wouldn't let me pet them; but then if I was a bunny I’d run like hell if I saw someone as ugly as me reaching down too. Overall, an enjoyable stay and I would definitely stay here again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the most beautiful airbnb I've been to, definitely will be back, animals are amazing, setting is amazing, host are wonderful."
2022-05-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect location for the wedding we attended just a mile down the road! We enjoyed the unique decor of the cabin and also the peaceful lake (caught 2 bass!) Overall, it was so quiet that we had a tough time waking up each morning! The owners seemed to think of every little thing that we could possibly need. If ever in the area, we'd stay again! Thanks for having us!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We love Stillcreek Meadow

2022-02-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is a very unique and old cabin that was right up our alley, however I can see how some would enjoy a more modern feel, so I would just make sure you're aware of the history of this cabin."

2022-01-01,5.0,Group trip,"These cabins are rustic, but in the best possible way. They were built in 1885, and we loved the fact that we were staying in a home that was so historic. They are absolutely charming, and the PERFECT place to unwind and relax. We stayed up late into the night lounging in the living room, and slept very well on some of the most comfortable beds and pillows I’ve ever laid on.
We were there for a wedding; there was plenty of hot water for everyone to shower and get ready all at the same time.
Mary Pat and Rick provided a fabulous backdrop for a fabulous weekend. I sincerely hope we can come back again for another couples retreat.
Note: we had 3 couples and 3 kids in 2 cabins and there was plenty of room for everyone"

2021-11-01,5.0,Group trip,Mary Pat was an amazing hostess. Even with the craziness of my wedding and my being late with a very important detail she was a gem. The cabins were beautiful and assistance with anything was available immediately. Truly a gem and I would definitely recommend still Meadows to anyone. Thank you Mary Pat.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was a great experience! We are sad we didn’t get to see the dogs but that’s ok, lots more to see. Lots of fun exploring with the kids outside. Very nice temperature in the house even when a little warm outside. One bedroom has a curtain as a door for the bathroom so just need to lock the room for privacy. You can see how much the owners put into making your stay comfy and fun. Mary has a cute scrap book with lots of great info. Thank you!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I am here for business, it was so nice coming to a cabin vs driving 45 minutes to a decent hotel. After a long day at work, I was able to walk trails to the pond and de-stress. I will definitely be booking a weekend trip with my family. This will be my new go to spot when I have to visit Thomaston for travel. Pat was the best to work with. Cabin was clean. Highly Recommended."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Super cute place! The old feel is pretty cool. Property was awesome. Definitely a place to be off the grid!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was beyond what we ever imagined from pictures! Between the animals and the ponds you really don’t have to leave at all. We even got Fresh eggs from the farm. But if you decide to venture out, the town is so cute and quaint.We shopped around and fell in love with a store “rescue me market.” They recommended piggy park BBQ (not really our style of food ) but also surprisingly good . We didn’t make it to dicky farms for ice cream but we were told by multiple people that it was the best . . The next day we kayaked sprewell bluff on the flint river with flint river outfitters. What a great weekend ! Thank you Mary pat and ric !"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This cabin was fully loaded and stocked with all the necessities and more. It has a nice cozy atmosphere. The inside was well stocked with towels, extra bedding, all kitchen necessities, and even a few toys for the kids. They do have quite a few antiques throughout the cabin, which was really cool. It was nice and spacious. The outside was on a beautiful piece of land with a nicely stocked lake and a row boat. My whole family came out and we had the best reunion. We were able to grill out on the back porch and make smores in a separate area on the side of the cabin in a fire pit. Mary Pat was an outstanding host and was just a phone call away if we needed her. However, we didn't need anything that wasn't already provided. We had the best time and would definitely like to rent again in the near future. If you're considering renting an airbnb in the Thomaston area, I highly recommend this cabin. There is also another cabin located on this property that is available to rent as well."

2021-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place to spend a couple relaxing days away from the city. The cabin was much bigger than I expected! Had all the necessary amenities and even more. We will miss waking up and playing with the dogs Mountain and Valley.

2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great spot! My son and I loved our stay at the cabin, especially the daily hellos from the fluffy dogs. The photos do a great job giving a sense of the cabin, but it's even bigger in person."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely amazing! My kids and I had the best time here! Most of our time was spent walking around the property with the animals and picking up pecans.

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I booked this cabin a bit last minute to get away. We didn’t really know what to expect. This cabin was WAY more than expected. First of all the location is amazing. Mary Pat told us a park (Sprewell Bluff) to go hiking. It’s a ten minute drive and a MUST DO. The hiking trails are great but the river is the best part. We went tubing down the river, cooked out on the grill, and hung out at the park all day. Highly recommend it !
The cabin is so cozy and cute. We made s’mores by the fireplace, hopped in the row boat out back, and even got to see the goats and horse in the morning behind the cabin.
The town is about 15 min away and there’s a restaurant we loved (fish peddler).
Mary Pat was very responsive and I appreciate it (I know we messaged her quite a few times)
The WiFi wasn’t the best. We only needed it to watch a pay-per-view that we ordered one night... but luckily there’s a TON of dvds in the laundry shed that we chose from. Overall, had such a great time."

2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Authentic and relaxing. If you need a place close to the barn wedding venue on the same road this is the place. Our kids loved meeting the dogs/puppies. Wished we had had more time to explore.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family of 3 stayed here at the cabin the week after new years. We loved the very rustic cabin and the surrounding property. We took the small boat out a couple of times, fished a bit on the beautiful pond, wondered around to see the farm animals and mostly just stayed indoors (Due to weather) playing games and enjoying the fireplace. The cabin has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The master bed was very comfortable as well. The cabin is the perfect place to get back to the simple life!"

2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This visit was as wonderful as we had expected!! Mary Pat and Rick are great hosts!! My daughter and granddaughters spent MANY HOURS fishing and exploring the woods. I know everyone says this but the DOGS are the best entertainment you could ask for. They “took care” of the little ones by staying by their side. We tried to figure out how to take them with us but the girls said they would be too sad to leave their home!! Folks the water is delightful!! The drinking water is a great surprise. I recommend coming here for a little RnR but look out you won’t want to leave.
2019-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"So lovely and picturesque. My daughter's first comment was ""I feel like Laura Ingalls."" The cabins really make you feel a part of history, yet they have what we need for our modern lifestyles. The land is beautiful, the dogs so friendly, and we enjoyed seeing the cows, goats and chickens. Sitting on the swing at sunset, watching birds and listening to cicadas was quite relaxing."

2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,I booked one of Mary Pat’s cabins for my husband and brother and there work crew to stay in while doing an out of town job. They had a wonderful stay and enjoyed that they could come back to the cabin after work and relax on the property and do a little fishing. The hospitality was amazing as they were sweet enough to provide some breakfast sandwiches and dinner for they guys one night. The husband enjoyed it so much he wants to take the daughter and I back to visit.
2019-04-01,5.0,Group trip,"Such an awesome, relaxing place to visit. We visited there for our sons graduation from the Army basic training. It was a very nice place for us to hang out as a family. Would definitely visit again if we get the chance. Loved all of the animals!!"

Kids enjoyed rowing around the pond with Pops and having a fire in the fire pit. Thanks to Mary Pat and Rick for sharing their little piece of heaven."
2019-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Charming and rustic. I could see how a family would enjoy the location. Nice setup for the kitchen and dining. One of the bathrooms in cabin 1 only has curtains in the doorways which might be a privacy issue if the bedroom is shared.

We will definitely go back!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location and comfy stay everything we expected
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay while we were in town for a wedding. The cottage is absolutely precious. The beds were comfy. There was a very well-stocked kitchen. The decor is so cute and homey feeling. We were able to spend a little time by the pool. The pool area was neat and included floats and toys for the kids. This property included lots of thoughtful details by Donna. We would definitely stay here again if we were in the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great, private, and safe place to stay. Donna is a great host and makes sure your needs are met. It is a convenient location for travelers heading north or south on I-75 (a few miles with nice view). I highly recommend. We have had multiple stays."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place. Highly recommend for travelers or those wanting a peaceful stay. Donna is a great host and makes sure all is well and your needs are met. Very nice and safe place to stay.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Donna is a great host. Nice rural area not far from I-75 if you are traveling. Quiet and peaceful area. This is a safe place to stay. This is our second visit. Highly recommend. We will be returning.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved staying here. The place is bigger than you think. Everything there that you need plus more. If you want country this is the place so peaceful and quite. The city is small but you will see plenty of deer. we saw about 30 in the 6 days we stayed. My kids loved the pool. It was such a great stay. We can't wait to come back. which we definitely will.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had the most relaxing stay at Donna's. We felt like we were at home. The place was so clean. We didn't have to cook, but we did find the necessary things we needed for drinks and light snacks. We had a large family wedding on the 24th at The Rock. Donna's place was perfect for us not to have to travel very far. There was an emergency with a niece's son. He had been at basketball camp for 3 days and the timing was off for picking him up, getting him home and cleaned up in time to get to the wedding. Donna allowed my niece & husband to stop at her place to get him cleaned up. This was so kind of her and it worked out perfectly! We loved being in the country. A perfect place for myself, husband, brother & sister-in-luv to have. We appreciated all the communication with Donna! What a gem!! We were blessed and would definitely stay again!! A++++++++++"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hosts were extremely friendly, place was lovely and clean and comfortable for our night there."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It is really a great place to stay. It quite, peaceful, and private. We stayed six nights and highly recommend. We would be happy to stay again."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Donna was an amazing hostess. Ww did a 5 k the laat morning there, and she told us we were welcome to come back and shower and relax afterwards and to stay as long as we wanted that afternoon because no one else was coming in that day. She even offered to but a local souvenir for me that was currently out of stock. A wonderful find!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very charming,and peaceful. Host was quick to respond with any questions. We would definitely stay again if we are back that way 😊."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our first visit was an unexpected delight of peaceful pastures and welcoming people. Only one night but on our way back from destination trip we stayed there again. It was like coming home. Beautiful. Serene. Will definitely return for an extended stay for peace and quiet and relaxation.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Five stars are not enough! This was the most amazing unexpected serene place. If you are wanting beauty, serenity, and peace, then this is where you need to be. Donna was communicative, informative, and very pleasant. We love history and she provided us insight into the area. We only stayed one night, but that was all it took to know we want to return for a future peaceful extended stay. The evening stillness was free from road noise and other mechanical noises. The smell of farm field grasses highlighted the clarity of the air."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The property is wonderful and exactly as described, if not more than what we anticipated. It is a very small town and situated on the outskirts of town, with room to run and bike and play.
The kitchen was large and stocked with some supplies, the bedrooms were large and comfortable and the bathroom and shower were relaxing."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for us! Donna is definitely a SUPERHOST…we hope to come back soon!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Cute, cozy and perfect space for a small family or two couples. Very clean!"
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was a little farther away from where we were visiting, but I couldn't find a bnb closer. Even so, I worked out well enough.
The place is very clean and decorated very cute.
If you need to be near Cullondon, then this works well. Beware, no restaurants nearby."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved the place! It was such a nice retreat from city life and it’s walking distance from the home of our family who we came to visit!
The house itself was so cute! Decorated and cozy! Comfy beds and stocked with extra things to make the stay that much better!
We will definitely be asking to stay again on our next visit!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Wonderful time at short stay. We had a quiet peaceful time
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Donna’s place was perfect for my friend and I! We booked it to do an online seminar where we knew we would be super loud, dancing, and yelling super late every night. It being detached and away from their house made it perfect (we did still let them know what we were doing and check that it would be okay before we booked though).
We felt completely safe and comfortable. It was bigger than we thought it would be from the pictures. It had a fully stocked kitchen with everything we needed to cook including salt, pepper, and some spices. There were also plenty of snacks we were told we could help ourselves to. It had two nice big TVs and was decorated cute for the season. Donna gifted us some of her friend’s homemade soap that was so sweet and let us check out super late since she didn’t have anyone checking in the next day, which allowed us to get extra sleep that we were really grateful for.
The beds were really comfortable as well! We did not get a chance to use the pool because of weather and being busy with our seminar.
Would highly recommend, including to just have a nice little getaway from Atlanta and hang out for a day or two."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a darling little country cottage in the country that is so cozy and comfortable. Donna decorated it so cute and added the fall seasonal decor throughout for our September stay. The kitchen and the coffee station is well stocked. When I asked if she had a blender so I could make my daily smoothie, she quickly replied that she would order one and have it in time for my visit. That’s amazing service. I felt very safe in the cottage knowing she and her family were nearby on the property. My daughter and granddaughter and I had a nice visit and it’s so much more comfortable than staying in a hotel."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Peaceful, well stocked, friendly host, very homey and very clean! We really enjoyed our stay!!"
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Donna is great at communicating before and during your stay. She’s friendly and hospitable. The location was perfect for where I needed to be and her place was clean and cutely decorated. I highly recommend!

2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Charming little farm house, nestled in the country. The house was very clean, and welcoming, and also well stocked for anything you need."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy was a wonderful host and her home is beautiful, peaceful and full of her very special touches. She is extremely accommodating and very responsive. The space is large and comfortable with outside areas to lounge or roam and indoor sitting rooms, two bedrooms, if needed, and a private bath. The home is older, so it has all the lovely architectural and period details. There is a coffee/tea nook with a small fridge and treats she encourages you to take. Overall, it was a lovely time and I will return when I am in the area again, if she will have me.
Thanks, Miss Peggy"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Comfortable. Thoughtfully laid out and labeled.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We recently stayed at Peggy's Picturesque B&B for a weekend wedding, and it was absolutely wonderful! Peggy proved to be incredibly accommodating; she allowed us to ship our wedding gift in advance, saving us from traveling with a bulky package. Additionally, her flexibility with our check-in time due to shifting pre-wedding plans was a godsend.
The home itself is both adorable & comfortable, filled with thoughtful touches like extra toiletries and snacks for late-night cravings. It truly felt like a home away from home. We also enjoyed the beautiful scenery that added a perfect backdrop to our stay & morning coffee on the porch.
Peggy's hospitality didn't stop at just amenities; her warm conversations & the stories about her house restoration further enriched our experience. If you're looking for a cozy and inviting place to stay, Peggy’s Bed and Breakfast is the ideal choice. Thank you, Peggy, for a fantastic weekend!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy is a wonderful host and tremendous artist. With an artists touch she has lovingly curated this magnificent home and property, and her guest are the better for it. Around every corner both inside the home, on the porch, and in the garden, whimsical little gems continue to reveal themselves. I look forward to visiting again when the garden is at its full expression. When you visit, please take time to give Llama the cat a few pets from his pal Slade."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay in Thomaston. The main living room was beautifully decorated and spacious. Art everywhere! The home has a wonderful history. Peggy's place was near downtown (short drive). She gave great suggestions for eating in the area. The kitchenette near the room was super stocked with snacks, fresh fruit, coffee, and other drinks. We will definitely stay with Peggy when in the area again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great Time at Wisteria Way!! We really enjoyed sitting on the front porch and reading books while enjoying a glass of wine! We also enjoyed talking to Peggy about the history of the home, grounds and the whole town. We also were able to walk up and see the downtown area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peaceful stay and very much enjoyed getting to know Peggy. We have a new friend...so grateful for her lovely hospitality and sharing her home with us.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,What a wonderful stay at the Wisteria Way! The red carpet was rolled out with a continual generosity of giving to serve us. This stay was a Devine Gift of Love and Care. Peggy went out of your way to take care all our needs during our stay.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peggy is an amazing host! She was kind and responded very quickly. Enjoyed my short stay. Enjoyed my coffee and kitchen was set up so cute with everything you could possibly need in the morning. Plan to see her again when in the area!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"There is nothing to say, except for EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Peggy’s place, Wisteria Way, was way above our expectations! Her home is clean, lovely, welcoming and setting very peaceful and really a wonderful respite in a quiet neighborhood.
The bed super comfortable giving us a good night’s sleep!
We appreciated Peggy’s prompt communication, willingness to accept our late arrival and greeting us.
We had private bath (hot water and excellent pressure in shower) and set off private area with microwave and refrigerator and bottled spring water where she has all sorts of offerings for breakfast: coffee, teas, delicious home made muffins, fresh fruit, refrigerator stocked with yogurt, Sprite, OJ; small crockpot, toaster, all sorts of cooking utensils.
She has even stocked the bath with lotions, bath items, and anything a traveler may have forgotten.
We have stayed at many Airbnb’s throughout US and have to say Peggy’s is tops! We wish we could have stayed for more than one night just to soak in the beauty of her grounds so encourage you to book!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was completely happy with my stay. Everything was exactly what the host communicated. She was so accommodating and made me feel right at home. Her homemade muffins were delicious. I loved the kitchenette. I had an assortment of selections each day. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well. Parking was excellent. I loved the front porch; it was quiet and serene. I felt safe, which was important to me as I was traveling alone. The bathroom had everything I needed; plenty of light and hot water. The living room was spacious and comfortable. I participated in an event called “Be In Health” and Wisteria was the perfect place to stay. I highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I enjoyed my stay. would stay again
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I booked the Protea room last minute, explaining my plans to go somewhere else had fallen through. Ms. Peggy was prompt in communication, kind and understanding. Upon learning that I was there to be alone for my wedding anniversary after losing my husband, she gave me flowers and a gift card. As a widow, it made my heart feel more at ease. Most people wouldn't think to be so kind. The little coffee/tea nook was adorable, stocked with anything you would need for a continental breakfast. The bathroom was also stocked if you forgot anything.
The bed was divine and comfortable. The TV and interner worked great as well.
This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a quiet and unique place."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Peggy is very responsive and accommodating. Goes well beyond expectations. Her choices for continental breakfast are spot on!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Wisteria Way couldn't have been better! Peggy was a fabulous host who went out of her way to make sure our every need was met. The space was so well-appointed, I can't think of a single item that was missing - from the food selections, the bedding, the bathroom amenities - everything was perfect. She is very personable, and we enjoyed our conversations and her recommendations about the area. We would definitely like to stay there again the next time we're in Thomaston."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We absolutely loved Miss Peggy! All of the artwork and such to look at. I will be back soon!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Peggy is very friendly and welcomed us upon arrival. The guest bedrooms and common area is beautifully decorated and comfortable. Thank you.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Excellent place to stay with an excellent host.
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful little cottage. Much nicer in appearance than a few of the surrounding houses, and you do face a gas station, but it felt safe, clean and homey. I was very impressed with all the small details. They even left us some welcome snacks.
Was a lovely, lovely experience--extremely worth the price.
One little gripe was how slow the wifi was.
Loved our stay!
Thanks!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My time here was so great. The place is well done and I felt it was designed as if Wendy was going to live there herself.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a cute little cottage! Plenty of space- comfy beds, full kitchen , quiet area. Was happy to find the cottage for a last minute trip to nearby Thomaston. This cottage fit my needs perfectly. Wendy was a great host."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Very nice clean cottage, everything you need for an overnight stay or an extended stay.
Susan is very responsive and is happy to answer all questions."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Susan's place was a perfect stay for us as we were moving close to the area and needed temporary lodging with our dogs. The home is beautifully restored, very well decorated and stocked with all the kitchen needs, including fresh coffee and clean linens.
Her farm is beautiful and she couldn't have been more helpful or friendly!! We truly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend Susan and her property as a wonderful and peaceful place to stay or get away!
Thank you!!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was absolutely beautiful! Susan and her sister were very sweet and personable hosts. Quiet country home with lots of animals and full of peace. I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend this place to anyone trying to stay in Thomaston!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Clean and comfortable home. We only stayed one night but this home fit our needs and was conveniently located for our situation-
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had such a relaxing night at Susan’s farmhouse. The country setting is peaceful and serene. We loved sitting on the porch while the kids played in the yard. The house is beautifully decorated and incredibly spacious. Very comfortable beds and clean bathroom!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,An idyllic piece of forest paradise. A perfect place for our family retreat. Cats and friendly dogs visit your cabin. Fishing and sitting on the lake. We have family nearby and will be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,So helpful and proactive in providing information. Perfect for our weekend wedding at Harper pines!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our family’s fourth time staying here and it, once again, exceeded our expectations. The pond was fully-stocked and our kids had to quickly learn to remove their own fish and bait their own hook, since they were pulling them in as quickly as we could take them off. The cabin was well-appointed and Nicole was an attentive and responsive host. She even left carrots in the cabin so our kids could feed the cows, donkeys, and horse. This property had become a family favorite and we will be back soon!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed out stay. The cabin was rustic and cool but not drafty. We also really enjoyed petting the animals on site
2023-11-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,"My overall feeling was that I visited a distant relative who forgot that I was coming and did their best to get ready.
Pros: The beds were very comfortable and even my dad slept well.
Cons: The first two are the most important because they negate the ADA compliance and pose a health concern.
1. The ramps to the unit were covered in leaves, sticks and other debris. This was a trip and slip hazard for my 78 year old dad and those that rely on ADA compliant ramps. When I messaged the host she replied “ We blow the ramps off often but there are so many leaves that it’s impossible to keep up.”.
2. There were mouse droppings under the sink
3. The right half of the couch does not recline (as experienced when sitting on the couch)
4. There were several inches of ash from previous guests left in the fireplace
5. There were crumbs or dirt on the couch cushions. It looked like the living room was not cleaned after the previous guest"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We were visiting family in Thomaston and this place was a short drive away from where we were going . My family really liked seeing all the animals on the property, they are all very friendly and entertaining. It was nice being able to walk out the back door and be able to fish and have the cows come running up to the fence to greet you on the way . They have a nice covered deck by the pond to sit and relax or fish off of. If you’re looking for a peaceful and relaxing place to unwind this is it. It’s also pet friendly, which was a huge plus for us since we were traveling with our dog . We will definitely be back when visiting the area."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin was so cute and homey! We loved all the animals and the beautiful scenery around
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Start off by saying, WOW, what an experience! Would we go back or recommend this place to anyone? Definitely!
The reason we were going to be in the area was to attend our grandson’s wedding at a venue about 2-miles away. There were eight of us: all adults. All of us were coming from out of state.
Last fall we were visiting family in McDonough, so we took the opportunity to start looking around. We looked at hotels in Thomaston and other towns nearby. It was obvious that we didn’t want to drive through the countryside at night. So, I went online and looked for an Airbnb. This Airbnb got my attention due to its location and how interesting it looks on the website. We drove out to see it and once we did that, we booked both cabins.
We found the cabins very clean with all the amenities of home: nice beds, a well-stocked kitchen with all the appliances, toiletry items and even coffee. We found sitting outside on the front porch in the morning a treat: quiet except for the rooster crowing."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay here!!! It was so peaceful and relaxing. We stayed here to visit family in the surrounding area and it was perfect. We enjoyed having coffee on the porch while watching the sunrise over the beautiful pond. We had family come over on one of the days so we could all go fishing together in the pond and eat lunch in their enclosed shed and they loved the place as well. The donkeys were so sweet and Nicole and Tucker were nice enough to let us feed them carrots!!! I recommend this to anyone who loves farm animals, fishing and peace and quiet."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is wonderful. The description was accurate. The setting was peaceful, beautiful, and private. The hosts were great. They left clear instructions, brochures for are attractions, and even carrots for the grandkids to feed the donkeys. We are planning to return at a future date."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"This was a wonderful place for a retreat!! I stayed for three weeks — it was very peaceful. I appreciated that I could bring my dog as it was much cheaper than boarding her.
The kitchen is well-stocked with plenty of pots and pans and utensils, there is a fridge/freezer and stove/oven. and there is a grill right outside the back door on the patio. The bathroom has a walk-in shower as well as a claw foot bathtub. There are also laundry facilities in a separate building very close by.
The pond is a short walk away, and there are donkeys and cows to visit as well. There is plenty of land to take a nice long walk without going on the road.
There is a Dollar General about 5 mins away, and grocery stores about 15 mins away in Thomaston.
Nicole was very responsive to emails and even emailed to check in with me to make sure I had everything I needed.
All in all, this was an awesome place to stay. I would definitely return."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great weekend . We caught over 50 fish this weekend . The kids had a great time on the paddies . Feeding the donkeys carrots was cool. Our daughter fell in love with one of the cats on the property . Very nice cabin , with everything that we needed"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Very peaceful place to stay and to walk around the property. Loved petting the donkeys. The pond is beautiful and we love the cabin. Everything was clean and check in is a breeze.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I can’t speak more highly of this cabin and host! It was a magical trip. I haven’t slept that well in a long time! Wood burning fire, rain on a tin roof and a swim in a lake followed by a garden tub bath. Truly relaxing, wonderful family time, and unforgettable memories. I can’t wait to go back! Thank you for making us feel right at home!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We don’t get to travel often because we have a special needs child that requires skilled nurses when we aren’t with her. We needed just a quick night away, to get our other children out of the house and time to just be normal kids for once. We couldn’t go far. Nicole’s cabin is only 40 minutes from our home but it felt like we were a hundred miles away. The farm animals were so much fun for our boys and my 4 year old caught his first fish on the dock. My teenager did have a few opinions about the antique dolls used for decor. He was convinced one was the Annabelle doll and we had brought him to a haunted cabin in the woods. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣 Once we hid the “Annabelle” doll, he still insisted on sleeping in the living room but he did have a blast! Disclaimer: The cabin is NOT haunted. 🤭 But I did get a very distinct feeling that George Washington may have lived there at one point, if GW had a power recliner and massive shower room."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have enjoyed time at both cabins, what a wonderful, peaceful place to stay."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great, historic, cabin. Quiet and peaceful stay. Highly recommend for all who want to enjoy a relaxing getaway."

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Absolutely gorgeous! Just the smell of the cabin walking felt like taking a step back in time. It felt like home as soon as we walked in, which means everything when you're working on the road. We hope to come back soon for some actual fun and exploring!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The cabin and the property was absolutely what we were looking for! The cabin was clean, comfortable and relaxing. The ramp to the lake made it really easy to navigate through the wooded area. We were encouraged to pet the farm animals, enjoy fishing in the lake and use the row boat. The cabin is handicap accessible so everyone can enjoy it. Pets are welcome too! The hosts were always available if needed but allowed total privacy to guests. Our stay here was everything and more than we had hoped for. We will definitely be returning."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Highly recommended!
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We rented this cabin for our daughter and her family. They had a blast fishing and visiting with the bunnies! The cabin is very cute and rustic. The walkway down to the pond is awesome too! The host thought of everything. Even designated towels for your pups if the decided to go swimming! A+
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really unique cabin and property. Enjoyed all the authentic antiques. Super quiet and peaceful. Great communication, easy to check in. Highly recommend. Would return if I was in town again."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Definitely worth another visit ❣️
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy & Comfy - Everything we needed for a quiet weekend getaway.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great cabin with lots to do! Nice pond out back and very pet-friendly. The general area offers numerous outdoor activities and nearby Thomaston is a nice little town also.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay, the cabin was so cozy and quiet. Mountain the farm dog kept us company and we fell in love with him! My son enjoyed fishing and caught a couple bass using the little jon boat. Mary and Pat were very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. Definitely recommend and look forward to coming back!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a splendid way to spend four days. I highly recommend hiking down (or up) at Flint River which is close by. We brought a puzzle and made dinners and enjoyed the quiet with our two pups inside the spacious cozy cabin #2.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet! Quaint! Comfy! My family enjoyed time by the pond, time in the boat, and fishing on the banks! Our evenings were spent by the fire playing games and laughing. together. It was a great time and location to unplug from the world! It's a rustic location and very down to earth! We loved our stay! Next time, we will book a longer stay!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great, secluded cabin with beautiful surroundings. Great for kids. Our 6 year old loved playing outside with the friendly doggy mascots."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Five out of five stars
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We stayed at cabin 2 and loved the quiet and secluded setting. Morning coffee at the private pond was so scenic and peaceful. We will definitely come back.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What an amazing place to get away from the City Life. I enjoyed every aspect of the farm. The log cabin was all of that and to walk the grounds and have fun with the goats and dogs was such a treat. I didn’t get the opportunity to fish in the pond, but I’ll be going back to experience some more adventures. I herded a couple of goats for the first time and it was awesome. Can’t wait to return."
2021-10-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful place full of charm, but may not be for all-comers… at least for now. We encountered a bit of disrepair in the form of wood rot on decking that gave-way underfoot. This was quickly repaired, but could be a real problem for a disabled person.
TV options are limited to DVDs, and though WiFi is available, you won’t be streaming above SD at the speeds offered. You’ll need to remember to bring your streaming box from home to make that work.
Still, you don’t come to a place like this to sit on the couch. Outside the pond awaits with fishing from the pier or paddle boat. There are lots of trails to locations around the property with animals etc. There are numerous destinations nearby with plenty of local flavor.
The amenities are bespoke and vary from subpar to excellent, so YMMV in terms of experience. The electric stove eyes were uneven and hard to work with effectively, but the shower was wide comfortable and very relaxing. The master bed has a great mattress and sleeps well, but the chairs are all hard wood and uncushioned except for one love-seat in the living room. The dock and pound are a great place to spend the day fishing or just relaxing, but slippery planks and wood rot may make the walk too it feel less than safe.
I can recommend for people who know what they are getting into and are willing to go the rough edges to enjoy a real rustic experience. The price is very affordable for what you get and being ‘pet friendly’ is an awesome added bonus. For the elderly, the disabled, or the very young; despite its appeal, this property is in need of investment to be comfortable for all guests."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Really enjoyed my stay at the cabin. It was a unique and interesting look into history. Mary Pat was an awesome host. It was like a vacation even though I was working. I would definately stay here again when in the area.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cabin is as an amazing place to stay only wish we had more time there.
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this was my second time staying...cabin 2 this time. I live them both so I don't think I could pick a favorite. I absolutely love staying here. everything is perfect. my dog loves it too.

2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mrs Mary Pat and Mr Rick are by far the most kind and considerate hosts ever. I adore them and their beautiful cabins.
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful relaxing place to go
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed our stay at the cabin very much. We spent lots of time at the lake hanging out and relaxing. Perfect weekend!
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,very spacious yet cozy little cabin
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great log cabin experience. Exactly as advertised. The grounds and pond were still surprisingly great as was nearby Sprewell Bluff Park. Host provided excellent local info.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Cute cabin! Great for small families! Our kids and dogs had so much fun in the cabin and out in the row boat fishing all day. We enjoyed the break from technology with the ability to connect. WiFi in the cabin. The posting was completely accurate and super easy to check in/out. Will definitely stay here again in the future.
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Recommend this excellent rental to anyone who enjoys privacy and nature
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was perfect. My family had a great stay at the cabin and visit to Sprewell Bluff park just a few minutes away.
2021-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"If you're into antiques, history or the feeling of stepping back in time, this should be on your list of must stay locations! Mary Pat and her Husband Rick have created a very special place here inside and out. Although we only stayed overnight, a family could easily enjoy a few days of old timeyness and enjoy the outdoorsas well. It's definitely not your typical experience, but that's what this location is all about. One thing to take note of, there is a fairly strong musty smell that would likely bother anyone sensitive to that sort of thing. I have respiratory issues, and one night is all I could handle. That being said, I'm glad we stoppedand experienced what they had to offer. Mary Pat and Rick were great hosts, very attentive and quick to respond."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Pat’s location, amenities, and hospitality made a very difficult weekend a place to unwind and relax. Thankful for the thoughtfulness. Definitely staying again."
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is a hidden gem! How many places can you stay in a real log cabin? If you are looking for a quiet romantic weekend or a week long place to spend with the family, this place is for you. Enjoy the claw foot tub and the view of the lake. Bring plenty of food, the local fare is hit and miss."
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Awesome stay can’t wait to spend another weekend here, kids loved all the extra stuff to do"
2020-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to spend a few days outdoors! We so enjoyed the animals, fishing, and beautiful outdoor spaces!"
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is a beautiful home and the property is excellent! The kids loved the pond and exploring the property! Everything was so clean and welcoming!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wonderful place!
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great rustic cabin on a nice property! Surprisingly spacious for an old house. Friendly hosts and dogs. Was perfect spot to relax with our kids in a rural farm setting.
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Expect a wonderful setting , a quiet place to rest , unwind and relax. We sat by the lake for hours just absorbing the peace. It was perfect."
2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Mary Pat was so kind!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place has everything you’d expect an 1800’s cabin to have + air conditioning, hot hot water, and the softest set of sheets. My kids spent each night and each morning running around the large property looking for the owners goats! We only stayed two nights and we planned other activities in town, but a couple more nights would have been great. I’m sure you could just let time pass sitting outside on the porch or around the fire. FYI The rain on the metal roof will put you right out. The tv takes DVD’s only and there is a collection in the joint laundry room.
We will be back!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Five stars all the way! Being on a farm reminded me of when I was young. Having my wife and her brother and our kids there to experience the farm was great. The dogs are absolutely the sweetest. The water was great. And the fishing was great. We came to hang out and fish, and that is exactly what we got. Everything was just as I expected. Didn't meet Mary Pat,but I did have the pleasure of meeting Rick. Who was really cool and hospitable. I recommend this to any with kids. Bring them fishing, walk the farm. And just relax. Awesome place!"
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at the log cabin! Quiet, friendly, clean and a chance to see an earlier generations way of living (with today's conveniences). I will be back soon!"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,As always a delightful cabin with an amazing lake . Great service and a fantastic atmosphere. This is our second visit and will definitely be back.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Mary Pat's and Rick's cabin! We loved having the lake there for my 10 yr old daughter to learn how to fish. Every morning when she woke up, she would change and head over to the lake to practice. We also loved the ramp from Cabin 2 leading all the way to the lake. We enjoyed having their Great Pyrenees dogs visit us everyday and sometimes staying overnight at the door. Our 2 little pups had a blast there as well sniffing the grounds and just being outside. It was such a treat staying at this 1800 cabin. It's also just a few min away from Sprewell Bluff which is such a nice park close to the Flint River. We will definitely stay here again the next time we drive to TN from FL."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an amazing place! Booked a weekend with my dogs and my friends and we rented both cabins. My dogs swam in the pond..we took walks..kids played outside and the grown ups relaxed. There wasnt a TV and I almost brought one but I promise you there was so much to do we never wanted to sit and watch anything . I will absolutelybe back again and maybe for more than a weekend
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The cabins are adorable! So many authentic touches! The kids can’t wait to come back! My son who doesn’t normally like fishing, caught 8 fish before I had the coffee made. The beds and pillows were super comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. Thank you again!"
2020-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was very cozy and tranquil. The kids did not want to leave.😂
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"So cute, cozy, and comfortable. We really enjoyed being on the property and the cabin was amazing! Would absolutely recommend!"
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very relaxing space
2019-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"The cabins are a sanctuary from the "" real world"". Too bad Monday has come too soon! We highly recommend!"
2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful. Exceeded expectations in every way.
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! Relaxing, private, and a great place to vacation with pets. What a wonderful getaway!"
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This place was amazing. The cabin is gorgeous and the lake is stunning. It was so peaceful and Mary Pat and Rick were so kind. They have everything you need to make it feel like a home away from home. Can’t wait to go back!!!
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Pat’s place is full of rustic old world charm. Just a stone’s throw from her house, your sure to find everything you need in this cabin for a quiet, relaxing, peaceful day away."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you want a nice cabin stay with a feeling of serenity and freedom, this is a must see place"
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The setting of these cabins is really lovely, with a access to the pond and farm surroundings. We adored seeing the animals and happy farm dogs. Our cabin was clean and had everything we needed, the queen bedroom very comfortable. The authentic cabin structure is very interesting and memorable. The cabin is a little dark inside - we turned on all the lamps - but the modernization is good, with plenty of electrical outlets and wi-fi access, all great!"
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Expect a great time and a relaxing environment. Everything is so clean and beautiful. We will make it a regular trip!
2019-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,We ended up having some cold days on our vacation and the fireplace kept us nice and cozy. The cabin-feel brought back good memories and made us feel at home. Our son loved the animals and pond.
2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You will love these cute adorable cabins nestled in the woods next to the little lake. If you want to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city this is definitely the place. If your on a long journey and traveling the southeast, this is a great centralized location to take a break and regenerate for a few days. There is plenty to do in this tranquil farm setting. The animals are grand entertainment as well as the dock and water. Enjoy The Stillmeadows as nature intended."
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A wonderful cabin experience! Our family of four really enjoyed our stay!!
2018-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,These cabins and grounds are absolutely beautiful and their animals are wonderful. We truly enjoyed our canine tour guides and greeters. We had a wonderful time. Thank you!
2018-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Stillmeadow! The cabin (Cabin 2 for us) was clean and spacious, and the decor was so cute. Mary Pat and Rick are very kind and attentive, and their property is BEAUTIFUL. The land has a peacefulness that you can’t find in a big city, but it still buzzes with life - goats, cows, fish in the pond, chickens, and dogs! Their dogs are so sweet and friendly. I would highly recommend staying here’sj"
2018-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Awesome! Would love to come back to spend more time to explore the area.
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay during our trip to Thomaston. The cabins are a great place for large groups to gather and fellowship. The cabins are located on a wonderful wooded property in a rural setting. Mary Pat and her husband were very nice and helpful. We would definitely stay again!
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"The cabin was perfect. We had a need to evacuate with three large dogs and didn’t want to be crammed in a hotel room. Instead we found this cabin and we had a wonderful hurrication.
We stayed for 8 days. Our son fished and hiked, we ran, played with the goats and were able to work. The WiFi connection was good.
It was great to be able to do laundry too. Mary Pat and Rick are wonderful hosts.
The cabin was perfect for our family of four. The bedrooms are large and we even brought our dogs’ crates and they fit. Our son loved the loft! The cabin is rustic but it has WiFi and airco!
The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. We even got a few fresh eggs from Mary Lats chickens.
Overall it was a perfect place to spend time away from home."
2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stillmeadows Cabin #2 was everything we had hoped it would be. Peaceful, rustic, but very comfortable with all the modern conveniences we needed. The attention to detail in the decor was really appreciated. Mary Pat and Rick were excellent hosts. We particularly enjoyed spending time with all of their friendly dogs when we walked on the property or relaxed on the dock by the pond. I would definitely recommend staying with them."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary Pat and her husband are two wonderful people and their spirit is reflected throughout the cabins and the property. I have always loved log cabins especially really old genuine ones and staying there was a dream come true. Although it might have been a little rougher without the plumbing and electricity way back when... I kept finding details that I had not seen at first glance and it made me smile every time as I recognized the same sweet touch. The bathroom had everything we needed and quaint touches all over it too. I am a gardener and my heart was glad to see each blossom reflect the owner's love and care. Although Mary Pat and her husband were not on the property during our stay (someone else was keeping the grounds), we were warmly greeted by their furry friends who were a nice presence for our son. I must say I enjoyed them too!
He very much enjoyed fishing at the pond even though this time he had the right equipment but did not get a catfish (last time the catfish broke his line)...However, he hardly had time to put his bait in the water before he would get something on the line! I had never seen so much fish! The fishing deck is so well thought of with its shady cover and outdoor furniture. I love hearing the natural spring sound in the background. A previous time we had used the boat on the pond and it made for a special intimate conversation and togetherness. Also loved the little porch area with the grill just outside the kitchen. Made for nice steaks.
The cabin was very comfortable and we slept so well we got up almost late.
Wanting to stay away from the city I cooked a lot and found a kitchen well stocked with pots, pans and utensils. The upstairs room is adorable under the gable. I could not resist sitting on the genuine era rope bed...and would have loved to sleep on it!
We were very thankful for Mary Pat's kindness to allow us to make use of a little more time as no guest were arriving that same day. She was excellent with communication by the way!
I hope I get to come back during the winter to stay put the whole time with chestnuts roasting in the fire..."
2018-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fishing, fishing, and more fishing! We caught so many fish we lost count! I’d say in 2 days we caught every bit of 50 fish or more. Nice spacious, old time cabin. The bed and pillows were great. Better than my house has! The dogs were so friendly and fun. Great response to messages. The property was well kept. We loved everything about our stay here it was extremely fun and we all felt like champion fishermen. Great time here. 5 stars from us, definitely. Thank you for the fun getaway with the family."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"2 adults and 5 kids (tweens/teens) stayed here for a relaxing long weekend and fit comfortably. Cabin 2 has a walkway directly to the dock and a decent view onto the pond, which was convenient for watching kids out in the boat while making dinner. Lots of nature, friendly animals and friendly hosts. Although there is only 1 bathroom, it is setup so that more than one person can be showering or getting ready at the same time and still have privacy. Good fishing in the pond. There was a row boat available to use as well."
2018-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is an amazing retreat! If you need you need a relaxing place to unwind, this is the place!"
2018-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Stillmeadows was the perfect weekend getaway! The Joneses are incredibly hospitable and have a lovely property! Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves being outdoors and doesn’t mind dogs, cows, and pigs!"
2018-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful, peaceful place to stay. Just as was described and totally easy. Loved it! Would recommend it to anyone."
2017-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2017-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"This is the perfect combination between convenience and wooded hideaway. The pond out back is full of hungry fish but you better bring your own pole and heavy line if you want to catch the HUGE catfish that always got away.
HVAC works like a dream. No TV needed when you could be watching a camp fire.
The beds are clean and cozy. Two very workable places to set up your computer and work if needed.
Over all a triple A+ from these experienced travelers."
2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great house, awesome to have such easy access to area sites and the pond behind the cabin. Wonderful stay."
2017-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved the scenery the lake was our favorite spot. We also walk the land and explored. The dogs were friendly and approachable.
2017-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our family loved Mary Pat's place! The cabins were charming, rustic and very well equipped with everything we needed. Mary Pat and her husband were super friendly, welcoming and very responsive to any needs that arose. Our children just loved playing outside with the dogs and fishing in the pond!"
2017-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place to bond with the family! A place full of Love!! Everything was perfect!!! Our kids enjoy it more than disney!
2017-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great place to spend a few days! My kids are already wanting to go back. Place is as advertised. Fun rustic but yet still very comfortable place for our family to ""unplug"". Great setting to just be together as a family, enjoying each other in a rustic/farm/outdoor/cozy setting."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The owners were on the spot when we got there. First Rick greeted us to make sure all was good and if we had any questions. Mary Pat was next as we met up from her gathering eggs. A very nice place and peaceful. You could feel the restfulness when you entered the cabin. I'll be back to rest, write, and get some alone time."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This country cabin is a genuine cabin-- old log construction, quilts, and genuine 19th and early 20th century artifacts, but supported by a well-equipped kitchen and contemporary bathroom. What makes this a wonderful family experience, however, is the presence of farm animals and a private pond, complete with fishing dock and small boats that children can handle on their own. Located in a truly rural setting, the site is completely quiet, with stars at night and roosters in the morning. Mary Pat even provides eggs from her hens. A wonderful retreat from the world."
2017-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time!! Mary Pat was a great host!! Every thing about the cabin was just as described!! We loved the area. If I could talk my wife into it I'd move there....lol!!
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay at the cabin was perfect! Exactly the rustic family getaway we were looking for. The grounds were gorgeous and the friendly pups were an added bonus. Would recommend for a fun family stay!
2016-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while visiting our soldier at Ft. Benning. Perfect place for reconnecting and relaxing. Mary Pat and Rick were perfect host. If you haven't experienced these cabins and country living, you are missing out. Great place to bring the little ones. Lots of animals to play with."
2016-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVED this place. It really was absolutely perfect for our family. My kids spent hours in the rowboat, splashing in the pond, and playing board games. We fell in love with the dogs, and our dog got to be truly off leash for the first time in her life. We walked the property, which was lovely, and mets goats and cows. The house was the right blend of nice (good beds and linens, AC) and rustic. We disconnected and went to bed early and woke up with the roosters. We will totally go back!"
2016-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary Pat and Rick made us feel very welcome. It was truly a joy to stay at the property as it was a quiet and relaxing place to rest. The children and I enjoyed rowing on the pond especially!
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Pat was very pleasant in our communication and her temporary hostess did an amazing job at making us feel welcome! It's a lovely cabin and the grounds are very nice, complete with goats, chickens, and a fishing lake. I would definitely stay again and will recommend it to friends!"
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This property was amazing. The attention to detail with regard to cabin life was perfect.

We briefly met the hosts upon arrival and they were welcoming and kind.

We only wish we had longer to stay and enjoy."
2016-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A very nicely restored historic property next to a wooded lakefront. Very quiet and peaceful. The cabin had all you would need to stay one or several days ( no TV but then again that's the purpose), just walk in with a bag of groceries! There's a covered dock at the lake with seating. Were going to keep this one on our favorites list."
2015-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cabin was so very comfortable, everything was very well maintained, towels were plush, information to restaurants was so very helpful. It was the most memorable part of the road trip for my children."
2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful location, charming old log cabin. The kids enjoyed exploring the property, fishing at the pond, playing with the dogs and petting the goats! Mary Pat shared a dozen farm fresh eggs with us for breakfast."
2015-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had five women in our party, three generations. We all agree that the cabin was quaint, the grounds were kept nicely and ripe for exploration. We mostly visited with one another, rather than exploring the grounds or surrounding towns, and we found the cabin perfect for our needs, just as it was described. We would love to visit again with our children and extended family. Thank you for a sweet time."
2015-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Perfect in every regard; everything as described. Quiet, comfortable, fully equipped. Wifi bandwidth was fine, shower was good. It was a pleasure to grill out on the deck, and best of all, I really got a good night's sleep. Really look forward to coming back sometime when I have more time!"
2015-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Mary Pat and Rick were great hosts. Staying in one of their 1885 cabins was awesome. The bedding was very comfortable, the grounds were spectacular and we felt very welcome. Wally and Georgia were very accommodating as well :) (make sure you lock the doors, the doggies know how to open them haha). They have really nice scrapbook on the table listing all the things to do in town including directions to restaurants. We enjoyed just walking around their pond and talking with the cows though. We didn't need or want for anything, we would highly recommend these cabins for a quiet getaway."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I enjoyed our stay. The view of the creek and the sound of flowing water was amazing. We will look to rent it again the next time we are visiting my wife’s family.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stay! The view was amazing, and the place was perfect for my husband and I and our dog."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay was amazing! The location is very romantic and beautiful. Our dog loved exploring the grounds, and there were awesome trails ~10 minutes away. Would definitely recommend!"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place for R&R. With all the rain, the creek was flowing wonderfully strong. I recorded videos of it. The sound of it made our sleep even sweeter. The bed was extremely comfortable and the surroundings were great. It was ""Nature Perfect"". I'd love to see it in the springtime. The only thing that would've made it more perfect is an upstairs toilet. I say that because of the stairs and our age. We're senior adults. But that's not a show stopper. I'd still book it again. Thanks for sharing it with us. We rested well.
Tim and Cate 💞"
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great place to stay with an incredibly beautiful view!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A beautiful place that I already reserved for another stay !!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely enchanting cabin nestled in the serene woods! The rustic charm, cozy interiors, and nature's embrace made our stay unforgettable. A perfect escape from the hustle and bustle. Grateful for the peaceful retreat. Kayla and Joel were incredibly responsive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience. Highly recommend!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an absolute dream! I’ve stayed in several AirBnB’s over the years & this one might take the cake for intimate surroundings. The river is beautiful & calming, we would crack the bedroom window & fall asleep to the tranquil sound. The hosts are amazing, the dogs are precious & we recommend this place 10/10. We will be back!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a great place to stay! The views are beautiful and the space is very cozy.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The home was beautiful inside and out! We really enjoyed our stay, and felt right at home!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place and perfect for me. Highly recommended
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for me while working in the area. It's quite, clean, comfortable and secluded."
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed about a week,"This was a nice private place on a creek that finally flowed after the hurricane came through, although that was not the reason I stayed there. The main living area is a bit awkward as the loveseat/ couch is under the tv so you can’t watch it unless you sit on the barstools across from it at an eating bar. That was almost completely taken up by my cosmetics/ hygiene products as there is no room in the bathroom to put anything. I know that there was nothing in the kitchen that I was not aware of as I was not cooking there anyway, but there was only 1 can light in the kitchen, no under cabinet or over the sink lighting. When the sun was up in the morning, the light was ok but we had some cloudy days and it was very difficult to read anything. The satellite was out for the first couple of days I was there but could get on the internet.
The bed was super comfortable but I guess I did not pay attention when I booked it as there was only 1 bathroom and had to negotiate some steep steps"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this little home! Perfect for my stay! Loved being greeted by Grady the pup when I would arrive back at the home. Great stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had a great time. The hosts were very helpful and accommodating. The place is very cute, and the setting is amazing. Everything you need to cook is available, the bed is very comfortable. The place is well priced.
Two things to be aware of, these are not at all complaints just two things I thought would be useful to know, they did not inhibit my stay at all.
The main house shares a driveway with the rental home so they are closer than I expected. The rental faces the river and the view is amazing, you will not see the main house when you are looking towards the river but it is nearby.
There are other dogs on the property that walk around unleashed, they are very sweet! I brought my German Shepherd who is a little wary of other dogs so that was an adjustment for him but the other dogs were great. Just a heads up for any other dog owners with anxious puppies. Other than that my dog had a blast climbing around the river and sniffing in the woods. I would stay again anytime."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,we really enjoyed our stay. it was as described and the creek was really nice.
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful property & view. Perfect size for 2. Enjoyed being right on the water.

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This place was just what we needed! Absolutely beautiful! The hosts were so nice too!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Anytime I booked a stay, first thing I read are the reviews for the location & places I’m looking to stay in. I couldn’t have been more blessed/thankful to find this cabin. I was taking this spring break week as a much needed get away, bonus it was also my birthday week. The reviews & the view of the creek flowing, sold me on my decision. Kayla & Joel are amazing, extremely friendly hosts, plus the doggies! Their hospitality was impressive & definitely appreciated! The cabin is super cute, the location is close to many things I had planned to do. Sitting out on the patio, listening to the creek, sipping coffee in the morning & reading a book was the most peaceful, beautiful, relaxing atmosphere & just what my soul needed, or wine in the evening. Joel even took time out of his schedule to make sure my 15 year old son was able to catch some fish, beings as that was his goal on the trip. We had an fantastic time & I’d highly recommend for a small family or a couples retreat! Will be back!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,So relaxing and the friendliest host. We will definitely be back to stay again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a perfect location for a couples getaway! We absolutely loved seeing & hearing the creek. The view from the bay windows upstairs is so incredible. The kitchen had everything we needed. We loved the heater fan in the bathroom :) the king sized bed was so incredibly comfortable—it was hard for me to get out of most mornings! Upson county is a true gem and you will not go wrong with booking this stay!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our short stay in this adorable cabin on the creek. The decor was cute, the location was quiet, the creek was serene, and the bed was so comfortable. We loved the large windows looking onto the creek. This was definitely a piece of paradise!"

I’ll be back soon!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a really great time at this little chalet on the river. Went to visit family, but it felt like a true vacation. The hosts were very nice. We really missed our pups back home so it was nice getting a visit every now and then from the very friendly pups next-door. We’ll definitely be back."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very calm and serene place. It was great

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A very picturesque backdrop. Very relaxing and quiet. would definitely recommend.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous view, lovely cabin! We had a wonderful long weekend visiting family in the area, using Creekside Cabin as a home base. Not only did we have everything we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay, we had the most amazing view to enjoy while we were there! We spent hours just sitting on the deck and watching the water, and slept with the windows open, so we could hear the water outside. Hosts Joel and Kayla were so friendly and helpful! They made sure that our experience was top-notch. The cabin was clean, well-appointed, and very comfortable. We enjoyed every minute, and can't wait to visit again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The creak cottage was absolutely awesome. Perfect for 1 or 2 people. Everything was clean and well stocked. The view and sound of the river rushing past the front deck was amazing. The upstairs loft was super comfortable to kick back in. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for relaxing getaway!

2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Perfect for a family of 2-3 who are wanting to enjoy some relaxing time in the nature.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a beautiful place! This lovely hollow nestled alongside the creek was absolutely stunning and exactly what we needed to come back to in between events of a hectic wedding weekend. The space is perfectly cozy and comfortable, efficiently equipped, and just totally perfect set against the beautiful natural landscape. There were so many little touches that made us feel right at home. And very close to anything you might need to reach. We also loved meeting the sweet and friendly doodles. We hope to visit again just to enjoy the place itself!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a getaway to sit out, read, and disconnect, this is it. Owners are nearby and extremely pleasant. If you wish, they are happy to leave you be or come down for a chat. Everything is as described. As far as sleeping arrangements, any more than two would be a little cramped. I would recommend two people. Sprewell Bluff park is only a few minutes away and is a great place to spend the day."
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The only reason we ended up in Thomaston was for this Airbnb, and it was all worth it. The cabin was absolutely beautiful and peaceful. Sprewell Bluff is only a 15min drive, and it's worth going more than once.
We're so thankful that we had such a beautiful place to enjoy."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful peaceful place!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was an amazing gem to find on such short notice. The coziness of the place and the amazing view makes this a 10 out of 10 in our books. Most of our time was spent out doors with our dog and some new four legged furry friends. Being able to be only feet away from the water and fishing near the banks of the property line was another amazing part of the trip.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed at the cozy cabin for almost a week in October 2021.
We throroughly enjoyed our stay. We relaxed each evening on the Patio watching and listening to the creek.
We also spent a few evenings by the firepit. Very relaxing!
The creek was pretty high at the time and quite loud! It calmed down after a few days.
We hiked several places in the area: Sprewell Bluff, Pine Mountain and High Falls.
The weather was perfect for hiking in shorts!
The cabin is pet friendly and the owners have a couple of adorable Doodles who visited us often. They were quite friendly.
We looked forward to being 'Doodled' in the morning and evening.
We brought our little 15lb Rat Terrier Buddy and he enjoyed the property and loved the hiking too!
The cabin was very clean and just as pictured! The kitchen is well stocked. Do not be afraid of the 'hot plate' -
it is actually a nice two burner cook top!
While there is no free standing range/oven, there is a nice toaster oven/air fryer and a large microwave.
We didn't have any trouble cooking any meals!
The cabin was quite well stocked too. I usually will bring extra paper towels/toilet paper/trash bags - but all were present and plentiful.
I read a review that someone said that the water smelled funny - I would agree - but it reminded me of the sulfur smell that is common from a well.
I didn't ask if the cabin had city water/sewer like I do in town - I just assumed it had well/septic.
I did brush my teeth and showered from the tap water, and I'm alive and well! LOL!
We did opt to get some bottled water in town for coffee/tea/drinking.
The owners were lovely to work with and we had no issues with anything at all.
We totally enjoyed the stay and hope to return next year for more hiking."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place sets off the road, quite and right on the river. Nice to sit in the porch and listen to the water. Super clean and nice."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Kayla & Joel’s place was absolutely perfect! Our family wanted time together in nature to unwind and take it easy. This location allowed us to do just that. The cottage was clean, well kept, and so cozy. You can hear the creek by merely opening the windows and even more so by sitting out on the porch. My family and I were able to explore the creek, swim, and fish. Sprewell Bluff was just 10 minutes away. You can hike, swim, fish, canoe/kayak, and tube.
Kayla and Joel were very kind, attentive, responsive, and quick to help with any difficulty.
We would absolutely stay here again!"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Hosts are lovely to work with! Loves being by the brook! Even got to give some occasional pats to some friendly neighborhood pups!
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place for a weekend getaway. The little cottage is the perfect size for a couple. All amenities were readily available immediately once you walk into the door. Location is nearby a park for many hiking trails. There is a grocery store nearby as-well, and full kitchen for use with a clean grill. Definitely will visit again, hosts would definitely be considered super hosts as they had everything to the tee with communication. Not a single issue was discovered, and it was super relaxing. 3 additional doggie hosts came around and made sure we are doing okay."
2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend. We really enjoyed it. Clean and good ac. Being by the creek is awesome for dipping your toes in, reading on the porch, or cracking the windows at night to listen to the water. Good and safe location that’s 10 minutes at most to Thomaston and several good places to eat."

2021-04-01,3.0,Stayed a few nights,Great views and natural vibe .... no service or WiFi .. water had a bad smell
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I were I'm Thomaston for a fee days to promote at a local kayak fishing tournament. We were close to the boat dock as well as downtown. The house was charming and perfect for our needs.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"lovely vacation home, with many amenities to feel like home. Beautiful, quiet, back yard with nice porch to enjoy the ambience. A bit of a drive to Thomaston downtown, but was fine for our needs. King bed in master bedroom was very comfortable. Electric fireplace is a nice touch"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the 2nd time we have stayed here. Everything was just as perfect as the first. Felt comfortable and right at home.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great find for a small town
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a little trouble finding it due to the way the neighborhood is set up. The house is down a long driveway and sits behind the house facing the road. Was a little confusing but host help get us there. Host was helpful when I mistakenly locked the door knob along with the remote lock. Had someone come unlock and get is inside within reasonable time. We had an issue with yellow jackets being in the house each night. Most were dying as they entered but obviously there is an infestation somewhere. The host did ask me if we noticed any but only after our stay and after I stepped on a live one and got stung. Hopefully this will be corrected. Otherwise our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. There were plenty of towels, linens and toiletries. Only thing I would suggest is a bigger trash can for the kitchen. The one there was the size for a bathroom. We were there on business so there wasn’t a lot of leisure time spent at the house, but it would be nice if you’re looking for a quiet stay."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,The house was beautiful and well maintained. It was perfect for my group!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This haven was perfect for my family and I! My kids really loved exploring the woods on the property and my husband and I enjoyed sitting on the porch at night time in the quiet. We had peaceful and relaxing stay!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, this is first time we have used an Airbnb. Originally from the area and didn't want a hotel this time. Host has everything stocked you could need for a stay. We will be staying again as we visit family very often."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,My family was only there for one quick overnight. We arrived late at night. Roger met us outside and welcomed us in. We felt right at home. Roger was very hospitable and had a small stock of anything that one may forget when traveling. We appreciated the extra thoughtfulness. We left very early the next morning and were grateful for the grab and go breakfast items that had been provided in the lounge area. Roger was very accommodating & communicative with our group as we had made several changes to our plans with others in our group also staying at Roger's place on additional nights.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We were in town for our daughter’s wedding and basically just to sleep one night. When we met Roger at check-in we felt right at home. Our room was wonderful…bed was very comfortable. We definitely will book there again when we have more time to enjoy their beautiful outdoors!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful area and a lovely place!we only stayed one night but will definitely be back :)
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roger’s place is beyond lovely. Would easily recommend to anyone coming into town and would 100% stay there again. Beautiful, relaxing, just what we needed!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Roger was an amazing host, and had a beautiful and clean home for us to say. The house was gorgeous and very clean, definitely recommend and I would 100% stay here again!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Location was great .host was very helpful and generous .would definitely stay again
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A beautiful and lovingly restored historic home - as described in listing. Roger was very friendly and welcoming. He greeted us at the door and gave a personal tour of our rooms - including tips for comfort, safety and snacks/beverages. The rooms were clean, well-furnished and comfortable. We grew up in this town and discovered that we now have several friends in common, so that was fun, as well. Will definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely step back in time with a beautiful setting. Nice large comfortable space. Definitely remmend and would stay again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Have stayed here multiple times. It is always a great experience!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roger was proactive in making sure I had clear instruction prior to arrival, and during my stay. This is a beautiful old home (I believe circa 1921) on a beautiful property. Conveniently located to downtown/town square, parks, rivers, as well as newer commerce. My room was very clean and comfortable, as was the central shared lounge. Will be my choice when I return to Thomaston!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rogers is a great Host! Easy transition, everything smith, fast communication and excellent prices that can’t be beat! Great historic home, great location and overall very pleased. We choose this stay to keep our technicians and guess when they come
To town from all over the country (: they love it, because it’s different and not a common stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roger is very welcoming. His place is a perfect spot if you are out near Thomaston. I was in for work and it was a great find. Had privacy, but also had some comfortable common space where I could get some work done. The house is neat and has been preserved well! I would stay again for sure."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I used to host. Sometimes when I stay with a ""super host"" it's a wonder to me they got the designation. This is NOT the case with Roger. A TRUE SUPER HOST and 5* experience. Roger goes above and beyond. There are not many places to stay in Thomaston. Many of my colleagues stayed out of town and were at a disadvantage with the heavy rain from a tropical storm. But since Miss Annie's is so conveniently located, I was safely off the road in less than 10 minutes and pleasantly surprised to be walked in by Roger with an umbrella. Quiet, private, and so much interesting history here. I highly recommend staying here."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roger was a wonderful host! Getting to meet him was half the benefit of our stay. He was so kind and everything we needed was right there; he even provided more than I expected. The house is absolutely gorgeous, and the mattress on our bed was great! Everywhere had vintage charm and it was cool to look at everything in the parlor, felt like we were in a hotel!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Roger was one of the nicest host i have encountered in my Airbnb rentals. He met me when I arrived, showed me to my room, showed me the lounge which is actually like a living room and dining room for the guests complete with snacks and beverages and we had a delightful conversation about mutual people we knew. The accommodations were clean and cozy and it was quite peaceful there. A side note: I was actually called away for a medical family emergency and Roger offered to refund my room…. I refused his offer and told him I would be back….. it was all I hoped for plus some. You will not be disappointed!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,This was my 2nd time to stay with Roger. He is a very gracious and accommodating host in a charming older historic home in Thomaston. Highly recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roger was very friendly and hospitable, everything was clean and well stocked"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a great stay. We stayed for one night for a wedding. We were greeted by the host. We were shown around and there were tons of things to make us feel at home (refreshments, toiletries, etc.) It was very quiet and very close to our venue. If we were in the area again we would certainly stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Such a lovely home and gracious Host !

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"As much as I enjoyed staying in a house I’d admired all my life, I enjoyed chatting with Roger about his life in my hometown. To be a relative newcomer, Roger has assimilated and become a vital and contributing member of the community. I can’t wait to make a return visit."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very clean and cozy! Will definitely be staying there next time I’m in Thomaston.

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A comfortable stay and very welcoming host. Only one night but I wish I’d booked longer. Wonderful historic home. Lots of information about the house and original owners. I recommend.. but stay longer than one night.. I wish I had.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Roger embodies southern charm and hospitality. He made us feel very comfortable and welcome. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone. We'll be back the next time we're in the area.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful little gem in a quaint little town. Roger greeted me with a smile and showed me around. The room was very nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed. The attention to detail like hot tea, coffee, fresh fruit, yogurt and water were welcome touches for this weary traveler. I can’t rave enough how welcomed and comfortable I felt. Truly, a home away from home experience. My only regret is I couldn’t stay longer."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Roger was a great host and gave us some very useful ideas of places to eat nearby. The accommodation was spacious and clean and there was an array of coffee/teas fruit and yogurt for breakfast. The house has a very interesting history.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Roger is a great host and makes you feel welcome from the first moment you meet him. Ms. Annie’s is orderly with character. My wife and I had everything we needed and more for the one night we stayed in the Garden Room. We will stay again if we find ourselves near Thomaston, GA in the future."

The house is so, so gorgeous and charming. Upon our arrival, Roger came out to our car and greeted us, and helped us with our bags! He explained everything to know about our room and the lounge and our stay overall, and our conversations with him were always so sweet and enjoyable! We told him one of my friends just had a baby with a couple complications, and he asked how the baby and the mama were doing, which was so considerate and very appreciated by us. He also asked us what our favorite yogurt is, and he was sure to stock it in the mini-fridge for us, which was so special, and such a kind gesture. He gave us a sweet card and a gift on the last night of our stay, and it made my heart melt! There were so many thoughtful touches, and we were so thankful that Roger cared so much about making us feel right at home!!
We stayed in the Garden Room, which was so cozy and beautiful. The pillows, sheets, mattress, and bath towels were all so soft and plush!! The bath towels were 100% Egyptian cotton, so we knew Roger desires the best for his customers!!
We were always so excited to come back to the house, because we knew we had a warm, cozy bed to sleep in, and it felt just like we were in our home away from home.
Roger, we can't thank you enough for all you did to make our stay the best stay possible!! Ms. Annie's is a gem in Thomaston, and if you're not staying here, you're missing out BIG TIME."

He greeted me and was a wonderful conversationalist as he gave me so many insightful insights into (interesting) Thomaston and Upson County. Beyond that, the whole arrangement there in his lovely home is simply everything a traveler could ask for. Lovely. Restful. Historic. Spic-and-span clean. Comfortable. Like home. So much like being at home. So many nice touches. Location is central to town (within easy walking distance to the city center). There’s much to love about Roger’s place – a historic place that’s tied up in the history of the county’s most historically significant family. When I go back to that part of Georgia, I emphatically hope to stay there again. Thank you, Roger!"

2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Annie's Guest House is a cozy and charming Victorian style home built in 1922. Roger is an excellent host and a wellspring of information on local things to do. If you like to hike, kayak, or tube, checkout Spreebluff State Park, a short twenty minute drive that will not disappoint. The grounds and gardens around the home provide ample opportunity for relaxing and romantic strolls. Lest I forget, the dark, hardwood floors, doors, and molding create an atmosphere that transports visitors to another era."

2018-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roger was amazing. My son is moving to the area and was looking for a place to live on short notice. Available housing isn't plentiful in town, but incredibly, Roger spent a great deal of time making calls and trying to help him find a place even though he had a very busy weekend of his own. He even rode around with us and introduced us to people who had rooms available for rent. I absolutely can't thank Roger enough and am grateful to have made a new friend who I can visit when I come to town to visit our son."

2017-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roger's home is so beautiful and cozy. He really went above and beyond for me on my trip. I was escaping hurricane Irma, and Roger let me check in early because I had driven a long way through traffic and got there sooner than expected. He also let me check out a day early as I was driving back to make sure my home was in one piece. He even packed me a sandwich and a muffin for the long ride. Roger is definitely a southern gentleman through and through!
The bed was so comfy and the house is nice and quiet, so I slept like a log my whole stay. I loved the upstairs parlor as a nice little common area to escape my room while there. The location is perfect and I urge everyone to take advantage of his suggestions for experiencing local Thomaston. Make sure you get to meet his two rescue dogs as well!"

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My family of 5 enjoyed Jared’s place on the Flint. We were up from FL to visit family for the holidays and loved having our own river front place to relax. The place had plenty of space for us & kept us warm on those cold nights. It was very clean and stocked with essentials. Jared responded quickly to any question I had. Will definitely stay again.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What an awesome place !! We loved the swing to the island
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My dream space on the Flint. A little higher in price than similar digs in other areas but I would stay again in a heartbeat.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jared’s location was EXACTLY what my family was looking for! It is a great spot on the Flint River and has its own little private island that we could fish and kayak off of. We loved drinking our coffee on the front porch looking out at the River. The house is very open with a large kitchen and living area, the bedrooms were clean and comfortable and the AC worked great! We loved it so much that we are planning to come back next year!!
I grew up in a rural area, so I’m used to bugs, snakes, GA red clay and absolutely NO cell service! So if you are city folk and expect something pristine with high speed internet, this may not be the place for you.
I almost don’t want to give such a good review because when I come back, it may be fully booked! But if you’re looking for somewhere to get off the grid and enjoy the River, this is a great place to stay."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,The guys enjoyed their stay. thank you
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Jared’s place is perfect for a weekend in GA. Clean, spacious and quiet. The house has everything you could need, huge relaxing back porch.Beautiful view of the flint river, can’t wait to go back and visit."

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful scenery. The river was nice and peaceful. We only stayed for a few hours as a last minute valentines day trip, but it was very serene and realizing. We grilled out back, and then walked across the bridge to relax and just watch the water flow. The internet is super slow though! But who needs the internet when your relaxing. There was no cellular service for us and we had to connect to the Wi-Fi to make calls. Otherwise it was awesome and relaxing. A little on the high end per night for just a couple, but great value if it’s more people!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We will definitely be back! The front porch was my favorite part. Watching the leaves fall is not something we get to see where I’m from. My kids had a blast on the bridge. It was very cozy. This is in the woods. There is no cell service but there is WiFi. We loved being able to disconnect from our phones. Thanks for a great stay!

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We were not able to take advantage of the property which has a beautiful river and kayaks to use!

I would recommend this for a girls weekend or a family weekend!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Cute, quiet, peaceful little place to relax with the family... THE BEDROOMS DO HAVE BLINDS! I was leary. ""Grammy"" had a little too much fun the day before check out and moved at a, well, Grandma's pace the morning of and they were very understanding and gave her the time she needed to get her moving again. She would happily return, but she'll keep to the porch next time!"

2022-07-01,2.0,Stayed with kids,"The renovations and upgrades were top notch. The little “island” and walking area were nice.
Unfortunately, it was not clean as you would expect when arriving for a night. Cleanliness is a big factor for us, and even my kids noticed and were hesitant to get into the beds.
What made matters worse on this particular night was that there was no wifi. In the middle of nowhere with no service, we couldn’t even communicate with the owners our issues.
Place has potential, but wasn’t ready for us."
2022-07-01,3.0,Stayed one night,"We travel alot, sometimes twice a month. So we're getting accustomed to Airbnb stays. The day of our stay i found it odd we didn't get a email from the host with check in information. Good thing Airbnb message had the address after receiving payment in full. We arrived at the home and checked email, but still no email from the host. I tried to email to get lockbox info but there was no cellphone service reception in this area. I tried to get a signal but nothing. My wife couldn't get a signal either. So we drove 2 miles away to get a signal. Once we got the signal we emailed for the lockbox info. Once we get that, we drove back to the house, get inside and then there's no power. We drove back 2miles down the road to email. She said it was storms that knocked out power and someone was coming to fix it. Understandable because it was heavy storms that week. I told her i can't message her with no service but she said when power come on wifi should work. We went back to the house and sat outside waiting for restoration of power. We ate on front porch. When it got darker we went inside and waited. Power came up around 8pm that night but wifi never came up so I couldn't reach out to host. What was very uncomfortable is all the large front windows and glass door. No coverage for windows so people could look into the dark nights there. My wife didn't want to go out to kitchen at night because how exposed it was. Bedrooms have blinds but not livingroom. The next morning still no wifi. Satellite TV finally came up but by then we had enough. We cleaned up and left around 8am. We drove to town and messaged that we left and was heading home. The only response seemed more like they weren't being empathetic about our situation and responding about showing up at their pizzeria they owned in town and getting a appetizer. I was disappointed because despite the circumstances I didn't blame them but empathetic at the moment wouldn't went a long way. I didn't want to write a review but I decided to after all and hope moving forward communication emails and feedback would be better. As a final note, it's a nice place with a nice view. You may have cellphone service issues but that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying peace."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, great location. Having no blinds or curtains is uneasy with all the windows. However all the windows is so nice to see the Flint, just no privacy at night. Beautiful home and amazing location!"
2022-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,It is gorgeous!! The location is perfect. I didn't like that there were no curtains up.
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a such a good experience here! The house is beautiful, very clean, and the neighborhood is nice and quite. Given the location, we were expecting to see quite a few bugs but we never had any problems with that! The hosts are very good at communicating and always made sure we had everything we needed. We would highly recommend staying here and will definitely be back ourselves!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paulette's cabin was a dream. We were just passing through and stayed just a night, but is was such a fun experience. My little boys loved running around the farm when we arrived, and I so enjoyed watching the animals and the sun set before we turned in to our cozy stay in the primitive cabin. We have been reading through Little House on the Prairie series, and it felt like the perfect place to stay for my boys to experience a little bit what it may have been like for Laura (but with ac, electricity and running water lol). Both Forsyth and Barnsville were charming little towns that had several options to eat and walk around. And Paulette was such a gracious host. She obviously has put in years and all of her heart to cultivating her beautiful farm."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paulette has a magical place amongst the cows, sheep, donkeys, cats, ducks, roosters, chickens and dogs. The guest house is eclectic and charming, definitely off the beaten path. It’s a good place to get away from it all and reconnect with family, self and nature."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful property! Very nice host:)
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The place was very peaceful except for the dogs barking all the night. I think is unusual so you may have a different experience.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This is the second time we stayed and it was charming and comfortable
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Cozy stay. Friendly host. My family enjoyed the animals and seeing people working out on the farm. With permission they allowed us to fish in the pond. There were some dogs barking on and off at night behind the house. They were by the chickens… so maybe to protect them. But we did fall asleep and didn’t have issues. Comfy beds, lots of pillows and blankets."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really enjoyed our stay at Paulette’s place. After a day of driving it was so nice to walk around the pond and watch the animals. The cabin was charming with artwork and antiques, and the setting was peaceful. It was about 15 minutes from I-75 and totally worth the drive. It is a working farm so I did hear a dog barking a couple of times during the night, probably to protect the chickens? Anyway, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again if in the area."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,A very fun and charming cabin. We loved all the antiques and decor. The kids were so excited about the farm animals.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paulette was a wonderful and welcoming host. The guest house is beautiful, cozy and peaceful. It is remote, but not too far out. Unfortunately we arrived late and we were unable to take in the beautiful sunset that others have mentioned, but we were able to wake to the sounds of the animals on a quiet and lovely morning. Coffee on the porch was very relaxing. We had a question when we arrived and Paulette responded immediately and was willing to help. Thanks again, Paulette for the memorable stay :)"

It is even nicer than the picture in person, my wife did not want to leave, will definitely book again if I have to travel to Georgia again."
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wished it was warmer weather so we could sit on the porch and watch the cows, sheep, turkeys, chickens, cats and the 2 miniature horses.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We certainly enjoyed our stay, even though it was only for one night. The cabin is very unique. A lot of antiques to observe. All the animals were so entertaining. Very relaxing observing the moon at night and sunrise in the morning on the front porch."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was just what we needed!!! The little farmhouse was like stepping back in time and living on a little homestead. The peace of their farm is so nice from the hustle and bustle of being in town. The sweet horse and ponies along with the cows, sheep and chickens along with the turkeys were a delight to wake up to each morning. Only negative was not being able to stay longer!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Hands down the most unique stay we’ve ever had. Rustic, interesting, welcoming. Loved the claw foot tub, loved the animals, especially the turkey and kitties.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette thank you for your hospitality and kindness. The comfort and beauty of your home is just what we needed during this stressful time. We loved seeing all the things from the past, walking around and seeing all the animals, nature and things you have repurposed. Becky loved seeing your moms wedding dress as she was found of your mother Ree Ree. Again thank you"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Simply put - this is the best Airbnb experience I've had. Better than described accommodations. The place was so clean I was stunned and the smell of the fresh flowers was memorable to say the least.
You're going to love the place, Paulette, and the scenery.
-Dan"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Thank you Paulette for sharing your adorable cottage with Air bnb! Where one is steps away from sheep and cow pastures in which you are free to walk amongst. There are chickens, roosters and white turkeys roaming the gardens. The inside is quaint and very clean, it was just what I needed to rejuvenate! Only thing sweeter was they host herself. A true gem ⭐️"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow! What a place, lots of character features that you could explore for hours, and that’s before you get outside! Amazing location, super peaceful and with lots of friendly animals… really felt like you were out in the wilderness sat on the porch at night, and a great place to watch the sunrise from - thank you so much Paulette!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paulette's place is beautiful. It was so peaceful sitting on the porch drinking our coffee in the morning. watching the sheep, cows, horses, ducks, chickens and turkeys.
Paulette is such a delight. We enjoyed talking to her. She gave us some wonderful recommendations for shoppingand dining. We would definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette's little guest house/cabin was fun and unique! So peaceful and charming. The kitchen space is small and rustic, but we weren't preparing meals there, just coffee and snacks, so it was fine. We enjoyed the historic touches throughout the house, and sitting on the porch with coffee in the morning watching the animals, especially the barn kittens. The surrounding landscape is beautiful and we enjoyed getting a chance to talk with Paulette before we left. Since we were there for a weekend event in Zebulon/Concord, we didn't have much time to explore the expansive ranch -- we'll just have to come back!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I cannot stress at how awesome it was to stay here … the place is extremely clean , all the amenities you can ask for , and waking up to the roosters felt very homey… I highly recommend this place to anyone staying in the area . Host was very responsive"

2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Ms. Paulette was so sweet and welcoming. Her place was absolutely as described. We loved the farm setting, ALL the animals, and the cozy house. So many vintage/antique items to enjoy. Very nostalgic on many levels for us. Definitely want to visit again and highly recommend it. If you are in to modern day amenities then this is NOT for you but if you are looking for a quiet and simple break away then this IS for you."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was a very peaceful farm place to enjoy with a family.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Beautiful, quiet, private surroundings, with a great view of the sunrise from the front porch swing while enjoying a cup of coffee.
Everything was better than even the listing or photos showed. Plenty of amenities, and modern features in a roar c setting. It was like taking a step back in time, but with a/c and indoor plumbing.
Loved the turkey and the baby kittens.
We mostly enjoyed the peace and quiet and the laid-back atmosphere. It was wonderful!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Ms. Paulette's place was so much better than expected. Peaceful surroundings with nature and history. I love antiques and cabins, this was both. Ms. Paulette had water and coffee available, thank you! Well air-conditioned, clean sheets and towels. Disconnected from 'the world' in a positive sense."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"An “off the beaten path” place to stay when you want just to just be together as a family. The farm location was unique and made for some fun encounters with horses, sheep, turkeys, chickens, ducks, and kittens. The rustic cabin was homey, but had all the things you’d need."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I loved the place. It took me back to my grandparents place.

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"love the simplicity and rustic vibes, very relaxing"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Overall it was a good stay. As was mentioned in some other reviews, the house needs to be ""buttoned up"" a bit. There are gaps around the front door and a layer of dust on the nick-knacks throughout the cabin. That was what we expected, so it was not a big shock to find when we got there. We would stay there again if we were passing through."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paulette & her husband are amazing people, very accommodating! Put an AC in upstairs without hesitation- we will use in the future!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The atypical accommodation even better than in the photos! A small museum. This step has changed our scenery! We also enjoyed the terrace in the evening and in the early morning , quiet, with the animals and especially the turkey! Paulette is very welcoming. The accommodation is very well equipped, clean and good bedding for a perfect night! Recommended!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paulette was amazing- flexible and accommodating, I will definitely use her place in the future- see you again in a few days!"

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you are looking to get away without technology this is the place. The farm was so peaceful to wake up to in the morning. The shower/bath was enjoyable as well. I didn’t think it would be relaxing but it truly was a great overall experience! The turkey was super friendly. Thank you for opening your home!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paulette’s place was absolutely perfect! I can’t wait to go back. The turkey was super friendly and there were animals everywhere. I recommend waking up for sunrise, it’s the most peaceful i’ve been in a while. & the AC works amazingly 😇"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This stay exceeded our expectations! My kids and I had the best time here - it’s such a fun and unique property.

Thank you all for a such wonderful experience. We will be back!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the stay here! My friends and I had a great time walking around the farm. There is a nice downtown area for antique shopping! The turkey was delightful and Ms.Paulette was very sweet to me and my friends! I would stay here again!

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We were greeted by the guard turkey. Very memorable. Clean bedding, comfortable sleeping. Fresh towels. Powerful AC which was great for the July Georgi heat. It was like stepping back in time. We enjoyed the farm animals and all Miss Paulette’s collectibles."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the best experiences I have had staying in an air bnb. Paulette was welcoming and the place was charming. It really was such a cute place and the farm and surroundings were beautiful. When we plan our next trip, and we will, I hope her place is available because I want to stay again! It really was home away from home."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Thank you so much for sharing your little piece of heaven with our family!! It was so peaceful sitting on the porch and looking over the farm. The little cottage is beautifully decorated and just our style. We loved all the farm animals, but the family favorite was the turkey. The kids thought it was awesome that he followed us around and seemed to pose for all the pictures. 🙂 The only part we didn’t like was having to leave so quick! We hope to be back soon for a longer stay. Thanks again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nice, rustic cottage. And we got to meet the sheep and a turkey!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Paulette's Place is an oasis of tranquility.
The cabin sits on a beautiful ranch, where you can enjoy watching a diverse range of farm animals, including goats, cows, turkeys, and horses.
The cabin itself is clean, functional, and decorated with local antiques. It is rustic yet cozy, and conveys a sense of what life was like ""way back then.""
The surrounding areas are hilly, with dense forests and small, welcoming towns interspersed throughout.
I highly recommend Paulette's Place to anyone looking to connect with nature and discover the daily rhythms of life on a Georgia ranch."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,What a lovely place! My kids loved it from the fireflies to the sweet dog. Wish we could of stayed longer. Hopefully will be back!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I am so glad we decided to stay here. Even though our time was short, it made our trip more of an experience, as opposed to if we stayed in a hotel. We enjoyed a quiet morning on the porch watching all the animals (and yes the turkey is friendly). The listing is exactly as pictured. It was a treat!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Paulette's place was very nice and relaxing, she had a turkey that followed you around everywhere you went. You were free to walk around and look at the pond and watch the sheep. It was so nice to sit on the porch and just relax. The inside was very nice with a look at the past. The only thing that was a little harder was the stairs if you have any problems with your knees. But if you don't have any problems with your knees the place is great, we enjoyed it so much. If we are in that area again we would love to stop in again. just have to say, it is so peaceful and the animal noises were wonderful to hear."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Quaint little vintage cabin. Large stair steps, comfortable beds, and beautiful antiques line this getaway cabin. Tons of cows and sheep to see and pet and the owners of the ranch are VERY kind and friendly."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful time visiting on the farm. The best part was just sitting on the porch and watching all the animals do their thing. Paulette is a wonderful hostess!!! Everyone will love their stay here, it’s really great for kids."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Incredible! If you like nature this is the place for you! It was wonderful to get away from the city life and experience a ranch. Our three boys 2, 8 and 10 just loved it. Our favorite was the turkey...he followed us everywhere."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Lovely location and the unit was charming. Plenty of amenities and there is a Mexican restaurant a couple of miles away that was delicious.

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The guesthouse was everything we needed and more! We stayed at the Bunn Ranch last year in an airstream and loved it. So this year, we came back with our toddler and needed space for her. This place was just the right size for the 3 of us. Everything we needed during our stay was already there. The guesthouse is welcoming, comfortable, and clean. Their farm is amazing, and you can roam around it as you please. Paulette is such a great host, and she is always so friendly. she's made an effort to speak to us face to face both times we have visited and we really appreciate that! We can't wait until next year when we stay there again!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Just loved our stay at this unique place. Paulette and her husband were very kind and helpful.
The accommodation on two levels was intentionally rustic and at the same time very comfortable. I very much enjoyed my walk around the farm to see the various breeds of cattle in particular."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved our over night stay. It was so cozy and peaceful. Just what we needed after a busy weekend. Loved all the antiques and collectibles to look at. We'll definitely be staying here again.
Thanks Paulette."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home met our needs very well for the short time we needed to be there. The play area was perfect for our children. We felt they were safe in the yard on the playground and felt very comfortable with them around the animals. We enjoyed the private, peaceful surroundings away from other people. The house is decorated very interesting, very similar to my parents' house, so it was familiar to my children. Lighting in the bathroom was a little dim for getting ready to attend a wedding. The kitchen was a little crowded for when cooking as there is no counter. It would be helpful to have some space to sit other personal belongings or shelves or hooks to hang them on. We did make use of the cook top, toaster oven, and high chair. Hostess was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. Overall, we enjoyed our visit, definitely would recommend over a hotel and would book again when passing through the area."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was the absolute find of the year! My kids had a blast, the hosts were friendly as could be, and the setting was pristine. I will say they have a rather personable turkey to watch for, which made our stay even more entertaining. Overall a 15/10. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs Paulette."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a unique experience. We felt as though we had gone back in time and were staying next in the Ingalls' place (Little House on the Prairie). If you want a luxurious stay, this isn't it. It's rustic as the description says. However, the Guest House had everything we needed and it was something we will never forget. The turkey that followed us everywhere like a dog, the gorgeous farm, the tame little lambs, the sweet cattle dog. I would liken it to staying overnight in a museum or antique store. Very interesting! And Paulette was a wonderful host. Great information and very timely."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was such a unique and charming place. We loved waking up in the morning to look at the animals and hear the rooster crow. Can’t wait to go back.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a fabulous stay. What a fun place for our “city” kids to have a night on the farm and so close to so many different animals. We loved all the antiques and the bathroom sink with the pump!! We will definitely be returning to stay again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is absolutely adorable, and Ms. Paulette's hospitality is second to none! Nestled in a working multi-species farm, there are tons of things to do and see without even having to leave the yard. The dog is the sweetest thingever and we were greeted by her upon arrival. Lambs played in the backyard as the turkeys wandered in the front. The sunrise is true beauty at its finest and Ms. Paulette's granddaughters are an absolute delight! Close to a lot of smaller historic cities and surrounded by adventure, this is the type of stay you need to add to your bucket list."
2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"The ranch is huge and full of animals to delight the kids who had free range everywhere. My granddaughters loved the freedom to roam, which they did from morning to night. These city gals acted like regular farm kids...which was a joy to see.
There is only a very small microwave, and two portable electric burners, and only one frying pan and a small refrigerator. No freezer.
If you plan to cook, bring your own cooking pot, but I am sure Paulette would have provided one had I asked.
She is delightful."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It's a great place for a weekend. It was so much fun and the kids wanted to go again.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely beautiful. We were greeted by Mr.Bunn and he was just precious. My daughter and I met all of the animals. Hours were spent taking pictures here. The town of Barnesville was equally inviting. We spent nearly an entire day visiting the little shops and just taking in the scenery. Every place we visited we met awesome folks. We have decided this will be a regular trip.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We loved our stay! Paulette is so sweet and welcoming. Our kids loved going around to see the animals and playing games in the cabin.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,What a lovely cottage. Everything about the home and the setting is idyllic and peaceful. Waking up to the amazing view with a glorious sunrise and two adorable lambs to greet us was so great!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is exactly as described. It’s a house on a working, active farm. Decor was pleasant and homey. Vintage vibe. Complete with farm dog that loves to play fetch. Enough room to walk and can see farm animals if you choose. Serene and peaceful. Great claw tub bathroom. Would stay here again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Such a peaceful and beautiful spot! Wish we had more time to stay than just one night. Everything was easy to find-including the house. We only needed to stay a night but it appeared to have everything you could possibly need for a longer stay. Paulette was so great at communicating and check in and out was a breeze!
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very quaint cabin. I wish the weather had been better so that we would have been able to explore the grounds.
2023-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Paulette is a gem !

2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I will definitely be going back. So close to my sister's house. The Guest House is beyond anything I could have asked for. Paulette is so warm and inviting it really felt like she was the family I was visiting. The house is perfect for a family, for a couple, to a group of friends. Everything is neat and organized, I could go on and on about how wonderful Paulette and the Guest House are! I even extended my stay for an extra 2 nights."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My two daughters and I really enjoyed American country life with kind people and nice animals. My kids played with host’s lovely grandchildren. ( You guys were so sweet :) peaceful view, lovely cows, lambs and some unforgettable special experience…
We are foreigners but Paulette did her best for our communication.
At night we sat around the table. We don't have a religion, but we prayed to thank for having been here.
I want to visit again with my precious people here. See you soon :)"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is more than a place to stay, it is an experience! The cabin is a total step back in time. The farm is beautiful!

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Paulette’s house was so beautiful and welcoming. She was very responsive and kind. We look forward to staying again!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wow what a beautiful space, Paulette instantly told us to make ourselves at home and that was easy to do. The farm is beautiful and there were little baby lambs only a couple days old when we arrived!! It was a great getaway from the city & I will definitely be back 😌"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a getaway and this was on target. We felt transported to a simpler time and the pressure of life just melted away. We enjoyed listening to the mother sheep call their lambs and watching them in the pen. I don’t know which porch visitor was better, the old farm dog or Tom Turkey.
This isn’t a stay, it’s an experience. We can’t wait to go back."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location, sweetest woman ever!"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Paulette thank you and your husband for the wonderful stay in the cabin and for the ride over to feed the cows, my son Wyatt enjoyed it so much! Hope you all have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!! We will be back!!"

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was WONDERFUL! The guest house has such a lovely setting - close to town for grabbing a bite to eat - but feels so far away! We enjoyed seeing the stars above the sheep fields, watching the sunrise from the porch while listening to the rooster crow, and reading by candlelight (just for fun - there are plenty of lights) around the table. Our children loved living like Laura Ingalls Wilder for a night while we drove from Indiana to Florida. Thank you for sharing your special place with travelers!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an hidden gem. My son loves here so much. Will come back for sure.

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our 3rd time at Paulette's farm and we loved it as much as our first. Always clean, always quick to respond to questions, and always a great time watching the animals and playing fetch with her amazing dog. Can't wait to go back!"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We arrived at sunset and left before sunrise. We wished we could have stayed longer. Our experience was like visiting a time capsul/museum. We especially appreciated listening to the antique radio and looking through old SEARS catalogs. We would stay here again.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Adorable cabin. We stayed for 1 night but would definitely stay again. We were able to walk around the farm and mingle with the animals. Very peaceful setting.

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you love farms and antiques, you'll love this place! This was the most convenient place for us to stop on our trip overnight, but I didn't get to feel all the charm until the next morning. We didn't get in till after dark, and that made it a little more difficult to find, but it was very comfortable and very quiet. We weren't there long enough to eat or use anything other than the restroom, so I can't comment on any of that. Seeing all the animals the next morning on the working farm reminded me of my childhood. Paulette was so sweet and I loved chatting with her that morning. If I had the chance to do this alone without my two teenagers, it would have been amazing. Thank you Paulette!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,good place to spend time as a family.
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is amazing. Paulette is the most sweetest heavenly sent woman. The grounds are so peaceful and kept up so well. It’s so quiet and calm here. Plenty of beds to sleep in upstairs. We will definitely be back. A much needed romantic, restful getaway for two southern city folks. We haven’t gotten this much one on one time and solid sleep in months. We loved it here."

Unplug and take in the view of the farm, enjoy the animals and live a little history in the Farm House with INDOOR plumbing for city folks. Just get out in the country and enjoy life in a more simple form. Just sit on the porch and watch the Hummingbirds buzz you, the turkeys, chickens, and ducks swing by to say hi. No traffic, just country air, and farm sounds."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This house is a quaint getaway with country charm and true farm living. My girls loved all of the animals around the property and our sleep was wonderfully comfortable. We would stay again.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Try to get there well before sunset, we had difficulty finding the right driveway in the dark, bad, bad GPS, and as much fun as animal watching and walking around in the morning was, I am sure the evening would have been just beautiful.

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Bring walking shoes, games and your camera. This place is great. Something to see at every turn. The weather was too breezy for us to really walk around, but do walk and explore. One bedroom cabin. It is like a museum but better you are touching and living it. Have fun.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Do not miss out on experiencing heaven on earth at this farm stay. This was a surprise for Mom’s birthday after spending a very windy day on Peaches to Beaches, Brunswick to Barnesville. The guest house was so warm and inviting and feels like a big hug taking you back in time to simpler times. Mom & I opted for the 2 twin beds which were very comfortable. Outside is full of wonderful surprises and picture perfect moments around every corner. The farm animals are adorable and give a glimpse of a life we’ve always wondered about. They have the absolute best welcoming committee....2 of the most lovable dogs we’ve ever met. Endless games of fetch and hugs are guaranteed. Planning a return visit already."

We have been before and will book again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. It is delightful and even more pleasant than the pictures. The host is extremely thoughtful and we were greeted with an assortment of snacks and drinks which came in very handy since we arrived later in the evening.
The host is responsive and has everything you could need should you forget something.
The area was flawless and well laid out. A few things that stood out to us: the mattress heaters 10/10 and we will be ordering our own. Also the robes were delightful after taking a shower.
Another thing that was nice was there isn’t a list of 100 things to do prior to leaving."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding place to stay. Beautifully decorated, exceptionally well detailed and organized. Would not hesitate to stay again. Thank you."

Thank you Susan!"

If we ever return to the area we would stay at Susan’s place again without a doubt!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed previously and enjoyed it just as much. She has thought of EVERYTHING to make the stay lovely, peaceful and homey. Her place is 5 star for sure and spacous with a nice layout.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. The name Serenity Carriage House is aptly applied to this place.
With some places it is very clear the instant that you walk in that the host spent a lot of time thinking about setting up the space to make the guests comfortable. This was one of them. There were so many little touches in every room that it was obvious that she wanted to provide a top notch experience for the guests.
One such touch was the bath robes that were very nice to have when you got out of the shower since it was cold outside. But that was just one of many.
The place was spotless and very comfortable with every amenity a traveler would need. I honestly can't say enough nice things about it. There were some excellent food choices less than 10 minutes away in Zebulon.
If/when I come back to the area - I will definitely stay here again without considering anywhere else. Stay here - you will be happy you did."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, we enjoyed our stay. Very clean and peaceful, just what we needed. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Cottage was breathtaking and everything I could have ever expected and more. I love love loved the presentation of the cottage and look forward to staying here again when I come back to GA! Also, the Host and her family are so kind and very helpful!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"It was perfect and exactly what we needed during our 3 week stay in Georigia. She was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely be back. The decor is so nicely done. Bed is so comfy and loved that it was king size. The ice machine is a nice touch. I would also recommend the food at the Concord Cafe!!
Until next time Georgia!!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was very cozy. This is the most comfortable sleep I’ve ever gotten in an airbnb. Loved being welcomed with snacks and drinks as well! 10/10 recommend!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a neat place to stay. Everything was top shelf and comfortable. We highly recommend staying here.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cuter in real life than the photos. Everything was clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wow! Just as described. Serendipity is the perfect place to get away and enjoy a peaceful and relaxing stay. I loved watching the fireflies while sitting on the porch. The cottage has everything you need. Susan did not miss a single detail. The bed is amazing. The bathroom is very spacious and the shower is great. One of the cleanest places I have ever stayed if not the cleanest. Susan is an excellent host.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice, comfortable, with everything we needed. Susan was a responsive hostess when I had a few questions. The bed was amazing, big and cozy. The cottage was very clean and private. We will be back soon!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The cottage was quiet and just as pictured. I wanted to rest on Mother's Day and this was the perfect get away.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This HOUSE is so cute. She has thought of anything you would need from coffee and shampoo to reading lights on the bed. We loved this place. We will be back!!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We picked this place because we had a wedding at Wild Daisy Farms and it was about a 10 minute drive and so nice to be able to come back and rest after a long day!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Carriage House was absolutely perfect from the time you drive onto the property. Once you exit your car, you walk through a beautiful courtyard filled with the sound of peaceful music playing which sets the tone for your little private getaway. Then you enter the spotless fresh smelling Carriage House with comfortable furniture and the best King Size bed for the most restful night’s sleep plus all the extras including bathrobes and snacks to so much more! I highly recommend this AirBnb and it’s the top of our list of close to 40 airbnbs we’ve stayed in!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,love all the details that have gone into this cottage. Everything we needed was there. Bed was exceptional. Really enjoyed our stay.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Serendipity was such a delightful place. We were there to attend a wedding, and it gave us our own space to come and go as we chose. Everything was exactly as posted, an even more. Time on the patio with relaxing music was the peaceful we needed. The kitchen was fully supplied with everything you might need. Bathroom was huge, in fact, the entire place was larger than anticipated and delightfully decorated. No expense has been spared with the cottage. I would encourage anyone looking at this place, to go and see for yourself. We are glad we did. The only drawback, no eating place close that we found, it is several miles to a restaurant, so take snacks to get you by or stop at the Dollar General Store on the way in. EXCELLENT!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really loved this place! The photos were very accurate, it was super clean, tastefully decorated, had very comfortable bed & furniture. Good parking. Here are some small things that I really liked: Quiet spa music played while sitting on porch area. Lots of towels & toiletries available. Comfy robes provided. Snacks, drinks & coffee with cream & sugar provided. Plenty of mirrors so 2 people could shave, put on makeup, get dressed, etc., at the same time. 2 luggage holders. Subdued lighting in bedroom (I hate LED bulbs in nightstand lamps!), plus a reading light attached to each side of bed headboard so one person could read while the other slept. Plenty of power strips.
The hosts have REALLY done a great job & we would DEFINITELY stay here again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted a quiet secluded getaway for our anniversary that was close enough to Atlanta to leave our teenagers home alone, so we could get back in a couple of hours in an emergency. And this is exactly what we found at the carriage house! It was a wonderful week. Decor was cute. Bed was super comfortable. No carpet, no smoking, and no pets made it feel and smell really clean. We cooked our own breakfast at the house. My wife had just got her motorcycle and we wanted to ride at slow speeds with straight roads, we would ride out for lunch at local restaurants in several neighboring towns and then come back for a nap. The shower was perfect for relaxing after our rides. Warmer weather than the mountains and no crowds like the beach during spring break. After supper we would lay in bed and watch TV."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan was so nice, for my fiance and I. we got married that weekend and she was so nice letting the brides maids get dressed there. her bed and pillows were amazing"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the nicest place we have ever stayed at. Susan's cottage was gorgeous and so very comfortable, peaceful, and quiet - just what we needed. She offered more amenities that we've ever seen, including a complimentary bottle of wine, more than enough coffee pods for the Keurig coffee maker, House robes, and so much more. The bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept in. When we first lay on it, we both let out a sigh. It felt like heaven. And then there is the sitting area outside where we could enjoy our glass of wine. It was perfect in every way. We will stay there again."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s and Susan’s place is hands down, the best! Every single detail was perfection. We would book another stay here in a heartbeat!"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Quiet, nice area and Susan was a great host."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was one of my very favorite places we’ve stayed. It was perfect for a weekend getaway. It’s so unique and has so many special touches that make it peaceful and homey. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it.

The bamboo around the property is amazing.
We had a great stay, very relaxing and quiet"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Susan's place was superb! We were VERY comfortable. She has paid the best attention to all things: travel size soaps, shampoo, conditioner, tissues, plenty of towels. In the kitchen: the knives were sharp, enough cookware, utensils, plates, bowls, and glasses. It was stocked with all the hot beverage appliances for coffee and tea, and even a cool ice maker! She had a bottle of wine and SNACKS! She catered to all. She even had gluten free options AND Dark chocolate, thank you! The bedroom was spacious and bed comfortable. It was handy to have a washer and dryer, if needed.
I am VERY grateful that I was not ""hit with a curtain"" of Plug In odor! Those are often to smelly.
It was an amazing visit and I hope to be able to return!"
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Everything was perfect, very attentive host and there were no lack of details in the house, highly recommended"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The Serenity Carriage House is amazing! It has all the comforts of home and then some. We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again!!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I’ve stayed at multiple Airbnb locations and this was by far the best one I’ve ever stayed at. It was cute it was clean the location and offered every single thing that we needed. The host responds immediately and is very accommodating. Its perfect if you need to also work and it’s far superior to any hotel room that you could possibly rent. We will definitely be staying here again in the near future.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Susan’s place was truly a retreat! With the tranquil music, calming scents and bathrobes. The bed was a California king and extremely comfortable. The place was immaculate, cozy, and well equipped. We enjoyed the short drive to 1828 Coffee Co. Griffin was about a 20 minute drive but had plenty of restaurants. Susan was very nice and accommodating. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"this place was equipped with everything you needed. the airbnb is what you expect, it’s quiet, private and a perfect getaway. the only thing is that stores and such are s bit far."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay with Susan was absolutely wonderful! We were in the area to watch our kiddo in a team competition & we wish we'd had more downtime to spend at the house. So many thoughtful, extra touches made our stay beyond comfortable. Wine, bottled water, coffee & snacks all greeted us upon our arrival inside the house. Keyless entry made check-in easy and the place was a super clean, updated and well appointed. The communication with Susan was excellent & checkout was also a breeze. We look forward to returning again in the future. Truly an exceptional place to stay!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"10 STARS ⭐️
We had a family wedding @ Whiskey Bonding Barn which is 7-8 miles down the road from Susan’s Airbnb it was absolutely perfect! The location was ideal for our trip- but Susan’s space is SOOO thought out & covers any need you may have for a wknd getaway. We thoroughly enjoyed the coziness, cleanliness, all the thought out details that truly make you right @ home. I love how efficient the lay out is, her decor, the bada** shower, soft music that is playing as you walk into the front door, & we had a sweet little cat friend(we named her Harriet) who hung out with us out on the patio.
Totally recommend staying here & know you won’t be disappointed at all. Thank you Susan"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved staying here! Felt like a home away from home. All of the little things make it really homey (i.e. little shampoo/conditioner/body wash).

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Had a wonderful weekend stay here. Everything was so nice! Owner was wonderful. Check in and out was easy. I loved the added touch of music playing outside, the snacks and wine left for us. The house is decorated adorable! The location was not private as we thought it would be. Very close to the main house and several Rvs. Inside carriage house you didn't notice though."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My stay was great. The cottage had everything I needed. Will be staying again soon.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house was so cozy and quaint. Susan has really thought of everything.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space for our getaway. Spacious but cozy. We would definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was just as it appeared on the listing. Immaculately clean , very comfortable, and extremely well stocked. We were just looking for a last minute getaway and this was a fun find! The town is tiny, but that suited us fine. There is one restaurant but we did not try it. There are larger towns with more restaurants and shopping and other activities 10+ miles away. Concord is very flat so we were able to ride our bikes. We went to Greggs Farms and bought fresh peaches and ate their yummy peach ice cream. Susan was kind enough to send me something that I left there. Thanks for a great weekend!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Super easy check in/out, clean, inviting. You won’t regret booking here!"

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Lovely guesthouse with a large comfy bed, plush towels, lots of little extras. Very clean, very quiet. It is behind the owner’s home but we had total privacy even sitting on the rockers provided on the patio area in front of the cottage. Very nice stay and would definitely stay here again if we were in the area."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,it's a nice little get away. things to do are a little drive away but not far. you can't beat the price. it's extremely clean and new looking.

2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Susan was such an amazing host. She was so sweet and lovely. An amazing host that was super helpful throughout our stay. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect little spot for a break away from the world. Susan is incredibly sweet and you can tell that she put her heart into making this sweet little place a home away from home.
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is a must stay! Susan has thought of every little touch. We loved the bottle of wine, coffee, and snacks. My fiancé and I agreed this is one of the best and most thoughtful Airbnb’s we’ve ever booked. I only wish we could have stayed longer!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The cutest cottage! We stayed here for our wedding night and it is so precious to me that when you come in there is a bottle of wine and two glasses ready along with cold water bottles and cokes in the fridge, along with a basket of snacks. It is quiet and peaceful and we woke up so rested the next morning."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,This house is beyond clean. You could eat off of the floor! We enjoyed our stay so much.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I really appreciated the well thought out items placed, from q-tips to laundry bags to the hot chocolate. It was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. 10/10 stay"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay you will not be disappointed.
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a wonderful place. It looks exactly the pictures. Susan is very friendly and welcoming. All the sweet little extra touches were such a blessing. We will definitely be back!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My experience at Serendipity was everything I read and so much more. The description does not mention listening to the beautiful music of birds singing while enjoying morning coffee on the patio. Or the spa like shower experience that is so refreshing. More importantly the peacefulness and tranquility that surrounds you each time you enter the carriage house.
As others mentioned the space is extremely clean, well thought-out and many extras not normally available in an Airbnb.
I would highly recommend and hope to visit again."
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Our stay with Susan was great. The cottage is adorable and felt cozy! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to stay in the concord area:)
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect place for rest and relaxation. Serendipity was spotless and spacious. It had everything one could need for an enjoyable getaway. Lots of extras too! I’ll be back…
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cottage house was SO cute. Photos seriously don't do it justice. Plenty of space, super clean, so comfy. Susan even had little things out for us that I forgot. Qtips, toothpaste, etc. My little girl loved it and is already begging to go back."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I really can't say enough about this stay. It is exactly as it looks in the pictures, and the description is accurate. The whole cottage is very well appointed. Everything we could have needed was in the kitchen, including some nice extras like ziplock bags that we needed in a pinch. She provided all necessary toiletries, and again extras like q-tips, makeup wipes, and bathrobes. There is a VERY large closet type area at the back entrance where we had all the room we needed to put luggage and hanging clothes. There was a really thoughtful basket of snacks that we were very excited about. She provided hot chocolate, a TON of teas to choose from, and very nice coffee options if you are a coffee person. The king bed was so, so comfortable and the sheets are soft and smooth! There was plenty of space in the bedroom for my son's pack and play. Access to the bathroom is NOT through the bedroom, so you won't disturb anyone who wants to go to bed early! All of the doors are sliding barn doors, so they do not seal or lock. Just something to keep in mind in case that's important to you. It is a little bit of a drive to get to the surrounding attractions, so make sure you know how far you will be driving. I personally prefer a bit of a drive and a very nice place to stay over a convenient distance and substandard accomodations.The only other thing I want to note is that if there is a truck parked in the driveway in front of the camper, then there isn't a very wide clearance for luggage. Just make sure not to hit the truck! I am already trying to figure out when I might be able to come back and bring my husband, because he would LOVE this place! It really is a fantastic value!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great local to get away. Super quiet. Clean and renovated guest house. Perfect to re spark our romance. Thanks!
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This cozy cottage was actually better than described. The pictures did not do it justice. The attention to the smallest details was noticed.
She had a basket with a good variety of snacks that was just what we needed after a long day of travel. She even placed a couple bottles of water & a couple of cokes in the fridge for us. She had the cutest little bottles of shampoo & conditioner. The water pressure in the shower was great. The bed linens were so nice and soft . The mattress was extremely comfortable and we slept so well. The coffee station was on point. I would definitely stay at this cottage again."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Excellent stay and very unique in a good way!
,,,"Great serene cabin in woods, peaceful, quiet and lovely view of lake..cows grazing nearby & a perfect get away to unplug from this fast pace world! The hosts were accomodating and kind and their friendly dogs were delightful.. I am ready to go back!"
