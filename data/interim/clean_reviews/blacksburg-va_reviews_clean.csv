2024-06-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Great house and location. We were really looking forward to sleeping in and waking up to a nice peaceful morning but unfortunately the lawn maintenance people showed up around 7am and didn’t leave until about 10am. Not Amanda’s fault but we would have enjoyed a heads up because we likely would have stayed elsewhere so we could get some sleep.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"What a wonderful stay. Multiple bedroom with multiple bathrooms were perfect for a group of 5. The property is very private and has beautiful scenic views. Due to some issues during our trip (not involving the airbnb) the general consensus in the group was “if it wasn’t for the airbnb, this trip would’ve been a lot worse”. Plans are already being made to return to VA and have no plans to look at any other houses to stay at."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,A nice place to stay
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Amanda was a great host! Very responsive and helpful. Great location and spacious. I would respectfully recommend a deep clean as there was so much dust my family had a hard time with allergies. Dust on ceiling, light fixtures, ceiling fans, cobwebs everywhere, air return had a layer of dust. There is a wood burning stove so I can give it a pass somewhat due to that however maybe have housekeeping staff pay closer attention to detail. One of the showers was leaking and unable to use so that was a bit inconvenient as well."

I wish we could have stayed longer and definitely plan to book another stay at this beautiful home."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"The house was exactly as pictured. It was close enough to Blacksburg, and although we were out and about quite a bit, we felt right at home! I only wish that we got to spend more time there and to explore the yard/porch a bit more. Everything was great!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay at Amanda's cottage. The place was clean, and had all the amenities that was in description of the place. The only downside was that it was little away from VT campus and took us around 20 minutes to reach the dorm or the central Blacksburgh."

2024-01-01,3,Group trip,"We booked this for a one-day stay for a funeral that we were attending. Amanda was fast at responding and getting us booked. Most Airbnbs won't let people stay for one night, so it was a blessing that she did allow this. The reason I gave this 3 stars was because of the unexpected fees and charges. The writeup on the website boasts a wood-burning fireplace and hot tub. However, there are EXTRA charges to use these amenities that aren't talked about until you arrive. After booking, I was asked how many guests and the arrival time. Our guest count went up by 3 due to more people attending the funeral. I updated Amanda on the 3 new guests. She stated she charges per guest and increased our cost $30 per guest.... Another SURPRISE charge. The house overall was good for our group of 7 adults. Hot showers and enough tableware. I asked for a later checkout, and Amanda did allow us to stay for an extra hour. I was thankful."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at Amanda’s. The house and property are beautiful. It was very peaceful and we enjoyed the views of the woods through all the picture windows.

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Fantastic value and beautiful setting. Amanda's house is situated on a beautiful part of the New River Valley just outside of Blacksburg and minutes away from the New River.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had such a wonderful stay at Amanda’s, we look forward to staying again soon — beautiful, beautiful home!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were looking for a quiet place with good trails nearby, and Amanda's place was perfect. I think it's excellent value for the price, as the house is large and comfortable. The only downside was that there was no flexibility with the checkout time, so we had to travel with my son feeling sick. Overall though, it was a great stay, and I recommend this home."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I will definitely seek this place out again. Nice yard for my dog to play fetch and as a tree lover I saw so many beautiful trees on the property. It's a nice healthy woodland, mostly all native plants :)
House was very well kept and such nice pillows. Last air bnb I stayed had just one flat pillow per bed, haha! It was just me and my dog but you could comfortably fit like 8-10 people there!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Quiet, peaceful stay. Everything you need for a place to stop over for a few days. Loved the deer that walk the yard every morning."

Deer visited me every morning while drinking my coffee on the deck.
Everything I needed was right here."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Amanda’s place! It’s in a beautiful, quiet, area and we loved seeing the deer at night. The house was clean, spacious, and comfortable. It was far enough away from campus to escape the move in chaos but still only a short drive away! It was ideal for 2 couples moving their Hokie into their apartments. We are hoping to stay here again in the future!
Thanks Amanda!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy location for visiting Virginia Tech! Plenty of space and comfortable beds. Our stay was so short we didn’t get much time to enjoy the house but it would be a great place for a large family or larger group.

Only a one night stop so we could not take advantage of the outside areas."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This says it is a cabin, but really it is a full-sized house in a quiet, safe, spacious neighborhood with large lots. The bedrooms are upstairs, as are two of the bathrooms. One half bath is downstairs. Parking is easy and safe on the driveway right in front. The kitchen is a full kitchen. There are a washer and dryer. The beds were comfortable. There is a formal dining room and living room. Getting in was easy with a door code. We slept well and would stay again."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location is peaceful, in the middle of woods, house is spacious with all the necessary amenities. We liked the glass windows on the ceiling of the master bedroom. Amanda and Joshua are kind and went above and beyond to help us out."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home in a beautiful place!
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,We had a nice stay! Very nice home. A little confusion on the use of the hot tub. Did feel a little awkward as the hot tub is very close to the guest cottage.

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Excellent!
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Good place in a beautiful woods. Amanda has very detail instruction on the check in and out. We arrived in the mid of the night so it is easy to miss the entrance. But everything looks good in the house and beautiful view. Would recommend this house.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"My family stayed at Amanda’s home the night before my daughter’s exhausting college orientation. The home had great amenities and felt super cozy and cottage like. The hot tub and fire pit were so relaxing, and my 24-year-old daughter loved the swing! She hasn’t been on a swing in over a decade! The beds were comfy and clean. Amanda was very responsive and courteous. I wish we had stayed a second night. Loved the seclusion and family time! We will definitely stay at Amanda’s place when we visit our daughter in college next year!"
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The house was exactly what we were looking for. Quiet, out of the way, well kept and overall well equipped.
Amanda responded to our concerns immediately over our confusion in the listing over the hot tub being shared between 2 homes on the property, but with renters for the other home leaving as we arrived, it wasn't an issue.
Surrounded by nature, every day we spotted deer out in the yard, including a fawn with Mom and Dad.
Also having a GPS made the house easy to find, since it was rather remote.
Overall it was a pleasant stay, to wind down after exploring the area."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Thank you for a wonderful stay for our team retreat!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice cottage in the woods. Felt very private.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place with lots of room for a large group. Private and secluded.
Get your groceries before you leave town. It’s a bit far, but worth it!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place.

2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful and quiet, it was a perfect place for family to celebrate a graduation."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Enjoyed every moment of my stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"I don’t know how this isn’t listed for $1,000/night. I kid you not. The only reason I can think of is that there are so many cheap and modest alternatives.
I was traveling with my son and, sadly, we only had about 12 hours to enjoy this stately home. Such an amazing place."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great house for a large family!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house and location are beautiful; don’t think twice about staying. The location was great if you’re looking to be out of the “hustle and bustle” of town. Plenty of space for all of us, loved that the dinning room had seating for 8. The grill was a bonus."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying at Amanda’s! It was peaceful and private, the perfect place to get some rest on our journey."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place exceeded our expectations! It was a spacious cottage that felt very homey and comfortable. My husband and I visited on a midweek getaway without kids but we want to come back with the whole family. This house would suit us well! It was easy to check in and communicate with the host and the outdoor setting was even better than we were expecting. We really enjoyed the area around Blacksburg and Radford as well-we checked out Claytor Lake on bike and hiked Cascade Falls-both highly recommended. We hope to be back!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great stay here! Quiet peaceful location and the house was clean. Amanda was super responsive whenever we had questions too.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was very comfortable and well furnished. We had a great time. Recommended!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amanda’s place was quiet and peaceful. Has everything you need! Would definitely go back!
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay for a weekend. Not ideal for road tripping though since we weren't able to use a lot of amenities provided like the fire pit, the pool,... So much to do in the outdoor area. Could stargaze at night."
2023-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place tucked into a grove of pine trees. Very quiet, peaceful, comfortable. It was well worth the value of the price we paid, which ended up being about the price of a local hotel room but we had the whole house!
We only used two of the 4 bedrooms so can vouch for 2 beds being comfortable. Bedroom decor a bit sparse, for things like a chair or place to hang clothes but nice sizes. Kitchen good, could use a couple other pots if you are people who cook like we are. But very generous with a full spice cabinet & condiments in the fridge that are so useful . Plenty of plates, glasses, mugs, silver ware basic kitchen utensils. Be patient with the burners if you are not used to electric so you do not burn food on to the pans. We enjoyed the outdoor fire pit. I had brought wood, especially kindling which I only use some of as there were enough logs and fallen twigs to make a very nice fire already there. Couches in the TV room comfortable, Living room comfortable. Enjoy your stay."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay for our girls trip. The fire pit and hot tub were a big hit!

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,We really enjoyed our stay and was a neat place to stay while visiting Virginia Tech. We loved the space and stuff to do outdoors.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely time staying at Amanda's beautiful home! It was a perfect spot for a relaxing get away, and the kitchen was fantastic to cook in!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amanda's place was beautiful and relaxing. The house was excellent and had a great view. Amanda was very friendly, quick to respond, answered all my questions, and checked in to see how we were doing, which we really appreciated.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful and refreshing. Not far from many towns with tons to do. Every thing was neat, clean and well organized. Looking forward to staying here again in the future!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"It was a nice space, very neat, and great amenities! Also, a great host. It does have a guest house right next to it, so be conscious of that, since it might not give you the full seclusion you might desire. But overall, great!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"amazing place, strongly recommended. very cozy and comfortable."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful and relaxing stay!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very nice place, peaceful, within minutes of Blacksburg. Easy check in with clear instructions. Great price for what it is worth."
2023-01-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was a beautiful old English cottage with lots of rooms and space to gather. It had a great master bedroom suite with skylights. The grounds are nice and private and the kitchen was well stocked. We were staying there during the winter and only for one night, so didn't use the hot tub or fire pit, but they looked really nice. This airbnb shares the fire pit and hot tub with another airbnb on the property right next to the house, so this may not be the space for a private getaway, but there is enough room in the house to have your privacy. My partner and I both felt like it would be a great space to rent along with the neighboring airbnb, so you could have access to all the amenities and privacy. I'd definitely recommend it for a weekend away or a week enjoying some hikes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. This is a newer airbnb, so there were some kinks to work out, but Amanda was very responsive and appreciative of the feedback."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,We felt right at home and enjoyed enjoyed preparing a meal in the kitchen.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very peaceful surroundings and a very comfortable and spacious home.Although our stay was during the coldest temperatures (probably) of this winter, the house stayed comfortably warm within use of the wood stove .
Great views."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We really appreciated getting in early since we had a family member who needed a place for a bit to warm up. We also liked that she had a book of instructions, we find that less and less at Airbnb's, forcing us to weed through our emails for check out instructions."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Amanda was amazing to let me check in a little early. Everything was great and clean. It was a great space!
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Great overall stay in a nice rural setting Excellent communication with host
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great home, comfortable beds, great communication prior to arrival. We stayed after a Virginia Tech football game and appreciated the amenities of a complete home rather than a hotel. Will look for this property in the future."

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Great property. It was perfect as advertised!

2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Amanda has a beautiful and quiet home. She was very accommodating and I would recommend her home to anyone looking for a truly serene and relaxing getaway.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I definitely recommend this home and host! The location and space was perfect for us. We chose this location specifically because we had some places we wanted to go that weren’t far from it (ie: Virginia Safari Park), however we really enjoyed just hanging out at the house! We only stayed two nights and wished we booked it for longer! The back deck is spacious, there’s plenty of room in the yard for kids to run around and play (open grass + a trampoline!). The rooms were a great size and beds were all so comfy. There are two separate living room type areas which was so nice. One had a tv and plenty of seating for us to hang out together. The other room was nice for just enjoying some quiet time. We used the grill one night to make dinner, which was so convenient. Amanda was so responsive and made some great dining suggestions for us! Just know that this place is a little off the beaten path, so don’t be discouraged when you find everything is about 20 minutes away. It’s a beautiful, quick/easy drive out to the busier part of town where all the stores and restaurants are. Our favorite spot was “Our Daily Bread”, where we all had a delicious breakfast and great coffee! I’m going to keep this place saved so we can hopefully stay again sometime!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great home in great location.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,House was clean and comfortable as advertised and expected. Would enjoy returning in the future.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Such an amazing place to stay! Very relaxing
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amanda was great. She was very accommodating when our original place didn’t work out. She managed to get the place ready on hours notice and was extremely sweet in communicating when the house was ready. Her place was clean and had everything you could need. We loved coming home or waking up to the family of deer in the yard. We will be back for sure!
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"We loved everything about the space. It’s beautiful, really clean, great WiFi, Amanda was really easy to communicate with and we can’t wait to go back!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Amanda provided a wonderful stay in a quiet wooded space that provided easy travel to several close by spots during our visit. The spacious kitchen and back deck gave us a ample room to enjoy meals and time hanging out with old friends. A great option when visiting the Blacksburg area!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place! Amanda was an amazing host, and her place is beautiful!!"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,We have stayed at many AirBnB locations and this one of our favorites yet!
2021-06-01,4,Group trip,"Great secluded place to get away from the city. House is very spacious for 6 guests. Kitchen was well stocked. Place has a great outdoor sitting area which is a great place to have morning tea. Bedrooms are big and spacious. In the evening you can see the fireflies glowing which was beautiful. 20 minutes drive will take you the Virginia tech campus are which has some great places to eat.
There is no cell reception for T mobile and wifi is unreliable (connects and disconnects). Not a place you can work or connect to VPN. Also you have to take out the trash with you to about a mile and a half from the property which is a little inconvenient."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect house for our large group! A paradise for all the kids with the beautiful yard, deck, and trampoline. Plenty of space and room to roam and had lots to do in the area. Amanda was a gracious host and we all enjoyed our time."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amanda's place was excellent! Rhanks again for the great hospitality! 😁

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,There is a lot of room inside and out. It has everything you need for a stay. The keurig and coffee pods are a nice touch. It really is less than 15 minutes to Virginia Tech and near good hiking and outdoor activity!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice location and setting. Spacious house for large family including children. Prompt replies to questions, accommodating and great place. Our second stay and always meets expectations. Would highly recommend."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great location, fully equipped and comfortable home. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2020-01-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful views, beautiful house and a great setup. Me and seven of my friends take a New Year’s vacation every year.
We chose Amanda’s house because of the beautiful house and the seclusion of the surrounding area. We enjoyed the massive dining room table (great for board games!) and the incredibly comfortable beds. Amanda was great about responding to messages, and I never had to wait more than five minutes to get an answer to my question.
The pictures for this house don’t do it justice- it’s truly a beautiful home."
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,"Thank you, Amanda! My family had a great time in Blacksburg celebrating my brothers graduation. We found our Airbnb to be just what we needed; super close to campus and extremely comfortable for our family. Amanda was an absolutely wonderful host - responsive and communicative.

Great deck for relaxing, large private location, close to New River, and overall a very good place to stay. Amanda was very informative and helpful when we needed some vehicle work done.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Anna was very responsive! It is a great place to stay!
2024-04-01,2,Stayed one night,"It is hard for me to give our stay a low review because most everything went great and was all that we expected. As Anna states in the description, we were sharing walls with other guests. I was in my room with my teenager daughter. We went to sleep around 10 pm ironically when quiet hours were to start. Around 10:45 we were both awoken by morning and groaning of a woman and her partner in one of the other rooms. This went on for about an hour. I had to explain to my daughter what was going on. I know Anna can’t control this but it would definitely deter me for booking this place again.
In addition we could not find extra pillows and there did not seem to be enough power to work my hairdryer. It would come on for a second and quickly turn off."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I've stayed here multiple times, and it's always a pleasure!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We enjoyed our stay in the countryside. Thank you very much.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was pleasantly surprised to pull into a place my wife and I had stayed before! We had great memories there.
Unit 3 was exactly as described and what I needed. Unit 4 has a view to the stream and woodland, and I have to say I do prefer that one.
Anna's place has a very private feel and is quite relaxing. There is no TV, but that is actually a welcome and rest inspiring relief.
Hope to stay again, as it was very near the training I was giving."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I always love staying at Anna's place! It's so homey and nice. Plus, it's incredibly quiet and peaceful."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"I felt safe. I slept very well. I could hear the people next door, but they were quiet during quiet hours. Which I greatly appreciated. Thank you again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It is very clean and beautiful place. I wish I had more days to stay!
2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We were very surprised at how comfortable and accommodating this small space was. We really enjoyed the view out the window of the horses across the street and loved walking by the stream in the back hearing so many different species of birds, including three different woodpeckers! The only real issue was that we were able to hear the people in the rooms that were next to us. We were prepared for that since it had been mentioned in other reviews. All in all, I thought the room was a great value and would definitely consider staying there again if we were in the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little spot, and can’t beat it for the value. Everything you could need-clean , comfortable, amenities provided. 10/10. Anna was super responsive and helpful as well :) I would definitely come back"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Excellent stay
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was my second time staying at Anna’s and it didn’t disappoint. whenever I’m in the area I make sure to book here if it’s available. not too far from Radford/Roanoke area, but far enough away where you can get some peace and quiet. Very well kept. Spotlessly clean. Beautiful surroundings. No complaints. The bed is so comfortable!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Anna is an excellent host.
She is always available.
Cute place, in the hills of Blacksburg."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,Anna’s place was a great decision for me to spend my free time staying at! The listing had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really liked this place!! It was super cute and provided me with anything I could've needed during my stay. Check-in and check-out was the easiest I have ever experienced and I loved how organized everything was! This isn't a complaint about Airbnb, as it's not anything they did, but I would recommend bringing earplugs. Not everyone follows the quiet hour rules and the walls are very thin. Besides that, I really really loved this place. I definitely would like to come back again!!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved all the flowers that were just starting to wake up from their winter’s nap and of course the creek.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay close to Blacksburg but still secluded and peaceful. A great place to stay to be in between a bunch of good hikes. Clean room with good amenities. Would recommend!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely stay, highly recommend"
2024-01-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay mostly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the ongoing noise from barking dogs on the high hill in front of the house. I realize this is not Anna's fault, but it really took away from the peacefulness of the place. Otherwise, I had everything I needed to be comfortable. P.S. There is no TV in the room.
I think a small one would have been nice."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Had a great stay! The place was clean and comfortable!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have stayed at Anna's place before in one of the other smaller rooms. This corner room was slightly bigger. Anna communicated well with us and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. Fresh towels, soft linens, and few other things made our stay cozy. The area is quiet and a little remote but Anna's AirBnB makes it worth driving out away from the city to stay. 15-20 minutes drive to the heart of Blacksburg. She has several listings at the same location. One of those is a cute cabin with a canopy bed. We plan to reserve that one the next time we visit the area."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Anna was friendly and proactive with instructions. Comfortable bed and quiet.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I really enjoyed staying at this Airbnb!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This room was perfect! I especially loved the tiny kitchen space.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was my second time staying in one of Anna’s rooms. The Corner Room was very clean and had lots of extra amenities like shampoo, conditioner, lotion, creamer, and even coffee! I also appreciated the bottled water waiting in the fridge! The walls are very thin, so it’s not suitable for noisier groups, but I had no issues with this during my stay. The area is so beautiful and peaceful."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I found myself having to have an extended stay and am so grateful for this adorable room!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,We stay here on our way to TN almost every time. It's alway clean and quiet. Highly recommended!

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great, peaceful and worth every penny. The necessary amenities are there, instant booking was clutch. The place is cozy for solo traveler or couple"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place to stay. Quiet and secluded, great place to take a break from the city. I do recommend getting there during the day because it’s absolutely gorgeous but the roads getting there are a bit windy and can be hard to navigate at night. 10/10 would stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay! Private and cozy. Really good communication and lovely stay overall! The property was so cute and we even saw horses across the street which was a fun treat coming from the city.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Anna and Billy were great hosts! The instructions for check-in and parking were very clear. The house is located in a nice, private neighborhood. They quickly responded to any questions or concerns we had. Overall, a great, clean, and quiet place to stay!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful surroundings and excellent host
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Anna was super responsive to our queries and needs. The place was private close to nature (yet not too far from campus) and which was exactly what we needed. Coming from the city, it was refreshing to be able to see all kinds of wildlife daily. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Felt very homey and was a great overnight stop for the price
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Anna's place was clean, cozy, very cute and peaceful. I would absolutely stay there again! I came in late, after dark, and although it was in the country, and roads were a bit windy, it was not difficult to find with GPS. It had a great little set up, with nice amenities and was equipped with just about whatever you could need. The bed was very comfortable and for a small space, it seemed very spacious! I only wish I could have stayed longer to take a look around the property, in the daytime, as it seemed nicely landscaped with lots of pretty flowers, and it mentioned a creek. I definitely recommend Anna's place if you are in the area. Thank you Anna... and Billy for the stay in your lovely little AirBnB. You both were very kind, helpful, and accommodating with my communication needs. I really enjoyed my stay, even though it was short. I will hopefully be back again in my travels."

2023-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a good place to stay for one night but i wouldnt suggest it for more than a night. no tv or anything but good place to crash for a quick stay.
We got in kind of late so it was fine for us especially for the price. Walls are thin if you are picky about privacy keep in mind theres people right next to you and you can hear everything going on. Unfortunatley the people next to us were really loud all night. It was just one night so i didnt care but some people might have been upset and wanted more privacy. I REALLY suggest to buy bath mats for the shower and bathroom its very slippery. Someone might fall."

I can't say enough great things about the place. Love it!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Great place to spend a night to regroup on a road trip. When we arrived spring peepers (frogs) were calling down by the river, which was wonderful. Good directions and super easy check in. The bathtub was large enough for a nice soak and lovely to find Epsom salts in the cupboard to add to the bath. The bed was comfy with nice linens and pillows. Kitchen was very small but well equipped. Only 3 things could have been better: a less noisy bathroom fan; a way to block the artificial security lights to promote peaceful sleep; and windows that opened (to hear those serenading frogs!). Overall, great place in a nice location for a decent price."

Overall, definitely a good place to relax and chill!."

The house itself was spacious, immaculately clean, and tastefully decorated. Its proximity to Virginia Tech, just a 10-minute drive away, made it incredibly convenient for us.
Amanda was an exceptional host, always friendly and proactive in providing restaurant recommendations. She even graciously accommodated a slightly later checkout for us. Without a doubt, I'll be booking this Airbnb again on my next visit to the area. Highly recommended!"

It’s a well maintained property with all you might need for a comfortable stay. We were a group of 9 and there was ample space for gathering around and sleeping. If we had any questions Amanda responded right away and that really helped. We’re also grateful to Amanda for letting us check in earlier. Overall a very positive experience. Thank you Amanda."

Everything was as advertised and there was even a room set up for kids! The extra mile was her providing brand new playpen sheets - we travel a lot and that had never happened before! We ended up brining out own but just knowing she cared enough to do that was amazing. Very close to VaTech campus - we will be returning again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amanda’s place is amazing! You walk in and it looks just like the photos but better. Everything is pristine and beautiful.
The dual heat pumps definitely make a difference in this 3 level townhouse so you can make the bedrooms be a different temp than the rest of the house. Definitely came in handy.
The kitchen is well laid out and had everything I needed to cook each morning and evening.
Would definitely stay here again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed staying at Amanda's place. She gave very clear and helpful directions and she checked in to be sure we had everything we needed. The house was spacious and accommodated 2 families quite easily (4 adults, 1 kid, 2 babies). We appreciated books and games being available for use. The house was a short drive to VT campus. We visited for the run and spring game, and we're able to go back and forth very easily. We would definitely stay here again."

We would definitely recommend and stay here again

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The townhouse is brand new and beautifully furnished. We were there on a weekday, so there was a bit of construction noise, but not too bad. Very easy 8 minute drive to campus. It has everything you'd need! We will be back I'm sure! Amanda gave us very easy to follow instructions to get in. And it was so great to have a garage because it was really rainy when we visited!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a beautiful brand new property. Amanda has furnished it beautifully without over cluttering it. Be aware that there is a great deal of new home construction in the neighborhood. We are early risers so it didn’t bother us. Property is very close to Blacksburg and Virginia Tech.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location is an up and coming awesome neighborhood. It's pretty awesome now... and it's fair to say that the neighborhood is still under construction. There are units being lived in and some still receiving work. That said, the location is already incredible! Beautiful views. Quiet. And luxury townhouses complete with a club house and pool!!
The townhouse is really wonderful and the beds are comfy. Everything is totally brand new!
GPS doesn't recognize the exact address but Amanda gives perfect directions and I'm sure this will be updated soon.
Amanda thought of everything to make my stay perfect... just wanted to stay longer and would certainly return with a larger group than just myself next visit.
Highly recommend"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"All the stars are owed to this location and host. Like other reviewers, in town for a swim meet, and the house was immaculate, the host was fabulous and communicative. Two minor issues were immediately addressed and did not have a negative/detrimental impact on our stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Chris was an excellent host! He was extremely helpful and responsive as we navigated traveling with our service animal and special needs children. The house itself was exactly what we were looking for, and exactly how it was advertised. We felt safe, it was clean, and we had a very comfortable stay. The next time we’re in the area for visiting extended family we will definitely look to rent here again."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My family was in the Blacksburg/Christiansburg area for a weekend long swim meet held at the Christiansburg Aquatic Center. The house was an easy 15 minute drive to the pool. The house is also very close to VT campus which is nice. The house was probably the cleanest rental I have ever stayed in. Chris was an amazing host and even let my family have a late check out at 2 pm when my daughter made finals on Sunday afternoon. My family and I definitely plan to book this house again next year when we are back in the area for swim meets. I highly recommend this house for families who are visiting VT and the surrounding areas.

The house was spotless and well-decorated, the beds were comfortable, and the surroundings were beautiful. We really appreciated the house having both a pack-and-play crib and foldable high chair for our little guy, and are happy to report that they were both very clean and in perfectly safe condition.
The area is a great combination of close to downtown Blacksburg (10 minutes tops) for restaurants, shopping, and Virginia Tech events while being in a quiet and relaxing area where you don't have to worry about college kids partying until the wee hours of the night. We will certainly look to stay here the next time we visit Blacksburg. Thanks so much, Chris!"

Aaron reached out several times to ensure we got settled in and to make sure we knew where to find information. He was fantastic to work with.
The only thing I would caution on is the extra fees that are added to the per night cost. While the per night base cost is certainly worth it, there is an added cleaning fee, AirBNB fee and taxes that substantially increase the overall cost.
Otherwise, the home is beautiful and spacious and was the home away from home we needed! Go Hokies."

2022-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"One of my very best Airbnb experiences an as an active “guest” since 2013 with 33 Airbnb stays. A great home with so many thoughtful touches! Wireless and wired charging for Apple and Android devices is provided. Apple TV connections in multiple rooms and keyless entry are great, a beautiful TV and sound system (ok geek speaking here). Tasteful decorations, a most comfortable couch and dining table for many, and outdoor seating on a secluded deck are provided. Super comfortable beds, a full kitchen with all the essentials from a multi-function coffee maker to many coffee mugs and wine glasses and plenty of dishes and silverware to cook (or re-heat your takeout). A washer, dryer and dishwasher to boot for “busy guests”.
The location in Blacksburg is most convenient, with a bus stop right out front and walking distance to all city and university locations that matter. Plenty of free onsite and street parking.
Add to that a most responsive host to any inquiries and you have a perfect stay with a true “Superhost” in every sense of the word, thank you Aaron!"

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at Aaron’s place for several days while visiting our daughter at VT. The home was nicely decorated yet comfortable enough for us to relax. I was especially pleased with the well-stocked kitchen and was able to make my daughter a nice home-cooked meal when she dropped by. The home was close enough for us to walk to an evening basketball game yet far enough away that we didn’t feel like we were in the midst of the college scene. We would absolutely stay here again.
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Aaron’s house is clean and neat and just as described. It’s close enough to downtown that you can walk to Cabo Fish Taco and all of the other fun restaurants. Aaron is super responsive to messages and when we were locked out, he let us in quickly. Highly recommend!"

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, super clean, quest neighboorhood!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Aaron’s communication is superb. Before and right after booking, we were able to communicate about specific needs of my group event. Our family was having a reunion in Blacksburg and needed a wheelchair accessible property for the first floor, and this property fit the bill! The zero entry front door and wide walkways made it easy. At the last minute, my child became sick and we couldn’t attend. Since the cancellation policy was nonrefundable at that point, Aaron permitted other family members of mine (who I trust!!) to stay there. They got into town early and we were able to communicate quickly with Aaron, who verified that the cleaning crew had just left and let them check in early. My family members reported that the house was very clean, spacious, and a great location (~20 mins walking to downtown, 5 minutes away by car to the VT bookstore, etc). They said they really enjoyed the home gym and were glad he provided so many towels! The only caution is that the staircase doesn’t have any blockings between the treads (gives it a half-floating look with an attached railing on one or both sides) so it might not be the safest for small children or elderly adults, but nothing that the use of caution couldn’t fix!"
2021-06-01,4,Stayed one night,"Greta location, and very nice place! 10-15 minute walk to downtown blacksburg. Host is very communicative."

The space is modern, while still maintaining a homey feel. We have really appreciated having a full kitchen, all the bathroom essentials, and a washer/dryer available. Aaron's hospitality is easily among the best we have encountered while staying in Airbnbs. Not only did he agree to host us this time at the very last minute, but he even made changes to his schedule to accommodate us. His cleaner was equally hospitable, preparing the place for us in record time. We cannot thank Aaron enough for his kindness, and we highly recommend his place to anyone visiting the area!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for our family if 4 to stay while road tripping!
It was clean, communication was very good, and we felt safe."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Although my family only stayed one night (traveling in to town for a wedding), the home was clean and welcoming. We appreciated the security and ease of use that the electronic key pad provided and that the home was spacious enough for five people and our dog. We had to request an earlier check-in (3:30pm instead of 5pm) last minute so that we could change prior to the wedding at the house and the host accommodated our request."

And a most delightful little outdoor seating area that overlooks a wooded area and a lush garden with water running and plants growing out of statues and strings of night-time lights. There was a cute little vase of fresh flowers in the room from the garden. FRESH FLOWERS!!! It felt so airy and lovely. Plus clean. New furnishings and linens. And a kettle for tea as well as a coffeemaker."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We needed a last minute place to stay and were looking for a place that would be a quiet and comfortable stop between two long travel days. Bryan and Heather's spot covered all of that and more. It was the cleanest place we've ever stayed and had beautiful furnishings and decor. Everything was as listed for amenities. The neighborhood was quiet and walkable. There are many restaurants nearby. We've discovered that Blacksburg is a perfect halfway point between Pennsylvania and South Carolina and I would book the bright and sunny in-law suite with Bryan and Heather again without hesitation. We highly recommend it.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Bryan and Heather have created a sweet little oasis for an overnight stay in Blacksburg. The bed was comfortable and the place was spotlessly clean.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"All aces Airbnb experience here, from the ease of check-in and communication to the delightful accommodations and the just-right location -- close enough for easy access to VT campus but just far enough away to sleep soundly without the downtown bustle. Bonus: Our hosts were flexible when our graduation weekend schedule necessitated a slightly earlier arrival. Can't recommend enough."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Quaint little place to stay for a couple if you’re in the Blacksburg area. Place was spotless, check in and check out simple. Host was a great communicator. Appearance of the place is exactly as advertised. Close to VT campus."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The description of this rental is perfect, inside and out! Not only is the apartment clean, spacious, and comfortable, the adjoining backyard is beautiful! The skylights allowed plenty of sunlight (beware if you wake to light as you will be seeing the sunlight at first light). It was a perfect alarm for us. The hosts were generous with their amenities as coffee, tea, and water was provided as well as use of dishes and utensils.
The only concerns I would mention is that is is an upstairs unit and the shower is very tight, so if you have mobility issues or are very tall this unit might pose challenges.
I highly recommend a stay here for those who want a peaceful and relaxing stay!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The location was so perfect!! Beautiful clean space with amenities like an iron, mini fridge, tv, blow dryer, etc! Great stay."

They provide everything needed for a comfortable stay and look forward to booking again when we return to the area."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great stay at this place - Bryan was very responsive, close parking, easy lock/access, good Wifi, water in fridge, loved the ""kitchen bar"" furniture piece and contents, and the best- SUPER CLEAN! Would definitely stay again!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Bryan’s place is located close to the heart of Blacksburg and campus but tucked inside a quiet neighborhood. The space is just as advertised. Make sure you try out the Wine Lab on the edge of Campus. One word of caution the ceiling in the bathroom does slip down where the toilet is and my 6’4 ft husband did hit his head a couple of times. Just something to consider if you are tall.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The suite is located in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Blacksburg and the VT campus. We were delighted to arrive after a football game to enjoy a crisp, fall evening sitting on the deck while overlooking their beautiful garden and listening to the running fountain. When it got darker, the impressive garden lights came on!
The self check in (and check out) were convenient and easy to use. The suite is spacious and beautifully decorated. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We recently traveled to Blacksburg to visit our grandsons at VT. It was our good fortune to stay at The In-law Suite.

When we return to Blacksburg we will certainly make this our home away from home."

My only complaint is that the heater was a bit loud when it kicked on, but that could be remedied by a standard pair of ear plugs (and it might not bother heaver sleepers at all). We will be staying again."

I didn’t need to communicate with Bryan because everything from the check-in instructions to check-out instructions were on point. This was a very comfortable, no fuss experience! Defiantly will consider staying here again."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bryan’s place is a great spot for a stay in Blacksburg. It is located close to Main Street, campus of VT and many of the apartment complexes where students live.

We arrived to find that they had placed some toys, puzzles and books in the suite for our 4 year old to enjoy. The suite is beautifully decorated and very clean. Bryan even had some water and other beverages ready for us in the mini fridge, as well as coffee and tea. He also included some Aveda toiletries in the bathroom. The rest of my family was staying in a hotel nearby and came by to check it out as we raved about the place - they loved it too!

2018-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Bright and Sunny as advertised! Nice to wake up to a sun filled room. When looking for a clean and quiet place to stay while in the Burg, this is the place. The location is far enough from the apartment complexes so you do not hear the late night parties, but still less than 5 min. from campus and about 2 min. from the Carol Lee Donut Shop if you time the stoplight right. You have that large hotel suite feel, with a separate hallway with frig, coffee pot, tea kettle and counter space, and private bathroom off that hallway, separate from the bed room and lounging area. The main room, in addition to the bed has enough room to comfortably include a desk/chair, couch and high back chair. The kids mentioned in the description were around my first day but if I hadn’t actually seen them, I would not have known they were on the property."

Check in and check out instructions are also super clear and low maintenance, so visits are stress-free. This was my second time staying in one of Austin’s places, and I’ve booked a third for December. I would definitely recommend staying at one of Austin’s places when visiting Blacksburg! :)"

The kitchen was well-equipped and had pots and pans for our cooking needs. Appliances were brand new as well. The home is located on the outskirts of Blacksburg, just a short drive to restaurants and campus. This is a very quiet location and we got to enjoy visits from a family of deer in the yard. We would highly recommend staying here!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We love everything about this HOKIE themed place! It always feels just like home when we stay there which is awesome because we always feel like we’re coming home every time we come back to Blacksburg. And it’s absolutely adorable inside. The bed is super comfortable. I could lay in it all day, and I did one day. The yard is totally fenced, and HUGE. This place is 100% dog friendly. We also had our own guaranteed off street parking space which was nice, and everything we needed inside to be completely comfortable. Virginia Tech, grocery store, many restaurants, and various other things to do are all within walking distance. Theresa is a top notch hostess. She made sure the place was stocked with everything we needed and was very responsive throughout the whole process of booking through departure."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our 3rd visit to Theresa's place and we felt right at home. We had everything we needed to relax and get a good night's sleep.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very nice stay in the downtown.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Close to campus and downtown. Quiet location with many amenities.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay near the Virginia Tech campus! Everything was clean and exactly as described/pictured. Theresa is a great host & I hope to stay there again next time I’m in town!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our one night stay. Our pup, Jodie, loved the back yard! Great location and quiet area."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was my 2nd stay here and always the first place I try to book. Thankful I had the opportunity to meet the owners this time. The place is clean and well decorated and stocked. The location cannot be beat.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very tidy and well kept place, thank you Theresa!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"No detail was spared, clean, nice, everything was perfect! PRO TIP: use the skinny back room to store your clothes and luggage. There is a nice bench there to keep the room more open and clutter free. (I finally figured this out as I was packing everything to go:)."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My wife and I stayed at Theresa's, and we had a wonderful time. Their place is private, but it's also close to campus, South Main, restaurants, Kroger, and downtown. It's the perfect place for a couple and their dog :)"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Theresa’s place was perfect for my girlfriend and I and our dog. Studio place was well stocked and the backyard was PERFECT! Really big and full fenced in. Would recommend and we are considering rebooking this place for our return trip! 11/10
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is our second time at Theresa's place and yet again it was great. We were visiting our Hokie daughter and prepped a meal in the kitchen to bring to her house. Our dog loved exploring the yard. We loved the comfort and convenience of this place. I highly recommend staying here.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A short, but wonderful stay! We loved the space. It can be difficult to travel with our pup, so we are always excited to find dog friendly places. We will look to stay at Theresa’s every time we are back in Blacksburg!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and comfy, great location!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Clean and comfortable place. Very nice to work with.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"For a quick stay in Blacksburg to catch a basketball game and visit our student, this listing fit our needs (2 adults). As you can see from the photos, it's essentially an efficiency apartment with the front door opening right near the foot of the bed. This is located directly under the main house so you may hear/see the owners - but generally felt private. It's rare to have a full kitchen in spaces like this, so that is a nice bonus and was part of our decision to stay there. Also very dog friendly which meant we didn't have to board our pet. The fair pricing was another reason we chose to stay here over other options."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a convenient place to stay while in Blacksburg. A quiet place to stay that is just a quick drive to downtown and campus.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Second visit here with our dog. Place is great, very clean and very quiet. Yard is set up for easy use with your pet. Will be back and would recommend to others."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Theresa’s place was the perfect place to stay while visiting my daughter at VT! Great location and thoughtful touches to make my stay very comfortable! I look forward to staying in the future!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,10/10. I would give it 11/10 if I could. Wonderful and thoughtful host who was so accommodating and friendly. We asked to check in early because of work meetings and we were traveling with our dog. Theresa was able to accommodate and was happy to do so. The backyard is unbelievable. My dog was depressed when we were leaving because it was a vacation for him as well! Could not recommend more. Would love to stay here again next time we’re in town.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,My mom and I stayed here after traveling from Minnesota to Blacksburg and it was exactly what we needed. The space is cute and clean and the yard for the dogs is H U G E! My dogs were very grateful for the use of it after two days on the road. It was a very pleasant stay :)
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We made a pit stop at Theresa's on our way down from PA to TN. After a long day of driving in a winter storm, it was honestly so nice to settle down at Theresa's. Our dog loved the large fenced in backyard and we had everything we needed for the night!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful, brief stay in Blacksburg. The yard and setup for the dogs was a huge perk. Would definitely stay here again."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've stayed here a few times now, and it is always a cozy place to stay. It is within walking distance of a few good restaurants. It is quiet, with a big backyard for dogs, if you travel with them."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a great space for us to stop with our dogs mid-road trip! The fenced in backyard is huge and the apartment has everything you could ever need for a comfortable stay.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,An amazing place is you have a dog. Great yard! Private and peaceful.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Had a wonderful stay. This is the most pet friendly place that we’ve stayed at - huge fenced-in back yard, bowls provided, a place for waste, etc. We really appreciated that. The little nook in the back was perfect for our baby’s pack-n-play. Great restaurants very close, even within walking distance. It’s always a joy to find little gems like this place. Thanks so much!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Snug little under-house apartment with a great yard for dogs.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We chose T's place to stay in Blacksburg since we were visiting with our dog. The studio apartment had everything we needed, and the huge fenced in yard was great for our pup! Will stay again next time we visit!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice place to bring your dogs for a getaway! Huge backyard. The residence itself was very clean and well-stocked with kitchen basics. Theresa is a wonderful host!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was perfect. Right near down Blacksburg, near tons of resturants and Virginia Tech. The place was extremely clean and I felt right at home. I will try to stay there again for my next trip.
Theresa was a fantastic communicator. I wanted for nothing, all the instructions and directions were clear and concise."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Enjoyed a very comfortable stay. The house is gorgeous and the backyard is gigantic; the fully fenced in yard was a plus. Bed was firm but comfortable and the room had everything a body needs for a relaxing stay. The only downside we encountered was that the heat from the house’s pipes warmed the basement room quite a bit and the split A/C did not work so it got a little toasty. Highly recommended overall.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"The accommodations were perfect. I only wish my visit was longer. It was cozy, clean, and comfortable. I'm so happy I found it. I will be back."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Convenient and super clean.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous little apartment that's been lovingly and thoughtfully prepped to rent with all the things you could need.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay for the night passing through for the VT game!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our stay here! Everything was super clean and we loved how easy it was to check in and find the house. Would definitely stay here again if we visit Blacksburg!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, modest, amazing location. Perfect for a busy weekend. Thanks Theresa and Kevin!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A well equipped, comfortable basement studio with a great location and lots of thoughtful touches. We would recommend Theresa's space!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"At Theresa's place, Zeke (my corgi) and I felt cared for by Theresa. There was even a bowl for Zeke to use! The yard area was beautiful with lots of room for Zeke to zoom around (much needed after being in the car so long). I was blessed with all the extra thoughtful touches Theresa supplied and the clear instructions on the frig. I have already scheduled my next stay at Theresa's. Thank you Theresa for providing such a wonderful oasis of rest.
Kindly,
Robin and Zeke"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome place! GO HOKIES! :)
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great, convenient, and private place in Blacksburg. I took advantage of the location to walk to the Huckleberry Trail and to downtown. Easy access and your own parking spot. Great shower. I will definitely stay here again if it is available."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Theresa's place was the perfect stay after a long day on the road. I could not recommend more!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Theresa's place was absolutely wonderful! The pictures don't reflect the character, attention to detail and thoughtfulness that went into arranging the space. There were more amenities and thoughtful treats as well. The instructions were clear and she responded immediately to my texts. The place has so much charm and is the cleanest place we've stayed it.
I look forward to returning!
Thank you Theresa!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect local stay for my wife and I while visiting our college aged children. Great location in Blacksburg.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay and the perfect location.
2023-09-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Very beautiful and well kept. The only reason I gave 4 stars , instead of 5, was because of heavy footed noise from above. It does , however ,state in description that there would be noise . I was not prepared for how loud and how late. We were woken up until midnight.
Probably a better stay for VT fans and not tired travelers. I didn’t see any complaints in other reviews so the pros outweigh the cons.
Lots of lovely touches to make it feel homey ."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had such a lovely stay at Theresa’s home. It was everything we needed and more. The bed was super cozy, great temperature control, and a nice hot shower! Everything was spotless and perfectly laid out."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very clean home with a great style and quiet neighborhood. The backyard was a super amazing bonus with a dog! Also great food choices nearby. Highly recommend! 🤙🏼
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a cozy apartment just right for a couple and within a mile of the Virginia Tech campus. It was perfectly thought out and detailed. We rarely get a chance to spend all weekend in Blacksburg, so this was much more reasonable than a football gameday."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This sweet space provided everything we needed and wanted during our stay. The full-sized fridge here enabled us to provide dinner to our extended family living here every night. AC worked great during the hot spell. We'll certainly look at this listing next time we visit Blacksburg.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is my second time staying here on my way to visit family. I chose to stay again because of the friendliness and responsiveness of the host, for the cleanliness and convenience of the unit, and for the peaceful and safe setting. I highly recommend! Thank you, Theresa and family for hosting!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Thrilled to have found this adorable, affordable place in Blacksburg! We were moving my Hokie into her apartment and just needed a place to sleep for 1 night. Directions to enter the space seemed a little complicated over written word, but it was exactly as stated and super easy! We arrived at night and the pathway was well lit. I was very impressed when we opened the door. It is a very cute place! Well decorated and had absolutely everything we could need for our short visit. It was clean and fresh looking. All necessary items available in the bathroom and the kitchen was stocked with a generous coffee bar. Bed was very comfortable. They even had an extra space with a desk/vanity. I just wish we could have stayed longer! Can't wait to book here again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Thank you for a great place to stay for my husband and I with my two fur-babies. Your home is very beautiful!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place to stay whilst we moved our son into Virginia Tech. So close to campus and Krogers! The apartment is so lovely - beautifully decorated with wonderful little personal touches - cute little baskets for the coffee pods, sachets of tea, chocolates, popcorn, shampoo and conditioner ….. I just loved staying here and can’t wait to return."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place for my husband and I to rest our heads after moving our daughter to Virginia Tech! The location can’t be beat - so close to campus and downtown. The space is clean and comfortable with a huge backyard for your dog too. Hosts were very accommodating, felt like we were staying with friends. I have been visiting Blacksburg for over 4 years to attend various VT events and this is our best experience yet!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The location was amazing, close to campus. Quiet street and gorgeous backyard setting. The bed is SO COMFORTABLE! That makes a huge difference after a long car ride. The place and grounds are spotless, and we ran into the owners. Both lovely people. Will absolutely stay here again! They had treats for my dog and he also loved the house"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Theresa is such a great host, I’m a repeat guest!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very close to campus and the highway. Great place to stay if in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We absolutely loved our stay! The location was perfect, the apartment was pristine, and their backyard was a dream. Our puppy, Sullivan, loved running around, and Theresa had everything needed for her to be comfortable. I couldn't stop telling our local friends about it. If we are back in the area, I hope we're lucky enough to stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Loved our wonderful stay a second time around. You always take such excellent care of the space and your hosting skills are effortless. Looking forward to a future trip back!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Hands down, one of the best air BNB’s we’ve ever stayed in. Everything about it was 5 STAR worthy. It was an easy walk to campus if we wanted or needed to which, if you’re familiar with Blacksburg, is a bonus especially since the town has now implemented the town parking permit policy. Sigh. Theresa’s place had everything we needed to survive for an endless amount of time. Just add food. Having three larger dogs, this place was ideal for us with its extremely large fenced in backyard. And because Theresa also has dogs, it became immediately clear that they were as welcome as we were. I think what we liked most about this place was that we immediately felt right at home. The random Virginia Tech Hokie decor inside and out was exactly what Hokie alumni look for when they come back to Blacksburg to visit. Oh and, there were tissues, the only place that’s ever provided them. Absolutely everything was fantastic! We wanted to stay forever. We would definitely s†ay here again in the future."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Delightful stay with friendly and responsive hosts. The cute pups were an added treat. Clean and cozy accommodations. The patio is a great place to unwind. Will stay again.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a wonderful, clean, and welcoming space, and in an ideal location -- close to everything in Blacksburg and to some beautiful trails. Theresa was helpful and kind. Would love to come back!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re heading to Blacksburg with your puppers, this is the place for you! Great yard and perfect plan for keeping their dogs and yours separate. Super close to downtown and Virginia Tech campus. Extremely clean and welcoming with lovely amenities."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was an awesome place to stay for a night on my road trip
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as pictured and described. Great location. Perfect for staying busy or relaxing. Theresa was super friendly and helpful. Apartment was spotless. Will definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Theresa's place was perfect for our night stay to visit Virginia Tech. The place was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was also very dog friendly and had a big fenced in yard for our two dogs to play in. The location was very convenient only being 5 mind to downtown/campus. Would highly recommend!!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I've stayed at a lot of AirBnB's (even internationally), and I really enjoyed staying here. The *huge* fenced-in backyard was perfect for my dog after a long road trip and the setup is really private, with close access to the hosts if you need them. They were responsive, proactive, and well-prepared for dogs (including poop bags, outdoor trash, water bowls, easy-to-wash linens, etc). The area is close to shopping, Starbucks, and not too far from the highway which I also appreciated. If we were in the area, I would stay here again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was great and fit description to a “t”. I would stay here again- owner was very quick to respond, beautiful unit."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We booked this last-minute while traveling home over the holiday weekend with our senior dog. It was a perfect spot to spend the night—agree with all the reviewers that the backyard alone makes it ideal for your pups. There are also dog treats, bowls, etc. While it’s a relatively small space, it is thoughtfully laid out. (And again the outdoor space cannot be beat.) We slept very well and would stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent stay! Welcoming hosts. Everything from the dedicated parking space and private entrance to the house rules/instructions were well communicated and easy to follow. Comfortable space with all you need. Highly recommend staying here!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We only had a brief stay but we were very comfortable. The apartment had everything we needed and the big back yard is amazing for the dogs.
2023-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Great location within Blacksburg. Quite dead-end street. Hosts were very nice and easy to deal with. The apartment had everything you would need and even more amenities as you look around. Two notes for this location. First, as Theresa mentions you will hear noise from upstairs as they move around; bring ear plugs if you like to sleep past 7am. The second is the vinyl flooring is slippery when just wearing socks."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Tucked away in the bottom level of a home, this unit was very thoughtfully designed and had everything in it that you could think of. It's quiet and you can get a good night rest while there. Occassionaly we heard footsteps upstairs above us the morning we slept in, but nothing that would prevent us from renting again! (Plus we were forewarned about that and possibly hearing a dog - which we never heard bark ever!) Love the little patio area. Super comfy chairs so that we worked outside on the pub table. Extra touches inside such as a Brita water filter, coffee pods, tea and chocolates was SO welcome! We appreciated the full size body wash, shampoo and conditioner AND even body lotion. I absolutely hate the small travel size shampoos etc. Small backroom with bench, make up table and shelving was SO nice as a changing area and make-up table. Hair dyer, iron, even band aids were there if we needed! Super close to campus and nice quiet location. Will come back for sure!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thank you. Wonderful place to stay when visiting your love new studying at Vtech! We will definitely want to come back the next time we visit our son.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you are traveling with a dog you will not find a better place to stay. Great location, amazing yard and the space was very nice. Comfortable bed. We stopped on a road trip and are hoping its free so we can stay here again on our way back!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great location, very convenient for a short stay."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful setting, huge fenced in yard for the pup and an overall perfectly curated and clean space. I could instantly see why you have such excellent reviews! I will absolutely be staying here again when we come back to Blacksburg. Thank you so much for the hospitality!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay in the space! It was in an really good location and walkable to downtown and campus. The space was very homey, clean, and comfortable. We would highly recommend it."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect spot! Very convenient to downtown Blacksburg and the Virginia Tech campus. Kevin and Theresa were very welcoming and wonderful hosts. The apartment is immaculate and the grounds are gorgeous — many thoughtful details especially for the pup! Thanks for a great stay!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Honestly this was such a perfect stay , it made us so happy.
The yard is gorgeous. It is fully fenced in and it is huge! Our two dogs had the time of their lives in the yard. It was honestly so beautiful seeing them running around and enjoying it so much.
The house itself is also very nice. Not only is it a beautiful carefully designed house but also it had everything you could think of. Theresa even had contact lense solution available should you need one.
I loved the dehumidifier, the fan and the AC in the room. It made our sleep very comfortable. The bed felt great after a long day hiking.
I would honestly come back to Blacksburg just to stay in this Airbnb!
What made everything even better was how pet-friendly and kind the hosts were. We were worried our dogs would be barking when we left them to do our own stuff, and Theresa and her husband said “let dogs be dogs” and honestly this peace of mind made everything so much better.
Thank you for a perfect stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a very comfortable stay at Theresa’s place. It was one of our best stays in an Airbnb!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Theresa's place is exactly what we needed to pick up our son following finals. The space is thoughtfully designed with just the right attention to details. Will definitely return with pup in tow to enjoy the spacious yard.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Easy check in and a comfy place. Was perfect and close to VT.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed a comfortable and cozy stay at Theresa's place. She provided easy self-check in instructions and directions. The location is close to a Kroger grocery store and the Main Street restaurants. The fenced in yard was a bonus for our dog to run around a bit, after our long day in the car!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place and exactly as described. It was more than adequate for our one night stay. Would stay again if I'm in the area.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect location and loved the fact that you can have a pet stay! Probably the most crisp and fresh sheets I have ever slept on! The back and fencing is ideal for a traveling pet! Most importantly, there was coffee pods and pet treats!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I very much appreciated my short, but very sweet, stay in Theresa's studio apartment. Everything was as advertised. Location was very convenient; so very clean; excellent accommodations for traveling with my dog; very responsive to my need for assistance with the lockbox. Highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fantastic stay. Theresa thought of everything. Beautiful outside space as well.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay! We would definitely stay here again!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We have always enjoyed staying at Theresa's home. Location is great, amenities are great, and the hosts are wonderful."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We felt at home
We had everything we could possibly need
The accommodations were clean and comfortable
Perfect if you have a pet
Would stay there again and again
Grateful of Theresa's kindness.
Stay here!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Hi- Great basement apartment so close to Blacksburg- clean, cozy and quaint!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is SPOTLESS! Cleaner than a hotel and so cozy. I really enjoyed my stay here. It had everything I needed. 25-30 min walk to campus and only a few minutes to grocery store and restaurants. Can highly recommend!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It’s a really lovely place: it’s very clean, cosy and quiet.
And it connects easily to downtown either on foot, by public transit or personal vehicle.
It’s really lovely and pleasant even for longer stays."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed being near campus.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great find in Blacksburg. Quiet place close to campus. Being that I have a Freshman Hokie and another one next year, I plan to return. Thanks again for a great stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place. I look forward to staying here in the future
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved our stay. We hope to visit again.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, comfortable with everything you need. Comfortable beds, very clean and awesome location. Theresa and Kevin amazing host that make you feel so welcome. Very accommodating for any special needs you have. Loved our stay and definitely will be back any time we need Blacksburg accommodations! Highly recommend if in the area!!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We’ve stayed here a few times when we come to town and it’s always an enjoyable stay!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I booked this room with only a few days notice before my trip to Blacksburg. Theresa was super responsive. Her check-in instructions and how to get to the unit were very simple and easy to follow. The amount of thought she has placed into making this space feel like home is unmatched. I loved this little space. My only caution is that it gets bright in the mornings in this unit, so bring a eye mask. I will slo make note that you can hear people or the dogs upstairs from time to time. Otherwise, the noise settles pretty early in the day, so that wasn't an issue for me. This little unit had pretty much everything you need. The location was perfect as it was only a few minutes drive, or walk, to several restaurants, grocery stores, and Virginia Tech's Campus."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you have a dog and would like to work in a stay during a long road trip- this is your place. Small yet pleasantly clean with all the essentials, the place welcomes your furry companions! Personally, I’m one that believes less is more and what’s most important with family travels is minimal stress and safety. This rare find is just that. Would recommend to anyone traveling solo or with a pet in particular."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful studio room just as advertised. Clean and equipped with everything we could have needed. Awesome, large fenced-in backyard for our dog."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing Place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay. Timely communication, and well equipped place, cozy, place, though a bit drafty door in the winter. Our dog loved the back yard."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I stopped by Blacksburg on a road trip with my two dogs. Theresa’s place was perfect for my one night stay: easy to find, very comfortable bed, and coffee for my early morning! My dogs also loved being able to run around in the big back yard!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"One of the best stays I’ve had! Very clean space, easy to get to and great accommodations for a quick trip. Theresa really put a lot of thought into this space and it shows/is very appreciated!"

I only stayed the night so didn’t spend a ton of time but it was very comfortable and convenient for getting to restaurants and campus.

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My wife stayed at Theresa's twice in February and says:
“During Covid, I have been driving back and forth along I-81 regularly. Theresa's Place has been an ideal spot for an overnight on my way. It is clean, nicely and comfortably furnished, easy to find, quiet and private, and near places to pick up a quick supper. I am glad to have found it as an ideal economical place to rest for the night and go on my way the next day. Important to me is that its air supply is independent from the main house so you are not sharing air with anyone in another household.
Since the apartment has a kitchen and a nice patio facing the backyard, it would be a good place to stay for more than a night if that was your need.
I wasn't traveling with our dog, but Theresa is welcoming of dogs and has a fenced yard off the patio that you can use.”"
