2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Well worth the money, in a great part of lumberton. Quick drive to local shops and restaurants. House needs some attention, but nothing that keeps it from being rentable. Neighboring dogs left messes in the yard but otherwise a good stay. Would definitely stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"If you need to stay in this area look no further. This is a very clean, great location, that’s way cheaper than any nice hotel around!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay! We wish we could have stayed longer.
2024-03-01,5.0,Group trip,It was easy to find. Very close to town and in a good quiet family neighborhood. I would stay here again.
2024-03-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,The only comfort we found is their neighbor is a police officer.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A very convenient and safe place to stay with your dog. A yard for him/her to run around after a long drive.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Very clean and beautiful.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Stays by way. Excellent
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Tina was a great host and had a beautiful home! I stayed with my family and 2 dogs - it was very clean and fit our big family perfect. very easy to find. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was in town for work and this was the perfect location.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was as described. Very clean. However in the room we stayed in there was a Bubly can left on the bed post. I assume by house keeping mistakenly leaving it behind. The house was spotless otherwise. Things to note, the water and ice didn't work on the fridge. However there was bagged ice in the freezer. Also many of the outlets didn't fit our standard appliances. About 1 outlet in every room worked, the others didn't. Something to look into for the owner. This was very convenient to stop at on our way from NJ down to Florida, as it was half way. I would definitely stay again for a one night stay."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Suited our needs for a quick stop on our way to Florida. Easy access from 95. Simple instructions. Easy check out process which allowed for us to get on the road early. Much appreciated!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home and great host. Would absolutely recommend
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was great ..easy to get to.. very clean and comfortable , grateful my dogs could feel at home and will definitely 💯 recommend to others"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,all perfcet
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I would highly recommend Tina’s house to anybody. I stayed there because of a race at Dillon Motor Speedway that we attended. I would definitely stay again.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Had an overnight stay with my family as we made our way back home. All went well, place as described, clean and pet friendly, so expect some stains on the couches. Overall good stay and good value for an overnight stop."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place that accepts pets, that was clean, just as described, and the owner is friendly and responsive."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I'm always a little nervous when a place of lodging accepts pets. I have a dog and rarely take because of this and I have never stayed in a pet friendly place until now. This place was immaculate, clean, smelled fresh, no sign of a pet,,,,except in the yard, which is expected. My dog loves to sniff when he's out.
If you are blessed enough to stay at a place like Tina's and take your pets, be respectful enough to clean up after your pet when you take him out."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,great location for the time we were there. house was clean and organized. would definitely recommend to anyone
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great halfway point for a one night meet up with family.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was a great nice house too stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"I loved Tina’s place! It was very easy to locate! Walking in the door you could tell how great and clean her home smelled. She made it feel like home. The beds were comfy, she had extra utensils and wash cloths. I had to reach out to her once, and her response was immediate! I would definitely stay here again if I am in the area!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,My family enjoyed the weekend at thisnhouse. We felt safe in the area. Great host
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent clean and quiet place, very good stay, 100% everything"
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Homey quiet place to stay when passing through.
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Tina’s place was easy to get to and check into. We liked the bedroom/bed situation - it worked really well for our family of four and cat. Be careful with some of the outlets as the covers aren’t flush, especially if you have little ones. The beds are also really high and hard for small children or people with mobility issues to get in and out of. We will stay here again on our travels north/south on I-95."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Loved this place it was nice comfortable and very clean would recommend to anyone.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The house was conveniently located by I-95 which made it an easy stop during a road trip. We had plenty of room and were very comfortable during our stay!
2023-10-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place. A few odd neighbors. The house was beautifully renovated but there were some small quirky things. There were very few places to hang things, no towel racks in the bathrooms. We were unable to watch network channels, for football but the host did let us know that beforehand. I just didn't understand it. Overall it was a great place and fit our five adult family well."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We travel 100 percent for work so having a nice place is very important to us. We really liked Tina's place because it was clean, well stocked, and close to our jobsite. We enjoyed our stay and would stay with her again if we ended up back in this area."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This home was very comfortable, clean, and cozy and nicely decorated. Everything was as described and the pictures depicting home were accurate. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe.
Things to note:
Bring your own Keurig kcups if you want coffee. The master bedroom mattress is very firm.
The home has electric air fresheners throughout the home leaving it overly fragranced. I am very sensitive to this and it aggravated my allergies/asthma. This of course is my personal health issue but people with allergies and or asthma should be aware. I have suggested that the owner cut back to one.
Aside from the fragrance issue, it was overall a great value, easy checkin/checkout, and I appreciate that the property allowed my small dog."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My colleagues and I were in town on a business trip. Tina's place was great! Just what we needed.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tina’s place was amazing. Tina was friendly and responded quickly to any questions that I had. The home is located in a nice neighborhood that’s not too far from the local stores and restaurants. Tina’s place was very clean and had nice furnishings throughout the home. The bedrooms were a nice size and the beds were very comfortable. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Lumberton, don’t hesitate to book Tina’s place you won’t regret it."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,"Easy check in and prompt communication. Thanks, Tina!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tina was an amazing host
I had to return to my fathers hometown to lay him to rest, which involved me bringing all of my children, and the house was a perfect fit for our big family, and our host was very understanding and patient!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great home in a quiet neighbor. We are not dog owners and the house was listed as dogs welcome; so at first we were worried. But the house was so clean you could never tell there was a dog in the house. Spotless!!!
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was all we needed. It fit our needs for the nights. I was surprised to get a message from the host prior to check out asking if we were ok. We work nights so we get as much sleep as possible before checking out and moving on. I replied that we were and she said the cleaners were circling waiting for us to leave. I told her I hadn’t seen anyone and it wasn’t check out time but we were out of the house. First time this has happened to us.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"awesome place, very convenient location on the way to/from Fl"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I can only say wonderful things about Tina's place. Clean, cozy, peaceful and so easy to get to off of 95. Will def be back again when its time for me to pick my son up from USC. This was the perfect pitstop on our journey in from NJ!I"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect place, especially for travel nurses"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall great stay at the home. It’s right off the interstate which was great. We were traveling from NJ to FL which allowed us a place to rest our heads for the night. We only used the master bedroom, and bed was comfortable. A few cosmetic features made certain tasks difficult. The switches and outlets in the master bath are not properly installed. The junction boxes are too far back in the wall which made it difficult to turn light switches on or plug anything in. The backyard deck also didn’t have steps so you have to jump down when going out the back door. Besides these minor things, it’s a very convenient home for traveling."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stayed for one night on our way up north. Very clean, comfy space and we were able to bring our dogs."
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Tina's place was a great value for price. first Tina reached out way in advance to make contact about when we would arrive she had someone working to correct an issue at the house and wanted to make sure we weren't inconvenience in anyway. we were checking in super late so she had no issues with that. we were super quiet checking in around 1 am. neighborhood was very quiet and easy to relax and not worry about anything. Tina's place was super super clean and very decluttered . if I had anything that was a negative ..there were no small extras like other airbnbs have had in our past travels ( sugar ,creamer for coffee ) but we were only staying a few hours for sleep and on our way to finish our trip ..so didn't really need too many extras. mastered room had an amazing mattress. would totally stay in again"
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Tina is an awesome host and her home was very roomy and exceptionally clean. The neighborhood felt very safe (a police officer lives right around the corner).
We were just stopping over on our way to Florida but didn’t want to stay at a hotel, this was way better and the cost was so reasonable.
I would highly recommend this home for its comfort, it’s location and it’s host.
Thanks"

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautifully renovated older home in a peaceful country setting-- perfect!
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home, the decor and color scheme were amazing. So soothing. Very quiet neighborhood, while still feeling like you have plenty of space. Quite convenient to anything you might need even as late as 10 o’clock at night! So many personal touches, the beds were super comfortable.(didn’t use the twins). Lots of thought went into the style of the home.
If you stay here, you’ll be shocked at how spacious it is once you walk inside versus the vision of the outside. Will definitely stay here again, we have occasion to visit this area about four times a year and will never stay anywhere else again."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We didn't win the Power Ball jackpot on Saturday night but we felt like we hit the jackpot staying in Sophia's home. This was a weekend New Year's Eve stay along the path of our travels and we couldn't have been happier with everything. Convenient to I-95. Squeaky clean. Comfortable. Well stocked with everything needed. We had a couple questions and Sophia responded immediately. She even came over to drop something off for us. I highly recommend this location.

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great stop along our long drive to FL. This place is not far off the highway at all so it was super convenient to rest and get back on the road easily. Also didn't hurt that it's not too far from Cookout , we love this place and don't have any of the chain in NY where we live so it was a nice bonus! Location super private and even though we arrived late still found the place and checked in smoothly at night. Yard seemed super big and would probably be great for kids.

The living room furniture was comfortable and so were the beds. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare breakfast and there was plenty of space. There was a big screened in back porch perfect for enjoying the outdoors and a huge back yard for the kids to run and play in. We enjoyed our stay and we would love to stay here again in the future.

2023-07-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"Sophia’s place was super clean. It was spacious and had nice amenities like a washer and dryer and full kitchen. There were a few things that could have made our stay better though. There was an overwhelming amount of instructions sent just before check in. In them, it said we could adjust the thermostat which was nice, however it kept kicking back up to the default temperature so my baby and I woke up sweating and I had to go monkey with it in the middle of the night. Also, most airbnbs I have been in have basic toiletries, but not here. Overall it was a good stay and met our needs but I don’t know that we’ll be back."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This is an ideal stop along 95. The perfect half-way point from DC to Savannah. The house is roomy, cozy, and exceptionally clean. We were able to cook a nice meal while the kids ran around out back. Then cozy up on the comfy couch for a movie. Beats the heck out of a hotel room for the night, across the board! We’ll be back for sure."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We only needed a place to shower and sleep, so this house was all that and more. It is an easy drive close to the highway but in a rural area surrounded by farm fields. At the same time, it is close to many restaurants and stores. We didn't use the kitchen, but the coffee maker was appreciated. The place is spotlessly clean. No complaints."

Sophia's communication was excellent and she was very responsive. You could not have had it any better than hers.
She even thought of windowshield cleaner. I got to remove the bugs before heading back out on my 12 hr journey.

Our family enjoyed the environment as it’s different from where we live and we felt at peace with how quiet it was since we live in the city. Would recommend staying here!
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Sophia's place was so comfy and cozy. As someone with mobility struggles, I was really happy to see a ramp up to the back porch and pull bars in the bathroom. The Christmas decorations made the space even more homey. There is some noise from the traffic, but that didn't bother us. There was room to ""camp out"" on the deck and make smores. This home is in the country but minutes to everything you could need. Excellent bnb!!!"

As superhosts ourselves, a top notch “kudos”to the hosts, Nan & Kurt, thank you so much."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"After a long day of driving from Florida Nan’s place was perfect. The grounds are a beautiful smelling and lush spot king garden.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This property was exactly as described and extremely clean and comfortable. All the little things has been considered that make an experience stand out from the rest - white noise maker, make-up remover wipes, pillows with varying firmness, etc. The only thing less than glowing thing I would say is that I wouldn’t consider it luxury. It’s certainly comfy and cozy and worth the price paid though so I still highly recommend the suite!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was my husband's and my second stay at Nan's, and like the first time, it was a fantastic experience. Nan's place is an ideal place to overnight when traveling up or down 95 -- less than 10 minutes off the interstate, but a world away: peaceful, quiet, beautiful gardens and surroundings. The immaculately clean suite, super-comfortable bed, top-of-the-line linens and towels, and Nan's wonderful artwork all combine to make this a remarkable space. Nan and her husband are both warm and welcoming, and we can't wait to stay here again!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful little guest suite with all amenities included. Definitely would stay here again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nan thought of every detail and need you might have. Will definitely stay there again!

It seems nothing is too good for their guests. If you don’t mind being treated like a King or a Queen, plan to spend some time with Nan & Kurt, You’ll be glad you did. An
Interesting, colorful and lively place to experience…nestled among the trees and the bushes, you’re soon find you have a new favorite place right here in the heart of Hope Mills, NC. Thank you Nan & Kurt; for a time I’ll find hard to forget. It was simply amazing!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nan and her husband, Kurt, are warm, welcoming and eager to share their local knowledge. Nan offered an alternate route to the airport that avoided a 30 minute traffic jam back to the airport. The sleeping accommodations are super comfortable, with a spacious bathroom (as opposed to the ""shoe box"" bathrooms at many hotels.) The garden grounds provide a beautiful setting to wander through while sipping your morning coffee. I highly recommend Nan's Place for your southeastern North Carolina travels!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely would recommend Nan’s place. Very peaceful and homey feeling the moment you pull in the driveway. Nan is so friendly and greets you when you check in. Will definitely check her availability in the future. Thank you Nan and Kurt!

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We stayed at Nan’s beautifully appointed guest suite after a long international flight and welcomed the peace and quiet.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect layover for our trip to the beach in SC. Accommodations were lovely (and spotless). Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was delicious. Everything we needed. If you are planning to eat dinner there as we did, a tip is to pick some food up at one of the exits along I-95 beforehand as there did not seem to be any restaurants for take out nearby. We would definitely stay here again!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nan goes on and above most hosts, an artist touch everywhere in the decor, an excellent nights sleep, and breakfast is outstanding."
2022-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely home and gardens. Beautiful and clean space. Kind and considerate hosts. The space is attached to their main home, so I could at times hear their TV and talking, thus the 4 star rating. Otherwise 5 stars!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A great safe quiet place to stay.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Fabulous B&B. Besides all the basic criteria being 10s, we felt like we had landed in paradise. The beauty both inside and outside warmed our souls. Nan’s artistic talents, whimsy, and fun spirit shine throughout. And did I mention the yummy muffins? All in all, a 12 star stop!!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This suite is on a lovely property out in the near countryside of Fayetteville, Hope Mills, and Fort Bragg. The amenities and hospitality both are quite generous, and this place makes for a great stay to kick back and slow down a bit! I highly recommend it."

Thank me and everyone else who reviewed later."

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I wish I had planned more than a single night's stay at ""the art teacher's garden"". This is a delightfully charming place: both the country atmosphere, with a little fountain by the door and lovely plantings surrounding the house, and the guest suite, which has every possible amenity, and some surprising nooks and crannies, like the tiny little drawers near the coffee pot, with each drawer holding a different type of tea. The furnishings and art work on display are creative and fun, and the sleeping was good."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We really loved this spacious and charming space. Nan thought of everything! The linens were extremely comfortable and soft, and it was so nice to have a choice of pillow to sleep on (as I said, she thought of everything). The coffee was delicious, too. Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Conveniently located off of I-95, Nan and Kurt’s guest suite is an oasis for weary travelers. My boyfriend and I stopped there on a road trip and had a wonderful stay - the space was clean, the bed was comfy, and the homemade breakfast was delicious! Nan goes above and beyond to provide all the amenities and services of a hotel for a fraction of the cost. We will definitely be stopping by again!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at Nan's! The bedroom and bathroom are warm and comfortable with many personal artistic touches.

Almost forgot, the breakfast that Nan offers was delicious! Don't pass on that."
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful time at Nan's place - we would have loved to stay longer, but unfortunately we had too little time!
The apartment is so lovely with many cute details, the bed was very comfortable, there's lots of space in the bathroom - Nan put a lot love into the rooms!
It is located in a very quiet and peaceful area and there is a beautiful garden around the house that you are invited to explore.
Nan and here husband are very nice hosts who made delicious breakfasts for us!
Thank you very much! We wish you all the best!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was the prefect spot to stop as we passed through heading south - a much nicer alternative to a roadside hotel. The rooms were beautifully decorated and very clean. We had a nice private area to sit outside in the morning. Breakfast was delicious!! We also enjoyed Dirtbags for burgers, beer and live entertainment."

2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nan’s Airbnb is very well appointed and Nan is wonderful!! I highly recommend staying in this very quaint place!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,A nice cozy place in the country. There are stars in the sky! Nan's accommodations were very comfortable. My husband is still raving about the heated mattress pad.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is very nice. The bathroom is huge and has its own little electric fireplace.
We loved the nice firm bed and the many amenities!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nan's place is conveniently located off I95. Very clean and beautiful amenities.
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is one of the best places we have stayed! The rooms were beautiful and well appointed with amenities. Nancy and Curt were extremely nice, and they were great hosts. The shower is huge and the linens were spectacular. Also, plenty of pillows and a great bed! We required some extra parking, and their space is large and secured with a gate. If in the area, we would definitely stay here again! This is great find along the I-95 corridor!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a wonderful stay at Nan's place. It was perfect for a short stay. I had an event at Dirtbag Ales right down the road and was very convenient.

I will certainly stay again!
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I could give 6 stars I would! Nan provided every thoughtful detail that could be offered, so many gracious touches.

2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nan’s place is fantastic - spotlessly clean and very comfortable! The bed was perhaps the most comfortable I’ve ever had at an air bnb and I loved all the pillow options. Breakfast was also great - you request in advance and bring $10 for it. A wonderful and relaxing stay!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was an absolutely wonderful experience & great space! Gave me the quiet time I was hoping for!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Unequivocally THE BEST Airbnb I’ve stayed in. There are super hostS and then there is Nan and Kurt’s place. It felt like a high end boutique room with an amazing personal art touch. The price was the deceiving part since we only expected a descent place to rest overnight during our final leg home, and we ended up in a place that was the best value one could wish for. I just can’t say how impressed and happy we were, not only at the accommodations, but also getting to meet the hosts. Our only regret was not being able to share more time with them."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Super friendly folks and a wonderful retreat for 1 or 2 guests! The breakfast option (ask the host) for $10 is highly recommended.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nan’s bnb was a great place to stop for a nite or two. Very relaxing and so much better than staying at a hotel. Very clean and you are away from the noise of the super highways. Definitely would stay again if I pass thru this way. Ok
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is super peaceful , nice and Mrs.Nan and husband are so nice. My husband and I absolutely loved the room and we were surprised that Mrs Nan made all the artwork on the walls. The room was very detailed in every way. Absolutely a 10 plus star gorgeous room. Thank you again we look forward in staying every time we go to North Carolina."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nan’s place was wonderful and all we hoped for. It was immaculate and so comfortable and peaceful. Nan and her husband were the perfect host. It was such an important weekend for us celebrating our granddaughter’s first birthday and they made it perfect
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was one of the nicest places we’ve ever stayed at. We were just passing through but wished we could have stayed longer!

Our hosts were personable and friendly.. the whole thing experience was a 10 out of 10 in my book. Worth every penny and then some for the peaceful rest we desperately needed after driving 8 hours. Thank you, Nan & Kurt for the coffee and delicious muffins to start our day. We look forward to a return visit!"
2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was our first Air B&B we have ever stayed at, and LOVED IT!
It was perfect. Nan & her husband did an amazing job at making us feel welcomed & comfortable.
The Room is cute. Has it's own entrance, bathroom & even a nice place outfront to sit and relax.
The bed is nice, comfy & cozy. The TV also had a fire stick which was perfect as we were winding down. Couldn't beat it.
The gardens at the house are beautiful & peaceful so make sure you spend some time outside.
We only needed 1 night as we were passing through, and it was PERFECT!
We stopped at a great brew house (Dirt Bags :) ) and also found an arcade/game center where you pay a cover & play air hockey, pool or a bunch of old school arcade style games. Even had a bar there.
Plenty of gas stations around to grab drinks & snacks.
Definitely worth staying there.

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Loved our stay at Nan’s - why would you ever stay at a hotel?? It was clean, so comfy and had everything we needed. Absolutely bookmarking this for any future needs! Thanks again Nan & her hubby!"
2021-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,this was a great airbnb for a quick overnight stay driving back from florida... very clean and comfortable. highly recommend!!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Sparkling clean and oh so neat! Loved it!
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nan’s place was great to stay at on a two-day trip from FL to NJ. The place is well-decorated and the bed is super comfy. Nan made me quiche and banana bread for breakfast and I got an early head start in the morning. My only criticism is that guests and I’m sure the hosts can hear each other, so it’s best to be quiet and maybe bring earplugs. However, the stay was just what I needed and would love to come back. 5 stars."
2021-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A perfect cozy place to rest and relax. My favorite was the natural lighting from the sun through the windows. Every little touch from the softest pillows to the large private bathroom made the stay feel that much more like home. Will definitely stay here again when given the chance!
2021-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We were very happy in this room and wished we could've stayed longer!
A lot of care and attention was put into the ambience of the room and property. The little thoughtful touches made the extra difference for the weary traveler! The bed is super comfortable, the host's homemade art is absolutely gorgeous, and the room includes everything you need for a long stay. overall feeling cozy in this little room and we'll definitely come back very soon! (For much longer this time)"

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and clean. Nothing but good things to say about Nan’s. Overall a very nice stay and highly recommended.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Absolutely loved our stay at Nan's. Great space inside and out. Pleasure meeting and talking to Nan. Great covid protocol. Convenient to I 95. Why stay at a chain hotel ? Nan's space is a great value. We followed Nan's suggestion and ate at Chef Glen's Diner. which provided good comfort food at very reasonable prices.
2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great hospitality, not too far from I95, super comfort (loved the mattress) and country vibe"

2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nan and her husband Kurt were wonderful hosts. Their place was perfect for an overnight stop. Recommend if your traveling the I-95 corridor in NC.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts and a cozy place!
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Nan & Kurt are awesome.. the place is exactly as described, the location is a bit out of Fayetteville town which I knew before hand. The place is very quiet, clean and was just what my partner and I needed for our visit to Fayetteville.
We slept in late, drove into town to meet up with friends and family, run errands and at nights we would return to a peaceful, quiet, cool, and private space. I would recommend this home to anyone, especially those traveling through NC it is right on the highway."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If you are in need of a great place to stay off of I-95 on the way down or back from the south - you definitely need to stay at Nan and Kurt’s place. Their place is prefect with great amenities!!! Nan’s garden kept my husband who loves to take picture of nature very busy.
FYI - make sure you pay the extra $$ to get the breakfast- so worth it. Very yummy."
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place to stay, had my own little patio and grounds have a beatiful garden of flowers-will be back-"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Started a new job coming from out of state and wanted a relaxing place to stay, has comfy bed, beatiful garden area, all I need with microwave, fridge, spacious bathroom- very clean and just 20 minitrs to hospital I'm working at-
Some fun art pieces handmade by the host-"
2020-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nan’s place was the most equipped stay I encountered. Quick response and quiet and clean atmosphere.
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nan was an amazing host! She's very personable, the place is beautiful inside and outside with lovely art work that she's made and designed. Her gardens are phenomenal with lots of flowers feeding the pollinators, butterflies and flitting about joyfully. The bed is amazingly comfortable, it's a special foam type mattress. Everything was exceptionally clean with lots of extras. We had breakfast made by Nan and it was a delicious quiche, homemade zucchini break and melon that she grew. It's a fantastic, magical place surrounded by farm land, and not terribly far off 95, so it was the perfect stop for me and my elderly mom. Her husband, Kurt, was also very nice even if he is a Steelers fan (haha)."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Such a beautiful suite for a really good price. The bathroom was super spacious, new, and beautiful and the bed was super comfy! Host was accommodating and kind."
2020-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"From the ease of booking and prompt response to questions before arrival made me comfortable. When I arrived and saw the Art Teacher's artist sign I let ought a sigh and new I was in the right place. Plenty of parking and my private entrance was in the front of the home. My private patio was surrounded by lush gardening and water garden thing. When I opened the front door I was speechless. I could almost cry, the decor was so inviting, art work decorated the walls, fresh flowers from the garden on the table along with homemade zucchini bread. The furniture was even hand painted with beautiful floral designs. The antique furnishing and personal touches were so outstanding I was afraid to but my stuff on anything. The amenities were selected with the same personal attention to detail. There was plenty of everything, coffee, tea, water, snacks, reading materials, towels, toiletries, etc. Nan and her husband are so quite I almost forgot they were here. I will return just to relax. Nan's place is close enough to everything with just a few turns to a quite, lush green friendly neighborhood where we stay. I enjoyed riding my bike 6 miles through the neighborhood. And last but not least, the mattress made me feel like I was laying on a cloud, it was firm but not hard, soft but not sinking. As you see I cannot say enough about Nan's place. The price for all these GREATNESS is far below value. I would pay twice as much to stay here. I hope you read it all and stay at Nan's soon. Better hurry she stays booked up. I was blessed with a cancelation which enabled me to extend my stay. I enjoyed my week!!!"

Everything you need is there including coffeemaker, well water, mini-fridge, microwave, toaster oven, and TV."
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Simply stunning. It was magical pulling up at night with all the lights lit for Xmas and probably one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Felt like a true home away from home. Very roomy and comfortable despite us not being there too long. The outdoor space was also gorgeous. Nan even left us muffins Saturday at our doorstep since we had left early in the day to get to event we had to go too. One of the most welcoming and comforting Airbnb's i've ever stayed in.
2019-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice place. Super comfy bed and the room and bathroom are very clean and well thought out. Nice touches everywhere and really makes you feel like you’re at home.

We met Kurt during our stay and he was happy to provide us with local tips on things to do and where to eat. Overall this was one of our best AirBnb experiences. Next time we are in Fayetteville we know where to stay again."

Perfect stay, doesn’t get any better than Nan’s!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great weekend stay here. Extremely peaceful and quiet. The bed was so comfortable and the entire place is extremely clean.

Nan""s place was a perfect stop and stay on my trip.
The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. A large full bathroom attached to a decent sized bedroom. Nan and Kurt born introduced themselves, and were gracious hosts. The location of the unit is close to 95, yet in a quiet area surrounded by farms. The outdoor area is landscaped and gardened nicely.
I highly recommended this place to single or couple travelers. I will visit again if i an in the Fayetteville, Fort Bragg area.
Thank you for an awesome stay.

2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nan’s place is beautiful from her gardens outside to the touches inside. The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was delicious!
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This Airbnb is a gem! It is immaculate, comfortable, quiet and peaceful. It is out in the country but not too far off the beaten path. Bed was comfy, pillows were fluffy and plentiful. No problem with WiFi or cable. Don’t expect to find nightlife or five star dining in the area but you won’t have to starve. It was just perfect. Bath was very well appointed and towels, soaps etc. were plentiful and the bath was roomy just as the bedroom was. In the morning we dinned on Nan’s home made muffins at the table with her flowers as a perfect touch. Nan and Kurt were perfect hosts and we would not hesitate to stay with them again."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This is a real gem! Nan’s place rates 5 stars across the board for us.
It’s conveniently located off of I-95. Nan’s attention to detail in decoration and cleanliness was excellent. The mattress was very comfortable and there was even a note posted with information on what brand it was and the benefits. Coffee/ tea, WiFi, mini fridge with some homemade treats to welcome us were only some of the lovely amenities Nan provided.
Beautiful property, quiet and peaceful place to stay! Simple and clear check in/out procedures. Great communication. Highly recommend staying here."
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Nan's place was a wonderful and much needed Oasis, that helped break up our long 8 hour commute as we made our way to South Carolina. As this was a midpoint destination, both to and from SC, check in time was pretty late at night. Nan does a good job of clarifying the rules for check in and was very accommodating to our unusual schedule. As for the home, it was decorated beautifully and smelled lovely! We felt that we had absolutely everything we needed for our stay- from a morning cup of coffee to shower supplies. We would definitely book again!"
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"When you arrive at Nan's, you will find the space just as advertised! In addition there are the special touches of original artwork decorating the walls, towels in several sizes and a bed full of pillows that makes watching TV a dream. She has everything that you will need including powdered coffee creamer or milk...whichever you prefer, microwave, minifridge and an Amazon Fire stick with options galore for your TV viewing. Her gardens are amazing and a peaceful place in which to wander after a long day of traveling. I also really enjoyed the private patio area at sunset where we could listen to the birds and enjoy the peace of a home in the country."
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Truly a wonderful place. Beautiful walkable garden with discreet benches overlooking a farm field that is large by NC standards and bracketed by dense woods. The breakfast service mentioned in the profile is well worth pursuing; ours were savory egg pastries with soft muffins and berries and were very tasty. The bed is large and comfortable, there is a TV with a number of streaming services and even internet access built in with a keyboard remote control, and a fridge, microwave and toaster oven. I have to give special praise to the bathroom as well; it’s put together so well it’s an atmospheric work of art with elegant furnishings, various shades of soothing blue and white, a very pleasant lavender smell, and a brewing station with coffee and tea stored in earthenware pots. Lastly the couple who owns this place are very friendly, helpful and accommodating."

2019-05-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Affordable price, clean room and bathroom. Close to I-95. Only issue was the comfort of the mattress. It was a queen but felt like a twin as it sloped inward and we were in each others space all night.
Landscaping was beautiful and it felt like a home away from home."
2019-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The house and the room is very beautiful and very clean. There is everything inside the room, very amazing. Nan is very understanding and helpful when I need help. Love this place a lot.

Thanks for everything!

2019-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Wonderful overnight stay in a secluded quiet setting. Very easy on/off of 95, plenty of parking, well lit surroundings, easy to enter even at night. Once inside it is a serene calming space with a small kitchenette area, with a fridge/freezer combo, coffee pot, toaster oven, large tv, comfortable queen bed, each bedside table had electric cord strips for charging etc. and a small dinette to work/eat at. The bathroom was very large and clean. There was an electric fireplace that produced a lovely warmth in the bathroom. Toiletries thoughtfully provided, plenty of towels and washcloths.

2019-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"You will not be disappointed!
I only had the opportunity to stay with Nan for one night, but it was one of the best stays that I've had, and I get the opportunity to stay at a lot of Airbnbs.
The location is off the beaten track but I loved that I was in the country and it was so quiet. The room was very tastefully decorated and comfortable, especially the bed.
A huge plus for me was the bigger than usual fridge in the room and a toaster oven (I don't do microwaves), loved that!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for 5 days, although not much to do in town it was beautiful weather to just sit outside and watch the farmers work the fields just past the back yard. We were glad the air conditioning worked so good as it was in the 80’s during the day."

2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,3 bedroom 2 bathroom home in nice dead-end street. Beds were comfy & clean. Plenty of towels and washcloths. Also liked how the living room was closed off with its own door allowing for a ‘4th’ bedroom (couch) if needed.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Thanks for your home
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This rental was a Godsend in our need of a quick place to stay for the weekend. Clean, spacious and modern amenities. Very nicely decorated with a new smart TV in Master BR. Plenty of towels was a blessing. As well as complementary shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the bathroom. Owners were super accommodating for our unusual situation. 10/10, would recommend to anyone."
2023-12-01,5.0,Group trip,Lovely home! Smelled amazing & I felt right at home! Thank you guys!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,lots of space in the house and the hosts were thoughtful. my only suggestion would be to have at least one more television. but overall it was a great stay
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,My kids and I had a fantastic stay at the cottage. The home was quiet and in a private location. The community is small and friendly and provides enough amenities to service any needs you may have. The home is extremely comfortable and very welcoming. The hosts are extremely responsive and friendly!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fantastic hosts. Nice peaceful location and the home was very welcoming. Definitely recommend and will stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"William was a very responsive and quick communicator. He accomodated my last minute booking literally the minute I reached out.
Very very clear instructions to get inside, absolutely IMMACULATE, CLEAN, TIDY, did I mention IMMACULATE and CLEAN?!!!! Definitely appeared as if the house was cleaned by a proffesional.
Easy to find and good location close to downtown and main roads.
The backyard and deck were really great spots to relax and walk around to stretch my legs after travelling.
The house itself was much bigger than I thought it would be. There was plenty of space to relax and be comofortable for several people. And the Master Bath is insane. Big enough to be a 3rd bedroom..... and the coolest and biggest jacuzzi bath tub.
I will 100 percent stay here again and again on my half way point driving down to SC.
William and his place are outstanding! :-)"
2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very home like. Didn't want for anything.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This a a great house for short stay off Route 95. The double jacuzzi is just what the doctor ordered after a day on the highway. Once inside the house, all your baggage falls to the floor and rest is found there."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Had a little glitch at the beginning but William was right on it. Great host. Would definitely stay again
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay. Hope to return next year.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place. Very clean. Awesome tvs. Hot tub. Well equipped. Nice older home. Dogs are not that bad.....and I'm annoyed pretty easily!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We came to attend our granddaughters wedding in Rowland. We were able to have our other children and family visit with us at the B&B and ""reunite"" for the afternoon before the wedding.
Everyone was very comfortable and enjoyed our private time together. The beds were very comfortable and we were able to relax and enjoy our time at the B&B."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful visit and will do so again while traveling. Convenient and perfect…especially when traveling with a dog.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great place to stay for a night on your way to Florida. Some reviews confused me saying about the smell and bugs but we have not experienced anything like that. Feel free to rent it out, great for the price"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Decent place for an overnight stop. Older house with a somewhat fenced-in back yard. It's fenced, but I would not let a pet out without supervision because they could possibly get out. Neighborhood felt safe and was quiet except for the incessant barking of the neighbor's dog all night - not William's fault and nothing he can do about that."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Met all our needs for our short stay and William was very responsive if we needed anything. 😁
2024-04-01,5.0,Group trip,Great place
2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"To be honest I wish it was disclosed exactly what a work in progress this house is. It was dingy, sparsely furnished and had several areas in need of repair. The gate you enter to access the house is falling apart. The deck was saggy and uneven. The thresholds to all the rooms are uneven (not an issue for adults but with little kids is a major trip hazard). The bedrooms don’t have bedside tables for placing any electronics on and the electric outlets are hidden behind the beds. We had to use an extension cord we happened to have with us to plug in a sound machine for our kids. There is a noticeable musty odor in the house. Luckily we were only there for a quick one night stop on our travels. If we had planned on being there longer we would have looked elsewhere after night one. We arrived after dark and it was hard to access the lockbox with no exterior lighting. There were no linens for the couch bed in the living room and a stain on the couch."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I have stayed here a few times, host is extremely responsive and the house is always clean- Thank you William!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,very comfortable and felt like home!
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a quick stopover driving back home and it was good.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,easy check-in and check-out. home was as described. Thank you
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a nice stay in for a night as we were passing through. We had a bit of trouble looking for the key until we actually looked at the door instead of looking around 😂 Besides that, it was a nice place to stay with snacks and drinks available. We even arrived quite late but the place was still available for us to get in. Really appreciated that. The home was comfortable and spacious. Definitely recommend and plan to stay again if I ever have a trip and we pass by again."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This was our first time staying, but hopefully it won't be our last. Very clean and conveniently located home. Perfect halfway stop for us and our pets during our travel between PA & FL."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great communication and help
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great place!
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"William's place was perfect for us traveling from PA to Florida. the beds were super comfortable, lots of pillows, spa tub was great. very nice place, I would stay again if I'm in the area. thank you."
2024-03-01,2.0,Stayed with a pet,"I rented Williams home for one night on a long road trip with my Dad and younger siblings. William himself was very sweet and responsive. The place was clean for what it could be, it was just the smell of every room that was very unpleasant. It either smelt like feet, mildew or animals. I also woke up with a swollen hand from multiple mysterious bug bites.
Every home around had left their barking dogs outside, so trying to get a very needed good nights rest was out of the picture. Their outside patio was beautiful and the tub is huge but it has a sink faucet as the water spout so good luck for anyone trying to use it.
I feel terrible making a post like this but I was very uncomfortable. My sister has serious allergies and immediately couldn't breathe when we walked in. Nothing against William, he was a great host. It was just the house itself. You can tell they did their best to keep it as clean as they could but it was not worth the price we paid."
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed one night,happy to have stopped by here for our road trip
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,It was an affordable and clean place to spend the night!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We quickly needed a place to stay and I love the Airbnb community, it was easy. And after being in a car for 11 hrs it was lovely to spread out, we each had our own bedroom & bathroom!! So fabulous!"
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,Comfortable for a night with our family while on a roadtrip.
2024-01-01,4.0,Group trip,Williams house was great! we had plenty of space and was able to use the kitchen to cook nicely as well! the jacuzzi was smaller than expected and took some time to fill up but was otherwise excellent!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,You are!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,William's place was a great stay. It was pretty cozy and had a very nice bathroom and tub! Absolutely loved it!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great place hometown America well lit backyard cozy bedroom great showers. Cool kitchen TVs. Good parking close to I 95 beautiful fenced in backyard. Nice front porch view and overall very cozy.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,It was so clean! Very comfortable beds! Everything was there to do laundry!!!!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"stayed here several times, and I enjoyed it each and every time. William is a great host and I love this spot!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great little spot, as described and William was very responsive!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We stopped at Willams place on our trip down to Florida and the location couldn't have been more convenient. He was also very flexible when we had some car troubles and let us have a later check out than originally scheduled.
2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great place to stop during a road trip. We chose it so our dogs could play and run around in the yard, nevertheless, there were multiple big holes in the fence which meant the dogs couldn't run. It would have been nice to know that in advance."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"5 stars, perfect and cozy. I have stayed here before, as well as I will stay here again!! Thank you for being a great host, and for keeping such a clean and comfortable place!"
2023-12-01,3.0,Stayed with a pet,"Although it's a good halfway point to stop between Florida and New York, the house just kind of smelt a little...damp and doggy. I checked in with my little dog and the neighbors all had (very loud) dogs, but inside the house smelt very much like dirty dogs. I will say the bathroom was very clean and the kitchen items were clean. However, the carpet in the bedroom did have a smell and some stains. I would at least wear socks at all times in the bedroom. Overall it was a very pleasant experience, just not the cleanest place."
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Overall, this was a great budget stay, and I WOULD RECOMMEND. 5 star host, 3-4 star house and location, and not because of a bad experience, but just because that's what this area is. The house was exactly as described, and the host was friendly and helpful. Here are the details:
Property: The back fence has some holes in it that open to the neighbors, and while the host has them blocked off, we didn't feel comfortable letting our dogs out unsupervised or without harnesses. The house is very clean! The beds were comfortable, and it seemed to have everything needed. You won't be wowed, but you'll be taken care of.
Location: The neighborhood isn't the best ever, but it's also very standard for this area of North Carolina, so that's hard to rate fairly.
Noise Levels: We stayed on Christmas Eve. Turns out Christmas Eve is a firework and gun shooting holiday, so it was noisy all night. There are a few neighboring dogs that bark pretty consistently as well."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,second time staying here and loved it!!! we'll be back for sure!!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"1000% will be booking again everytime that I'm in Lumberton. Myself and 2 kids was only there for a 1 night stay, and it didn't take more than 10 mins to bring in our bags, order doordash and curl up to watch a movie with my kids comfortably and felt safe."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,William’s place is spotless and comfortable. Easy access to good restaurants and not far off I-95.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"If I ever find myself in the area, I would stay again"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very clean home! We appreciated the yard very much. Plenty of room for our family, comfortable, and has all of the basic kitchen utensils."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I had issues with the lock box but William was extremely helpful and responded immediately after I had messaged him about the issue! The jacuzzi tub was so relaxing, and the tvs in the bedroom were great for playing rain sounds and lullabies for myself and my children while we slept!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This house is perfect if you are looking for somewhere to stay that isn’t a hotel off 95. The house is cute and easy to find. William left chilled bottled water in the fridge and some snack bars. Much appreciated. I booked this for a road trip between FL and VA.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Clean, private setting. Responsive host. I loved the convience of the location for our trip to Florida"
2023-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"Perfect for our group of 5 on our way back from Orlando, the hot tub was well needed! Thank you William!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great stay as a midpoint between NJ and FL. Very comfortable and easy to find. We hope it is available every year.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place! Very clean
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great stay….always a pleasure and worth the wait.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"I booked an overnight stay at William’s place for my husband who was traveling from Virginia to Florida after work to pick me up in Florida. This was the perfect stop for him to rest, and only a few minutes off of I-95. William is a fantastic host and even provided bottled water and lots of snacks. Check in instructions were very easy. My husband had a very peaceful, overnight stay. The bed was very comfortable, and the place was very spacious and nicely decorated, and spotlessly clean. Would definitely book another stay here."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,👍🏼👍🏼
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Really nice place I wish we would have gottwn to enjoy it more but we got in at 2am and were back on the road the next morning. Really appreciated the communication and that they allow pets!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Great location for rest stop. The area is quite quiet. I was traveling with my family from West Palm Beach to New Jersey and is just halfway there. William was a great host and was looking out for our arrival. The next day he allowed us to stay a little longer to rest from the trip. The house is cozy and very beautiful. Everything perfect and would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Easy to get to and very clean. I would stay again
2023-09-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,Everything was ok until the jacuzzi didn't workthe dogs was barking all night didn't have much linens
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The house will be great when they are all done fixing it up. The beds were comfy, bathrooms were clean and he even left us water and snacks. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and I’m told by local friends it is the safer side to stay at."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying at Williams' place. it was cozy and comfortable and was made to feel very welcomed. it's always very difficult when you have dogs with you that you've trained to be respectable when in a new environment and so they are very well behaved and when trying to break the stigma other pet parents have placed on hosts is challenging. especially when those other pet parents don't follow the same principles as we have with our dogs. Although William was very accommodating to our 4 well-behaved fur babies. not to mention the home was extremely clean and well organized, and I also loved the jacuzzi tub!"
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,As advertised. Clean and comfortable
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"As it was described in listing, it is a work in progress in appearance. It could use some cheering up. However, all in all it was a comfortable 1 night stay And we will use again and recommend to our family members who travel North on occasion."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I chose Williams place because I make frequent trips to NC and wanted to stay somewhere other than the local hotels. The house was located about 10 mins away from family and in the vacinity of various restaurants/stores. The neighborhod has more of a city feel as opposed to a country one but it was extremely quiet and felt very safe. The house is old, but that fact is stated clearly in the description and it felt very much like home. The pictures are accurate, William provided an ample amount of supplies (cleaning, toiletries, linens, towels), and the place was clean. The beds were extremely comfy and it was easy to find something entertaining to watch on television. I was a fan of the master bathroom because not only was it huge, it contained the infamous jacuzzi tub which is quite relaxing as long as you dont run the water too hot. William was also very responsive to all the questions and concerns that we had during our stay. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and would recommend it."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a great time. The community is quite, the home is clean, and very easy to find. This was a great find. Five Stars!!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had an amazing experience at William’s air bnb! The house was just as lovely as the photos and there were snacks and refreshments in the fridge for us when we arrived. The beds were comfy, the jacuzzi tub was my kid’s favorite part and the smart tv’s in each bedroom kept the entire family happy. Highly recommend staying with William!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Loved it☺️
2023-08-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Was what we needed for a quick overnight stay to break up the trip to Florida. The house smelled a touch musty and seemed a bit damp. Other than that it was fine.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"William was great! He kept in touch even before I arrived. I was only staying one night, quick stop over on a long trip but the place was very clean, comfortable and there was everything you’d need. The jacuzzi tub was the best, so relaxing after a long drive.
The house does seem to be a “work in process” as he states in his ad. It’s a diamond in the rough, a few finishing touches are all that’s needed. Not overpriced…highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Thanks William for good communication everything worked out wonderful
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We loved the little neighborhood this clean sweet home was located in. The outdoor shower was a neat find along with the mens outdoor potty house! We enjoyed the hot tub after a 6 hour drive. We would definitely stay again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful and peaceful stay in an entire home. Dogs loved the fenced yard. Nice patio to grill some hotdogs out on in the evening.

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,William’s house was a perfect stop off after a long day of driving from Florida to DC. The snacks and water left for us were a very pleasant surprise and that jacuzzi hot tub was not an exaggeration in other reviews! William was friendly and responsive. Recommend!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The place was exactly what I expected. We were driving to Florida on the 95, and we needed a place where we could let our dogs outside to run around after a long drive. We weren't looking for luxury, just a clean place to sleep. It was fine"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great host! Replies so fast as well. He had a very clean place, the AC was great ! comfy bed and super cute home"

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Are you planning a long day of driving? Thinking about stopping anywhere near Lumberton? STAY HERE!
The jacuzzi bathtub alone is worth the stop. It comfortably fits 2 people!

Also, beds are comfy, neighborhood is quiet, and the rest of the house is quaint and well appointed.
Stay here, you’ll love it."

Overall, we were very happy with the home and will stay here again."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Our two night stay was very relaxing and comfortable. The house is small but it definitely gives the you’re at home feeling.

We’ll definitely be staying at Williams’s house again when we are in the area.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute house and easy checkin and check out. Comfy beds. The huge jacuzzi tub sets this one aside from any others in the area, we loved that for our romantic quiet get away from the kids quiet weekend together.

The house is clean and comfortable. Usually I don’t like beds in motels and at some Airbnb but here I was able to sleep nicely. Beds are clean and very comfy.
The host William is very helpful and great with communication. We landed early so William arranged for early check in too.
I recommend staying at this location if you are looking for comfortable and relaxing stay and a great host.

With two pups and two kiddos, a hotel wasn’t feasible. William replied quickly with accommodations in this lovely bungalow. Fenced in yard for the dogs, and a huge tub for the kids to enjoy. The small touches provided by the host (cold bottled water, granola bars, coffee, shampoo and soaps) was very much appreciated considering the circumstances. 10/10 all around."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place and the host were so awesome! The space is very clean, very comfortable and in a great location. But if I'm being honest, it's the jacuzzi tub I loved the most. Looking forward to the next visit."

I got lucky when I found this gem in Lumberton! Two full bedrooms and two full baths with a luxurious hot tub in the huge Master Bath to soak away your worries!
William has thought of everything in this charming WHOLE HOUSE offer! Full-sized refrigerator and stove, microwave, Keurig full-sized AND pod coffee maker, everything you need to feel right at home! There is a quaint little back deck and backyard area, perfect for grilling, and private parking off the street so you can feel safe with your car and belongings.
I couldn't be happier with my experience in this house. William was available and easy to work with from the very beginning, and thanks to his navigation, my whole experience was a smooth and pleasant one. I would definitely stay with William again."

Everything was amazing"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for us while we attended an event at the Southeastern Ag Center! Just right down the road. Jaywan was a great host from a clean place to being sure we had everything we needed and very responsive.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,In town for work and this was the perfect location
2024-02-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The description was a little bit deceiving as we thought we were renting a modular not a single wife mobile home. Maybe that’s a different talk down south from us up north but it was cozy. Jay was very responsive to help us with check in. We were very last minute booking so it was great to find a place. Water was hot and the washer and dryer were wonderful.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,To say it was 5 stars was a bit of an overstatement. Jaywan was very responsive and was great. However the room was a little bit different. The first night one of the beds broke and had to contact him to come fix it the next day. The next day the repair man came while we were out and locked the door wrong and we were stuck outside for about an hour. This is the only time Jaywan had been unresponsive to me. Finally we got inside. The room was nice. It was basically as described. Not as stocked as it may have seemed online but that’s okay. Thankfully we brought everything with us. It was an okay experience.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was amazing. Everything you needed for the family. Great beds, plenty of space for a large number. I would highly recommend this place for a vacation. Will definitely rent again."

2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the second place that I’ve stayed with this host. My only complaint if I have one is it’s on the main road and it’s really not that bad.
2023-01-01,5.0,Group trip,this place was amazing he went above and beyond thank you so much
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great host!! Will be staying again.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Rented as an out of town stay for a business project. Great place for us. Massive industrial parking lot across the street accommodated us very well. Will definitely consider again if we find ourselves working in that area.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed my stay, lovely and comfortable home. My stay was 15 minutes or less to our main locations.
Ever in Lumberton, this is a 5-Star stay❣️ The host was very accommodating and great❣️"

2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was amazing! From the moment we step through the front door we felt calm and peaceful.

2022-07-01,5.0,Group trip,"Jaywan, thank you for the amazing hospitality! We loved staying at your BNB, the home was extremely clean and was more than we expected in such a rural area! Thank you for always staying in contact with us."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Myself & well as some of my church family stayed at Jay's AirBnb. Jay was very responsive, understanding and accomodating from the initial conversations about the stay and throughout when questions arised. The home was very spacious, clean and beautiful. Our children had more than enough space to run outside and play. The House wasn't to far in location from Walmart and other eateries. Jay was even compassionate when it was brought to his attention that some of our family was in an accident while there and that we needed to check out at 11am instead of 10 due to train scheduling. Jay is an excellent host or cares not only about his property but his guest! We would definitely stay again and refer him to others."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"First let me say that I’m originally from Lumberton and was really surprised to see an Airbnb in the area but especially one this nice. I’ve never stayed in a mobile home before and trust me it looks nothing like the outside or the surroundings.
It’s located across the street from a discount warehouse and right off the highway. It was raining when we arrived and the host was kind enough to not only inquire if we made it in town safely but also remotely unlocked the door so we didn’t have to fumble with the remote lock. I would definitely recommend downloading the August app for easy keyless access to this space.
The accommodations were just as pictured, smelled nice and it was very clean. It was moderately/very well appointed with updated appliances, full cookware and baking set, flatware and dishes. A Keurig (with the latte and cappuccino maker), creamer, sugar and various k-cup pods were also available. I wished there was a measuring spoon/cup set because I actually did cook.
There was a grill on the back patio with furniture but we didn’t use it due to the rain. Speaking of, please note that there is no paved parking, just grass (or mud if it’s raining). Also the main bedroom is on the side closest to the main road so if you are a light sleeper you may be very aware of cars driving by at night. I would definitely stay here again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great home, exactly how it was pictured! Would definitely stay again!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was great and the place was super clean. I would definitely book this in the future!

2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"I see why Jaywan is super host and this little hideaway is super comfy and cozy!
Thanks to the Nest air system and nice mattresses we all slept comfortably at night and were perfectly warm/cool during the day. Found everything we needed in the kitchen and baths. The oversized state of the art washer and dryer were also a treat when my son spilled salad dressing on his only jacket.
Jaywan was the perfect host. He Splurged on multiple (4) TVs and all the premium TV channels. My kids and dad were in heaven. Actually so was I. Most ABNBs only have 2 TVs and only a few channel choices. During our down time, having all of these viewing options plus the Wi-Fi is a real luxury. We were really pleasantly surprised. My kids are usually constantly negotiating for the tv during the entire vaca, here it is not an issue. THANKS 🙏🏽!!! Jaywan said He wanted his guests to be just as comfortable away from home as he is when he’s at home. So he provides Disney Plus, HBO Max, Starz , Cinemax, Hulu Peacock. Prime. Paramount plus, Netflix. Movie night was a treat!!!!"

The apartment had everything we needed for our brief stay, and was comfortable and clean, with cheerful decor, and we could see it would be great for a longer stay. We'll definitely keep Arleen's place in mind for future trips!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for us!! We loved the quiet neighborhood, the pond and the convenient location! We were traveling home to Florida and this was a great stop for a long weekend before home. It was not far from the interstate and not too far to get into Fayetteville. Great homemade to enjoy the Cape Fear Botanical Garden and the Cape Fear River Trail. The place was cute and nicely decorated. Arleen thought of everything including a well stocked kitchen complete with what we needed for cooking and the snacks were a very nice touch! We really appreciated the fresh eggs too!!
As folks who routinely travel I-95, we’ll favorite this place!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Outstanding airbnb. Lovely huge apt with any amenity you can imagine. Squeaky clean. I came way late, unexpectedly, and my host kept the floodlights on for me -- very helpful bc it is a rural road, very dark at night.
I had the plessure of briefly meeting Arleen's mom, who was wonderful. BIG five stars!!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Was a perfect stop. Nicely decorated. Clean.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This was a Great day, one of my favorites. It was dressed for the holiday, which was pleasant. Beautiful outside surroundings. Getting in was super easy, and everything was newly remodeled, extremely clean. The kitchen and bathroom were exquisite. Comfortable bed and bedding. Lots of towels. You could tell that they put a lot of thought into the comfortability of their guest. If you have forgotten anything, I’m sure that they have it from spices to cook with, to not having a toothbrush, body soap, shower, cap, little chocolates, and after dinner mints, a continental breakfast offered extremely thoughtful little details."

Super clean, beautiful and has everything you will ever need. Didn't even have to unpack our toiletry supplies, as the bathroom is well stocked with anything you need. This makes it super fantastic when you are only staying a night to rest up for the rest of the journey home. Even fresh eggs in the refrigerator for the next morning's breakfast. What a treat after eating powdered eggs for nearly two weeks at a hotel. Do not hesitate to book this Airbnb. You will not be disappointed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Arleen’s cottage was perfect for our midway stop between Florida and Virginia. It’s a very private location and we didn’t feel like we were annoying anyone with our late arrival and early check out.

All the information we needed was provided. When I had issues with the door code Mr. Michael was quick to help. This place is just perfect! Extremely clean and cozy. Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. You can tell their heart went into making this place feel just like home. The bed is comfortable, bathroom is excellent (I loved the shower) and location is incredible & peaceful.
The weekend was comfortable and memorable.
Thanks for a wonderful weekend!"

Things that I love when I rent an AB&B
Kitchen or bathroom hand soap that smells good
Toilet paper that’s not cheap
Plenty of towels and wash cloths
Soft bed and pillows
This had all the above."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"absolutely charming. set back in a private setting. the details were insane. the easiest check in/out ever.
bed was comfy !! kitchen was stocked. 10 out of 10 would recommend..... this was one of the best airbnb I've ever been too."
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was absolutely beautiful. All the amenities were well thought out. You do feel right at home. Bed was super comfy!
Here are my concerns: 1) Chickens/rooster waking you up early (which is mentioned in the Airbnb description) it just happened for long periods of time in the mornings. 2) Co-host Mark was unfriendly in his responses about checking in earlier. The reviews showed that some guests were accommodated. I understand cleaning the rental for the next guest, but don’t say I can check-in early then switch back and change your mind then switch again. It was a lot of unnecessary back and forth. However, Arleen was able to work it all out. 3) Get back to your Airbnb before dark. I got back to the place around 10:30pm and it was super dark and creepy. I heard singing sounds in the woods and was completely terrified."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very cute space. I loved the idea of a tiny apartment!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"What a wonderful stay! Everything you could need, plus so much more! The attention to detail was above and beyond, we were so thankful after our 10-hour day on the road to have a safe and comfortable place to stay. Thank you so much!"

A perfect place to reflect, relax and remind oneself of what is important in life. Arleen is a super host."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"So friendly and helpful when it came to making accommodations. My boyfriend and I were running late because of weather and ended up in town at 5 am, way too late to check into our Air B&B we previously booked. She was kind enough to let us check in early. The place was incredibly clean and quiet. Being from the country, I appreciated being away from the city. I visit frequently because of boyfriend at Ft. Bragg, this is the fourth Air B&B I’ve used and by far the best. I wish I would have seen this one before to save myself the hassle. Thank you so much for being so helpful."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Arleen's place was a choice almost last-minute find on our road trip from Florida to Virginia after Thanksgiving. We weren't sure until just a few days before where our road trip route would go or where we'd want to stop. Once we figured that out, a search for hotel lodging turned up few options. Arleen's offer on AirBNB was more than competitive with area hotels, and no downtown hotel can provide what Arleen has built here - a true home away from home, sparkling clean, with a full kitchen and a full-sized fridge (very important for hauling home all those extra leftovers!) , and plenty of space to relax and unwind in a quiet area not far from the highway. She also provides very comfortable sleeping arrangements, and thoughtful extras like light snacks and keurig pods to get you fueled up for your mornings. Arleen was very responsive to questions, We would definitely stay here again next year, without a second thought!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a quick but great experience at this little bungalow! Great “country” setting, very clean, private and comfortable! It was the perfect location to stop (just off 95) for our trip to FL. We would definitely stay again if traveling in the area!"

Cozy place with a surprisingly roomy kitchen and shower. The great selection of premium TV channels was a nice guilty pleasure after the long days of training I was doing in Fayetteville. Incredibly quick communication: After a check-engine light came on Sunday night, I sent a message to Arleen asking if they knew much about cars. Within two minutes Mark called to say he would call their mechanic in the morning. He did and got me the information I needed! Like so many other reviews, I wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb."

I only stayed one night for work and was surprised for the quick turn around. A little out of the way, if you’re looking for some good food but there were restaurants with 15 minutes.
Only negative was the TV In living room was very slow for streaming. I didn’t connect my laptop because of this but got some much needed rest.
Also, I forgot toothpaste and there wasn’t any available but Arleen definitely had all the other personal hygiene, toiletries and normal household items available.
Definitely recommended for personal or business travel."

The space is large and filled with small touches that make it feel more than just a space to rest, you can truly tell that her and the co-host care for their guests and want them to feel like they’re home.

This quaint home was tucked down a country road and sat on a well manicured private lot. Front porch was so inviting and Jaywan provided a beautiful new patio set with matching cushions and pillows. Ooh:.:we used the gas grill at least 1-2 days a week. The home was furnished like those homes on HGTV. So impressed! Kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, dishes, glasses and every utensil known to man. Jaywan’s place has everything you need, a home away from home. Just brings your clothes and a toothbrush!! I 100% recommended staying with Jaywan."

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family of 4 had a great stay at Jaywan’s cottage! We were in town for Thanksgiving and also took a day trip into Fort Bragg.
Jaywan was very communicative and though we didn’t need to reach out for any issues, when we did to ask questions he was quick to respond. The cottage was comfortable and home-y, and the bedsheets were INCREDIBLY soft; hands down the most comfortable bedding I’ve slept in, so that was really a treat.
The ONLY con, was none of the interior doors click shut, let alone lock. I would have liked a little more security in my sense of privacy, but I was staying with my husband and children so there wasn’t really an issue of privacy violations and the doors didn’t really negatively impact our stay.
That’s the worst I could say about the cottage. Everything else including Jaywan was great."

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Retas place was an excellent facility to enjoy our overnight stay on our journey back home to Nova Scotia.
Fred and Reta are indeed super hosts."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is an adorable tiny home on a beautiful property and was a convenient, pet-friendly stay during our travels! Reta is very friendly and accommodating and responded quickly to our questions! Clean and roomy even with two small dogs. Amazing shower with a wrap-around door and great water pressure. We were very happy with our overnight stay with the exception that I just did not find the full-size, pull-out bed to be comfortable. :( (Note: My partner said he was comfortable, but I felt like I was sleeping on a rock.) Most reviewers don’t mention the bed - noting for those who need more comfort. Hope an improvement is made on the mattress/bed. Would love to stay again. Everything else is 10/10!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I HIGHLY recommend this place! Tucked away in a quiet space full of beautiful scenery, the interior is all wooden and has all the necessary comforts anyone could ever need for a convenient stay.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a perfect little stay! I was traveling on 95 from MD to SC and this was the perfect halfway point. Peaceful and cozy. Loved the thoughtful and welcoming touches (snacks, coffee, etc)"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Reta’s tiny home suited our purpose perfectly. We were traveling by car and needed a place to sleep for us and our dog. It was the perfect stop so close to the highway yet in a beautiful and private setting. Way better than a chain hotel. We will utilize her tiny home again in the future should we drive the east coast again. Maybe next time we will have the time to enjoy walks on the beautiful property. And thank you Reta for the prompt communication and the delicious cookies and hot chocolate!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet and relaxing spot. I would definitely recommend.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I'm so grateful I was able to stay both nights on my road trip between NJ and FL. It's literally the perfect halfway point to stop and rest and I'm so glad that the puppy is allowed.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay at Reta’s. It was an overnight stop on our way to FL. The property was conveniently located off of I95. The tiny house was beautiful and was a great alternative to staying in a hotel as we were traveling with our dog. The property had a lovely walking trail and with the flowers in bloom was truly a lovely setting. Reta was very helpful and friendly and I enjoyed talking with her. I would recommend this property and would consider booking again in the future.
2024-03-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful stay, will be back!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a great and comfortable place to stay the night on my trip to visit family. I'm so grateful for Reta's warmth and the welcome for me and my puppy.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Reta's Tiny Farm House was wonderful. The location was very convenient to I-95, and the perfect place to stop for a night as we headed farther south.
Reta was a terrific communicator, and everything was clean and ready for us upon arrival. It's a small space, but exactly as described and perfect for the two of us to get some rest after a long day on the road. The cookies and other drinks/snacks provided were a nice bonus!
I would definitely stay at Reta's place in the future, especially for the value and quiet surroundings."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A location where I felt safe, accommodated and was more than a guest. Quiet, family friendly, and great for morning runs or walks."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Such a hidden little gem! Needed somewhere to stay overnight to break up our roadtrip from Florida to Maryland. Reta was welcoming and we appreciate that we were able to bring our German Shepherd, Dax. The inside was clean and quaint. The outside was picturesque at sunrise. Beautiful and peaceful walking around the property. We will definitely stay here again on our next roadtrip!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Booked the stay for my husband for a night out solo for him as a ""cabin"" birthday experience for his birthday near our home in eastover.

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is perfect for rekindling and refocusing. It literally is a home away from home and this was our second time! We love this place and the aura it brings. Reta was so nice and understanding! She’s extremely responsive. Made us feel welcomed ! If you get the chance to stay here, take a break from the tv and the phones and relax; they have created a space designated to feeling cozy and relaxing. It’s absolutely worth the pay! Thanks again for such an amazing home!"

I highly recommend this air b&b."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Reta's place was cute and comfy! The tiny home was easy to find and very close off 95.

The fenced in area for the dogs to play was awesome. We met Reta who loves dogs. We were very happy to be there. Only drawback was the bedding. I may have made a mistake when I booked that there were 2 beds.
Christine, Harold, Ms Bea and Millie, Lewes DE"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here on my way down to Florida for Christmas, and again on my way back up. Thought was put into every detail. A bottle of water was waiting in the fridge for me, which was very much needed after a long day of traveling. Cookies and hot cocoa mix in the kitchen as well. And on the return trip, there was even a small bag of dog treats for my four legged companion. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay and will absolutely try to book here if I’m coming through again this year."

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I absolutely loved staying here, it was super cute and cozy! The property felt very private, easy to check in and there was lots of space for my dogs to run around in the yard. We even had home baked cookies waiting for us upon arrival! Would happily stay again!"

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful stay, very peaceful area. Very nicely furnished place, and welcoming atmosphere. The house is small, but well designed and does not feel crammed."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Second time staying here and it was just as great as the first! Very clean and a perfect stop with my two pets on the way up north!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Loved the Area, wish I had more time there"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is a great alternative to staying in a hotel while traveling. The tiny house was beautifully decorated and there is a nice porch and sitting area outside. I travel with my dog and he is often distracted and skittish in hotels, but this place was so serene that he felt right at home. I really like this airbnb."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,A great place to rest with my three pups during a long road trip. The place is adorable and the surrounding property is wonderful for dogs. I’ll stay again.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Rita was awesome accommodating and friendly. The property was beautiful for us to walk around with our dogs and the dog park was a life saver! I highly recommend!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had such a wonderful stay here! It was the perfect stop on our road trip—quiet, private, and convenient to I-95. There were so many thoughtful touches in the space, and the couch and bed are incredibly comfortable. The property itself is beautiful, too; we had a great time walking around, especially after a long day in the car. We would stay here again anytime!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,I couldn't have ask for a better place to stay. I was there just over night but truly wished I had time to relax by the fire pit and walk the grounds. Highly reccomend and I hope to use this stop on a regular basis!!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Reta is hospitable and the place was amazingly clean. Lots of goodies inside including popcorn and coffee. We needed it for a quick stay over on our way home down the 95 and it provided everything we needed.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Well done tiny home. Perfect for my stop to FL, just a mile off 95 and easy to find. Sleeping arrangement were as stated by owner and other's who reviewed but that didn't bother me. Kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook a meal. I chose to try Fox's Pizza and would recommend (closest to Reta's). Not alot of food options nearby so be prepared if you want to go out for a meal you will need to drive closer to Fayetteville. Thanks for hosting me and my fur baby, enjoyed my short stay. Debbie"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This place was beautiful. Adequate towels and toiletries. Everything squeaky clean. Loved being able to walk. There was a huge dog at the end of the one path that scared the begezies out of me. He was loose and huge, he didn’t come up to us but we scurried away from him. Honestly don’t know if the dog belonged to the host. The property and the tiny house are truly unique. Unfortunately we arrived later than we would have liked and only spent one night but we were able to get a nice mile walk in. I would recommend the place for sure and would love to visit again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Had a great time. The space was nice and clean. Reta is very friendly and knowledgeable of area. Made us feel right at home!
2023-11-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"My husband, pup and I had a nice stay in Reta's tiny house. We were impressed with her hospitality and the beautiful property."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"My fiancé and I were traveling from upstate NY to FL to move with our three kitties. We were so beyond grateful to have found this gem as a great half way point for our trip. The directions Reta provided were very clear to get to the Airbnb. Great sign right down the driveway to guide you to where to park and lead right up to the front door.
The Airbnb was more than what we expected and we were beyond pleased with the pull out couch (super comfy) and amenities of the place. Super quiet and peaceful night. Only regret is we wish we had more time to walk around and explore the beautiful scenery and enjoy the seating around the fire area that’s right outside the tiny home. This stay really helped us get thru the rest of our trip the following day.
Would absolutely stay here again ◡̈"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Awesome experience!!!

2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oh my gosh! I loved Reta’s place! It was so clean and the attention to detail was great. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was perfect. The surroundings so peaceful and beautiful. Reta even baked me some cookies which was much appreciated!
I would stay here again and would recommend it to the rest of my team when they’re in the area.
Reta was super friendly and kind.
Thank you for sharing your little piece of heaven with me."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,What a beautiful place to stay! It was so close to the highway but very remote and quiet.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,as advertised
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Reta’s tiny house was perfect for our one night stay on our drive down from NY to FL! Right off I95, great price, super cute house, never stayed in a tiny house before but this was awesome! It fit my boyfriend and I and our 2 bigger dogs. We loved walking around the tree farm the next morning before getting back in the car too! Really overall can’t say enough good things about this place! Really enjoyed our stay!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay if you are on the road traveling. The home was private enough for me and my dog to eat and take a rest. The bed is a foldable bed that goes on the floor but was surprisingly comfortable with the mattress topper. I would stay here again if I’m traveling through in the future!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The tiny home was great. Reta came outside and brought me an extra blanket when I got there due to the incoming weather. Everything was great.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I will always check for this ,when traveling south in the future. It was a perfect distance for my needs, and so comfortable,easy, and welcoming. Thank you Reta!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,great location.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome place!
We appreciate that the place was clean and quiet. The place welcomed our dogs. Since it was a place that welcomed pets, I thought dog hair or cat hair would be presence but it was not. The place was clean!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,AMAZING stay on my FL to NY road trip with my dog. Right off I95. Close to Fayetteville. I will def be staying here again next time I drive down
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Small, cute, and comfy! Worth the stop while traveling on I95!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Reta’s place was a perfect spot to stop on my road-trip up to New York. My pup loved the property and it was super clean and cozy inside. Reta was super responsive and even brought us blankets right before bed :) I’ll definitely keep this spot in mind for future road-trips!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice place in a quiet location. Reta and her husband treated me , my wife and pets like we were part of their family. We will definitely stay there again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! Love the property and that it was dog friendly. We are traveling north and it was a peaceful break on our travels!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Reta was a very good host. It's a cute place close to I95 but a nice country setting. Clean and just right for my husband and I to overnight. Likely to stay again in the future.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Place was exactly as described, and very clean. Stopped halfway with two pets on a long drive down south and it was exactly what we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,The accommodations were perfect for my small dog and myself. Place was very clean and private with lots of space for my dog. Great snacks and coffee I will definitely be back.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Rita was very responsive. We needed extra blankets and she was very quick to accommodate. The location is very quiet and peaceful. It was very hot when we were there and we were very grateful for a great a/c unit. Highly recommend.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a beautiful and peaceful tiny home. It was very clean and cozy! Would love to stay again.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,thank you for the stay!
2023-07-01,4.0,Stayed one night,Very responsive - Great hosts! Quiet location and perfect to get off of 95 on a long drive and get some rest.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Was an absolutely perfect stay, comfortable, safe, quiet, and close to I95!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous piece of land, quiet, and lovely place to stay. They were great hosts and the cabin was peaceful. we also had the cutest kitty guests stop by!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Probably one of our favorite Airbnb's ever! We stopped here for the night on a road trip with our dogs, and wanted something more comfortable than a hotel room for our pups. The tiny home was perfect! The dogs LOVED playing in the field, going on walks around the property. The property is so beautiful and peaceful. We couldn't believe what a gem this was! Reta was a perfect host and we can't wait to stay again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Lovely and quaint
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Reta's place was incredible! It is in a beautiful setting, right out of a movie. Reta's family owns a tree farm and the walking paths surrounding it are amazing! However, the sleeping arrangements do need to be discussed. I was lucky as there was only me and my dog (with her pillow). I am not sure how two people or folks with limited mobility would have been able to sleep on the ""chair beds"". Yes, the pictures on the posting make it look easy to change the chairs into beds. There is also a set of directions on a sheet of household informational tidbits like wifi, etc.. However, I was unsuccessful and used one of the mattresses I found. After driving all day and two Tylenol PM, I was ready to sleep anywhere. I am not sharing this info to keep anyone from staying here. I just think a more realistic description of the sleeping arrangements needs to be shared."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,We enjoyed for a overnight and unique experience.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Great spot for a solo, female traveler and her pups en route to Charleston! Got in late, and mostly was there to sleep, but nice little landing pad to shower and get a good nights sleep. Pretty property in the AM too!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The tiny home was just like the pictures. Reta was so nice. She even fixed the chairs into beds for us before we arrived because we were coming in late. Overall, it was a great experience."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The host was very responsive and supplied us with tools for the grill immediately when we asked! The house had everything we needed and we really enjoyed our stay. I recommend not forgetting to bring containers or other small ingredients for cooking because we had forgotten some things. Everything is about 20 minutes away from the home but there rides feel short and scenic!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved the property and the privacy. Would definitely stop here again when traveling up North from Florida.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This tiny home is even more beautiful in person! It’s a great location if you need somewhere off 95 to stay for the night. The one and only critique would be the bed situation. A pull out sofa would seem like a better option, but even still they do have options to choose from (the chairs pull out to single beds, another little fold out cushion for the floor, and an air mattress). Otherwise, there’s nothing negative I can say because it’s a beautiful home in a peaceful location off the main highway. The hosts were very responsive to messages which I appreciated! Thank you so much! I will be back!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,I like to thank Reta for renting her place to us. It was raining when we were there my husband did some exploring he absolutely loved the property. I just wish that we could have stayed longer. Thank you again Debbie & JIMI
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beat Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at will be returning
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,This was a perfect stay for a night after a long day driving 95! Everything was perfect!

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Amazing and cozy tiny home! Very clean and comfortable!
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny house was on a beautiful, quiet property. The attention to detail was obvious in this comfortable setting. Everything about the stay was perfect with the exception of spotty wifi which caused the television to go in and out, and the ""beds"" (pull out chairs) which were far from comfortable. We came for one night for sleep and lodging to break up a long drive and we thought the lodging was excellent but the sleeping part was subpar."
2023-06-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a cute space for a quick stay. The sleeping arrangements were the only thing we didnt love about the place. Reta was lovely, and brought us a clothes iron."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Will definitely stay there again. Wonderful surroundings and my dog loved the spacious yard

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The hosts were lovely, and the tiny home was great. I traveled alone here and felt very safe the duration of my stay. Would love to stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,everything was great served us perfectly. we got in later than expected but in the morning it was pleasant seeing the beautiful surroundings and their beautiful home just feet away.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Fred and Reta are amazing hosts. Beautiful property! I can’t say enough positive comments.
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved this space! Very cozy and peaceful - I will return
2022-12-01,4.0,Stayed with a pet,Great one night place to stay /Easy on and off I 95
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful place tucked away in a peaceful location. Reta and her husband are gracious hosts. Only a short drive to Fayetteville or Fort Bragg.
Hope to stay here again soon."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Reta and Nelson were lovely hosts. We ran into a little snag when the lock on the tiny home was malfunctioning. Nelson and Reta were on it right away and accommodated us with a larger room with all the comforts of home. They were very sweet and hospitable. Although this was just a quick overnight stop on our road trip we felt comfy and cozy. We’d love to return in the future!
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I loved staying here. I selected it because I’m traveling and it was minutes from I95. It was described perfectly, and Reta was very welcoming through her communications. Next time, I’ll plan to stop here during the day, so I can enjoy the beautiful property."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Stayed here with our dog on on a roadtrip from New York to Florida, and it was the perfect halfway point at a great price! It was a very cute and cozy place, and the hosts were very responsive and friendly. The kitchen was stocked with some snacks, soda, and water bottles along with everything you would need to cook a meal. We are definitely considering staying here again on our drive back to New York."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We stopped for the night on a long distance trip heading south. The tiny home was perfect for our needs. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable! We would definitely stay again."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice place, heater works great. Very welcoming and professional host. Easy to find. Shower was really great too! I'd stay here again for sure."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Our group of three had to cancel our booking at another location and needed to find a place to stay at the last minute. By luck this tiny house had just been listed and even though it had no reviews (at the time) we contacted the host to see if it would be right for our needs and after a quick exchange we went ahead and booked it for two different stays. We were a bit nervous at the idea of being one of the first guests to stay at this location, but we had absolutely nothing to worry about. The property is just a few short minutes off I-95 surrounded by trees and away from all the noise. A code is needed to check in which our hosts sent to us before we arrived and we were able to park directly next to the house itself. A note was waiting for us with a contact number that we actually had to use because we couldn't figure out how to work the tv (which is set up with Roku and Netflix). Not only were the hosts more than happy to help resolve the issue but they wasted no time to get it fixed; when we walked through the door on our second stay the tv was set up and ready to go! There are three sleeper chairs with linens, but an air mattress is offered as a substitute for one of the chairs and a queen sized bed in a separate area can also be used at no extra charge which really goes to show how much the hosts care about the comfort of their guests. There's a kitchenette sink, mini fridge, and stove combo as well as a small microwave and two coffee machines (k-cup and standard). The kitchen provides cups, cutlery, plates, a few cooking utensils, and a convertible table that seats two. The bathroom is roomy, has plenty of towels, and the walk-in shower has consistent hot water with good pressure. What we really appreciated were the small touches such as the snacks/candy on the kitchen table, the waters and sodas stocked in the fridge, the board game in the main area, and the fire wood for the outside pit; on our second stay there were sugars and creamers available as well as body wash and shampoo/conditioner in addition to everything else. However, nothing will highlight how kind and generous these hosts are more than the message we got from them between our stays asking after our well being as they knew we were in Florida at the time Nicole was passing through the state. It was an absolute joy to stay at the tiny house with these hosts and we highly recommend others to stay here whether it's for one night or an extended stay."
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous cozy place, nestled in the Carolina countryside. Wonderful place and setting - so peaceful and quiet. I loved the natural wood interiors, even above the windows. Excellent communication/correspondence from this lovely host. Thank you!"
2022-11-01,4.0,Stayed one night,See my other review for full details but forgot to mention there is heating and AC in the tiny house.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved the Tiny House. I was picking up my daughter from Raliegh Airport, so it was a nice spot for us to stay. I did a bike ride Saturday and then picked her up Saturday night, it was an easy drive to there and we slept so well on the beds, the mattress was so comfortable. Reta left everything in the house that we could possibly need. Her and her husband also had the outside fire pit loaded with wood ready for us to use. It was a wonderful stay, and we look forward to coming back."

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Irene was great! Very helpful and communicative!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We booked the cottage for a pitstop stay on our way from FL to PA. Just close enough to 95 but not too close. The cottage can not be seen from the road but is easy to find. We were so happy to find every amenity we could think of and beautiful thoughtful decor. Irene makes quilts that are stunning and examples of her quilting are everywhere, I enjoyed them like being in an art gallery! There is ample space to stretch out and relax with a cozy comfortable atmosphere to make you feel at home immediately. Plenty parking space and a great little yard to spend time outdoors with comfortable seating. Irene heard we were travelling North to celebrate our child's Birthday and made a cake that was waiting for us when we got there. It was delicious and a perfect welcome for weary travellers. My family plans to book here again on our drives up and down 95."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Irene’s place is better than the pics. It’s super clean and has everything you need. Clear instructions everywhere in the room. The yard is beautiful especially with all the lights on during the night. I traveled with my cat and dog and they love it.
Irene is super friendly and helpful. Very easy to communicate.
I would definitely come back if there is a chance in the future."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was definitely an enjoyable overnight stay. My children loved it and they were so entertained by the games and puzzles.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Cutest little conveniently located spot. Our dogs were made to feel right at home immediately. We very much so enjoyed our nights booked with Irene and Charlie and are thankful for their kindness. So much better than a room rental, you can fit a lot of people the way they have it set up! The quilts there are a homey extra touch provided. Loved watching a movie and relaxing fully! Would definitely return."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Irene’s place was so adorable and so clean. We only stayed overnight with our dogs a we traveled from the northeast to the south but kept thinking that our grandchildren would have lived the place. Great fur anyone traveling with dogs or a family. And Irene was very responsive and made sure lights were in outside given that we were arriving late. I would definitely recommend her place.

2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"The comfort vibe in this home is excellent. Everything you need is there. Irene was pleasant from the minute I requested to book. The efforts put into this adorable open space really make you feel right at home. We loved that there is no carpet, just a few well placed throw rugs. The cutest little sparkling ball lights as we sat outside in the evening to relax. It had rained a bit, creating some humidity and there were no bugs!! So close to 1-95, if you take exit 41-approximately 4 miles maximum. I would highly recommend staying at this quiet clean well appointed home. The home is exactly as the photos show, if not better!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Every thing was very good and their hospitality made us feel right at home.
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed in many AirBnb’s and none has compared to this one!

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay at Irene’s Cottage! It was totally spotless, wonderfully appointed, colorfully decorated and we felt completely at home! The fenced private yard was great for taking our dog out and there were even sheets/towels especially for pets! The rooms were large and the couches and bed were very comfortable. The kitchen had everything we could need and the cable TV was great. We loved the privacy of the location (not seen from street) and felt very safe. We are looking forward to returning later this year when we go to Florida for the winter. We highly recommend this lovely cottage!"

2024-04-01,3.0,Stayed with kids,"We really appreciated the activities for kids. Our kids had a blast. All the quilts were really beautiful. Unfortunately, there was a dirty mop water, bleach smell in most of the cottage. We didn't inform the host because the solution would have likely been more disruptive to our evening, and we only stayed for one night. We also found a few hair strands on the pillows and in the sheets. Luckily, there were extra sheets in the closet, so we habdled it and replaced them ourselves."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Irene was extremely helpful and flexible with the stay. She provided me with local restaurant recommendations as we were arriving later in the night. And also gave me some local tire shops to get some new tires that were needed on my in-laws car. Definitely recommend the stay, and 100% worth the money!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We loved it here . So did the dogs! They had a private outdoor space right at the front door. We will be back on the way back home. Grocery, restaurants and shopping were just a few minutes away."

We look forward to stay there again when we drive to Florida and back."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was above my expectations! The small touches everywhere were really appreciated! There are games, toys, a kid table, and children’s dinnerware. It made the stay with 3 young kids less stressful! The beds were very comfortable and she had everything you could think of needing! She was very responsive to messages! We only stayed for one night on our way to Disney and I would definitely stay again! This place is saved in our favs for future trips!"

We will definitely rent Irene’s place again in future."

We only stayed overnight but we got take out and relaxed in her comfy furniture watching movies. Very spacious place, quiet street and walked our dog around the neighborhood. Bed was super comfy which is one of the most important features to us!
We live in Maine and like to get out for a month and head south so Irene’s place will be on our list of stops!"

2024-01-01,4.0,Stayed one night,"Had a quick one night stay and it was perfect for what I needed. Great location and near a lot of entertainment/food. I arrived a bit earlier than check in time and was told I could check in early- which was great. However, when I checked the app for the check in instructions, I did not see any. After knocking on the incorrect door and subsequently reaching out to Irene, the instructions were provided to me. Overall, Irene was responsive and helpful with her communication and I enjoyed my stay at the Hidden Cottage."
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Even nicer than it looks in the pictures and super comfortable! I could have slept for a couple of days there it was seriously so peaceful! The nicest host too :) Would absolutely stay again if I’m ever driving through.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Amazing place to stay!!! If you have pets that are a bit skiddish, this is definitely the place to be. The block is super quiet and private, perfect for taking the dogs on a walk. After staying in pet friendly hotels over the past few years, never again! Doors constantly opening and closing, people coming and going all hours of the night, a restful night was never in the cards. For someone who travels back and forth from NY to FL a couple times per year, we’ll be staying at the Hidden Cottage from now on.
Irene was a great host, provided clear directions, was always responsive, super friendly and even left some treat surprises for the pups!! The Hidden Cottage has everything you could need for an overnight or even a couple of days stay. Place was very clean and felt right at home from the minute we pulled into the driveway. Absolute 10/10 !!!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our second stay at the “Hidden cottage” Irene is a wonderful host. On our first stay there one of my grandchildren misplaced a necklace and we didn’t even know it was missing. Irene found it and kept it safe. It was on the table when we got there.❤️ I’ll be back!

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,If you’re on the fence just hop off and secure your stay at the “Hidden Cottage “. This place was perfect for my family. Sadly we were just passing through so we only stayed for one night while traveling south. We did however book a night for our return trip north. This is an ideal home if traveling with children. They have tons of stuff to keep the little ones entertained.

2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice, private place. You have to walk out front to walk your dog, but there is a nice place right across the street to walk them. It is a very nice, quiet neighborhood. The bed mattress is a bit hard. Most Airbnb hosts buy the Casper (or Casper-like) mattresses and they are not very comfortable; very hard. The place is very nice and comfortable with everything you would need."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was a fantastic find for a short trip to the Fayetteville area. Quaint and cozy cottage full of all the needed amenities. Irene was very responsive when I had questions.

2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Irene's place was my sanctuary/stop over on a long drive down the East coast. It arrived late in the evening. I was worried about finding the BnB and parking correctly...but Irene's instructions were spot on and super clear. When I pulled up there were some fairy lights on which was a cute touch and VERY helpful to the unloading process (as it was late at night). The house was exactly as pictured and very comfortable. It was a lot bigger than I expected and would be wonderful for a family trip. There was a FULL kitchen, adorable reading nook and piles of games.
Thank you Irene!"

We felt welcome and right at home in the cottage. You can tell the owners care about the property and want their guests to have a good experience. They provide so many little extras from Band Aids to a full coffee bar, they have it covered! We also loved all of the bright, beautiful handmade quilts and wall hangings! We have found an excellent alternative to staying in a hotel!"

The house was clean, well supplied if you wanted to cook (super nice surprise to find coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and oatmeal), and we had the best nights sleep on a very comfortable bed. Plenty of sleeping space for a larger family. Our dog was very happy with the treat left for her. What a sweet touch. If you are traveling on I-95 and need a good night's sleep, we HIGHLY recommend a stopover at The Hidden Cottage.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"I didn't want to book a hotel for fear of many things like smells, noise, filth, unsafe parking lot.... and so much more, and I'm beyond glad I didn't and stayed at Hidden Cottage. There was no smell, no noise, and it felt safe and was clean and sooooo comfy--including the furniture. It was really spacious, and there were so many nice touches: loved the lighting, Netflix seasons I haven't seen of my fav shows, fresh sage and rosemary in the planters, the cabinet of creamers, coffee, cocoa, and oatmeal, nice coffee maker, perfect firm bed (and the other one not so much for those who don't want firm), beautiful quilts, luxury sheets, covers, pillows... easy in and out, super easy quick digital lock. It was truly perfect. Even a welcome biscuit for Willow! And the place is just adorable, so artistic. What an incredibly professional thoughtful host!!"

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,so amazing!!!!!
2023-04-01,4.0,Group trip,The exterior camera was uncomfortable. due to conversation taking place in the patio and we d
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Adorable place to stay! We stopped here overnight on our drive from Orlando to Boston. Would stay here again 100%!!
,,,"The house was pretty, the host was nice at first . They got bugs though and when the heat is on it smells . He gave me 70$ back from our trip . I paid almost 500$ . We were out of town and had no where else to go for us to just leave the air bnb . I asked air bnb for money back and he denied it. I let it go and this man proceeds to file a claim about smoking which we absolutely didn’t do because we were never in the space long enough to smoke . Just get dressed and go that’s it . His claim was denied by me and proceeded to process it with air bnb and they also denied his claim ! Like bye . I hope who ever goes next enjoys ."
,,,"The price was not worth the stay. I booked and paid for two nights but stayed only one night. As an air b n b host myself I was dissatisfied with the experience and the advertisement.
This is a modular home, sited within a trailer park community. The unit had one half roll of toilet paper and 4 sets of towels ONLY. Guests that are visiting and not staying overnight are welcomed in the advertisement, but in response to a question about the lack of toilet tissue I was told there was additional
Tissue in the master closet when there was NOT (I had to buy); in fact despite the advertisement welcoming visitors the immediate response was that I would need modify my reservation to include additional guests , because the cleaner counted 7 people versus 5. The unit was not available at 3pm as advertised. It was not ready at 4pm as discussed. The cleaning person was in the unit 20-30 minutes after check-in. The bathroom doors do not lock properly. There was a brown stain on the bedding. Under the beds were not cleaned ( white particles). The internet/WiFi worked about 25% of the time. Since there is only streaming services available on the TV that meant incessant buffering. Despite these many issues with the stay and the modular unit, the host had very stringent rules about smoking, returning the place to its exact (implied pristine) condition, and shoes in the house; me and my guest respected all of the rules of the home.
I definitely would not recommend staying here unless the price was significantly reduced and the host was explicitly honest about the unit, it’s amenities, and the condition of the modular home."
