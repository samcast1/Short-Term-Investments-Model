2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Once again, a GREAT stay at one of Stephanie's houses! This is the 3rd time and 3rd house that we have stayed at. She is super responsive and very easy to work with."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,"Stephanie‚Äôs place was like a home away from home. It was beautifully decorated and clean. It was wonderful arriving and already having a fridge with milk, eggs, creamer and butter. We will stay again for sure."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,feel like you home.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Outstanding Airbnb rental! Steph is the epitome of the perfect hostess. The personalized touches of a handmade table and the end tables in the living room, and the handmade mantle complemented the freshly homemade cheese bread Steph bakes just before her guests arrive. The ‚ÄúBlonde Brick‚Äù house is inviting, cozy, comfortable and very relaxing. 5 ***** isn‚Äôt enough of a rating for this beautiful home and extraordinary host."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thank you!
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Really great place! We felt like home üè°. It is very clean and better then what it look in picture .. our host Steph was very nice and communicative.. quick response when you reach out to her. Steph even had snacks and some others for all of us. Would definitely come back again!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have you ever walked into Airbnb within minutes, you're ready to write a stellar review? This home has vintage charm and all the updated amenities to ensure a stay that will exceed your expectations! Our host had an adorable Christmas tree decorated and lit welcoming us as we walked in! The dining area is so inviting with an adjacent living area with soft throws to curl up on the couch- Be sure to check out the kitchen! It's loaded with the best cookware, utensils, spices, snacks and to help you get your stay underway, you'll find chilled waters, a carton of eggs, and milk in the refrigerator. Come on, who does that?! All of the beds have the softest linens, but check out the bathroom with full size shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. in the closet, you'll find extra amenities because you always forget when you travel! This perfect home is excellent for a bridal party, family getaway, and those visiting for the holidays. This is our third time renting from Stephanie, our host!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We are from Sioux City and staying at this Unique, well stocked in All the ways home felt so cozy and welcoming. Highly recommend this space! Excellent neighborhood, great for familias, lots of space and amenities, games etc to entertain. We will definitely chose to stay here on our next return!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable. The sun room was nice. Also, the Sioux City/Leeds touches were fun as we all grew up in Leeds."
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I loved the place! We had a great time and spent a lot of time hanging out in the sun room. It was perfect for us!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and well-kept home. Lots of room for your family! About a 40 minute drive to the university of South Dakota. Would definitely rent again, if I decided to come back to the area."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay, it was clean and easy to get to."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Our group enjoyed the dining and kitchen space since we like to cook some meals and play games.
We appreciated having two bedrooms on the main floor.
It was a short drive to get to downtown or parks and other sites.
The only major drawback was squeaky stairs to the upstairs sleeping space- trips to the bathroom on the main floor in the middle of the night could easily disturb others.
The kitchen space was nicely renovated and the home had many original features such as great woodworking. Britney has done a beautiful job blending contemporary furnishings with the original elements.
We would highly recommend this home!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,"Britney has done an amazing thing with this older home in a peaceful neighborhood. The place had ample room for the max number of guests, was crazy clean, the decor was perfect, and we had everything we needed for reconnecting as a family for several days. I highly recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,We had a great girls weekend. Perfect for relaxing and game playing. We will be back.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was perfect for our group! The house has beautiful woodwork all throughout, and is very well taken care of. We will definitely stay here again when in Sioux City!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"While working in Sioux City, we stayed at Britney‚Äôs.
We were there shortly after the second blizzard so it was VERY cold. The second you walked into the house, that chill was replaced with the warmth of her place.
This is a 3/2 home. All beds are very comfortable and we slept well. Bedrooms are great with high end linens.
The bathrooms had ample supplies. We didn‚Äôt have to buy anything. Very hot water and great water pressure. We had 3 people getting ready in the morning and never had a cold shower.
The living/dining/kitchen were my fave. Craftsman bones are evident throughout the house. Beautiful entry way and hardwood floors. I cooked a bunch and had everything I needed.
The outside area is pretty with a screened in porch area that‚Äôs huge. I‚Äôm sure in good weather that would be a great hang out.
I am 60 with a bum knee and had zero issues managing the stairs. Britney made sure the steps were salted daily. Highly recommend. I would return in a heartbeat."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,Very helpful. Really great people
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely time staying at this home. The space was warm and cozy and decorated very nicely for the holidays. It was perfect for our family and we will look to stay here again on future trips to Sioux City. We appreciated the Sioux City treats in the kitchen and the Sioux City decor around the home. Lots of small touches that made the home so nice; device power stations on the bedroom nightstands, board games in the living room, fast internet, loads of towels. Overall we had a great experience."
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,Britney was a great host - responsive and helpful. Would stay again if we came back to the area.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect place

2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"The house was everything we expected, and we will definitely stay again if we are in the area."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous and well kept home. It is a little farther out from downtown than ideal if that is where you want to be, but for a family get away you couldn't ask for a better space, and it was still very easy to get everywhere we wanted and needed."
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Your home we great!! My only suggestion, just my suggestion!! I‚Äôd put at least 1 bed in the basement, since the other bathroom is down there and have the attic/ dormer more of the extra sleeping space. But other than that, I was great!!
Jamie"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an excellent stay! Super cute and comfy house with more than enough room for us. I would highly recommend Britney's place and look forward to booking again when we are in the area.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, with lots of room. Only negative was a bit warm upstairs, but otherwise lovely and would recommend to anyone !!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean home. Nightly charge was reasonable. However, cleaning charge and Airbnb service charge increases final total. Britany was kind and informative."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Brittney is a fantastic host! The home was very clean and comfortable. Brittney was so sweet and very responsive to anything that we needed. I would definitely stay here again if back in the area.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"First time renting Airbnb.
The house was cozy, very clean, very spacious and well equipped. Very easy to get in with the keypad, nothing complicated.
There was good communication with the host and the co-host via Airbnb messages. They made sure we got there ok and that there was no problem at check in; there was a number to reach out in case of any issues.
Instructions came right at the time as they said it would and they were easy to follow.
The neighborhood was nice and very very quiet. A Walmart was less than 5 min drive, 2 car wash, a small shopping center. And about 10 min, downtown Iowa.
I would definitely rent there again for the next visit to Iowa."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was beyond our expectations! The house was beautiful and the whole process was very first-time user friendly. Britney and Tracy answered every question in a timely manner. We were in town to get together with family who live in the area and the house provided a safe, child-friendly, and at-home feel for everyone. We will definitely be booking again for future visits to Sioux City!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Britney and Tracie were amazing hosts during our stay, always responsive and flexible. Wish we could stay at their home our entire time in Sioux City! Thanks!"
2023-06-01,4,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay. The place was clean and our favorite part of the house was the covered patio. Only complaint was that there wasn‚Äôt enough towels for all of our guests and there was only one extra blanket that we could find.
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Very Nice Accommodations. Our party of five (four of us over the age of 70) enjoyed the privacy. Three of us had lived in Leeds during our Highschool years. Our stay brought back memories. If I may, just say one thing (not trying to sound negative here, tho.) The two separate steep stair cases were doable, but we 70+ year olds had to do them Very Carefully.
Our Hostess was extremely accessible via the cell phone--she was very understanding & helped us with questions. Her sweet voice and her understanding HELPED so much. Thanks, Britney!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house for our group of 5. Loved having the pool table since we were there for a pool tournament. Living room and dining room were great for gathering. The outdoor screened in patio is nice for good weather. Beds were comfortable and house was clean. Neighborhood is quiet. Will probably try to book again if we come up next year. Thanks!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very Beautiful home clean, lots of space and has everything you would expect a home to have and more. I wish the weather was warmer so we could have enjoyed the outdoor patio! I would definitely rebook!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Britney and Tracie were great to work with, they even met me prior to our move in to make sure the location and home were suitable for our stay. They helped replace batteries in the door, get packages delivered, and store our belongings when we moved to another of their homes. Great service!"

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I must say this has been my favorite Airbnb yet. From the moment you step it has an old world charm about it. It reminded me of my grand mother‚Äôs place in the 60‚Äôs. It‚Äôs been lovingly redecorated in fantastic fashion. The artwork compliments the house wonderfully. Don‚Äôt forget to check out the light switch in the master bedroom. Jessica does everything to make you feel welcome and communication is a breeze
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute and comfy home!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an excellent choice for us on our way to Texas from Manitoba. We appreciated the quiet neighborhood since it was located on a ‚Äúnot through‚Äù street so we did not feel the need to totally unload our vehicle. Grocery store close by with very friendly staff.

We were amazed at how quiet it was inside when the neighborhood was filled with little trick-or-treaters outside. The neighborhood was quiet and filled with well-cared for older homes. Jessica was very responsive to the messages I sent, and her home is a little cozy gem for those comfortable with an actual lived-in feel to where they stay. Excellent water pressure, amount of hot water and heat in this old home. Reminded me of being a kid at Grandma's house! Loved putting my cold feet over the vent in the bathroom. It was always warm!"

Jessica was an awesome host, quick to respond when we had a question after check-in, even though it was rather late. The space is comfortable, spacious, and had some cool art on the walls.

2023-09-01,3,Stayed one night,"This house was what we needed it to be - a place to stay for a night on a road trip home. We didn‚Äôt arrive until late into the night, but when we did there was a conglomeration of cars parked in a yard across the street with a party going on. However, that is completely out of the host‚Äôs control. The party didn‚Äôt disturb our sleep, but I did feel the need to keep an eye out. What was an issue was the smell inside the house. Immediately upon entering the front door, it smelt like dusky smoke. The smell decreased outside of the living room, but it was still noticeable. For those that are allergic or sensitive to these smells, please be aware. We had Lysol and air fresheners with us just in case, so we were able to manage. Overall, we had a place to sleep and I was thankful after a long drive."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jessica's home was perfect for us while traveling out West and needing a nice place to wind down and get a good night sleep. Skip the hotels! This space was super comfortable in everyway! Jessica provides everything you need and goes above and beyond by supplying coffee for your morning caffeine fix, water and snacks! Thank you Jessica for being a great responsive host ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,We had a good stay here!! Thanks Jessica!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super cozy, comfortable and clean! Thank you!"
2023-09-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great stay for the price! My only complaint was the creepy attic that was never mentioned. It made me uncomfortable. This house also appeared to have mold in the bathroom and the paint was chipping off the walls and trim. But other than that, great stay! Worth the price :) Also had snacks and soap if needed"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jessica was a fabulous host. When you step in the front door it feels so much like home. She has thought of everything from spices to toothbrushes. We will definitely stay again anytime we are in Sioux City.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely night at Jessica‚Äôs sweet house! It was clean, comfy, and homey ‚Äî and our dog loved it! Jessica was a proactive and communicative host and it was a pleasure coordinating with her üòä"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"We enjoyed our stay there. The only problem I had was getting in, but that was my problem. I didn't wait long enough after I entered the code.
All in all, it was peaceful and quiet there.
I think a previous tenant may have programmed the tv to go on early Wed morning. My sister noticed it was on when she got up, and she had turned it off before retiring for the night. This was not the hostess fault at all. My sister, brother and I give this airbnb 2 thumbs up!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,üòä

2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It is all Jessica states and more. The little backyard is beautifully kept and perfect for your dog. She is very much a communicator.

The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe which was especially important with an out of state plate and a car that was full. Thank you for having us!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We chose Jessica‚Äôs place for our visit ‚Äúhome‚Äù for a family reunion.

Will look you up next year!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is the cutest lil house. If you like charm, this is your house. We felt right at home & our pets had plenty of outside space to walk around.

2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful property and well maintained. We walked into a beautifully updated home that was sparkling clean. The space was perfect for our family of 4. Monica was tremendous, responding to our needs promptly even on Christmas Eve.
The only downfall is the location, while perfectly close to Interstate 29 and Highways 20/77/75, it was not the ideal neighborhood, which was slightly run down. This is not too much of a concern, as most of the Sioux City/South Sioux City is very similar being mostly blue collar. I just was not prepared for the neighborhood, given the high end quality of the property."
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Monica‚Äôs place is definitely the place stay if you get the chance. She‚Äôs a wonderful host and will do anything to be sure you are comfortable during your stay..
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy drive to downtown Sioux City and the Tyson Event Center. Monica is a welcoming host. Her home is spotless and well equipped. We were in town for an annual volleyball tournament and if the team qualifies next year, we hope to return."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Nest was wonderful! It was extremely clean and in a good location. The space was very stylish and beds were comfy being a firm foam with soft sheets. The kitchen was well stocked with pampered chef utensils which I loved! It also had basic oils and salt and pepper and ketchup and mustard. Several towels and bath rags were available and there was a built in seat along the back of the shower. Shower gel, soap, shampoo, and conditioner were supplied. There is an iron and ironing board also. It was 15 min from the airport and I think close to 10 minutes away from the mall and shopping and some eating. Monica is very responsive and even removed some items ahead of time for our toddler so he wouldn‚Äôt get into/break them like a big plant. I would recommend The Nest to anyone visiting Sioux City. Feels like home."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great area, nice customer service and really makes you feel like you are at home if I visit Iowa again for work will definitely book in the future"

When you settle in, you won't need anything extra. They've taken care of it! This home has all the comforts of home and while you stay here, it will be comfortable, cozy, and more importantly, quiet. This property is nestled in a neighborhood that is quiet. The beds! So comfortable and the linens...just wait till you crawl in üôå The rooms my husband and I spent most of our time in the kitchen, dining area and living room. We love to cook and found all of the cooking ware, knives and utensils and plates were in new condition. Great quality too! The dining area is perfect where we enjoyed breakfast and dinner. a couple evenings we enjoyed sitting In the backyard. It was so quiet and really enjoyable! I worked remote and used the spare bedroom with the adorable antique desk. The lighting was bright and cheerful which made my video meetings perfect. Wi-Fi is strong and reliable which I depended on to get my work completed. In the evening, we relaxed in the living area. The rocking chairs are super lush and cozy! I enjoyed a couple evenings on the couch with the provided throw blankets while we watched TV. Wait till you head down to the basement! There's a full workout area, and the washer and dryer are gigantic with a large area to fold your freshly washed clothes. honestly, they thought of everything! If you're staying here for a week, month or longer, you're going to love it! Welcome home!"

Location was great, right in the middle of things so super easy to get to their house and the other places we were planning on visiting. Place was really nice, clean and best of all we were able to bring the dog. This was huge as it was a holiday weekend so we had no one to watch him and would‚Äôve had to cancel the trip. So that was HUGE for us. Thx!!!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Excellent place for us and pups. While we didn‚Äôt need to use the upstairs area, the main floor of the house and backyard was perfect.

However, in the middle of the stay I found a mice running around the living room and I had to move out to a hotel. He did give me a partial refund for the nights I did not stay because of the mice. He was professional, and courteous even though the stay was not ideal for me."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Phone was very flexible given the blizzard that had come in and worked with us to obtain salt for walkway. He was extremely quick and offering a refund for the salt that we bought. The storm was completely unexpected.

Thank you for making a special weekend easy, and memorable!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice enough place. Close to Morningside University which is what we wanted. It was clean and adequately supplied but seemed a little over priced for the area and quality of homes in Sioux.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love staying here while we are in Sioux City. Gives us a ‚Äúhome base‚Äù that you can‚Äôt get from a hotel. We have everything we need in this space.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Vaughn was very accommodating and helpful throughout the stay. House was clean, convenient and comfortable."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We weren‚Äôt there long, but the house was perfect for what we needed; a one night stay on our way to a different destination. Everything was very clean, and Vaughn and Haley were very quick to respond to our questions. Recommendation to eat at Bob Roe‚Äôs for dinner was great- pizza and wings were delicious. The upstairs is sort of a strange set up, with the bathroom in one of the 2 bedrooms, so one guest has to go thru another‚Äôs room to get to the bathroom, but not a huge deal. We had seen that on reviews so not a surprise. Overall a really nice place! Thanks for the hospitality!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were in town for a family gathering and enjoyed our stay at this cute and cozy home. The neighborhood is quite and the home easy is to find. I grew up in the area and felt very safe in this neighborhood. The host was very helpful and easy to communicate with. The beds and pillows were quite comfortable the the coffee was good ! The stairs leading to the top floor are a bit narrow. We had rainy weather and did not use the backyard deck or fire pit but it looks very well kept. Very nice remodel - we would stay here again :)

2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The Airbnb was located in a good spot - close to main roads, not far from highway access and close to downtown. The house was very clean, furniture and house has been modernized. I loved the master bathroom. We did not use any amenities really, we were out most of the day as we were in town for a family gathering so we were mainly there at bedtime. Master bed was very comfortable, queen bed was also comfortable but the twin beds were a little hard.
Found some windows unlocked which caused some anxiety, neighborhood was nice but we could hear a lot of outside noise which made it hard to sleep - I think I only got 3 hours of sleep the first night. The upstairs is a converted attic, no door for the room with the queen bed and whoever is sharing the rooms upstairs shares the bathroom upstairs which is accessible through the queen bedroom.
Overall a good location for where we needed to be and a good value for the money."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts. Vaughn helped accommodate with our time situation and had a clean home. Plenty of room. Would recommend anyone to stay here that is looking for a place
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house is in a quiet neighborhood not far from downtown. We found the furnishings and beds comfortable, with space to spare (which is very nice!). There is a nice patio in the backyard with a firepit for use if you are interested in spending some time outside. If we ever visit Sioux City again, we would not hesitate to stay here."

2023-07-01,5,Group trip,One of our favorite AirBnB locations. Everything you need. Clean. Comfortable. Just perfect.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"House was in a convenient location. We loved having the fenced in back yard for our kid to play in, and the lights made for cozy nighttime hangouts. The kitchen was more bare than we expected: no cheese grater, vegetable peeler, etc. One thing I did not catch from the description is that the upstairs bedroom with the queen bed is a walk through (to both the bathroom and the bedroom with the two twin beds) and does not have a door‚Äî if anyone is hanging out downstairs it‚Äôs going to be loud in there."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vaughn was very responsive and the house was spotless,"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brad is very efficient in managing his properties. We have stayed at several of his listings. He is quick to respond to any questions or issues.
The house is very comfortable, quality furniture, easy to relax at. There are always little improvements for the guests.
The property is a very good value and competitively priced, but there are too many added Airbnb fees these days."

She had ""What do you meme?"" and ""Card against humanity"" for a fun activity in the house. Coffee maker, microwave, stove, fridge, and plates/cups available.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,BEST AIRBNB IN NEBRASKA !
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Very private and beautiful sunset from deck. Surrounded by cornfields and cows next door. Amenities as listed, clean throughout and master bed was comfortable.
Getting into home requires navigating three steps- not a big deal unless you have old knees like myself!
Mandy and Bobby showed me the tipi when I asked about it and also talked about the local wildlife. I was excited to hear there were three owls on the property."
2023-08-01,4,Stayed one night,"The place was nice, it had a strong bad smell, ( it looked clean, but tge smell was very strong, We couldn't lock the main entrance in house and room has no lock either, nothing happened, but it was to scary to get trough the night with a house unlocked, I did not sleep at all, host was accommodating with check in and out, overall it was good, I would not stay in this place again"

Mandy was awesome!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Nice little get away, peaceful and clean."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mandy is such an awesome host! Very personable and responsive. She even let us check in a little early as we were traveling.
Her house is adorable with all the extras that you need to be comfy. The view in the morning was gorgeous with the fog, sunrise, and cattle! Talk about the Midwest..
Just make sure to note that the house doesn‚Äôt have Wi-Fi (didn‚Äôt matter to us and it‚Äôs clearly in the listing). That was really the only thing I noticed that isn‚Äôt generally at an airbnb. We‚Äôll definitely stay again if we find ourselves in the area!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Mandy was an amazing and amazingly helpful host. Place was awesome and the people couldn‚Äôt have ben nicer. Will definitely be back when I need to stay in South Sioux again! üôèüèº

2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"First time renting an Airbnb, friend and I enjoyed our time here.
Mandy was very responsive and accommodating!
The bed wasn't as cozy as we thought(just too high for us) but the couches were super cozy hahaha.
I'd say wifi would be nice but connecting a hotspot worked out with the TVs. Also big bless for AC window unit and AC. Kept the place nice and cool during the hot weather.
If you love the countryside and want a simple small private place with an affordable price, come over here!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Cool spot!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect! Quiet oasis, with exceptional attention to detail. From coffee creamer selection and peaceful farm views to quiet porch and comfy easy chair, the little farm house exceeded expectations. Quiet. Quiet. And gloriously quiet. A hidden gem for honeymoon or business travel in South Souix City area. Friendly responsive hostess, was quick to recommend good local food/fun. No WIFI (and fantastic private view of acres upon acres of corn fields) No problem. I had Stabe 4+ bars ATT service and solid hot spot access for phones & laptops during entire stay. Comfortable affordable accommodation with cozy small farm feel, only moments away from Walgreens & Walmart."
2023-06-01,4,Stayed one night,We were traveling from Georgia to Glacier NP in 2 days and this spot was the perfect in the middle of the drive place to crash for a few hours of sleep. Mandy was so kind and accommodating and answered our questions quickly! Only minus is this place is listed as sleeping 4 (2 in the double bed and 2 on the couch) and it was a little tight with just 3 of us (1 in the bed and 2 on the couch). All 3 of us are in the 6‚Äô - 6‚Äô5‚Äù range though so maybe if you‚Äôre shorter it would be more comfy with 4. But would definitely stay again if we made this trip twice! :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful experience in this space! We especially enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the evenings watching the bunnies, the cows over yonder, the turkey in the next field - all under the cute solar porch lights with a terrific breeze! Thank you so much for having all the comforts of home and for having a nest of a bed! It was quiet, peaceful, and exactly what we were hoping for!
Also, this place could NOT have been easier to get into. Mandy is a terrific host! We‚Äôll be back! üéâüéâüéâ"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Mandy's place was such a nice getaway! Just out of the city but still felt like we had our own little corner. The teepee on the property was cute also!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mandys place is great, it's like home for us, so quiet, we seen turkey and raccoons in the yard, but yet it's easy to get to wherever you want to go to in town. We are so glad she offers it and will be back in September......"

2022-12-01,3,Stayed one night,"The home is located in south Sioux on a big beautiful piece of land. Next to a teepee I‚Äôve seen before as a listing (super cool).
But I myself wasn‚Äôt fond of this listing it was freezing cold The doors didn‚Äôt lock right. There were notes saying you couldnt go down here or don‚Äôt open that. Witch I did check the basement and opens the door to the garage for my own safety because who does that? It was very strange‚Ä¶ especially When I paid to rent the whole home. Honestly I didn‚Äôt even. Spend my one night here and changed my reservation."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute place, perfect for two. Nicely decorated, really comfortable and peaceful."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mandy‚Äôs house was

And the porch was perfect place to eat dinner and relax.
We will definitely be back thank you Mandy."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mandy was very accommodating and we had everything we needed to stay! Very clean, homey and comfortable."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Mandy‚Äôs farm house is a hidden gem for those wanting a relaxing time away from home, or a quiet place while traveling. Her cozy covered deck offers views of beautiful Kansas sunsets and a place to enjoy morning coffee. This yard is located close to shopping, restaurants, and gas. However, you‚Äôd never know it. Mandy provided fresh fruit , coffees, and teas. Everything promised and more. She is a lovely hostess. We will definitely plan our trip to include staying with her again."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"WoW! We‚Äôre thrilled to have Mandy‚Äôs Airbnb available! There are very few Airbnbs in the South Sioux City area, so that‚Äôs one reason we‚Äôre so happy, but her place is very spacious and guests have plenty of room to spread out.
Very close to South Sioux City‚Äôs Cornhusker street and minutes from Walmart, Dollar Tree and many restaurants.
Highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,What a place!!!! You will stay on a farm surrounded by corn fields. The view is amazing. The accommodations are perfect! You feel like you are in a super remote location but you are in walking distance from a WalMart which you would never know once you are on the property. You will only be 8 minutes from the casino as well! I can not say enough amazing things about this AirBnb
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay was fantastic. Our host answered all of our questions in a timely manner and to top it off had a nice little gift for my wife and girls.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place was in a very convenient location. The house was clean and comfortable. Brad was one of the best hosts I have ever delt with. I called to ask why there was no check out requirements in the book and he said that he doesn't expect his guest to work while they are staying there and to just take care of the obvious things and leave the rest for his team. I absolutely would stay here again and recommend others do the same.

The parking spot is awesome. You can literally park your car 2 steps from the front door. Unfortunately, there were dead bugs on the surface of the neatly-made bed and on the bathroom floor. Also, a food wrapper from fruit tart was under the bed. Those were my only concerns. In addition to the cleaners used in the place which had a very strong smell and a sticky feel to the floor. My husband is very sensitive to fragrances and chemicals. We would just suggest allergen free products and hiring a different cleaning crew."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was very clean, nice amenities, good bed and Debra was super helpful. I appreciated the Alaska art and books she left for reading. Debra knew I was coming in very late on the first night, but still asked that I text her when I arrived. It made me feel good to know she was available if anything went awry. This location was great for me as I was close to family but could have my own space too."

She made sure the drive and steps were cleared from the over 12"" of snow we received. When I asked to stay an extra night, due to bad winter weather, she very quickly approved it! I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in Sioux City, IA area if I return! Thank you, Debra!"

Fully remodeled and accessible to all the things we love, like watching Briar Cliff baseball games, going to Prince's tavern and visiting with friends in Sioux City. This is a tiny home but it checks ALL the boxes! Super clean, private, and you can't beat the price! Debra is a wonderful host!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The "" Tiny House "" was perfect. Very clean, within a couple blocks from any possible need that a person can might have, but still in a very quiet area.

I will be staying again if needed arises!!!!! Love the place"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You want for nothing here! Debra has thought of everything you could possibly need during your stay.

This was my second stay but won‚Äôt be my last! Thank you Debra!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is such a cute little house, it was perfect for me. The neighborhood is quiet and traveling as a single woman alone, even more important to me was that I felt very safe the entire time. The hostess really makes it feel homey, I really appreciated having coffee and filters that first morning so I didn't have to run out and get some. Having a washer and dryer was so nice, I brought my own detergent not expecting there to be supplied. She even had drier balls! It's all those little touches that made this little house such a joy to stay at."

The kitchen was stocked with all pots/pans and utensils needed for cooking most meals. There is also a crock pot available for use. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and there were small essentials available for showering/bathing.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our second stay & it was just as wonderful as the first. It is one of the cleanest AirBNBs we have ever stayed. The kitchen is well stocked if you want to cook & you have a very clean full sized fridge for your groceries. Plenty of towels and & all the linens are in new condition. I also Like that they make the effort to recycle by providing separate trash. The place feels like home. We will be back next year!

2020-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"House is near Briar Cliff University. House amenities were up to date and everything inside was very clean & neat. It had everything we needed for a week long stay (Kitchen, Laundry, WiFi, Television, etc...). It is not a large house; but it's a charming little place and was much nicer and more enjoyable than a hotel room by far...and at a fraction of the cost! I would recommend this option to anyone needing a place to stay when visiting Siouxland!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This tiny house is awesome! And Debra is an awesome host! I loved living here for 3 months, it was a great place to be quarantined in. I had no idea when I began my stay on March 2 that I would be living here during a pandemic. The layout of the house was perfect and felt very spacious. I had the perfect amount of storage and the space met all of my needs. I will definitely be staying here again if I can find a time that it is not already booked. Thanks for the perfect 3 month stay!"

Debra added thoughtful touches such as a full length mirror for dressing, hair dryer, ‚òïÔ∏èCoffee maker, toaster, amazon fire stick, WiFi, extra pillows, blankets and towels. The house has a washer and dryer which came in handy on a 5 day stay. The kitchen is tiny like the house but big enough and equipped to cook all your meals. The entire place was newly remodeled, super cute & sparkling clean. Debra was always quick to respond and offered several suggestions for local restaurants. We will definitely be staying again the next time we are in town."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was great. It was a large space to be with a bigger group.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We came to town to have family game night with other family members from out of town and some from in town. This spot served its purpose just right. It was spacious, met my cleanliness standards, was stocked with ammenities for convenience, which was great for the couple things we forgot for family dinner and breakfast cooked at the house! It was nice we could bring our dog along as well. One thing to be aware of is there are steep stairs to get to the main family room, so be cautious with folks with mobility challenges. This detail didnt diminish the value we felt we got from being able to accomodate almost 10 family members overnight. Would suggest this property to others."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time at the hamilton house and everything was amazing! Great parking and awesome communication with the host! Looking forward to coming back again!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Zac's place was our favorite AirBnB stay so far. The pictures really didn't do it justice...it's beautiful! We traveled with extended family and a small child, and EVERYONE had plenty of space to either be together or have some quiet downtime.
We were in town for our sons' wrestling tournament and hosted a family style Sunday dinner for a handful of wrestlers. Zac was super welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed (even a crockpot). In addition, he was always quick to respond to each and every question. This will be our top choice over the next few years as we continue to make trips for BCU events and to see our boys."
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Second time staying and it was as great as the first time! Quiet location, beautiful kitchen and cozy rooms. A great place to stay if you‚Äôre coming to the area!"

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,We had a blast! The place was nice and clean. Zach was very attentive to all of our questions and needs. Would definitely recommend it. Ideal for a private party. The location was great and peaceful neighborhood.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family rented Zach's place in Sioux City, IA. We attended hometown Christams in LeMars, IA. The house was awesome! My children and grand children loved that we could stay together in one place. Zach was friendly and responded very quickly if a question arose. We got snow on Friday night that was not expected. Zach reached out to me and stated "" he will have someone take care of the driveway for me"". The house is located down the street from several restuarants, gas stations, grocery store. Pretty much anything you need is less than five minutes away. I thought it was awesome that I had access to park in the garage. The house is spacious and has all the items you need to feel right at home. If you find yourself in Sioux City, IA and needing a place to stay. I highly recommend booking Zach's place. You will feel right at home."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a fantastic time staying here and visiting family for my brother's wedding. The house accommodating all staying with us and even those who visited for dinner - which the house was stocked for me to cook up a feast! My kids loved the space and big table to play with their toys and legos. The TV was accommodating so we could easily sign into all the things we have at home. The house was a quick 5min drive into town and was incredibly easy for all of our out of town family to find from their hotels. We can't wait to come back and book with Zachary for our next visit!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This was a beautiful home with everything listed/shown plus some!

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Great place to stay. Easy access, plenty of parking, and great amenities. Would recommend."
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,The home was immaculate and everything was as described! My family and I all said that we would definitely stay here again. Everything had been recently remodeled and was beautiful. There several balconies we could step out onto to overlook the forested area in the back. Plenty of parking on a quiet road and everything you needed was close by.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"We attended our nephew‚Äôs wedding at the Country Event center and this place is about 5 blocks from there so it was very convenient. Place was spotless, beds were comfortable and the coffee appreciated. Would definitely stay again."
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,Zachary was very prompt in communicating right from our initial inquiry on the stay. We were in town for a wedding down the road at Country Celebrations and it was the perfect location. Beautiful view out the back! Nice and updated interior.
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,Host is very responsive and kind. Instructions are concise and the house was just perfect for what we needed! Thanks so much!
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Beds were very comfortable and the back woods very senic
I would stay again"
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"There were 6 adults and 3 children that stayed together at Zachary's place. Overall, the place was very clean and inviting with lots of amenities for children (rollable changing pad, kids board games, kids toothpaste, etc.) The biggest con for us was the couch situation. The picture made it appear that the 3 couches were normal couches... they were futons. Each and every one of them. I can see that this might make more ""sleeping space"" but it made for a very uncomfortable lounging experience. The futons (and under the futons) were very clearly where dogs had been as there was so much white dog hair. Other than this, Zachary was very responsive to any inquiries and like I said, there were a lot of great amenities. It was hard to be next door to an inground pool and playground and not be able to use it - haha!! I think the other thing that should be mentioned to anyone reading this review is the beds are all memory foam mattresses as of this review - becoming too soft over time."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"The interior was beautiful, an excellent place for our group of friends. Easy to get to, communication was great, lots of little extras that made our stay perfect! We loved this house and will definitely stay there the next time we're in town!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Zachary‚Äôs property was more then expected. Updated, clean, plenty of room for all of the kids to run. There‚Äôs steep stairs but there was a baby gate!
Since I‚Äôm a super host I was going to give Zach tips, but it was beyond clear he doesn‚Äôt need my tips! He‚Äôll be super host in no time!!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was a beautifully done home. Had everything we needed and more. It was clean, which is highly important to everyone in my family. The forest was cool and we got a picture of a deer wandering out there this morning! Great stay, hope to return one day."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had an amazing stay at the Hamilton Home with our furry friends! The host was incredibly accommodating and made sure that our furry companions were welcomed and comfortable throughout our stay. The home itself was spacious, clean and had all the amenities we needed to make ourselves at home.
What really impressed us about the Hamilton Home was how pet friendly it was. There were plenty of amenities for our furry friends such as food and water bowls, and the host even had toys. It was evident that the host went the extra mile to make sure that furry friends felt just as welcome as the human companions.
The space was bright and airy with plenty of natural light streaming through the windows. The decor was stylish and modern with plenty of seating options and a fully equipped kitchen. The bedrooms were cozy and inviting with plush beds and plenty of pillows and blankets. The bathrooms were spotless and well stocked with fresh towels and toiletries."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was exactly what we needed for a weekend for sports! The owner was quick to respond to any and every question! The place was large enough to host a team meeting before the event too! Will be coming back next year!

2023-02-01,5,Group trip,Amazing stay. Pet friendly. Just make sure you‚Äôve got the door codes figured out. Found it tricky getting back into the house late that evening and we unfortunately had to disturb the host‚Äôs night to unlock the doors manually. Other than that a perfect spot.
2023-02-01,5,Group trip,"Zach was great, inside the house was great.
The big table mad it easy to have dinner and play games with the family.
AS good as most places you might stay."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Hamilton House was lovely. It‚Äôs near most anything in Sioux City, Iowa. The house was pristine, modern, clutter free, and wonderful. With five double beds there was room for all of us. Zach was a great host with immediate communication, flexibility, and kindness. We will definitely book again next time we are in town for an event."
