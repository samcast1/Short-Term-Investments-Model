2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed 4 nights in Vincennes at this home away from home. A great size for a small family - cozy space, and everything we needed. Visiting in spring, the weather could vary from cool to very warm and we really appreciated Andrea checking in to see if the temp in the space was comfortable. We had a great spring break trip here. Grateful to Andrea for having us!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,Exactly as described and Andrea was very responsive and helpful!!!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Neat place. Medical Clinic turned Airbnb. Would definitely stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Home sweet home! All was great and Andrea was great. She was in contact with us a lot to make sure we were comfortable. Thank you for sharing your place with us. We never used the smaller bedroom. The king bed and all was awesome. Thanks again and we would be staying there again if I’m ever up that way.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean and comfortable. The beds were super comfy and we felt very at-home in this home.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this house! It felt as clean in each room as if brand-new. So many nice extras & features. Lovely kitchen is efficiently planned, bright and fully equipped! Bathroom was so nice, even had luxurious shower heads. Plentiful fresh linens, cozy living room & TV. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We thoroughly felt at home at Angie's place. It was well stocked in the kitchen and VERY clean! Beds were comfortable, lots of towels, and extra blankets for TV viewing. The enclosed front porch was a nice extra as a place to relax. Parking off the street was convenient. My only concern is that there are a few very steep steps at the front door - would not be handicap accessible if needed. Thanks for everything, Angie!!! We would definitely stay here again."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is clean and has all kitchen utensils. For laundry you need to go to a laundromat, for food you can go to a nearby supermarket (about 500 meters)."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,Overall had a great stay while here. She even got chocolates and wine for my partner and I. My partner also left their toiletries and she was kind enough to ship them to us. Great host for our first time using Airbnb.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect central spot for what we needed. It is very much an old office converted, And there are things that are “officy”- but Andrea made sure to include everything you could need and it is very comfortable . Plus I had to work so the desk area was very useful. The laundry mat down the street was a little father than I hoped, but it was still close enough to allow me to do a load. Ladies, bathroom lighting for makeup is perfection. Mommas, Instacart does deliver but not many drivers. Recommend using Walmart delivery instead. It was very fast!! If we’re ever driving back thru, we’d love to stay again"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The description matched the location perfectly. Was in town for work and it was great to come back to a home style stay. Will stay again if I come back!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our 4 night stay in a fun 2 bedroom apartment which was spacious and clean. Andrea was helpful with the area as far as food, parks and fast to respond! It made our trip to a regional baseball tournament very enjoyable! We also happened to win and will advance to the World Series for 12 yr olds Cal Ripcan !"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was amazing! Andrea is awesome she is the type of person who really cares about her guests and what their needs are. If I could give more stars I would. The home is literally within a 5 minute driving distance of everything. I will definitely be staying here again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it! Gonna book again next year!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the second time I’ve stayed here and Andrea is so consistently hospitable and willing to make sure everything is done to make me feel right at home. Great little place whether your staying 3 days or 3 weeks! Highly recommend it!

2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"Our family came into town for a wedding and the space was great, there are 4 bedrooms for 2 people each, so sleeps 8 comfortably. The only issue we had was the bath towels in the closet were damp, so maybe the turn around was a bit quick? But all-in-all it was good."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent property. VERY spacious. Looking forward to going back.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,I will have to stay again as soon as possible. the pizza I was cooking dropped some meat and started to smoke it set off the smoke alarm they called me right away to check on things and it only about ten minutes for the fire department to check it out.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Quick and easy especially for our last minute booking!!! Thank you Vince!
2023-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This home was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The open kitchen, dining and living room were welcoming and suitable for family or multiple guests. There was a nice sized deck for relaxing, a beautiful tree for natural shade and a spa (did not use the spa, so not sure it worked, but I imagine it would be great!). There was also a BBQ that we did not check out, but it was available. When I had a question I texted the host (they left their contact number for us), and the response was right away. I even had to call early on a Saturday morning and the host was very helpful and pleasant.
This location is a good deal for the money. Note that 2 of the 4 bedrooms have 2 twin beds in each- so suitable for children, not adults. I would stay there again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay at Sue’s place. Shakamak State Park and Greene-Sullivan State Forest are close by and beautiful places to hike. Sue was a lovely host and even fried us some fresh caught bluegill for lunch. Overall, great price and had what we needed!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"This was the best experience we’ve ever had in an air bnb. The host, Sue was extremely nice and was quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had. The place was amazing and cozy. We were here for work but it felt like a vacation with the cute place we stayed in. Would 100% be back !!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Sue was amazing. Our 18 year old son was traveling from pa to Kansas for the harvest and she took extra time to communicate with me about my concerns of him having a safe place too stay. She even cooked him supper. This was a little out of his way but definitely worth the extra travel. Highly recommend and hopefully got a new friend!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Nice place
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a rustic, quiet place that is it! you have all the basics you would expect for a tiny cabin. Fun adventure. Be prepared to drive a few minutes to get a restaurant.
It was exactly what we were expecting and enjoyed the stay."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,was just a described would definantly stay there again
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was lucky to stay at Sue's place for the total eclipse and couldn't have asked for more! Carousel House is a cute tiny home with all the amenities you could want, and Sue clearly cares about her guests and the space. She went out of her way to check to make sure we were settled and had everything we could need. We loved the proximity to local parks. Would stay again if we were in the area!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,She was very accommodating and communicative! enjoyed our stay!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,She was a great host. She was very accommodating and verified that we had everything we needed.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"If i could rate her higher i would! Beautiful home, beautiful area and wonderful hosts! Definitely would return!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This has an absolutely terrific set up for a tiny house. I have stayed in many tiny houses, but very few have a washer and dryer. I absolutely love the Set up. I am thinking fall and spring are some of the best times to stay here as there’s a good little light available for grilling, using a fire pit, and a picnic bench with a nice park only a few steps away. Sue is fantastic and literally right there if you needed her. They did a great job with this place. Please note that it is not a cabin, like you would think of In the middle of nowhere on top of a Mountain, ￼It’s simply a play on words. It is set up like a cabin, but it is a tiny house in the middle of a country town. That is perfect… Absolutely perfect.￼ Thank you, Sue, and Charlie for being so hospitable. I’ll be back.￼"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Great little cabin! Sue was very communicative and friendly. The place was clean and cozy. I’d definitely stay again!
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Sue was very friendly and responsive. We had a great weekend, as we were not looking for local attractions. We just planned to be in a secluded cabin and go to the off road park. The place was nice but just know it is a fixed up shed and is on a street corner with old mobile homes behind it. The other reviews, the word 'entire' in the description and the price made it seem like we were renting a full size cabin that was more secluded. Again, the Carousel Cabin is a nice little place for a single or young couple for a weekend and Sue was a very good host."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Sue, we absolutely fell inlove with this little slice of seclusion heaven! You guys had the place warming up and a blanket in the dryer for extra warmth(Gabriel really appreciated that)! Little gestures of kindness like that warm my heart. Peaceful night sleep and it is absolutely gorgeous inside and out i love the wood work and the simplicity with some modern amenities made this place perfect for us thank you again ma'am. Happy turkey day!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to get away and great experience at Redbird!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Sue and Charlie were absolutely amazing hosts! I got the chance to stay with them for three months and they embody what it means to be hospitable! They quickly became family to me! Their warmth, kindness, and generosity were out of this world! Sue and Charlie would always make sure I got my packages of books for school and Sue brought over many hot meals! I also got a tour of the town and great recommendations for places to eat! Being away from the city was so peaceful and just what I needed. Sue and Charlie made me feel right at home from day one! For me it was an unforgettable experience and the best air B&B hosts I have ever had! Sue and Charlie are amazing people and I’m sure going to miss staying there! They went above and beyond in meeting expectations and provided a cozy, quiet, and peaceful place to stay! I can’t say enough about how wonderful they are and my stay was! I hope to come back soon! To anyone looking for a great stay, look no further! This is a stellar stay!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sue is an excellent host and communication was clear and easy. The cabin is well appointed, clean, and everything works. It’s a quiet little town surrounded by cornfields, as you would expect in Indiana. Carousel cabin is highly recommended."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect escape and just what I needed and was looking for. I had 2 weeks in a city hotel. Sue's cabin was in a rural area quiet and peaceful. I would recommend if you are looking for a break away from the big city.

The host was very quick to respond and was very kind! The place was clean and had everything we needed for the night. At the time, the place did not have wifi but she was currently working on it. Even though we did not have it, we had enough to do around the place and had a TV to play some games! 10/10 would come back again!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Highly recommend this host. Was able to reserve last minute which was great because I was coming into town due to a family emergency.

"" Thank you & hope to return! soon ?"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This was a great no frills spot for us while in town for a wedding. The location right across from the park and close to downtown was perfect. Our only complaints were that the beds weren’t very comfortable and the furniture was sparse—could have used a proper coffee table and a full-length mirror. Overall, it suited our needs and was a more affordable option than the local hotels."

Suggests: need a long Mirror, click the shower head holder, needs something stronger to hold the shower head. Kleenex. Maybe curtains, to give a homey feel. A small coffee table to hold drinks. Otherwise pretty nice! We would stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was awesome for us since we were visiting family in Lawrenceville, Il. it had all the amenities needed for our 5 day stay, close to a beautiful park, and was within walking distance of downtown. Our host were very communicable and gave great suggestions."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very clean and comfortable. There is a park across the street for walking, very close to shops and restaurants. Best value for the money. I will definitely stay here again my next visit to Indiana!"
2023-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, but small- which we knew. Beds were comfy- plenty of pillows/blankets; kitchen was well stocked with items needed. Bathroom is tiny, bathtub was tough to get into for a few of us elderly, and there were no safety bars; but it was clean, and we managed.
Visit the park across the street, it’s beautiful and a nice view from the front porch. It’s a nice walk. The house is convenient to everything in Vincennes.
We found that loading and unloading from the back porch was much easier for us. And it was convenient…and we felt that it was safer for our car so it wasn’t parked on the street.
Some suggestions for owner: 1. some sort of table for eating on- msybe a coffee table that pulls up to table height; 2. Full length mirror somewhere ;3. Written instructions inside the house for check out.
Overall, nice place, we would stay again. Thank you!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place to stay and super responsive host. We were able to park and walk to the nearby restaurants which was a nice perk! My only observation was the shower head is a little weird but usable so no deal breaker for me. Will be staying again next time I head out that way.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house had everything we needed for two couples. It’s within walking distance of downtown and right across the street from George Rogers Clark Monument and Park.
We hope it’s available for our next visit to Vincennes."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was great and located centrally to the university and downtown. We even met the officer that I'm believe takes care of the place for Vince, nice guy! would recommend to friends and will stay again if we ever come back down."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vince’s place was cozy, comfortable, and spotlessly clean. Really nice, comfortable bedding & furniture. Great location! Very close to downtown & the interstate. Also, there is a lovely park directly across the street. The hosts were very responsive & helpful."

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Thanks for a comfortable place to hang with my friend!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I came to Vincennes on 4/20/23 for an event at Vincennes Univ for my son. My late husband's 80 yr old Aunt came w/me. After a full day of traveling, an evening of visiting & exploring, & rain storms coming in, we decided to skip stay the night rather than drive 3.5 hours back home. I called the hotel I usually stay at but the few rooms left were far more costly than usual, as were all other hotels. I finally remembered Airbnb but since it was now 10pm, I wasn't sure I'd get a response. I was pleasantly surprised Vince & his local manager responded very quickly. DJ met us there & assisted my Aunt w/the stairs & me w/our luggage. We enjoyed chatting w/him while we settled in. Note: Beds on the firmer side comfy w/lots of cozy pillows & blankets! Shower has great water pressure! Basement has lots usable space. Only wish: Front porch chairs to enjoy that stunning view of the Monument!! We 100% loved our stay! I hope to bring my kids & grands to explore Vincennes & stay your other home!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Ty for allowing me to stay at your place.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,perfect space near university. would return!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband was in Vincennes on business. I messaged Vince, received an answer, rented this house, and my husband was able to get in. working about 15 minutes. The space was comfortable, clean, and ready to be occupied."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"The house was exceptionally clean, and we found everything we needed. The bathroom and kitchen were quite small, but they were sufficient for our overnight stay."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is such a cozy and clean home. We enjoyed our time here. Location is nice! You can walk right across the road to the river and catch a sunet view. Plenty of parking on the road and it was quiet. I would book again while visiting family

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,really enjoyed staying at the loft ... comfortable beds ... anything needed to cook a meal was there only thing you needed was the food ...cleaning supplies and laundry supplies were there if needed ... as i told him before I left my only complaint was we had to head back home lol
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay close to Downtown
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a beautiful home in a quaint town. We enjoyed our stay!
The vaulted ceiling, industrial brick walls and metal window frames made this a unique place to spend the night.
Sound and light carried throughout the space, because there are walls to divide the rooms but no traditional plaster ceilings covering each room.
Despite this, I would stay there again. It was calming and homey- a plus with children in tow! The accommodations were very clean and comfortable."
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"The location matched the host's description and our expectations.
Being a loft space, privacy is lessened compared to a more traditional residence--the room walls do not reach the building's roof, so sound carries throughout the entire space. This isn't an issue if you know what to expect, but some folks who signed the guestbook apparently did not anticipate this when booking.
We stayed during a spectacular total solar eclipse in the city, and this space provided a location that was easily walkable to the main community celebration and to some of the local restaurants and shops. The shortage of lodging in the area for the event drove up prices for accommodations, but this listing offered a relatively reasonable value compared to other nearby options.
The host was very friendly, and her responses to any questions we had were prompt and helpful.
This was our first Airbnb stay, and we can only hope that future bookings will be as smooth and pleasant as Jessica helped make this one."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It is an excellent place to stay in and large enough for a family.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"A/C had not been on long enough to cool the rooms down. Besides that, everything was great! Thank you for being the best hosts!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Excellent place to stay in Washington. Very spacious and very affordable. Highly recommend.
Only caveat's:
It is a loft as described, and the walls do not go all the way to the ceiling. Thus sound travels and this includes Bathrooms. They do include some white noise machines and that did help. But be aware of this.
Parking can be tricky in that you can park in front of the place, but you may be the only car on the road. I didn't feel comfortable being the only car parked there, so I parked on the side of the building. However, I had to move first thing Monday morning so that i wasn't in the way of the work trailers parked there.
Finally, the master bed/bathroom does not have a door between the bathroom and the bedroom. So be aware of that.
Overall though a wonderful stay and I'd definitely stay there again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The home was clean and spacious. I really enjoyed my stay!
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Jessica’s place was a great find for our weekend. We came into the area for The Spirit of Vincennes weekend, our kids and parents were taking part as Rev War reenactors. It was a great spot to come back and relax after the long days in the sun. It’s a very cool space with a lots of room to spread out. Clean and comfortable!"

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,What an amazing little hidden gem in Washington IN. Perfect for a little weekend getaway!! Hoping to stay again in the future!! The kids even had a blast with the games that were available!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect place for us to stay while visiting our family. The apartment is very spacious, clean and had every thing we needed.

Jessica was quick to reply when I messaged her. We will definitely stay again!
Thanks for sharing your super cool apartment!!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Very unique place!
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,TheWrightAway was the perfect meeting spot between family from Indy and us from Southern Indiana. The industrial design of the converted loft is very cool and unique. We really loved the exposed brick and the huge windows. The kitchen was perfect for us to do a little cooking and then play games and get comfy in the living room. We would love to stay again in the future! 🤗
2022-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"One of the reasons we chose to stay here was the hot tub. Unfortunately, there was not enough hot water to fill the tub. We notified the owner and he came out immediately and told us everything working fine and that no one else had complained. We went to bed and, in the morning, we tried again to fill the tub. The hot water ran out before the tub was half full. There were dozens of dead flies and one cockroach. There were 2 gas fireplaces but neither worked. This place has so much unreached potential."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great space for a family to enjoy.
There were sound machines to help with sound traveling throughout the open space (low walls and tall ceilings), and the place was very clean and in good working order. The unique windows made for a truly one of a kind experience.
We used this as a jumping off point for Holiday World and we found the time change allowed us better mornings and the drive wasn't bad as we were able to enjoy the small towns around for places to see and eat.
Thanks for opening your space for us to enjoy, it added to our family vacation memories."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was very cute and cozy. Everything was very clean. Shane was helpful and answered every question i had right away. And I had a few. There several good restaurants within a mile. Or there was a full kitchen right there. It was about 25 minutes from where we needed to be, Sumner, IL. When we come back, we will definitely stay here again. And I recommend it to anyone staying in the area. It feels like home."
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"Great home. 1 bathroom, so that makes it a little tough with 6 people. It was a great place to stay for eclipse."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great little place! Lovely atmosphere and Shane was very communicative.
2024-03-01,4,Group trip,"Overall our stay worked and was fine.
I appreciated: Shane’s responsiveness, super easy check-in, plenty of towels, toiletries if you need them, hangers in the closet, nice carpet, extra blankets, heat and ac work quickly,
Could be better:
-One of the bedrooms did not have a door (open to the kitchen) and made it annoying and loud and less private for the person sleeping there.
-The only bathroom is in between two of the bedrooms so if you have to pee in the night you have to go through someone’s room to get to it.
-There was an annoying and somewhat loud banging/popping sound that came through the air vents intermittently (even through the night).
-There was no dishwasher and only one mug (but plenty of regular drinking glasses).
Things to note:
- The area of town is shabby (as is most of the town) but we didn’t have any issues.
-Some of the doors didn’t close/open well.
-The curtains are not opaque, so bring an eye mask if you need a dark room."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and very clean
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and comfortable. Thank you Shane!

2023-12-01,5,Group trip,"it was much better then staying in a hotel. clean, the bathroom had plenty of towels and even travel sized items in case we were missing items. the kitchen had enough to prepare meals. easy entry. if I had any wish at all, it would've been for a large table to play games on. would definitely stay there again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"What an amazing place, Teresa's listing reminds you of why you choose Airbnb's over hotels. The smell you are welcomed with when walking in lets you know that this place is going to be clean - and it delivers. Everything is spotless, attention to detail in literally everything. The room has everything you could need plus more. I was so thankful to open the fridge and find a cold water in there, with snacks upon entering as well. It was peaceful and quiet (in the room, the lobby, and outside). Bed was comfy and a basket of varying types (thankyou) of blankets helped create a cozy vibe. Teresa was extremely kind and double checked to make sure I got the check in details - she radiates positivity. If I had anything negative to say about Teresa's place, it would only be so no one else booked it up hahah. Truly perfect, thank you!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A home away from home , she thought about all the things that was needed to make your stay enjoyable . I have been to different places on vacation but this place exceeded then all, if you ever decide on staying here it will be your only get away all I can say give it a try it’s money well spent."

We will stay again in the future if we are in the area!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was our first time staying at an Airbnb rental. Teresa’s place was exceptionally nice and was more than what we expected. Teresa’s photos and descriptions on the rental were excellent. She was very quick to respond to any questions we had. We would definitely rent from her again and highly recommend this place to others.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"So cute!! I am in this area a few times a year but until now, I had no idea there was an Air BNB.
I wasn’t aware I needed to stay until 8:30pm. When contacting Teresa she responded almost instantly! I only needed a few hours sleep but her suit offered so much more. I wished I had more time to relax and enjoy it. The suit was extremely clean and beautifully decorated.
I will be definitely return when I am in the area."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect place to stay if in the Goose Pond FWA, Linton Indiana area. I am a wildlife photographer and have stayed here now several times. Very clean and quiet.

Highly recommend and we will also be using her in the future for future events!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Immaculate and tastefully decorated! The lobby and our suite smelled great! Water and a variety of snacks was provided in the lobby and our suite.

Teresa has a wonderful place with lots of added and thoughtful touches. I will stay here again and highly recommend her place if in the area. There is a great little coffee shop within walking distance as well.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Teresa is a fantastic host! Check-in instructions were detailed, keyless exit/entry made it a breeze. Suite was exactly as described and very comfy. Teresa checked in periodically during my stay, which was nice. Any time I'm in town this will be the first place I look to stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,I was traveling for work and booked Teresa’s place and it was so cozy and she was very welcoming. I would highly recommend it.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Teresa met us at the door. It was a lovely room and a lovely stay.

Would recommend"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a very cute spot to spend an overnight in Linton. I appreciated the attention to detail with fresh fruits, water bottles, assorted Keurig cups including English Breakfast Tea for this non-coffee drinker. There are several spots to plug in cords to charge phones etc. And the kitchen in the room would be helpful for anyone who was staying long enough to want to prepare meals. It is in an urban/city location with parking lots nearby, but the outside is nicely decorated and an attractive library is across the street. A bonus is the amazing donut shop a 2 minute walk away. We would definitely stay there again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I tell you what, I was not suspecting Teresa at 8:00 at night, or whenever I instantaneously decided I needed to temporarily 'run away' from work, to respond minutes after I sent a request to stay at her Air BnB.
Teresa was an excellent hostess and has such a sweet heart. Honestly I wish I could have paid more for how much I was accommodated for.
Even though, if you want to do something around the area is limited. If I ever had to stay a night somewhere this would definitely be the first spot I would look for in the area.
I appreciate your hospitality, Teresa."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A great place to stay. Bed is super comfortable, and everything was so clean and quiet. Theresa is amazing, she was so accommodating. Top notch I would definitely stay there again!!!"

Comfortable bed. Smartly decorated room. Fantastic A/C. Teresa was fantastic and very accomodating. I have another work trip in December and plan on staying again. I highly recommend staying at Teresa's place. If your experience is anything like mine, you'll be back. I am 100% certain of that, because I will be returning."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Pam was very friendly and communicative! We weren't sure wether my sister would be coming or if she would be bringing her dog; Pam was very understanding and worked with us. She was very thoughtful, and gave us the choice of decorating the Christmas tree ourselves, or having it already decorated before our arrival. Our daughters enjoyed decorating the tree, and everything else, with little cardinals! It was very helpful having a kitchen full of cookware and dishes with which we could cook and serve Christmas dinner! Pam was great!"
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"Wonderful host who was super helpful and responsive and a great place to stay. We had our Thanksgiving gathering here and it was absolutely perfect.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect location for privacy but also access to town. Well decorated and very nice amenities. Pam checked in appropriately but really anticipated every need!

Would highly recommend and give more stars if we could!!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a dream! A previous visitor stated he wanted to buy it and I do too! The outside was private and extremely peaceful. We were able to allow our pup to wander around the land while we sat and took in the scenery. The deck and outdoor lights created the best ambiance. The inside of the house was spotless and up to date, which is especially impressive in a rural location. The amenities, decorations, thoughtful touches (snacks AND wine!), and the communication were all top notch. We were even able to go to the Farmer's Market on Saturday, which was a great experience all on its own. Our stay exceeded our expectations. I hope to stay here again in the future and I would 100% recommend it to friends and family."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I will be staying here every time I come back to town. Pam’s attention to detail is evident down to her leaving a Texas themed BBQ apron for us laid among the grill tools. (We’re from Houston) Very comfy beds, pillows and linens. Place cooled way down despite the sweltering heat. Plenty of coffee. Lots of happy birds, and flickering fireflies enjoyable from the darling patio and shed. A great home away from home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the place, infact, I would like to buy this place. It was well located for a) we needed to do. The garage was great. We enjoyed the screened in patio area. All of the amenities were so helpful.

Suggestions
A small fenced in area out back would be marvelous since its pet friendly.
TV in bedroom. The tv reception was poor.
There maybe some lights out in kitchen and living room."

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage was a true gem. It had all of the amenities we needed and many extra touches that made it special. Nestled in the trees with the sun setting on the pond, the rolling lawn with horses grazing over in the field nearby and the sounds of nature made it a wonderful place to relax and unwind. The decor inside had a western log cabin feel. I’ll definitely be going back!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This guesthouse was in a beautiful space. only 5 minutes from the nearest Walmart and yet the feeling of being way out of town. The guesthouse was wonderful, the spaces were beautiful and ready to enjoy. Check in and out were easy. It was a great getaway."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a great option if you have a small family and are staying in the area! We have two little kids so this way a much better option than staying in a hotel in town. We loved how cute the cabin was as well as how quiet it was out in the countryside.

Most of the store’s /restaurants were closed by the time we Checked in, so that was kind of disappointing . We did go to impressed coffee and it was super affordable and a cute place. We actually just enjoyed the place! The beds were comfortable and everything was clean!

we enjoyed it a lot
If you follow the directions the place isn't hard to find
It's not for a person who has problems with stairs
I would definitely stay again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This location was unique and had a special flair to it. Very cool modern farmhouse décor, multi-level and open, gave the feeling of being ""connected"" to those staying, but had areas for privacy as well. Eclectic. Kitchen was well stocked, everything was very clean and not cluttered. Bed's were comfortable. Air conditioning was great and really needed during the heatwave! The ""master bedroom"" was missing AC, but they did provide fans and it turned out just fine. One note, there are stairs, so if there is a guest who cannot go up and down stairs (i.e. uses a walker), this is not the place for them.
I would definitely stay here again, the host was very pleasant and as mentioned, the interior was really special. One other note- the entrance if through an alley and returning alone at night was a little discerning. That said, the alley was well lit and I wont feel that way my next stay, just calling it out."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a wonderful stay. Apartment was very clean with plenty of sleeping areas. Dog friendly & with this apartment being in a great location to take the dogs for a stroll. Host was very responsive with very clear instructions & gave great suggestions of places to eat & spend our time.

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice house and good location close to Vincennes. The house was clean when we arrived. The beds were comfortable.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,These guys are awesome. We have stayed in a couple different properties they have and we are always satisfied! Great communication! We actually had a mix up this stay (all my fault) and thought we were checking out a day later than we actually were! It could have been a huge mess but DJ moved us down the road to another house for the last night so it all worked out great. He was extremely understanding and willing to get it worked out for us even though I’m the one that messed up my dates! Highly recommend staying at any of the houses they offer!

2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"My crew and I worked in the area for three weeks so we stayed here for that time. For a small business owner, it was a way better option than a hotel. For the price I paid here to house my crew, I would have had to pay double or more for multiple hotel rooms were you have to walk up and own stairs, share space with people you don’t know, etc. Here, we were able to get off work and relax. My wife came and cooked meals so I was able to save money on eating out too. We had a very nice stay."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,The place was well taken care of and we were accommodated well. Any question or concern I had was answered promptly. I would definitely recommend this place.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We rented this with our kids and grandkids for a family wedding in the area. It was prefect !! Close to everything that we needed. I wanted to pick this house up and move it to where I live. It is so cute, clean and homey feeling. Everything was just as described and DJ , the property manager, was great and answered the few questions I had.
It was a great value and offered a wonderful outdoor area for everyone !
We will definitely try to rent again if we are in the area ( already thinking not a bad drive from there to Holiday World sometime !)."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I own a business and we had some work across the river. We had 4-5 people there including my wife. It was way better and more comfortable than paying for 2 or 3 rooms at a hotel.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had the most wonderful stay here while in town. The bed was the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. The sunroom was the perfect space to chat and watch tv. It truly had everything we could need. I wish we could have stayed longer to just enjoy the surroundings. Thank you!!!
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We felt right at home. The house was clean and welcoming. Everything was labeled. We enjoyed sitting in the sun room and cooking on the grill.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed each other to havefamily together in one place for three days. We had lots to do outside of the house, but it was nice when we came to this comfortable place. My kids only suggestion would possibly be have a coffee pot in addition to a Keurig. Who would use this place again."
2023-04-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay at Vince's place. The check-in was super easy. We absolutely loved the heated sunroom and loved watching the animals in the huge backyard. We had a wedding at the Great Banquet Hall and it was only a 6 min drive.
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,My friends and i enjoyed this 3 bedroom home. We loved the sunroom the most! Everything was very neat and tidy in the home. The hosts were very responsive. We all would love to stay again in the future. Just a short drive to downtown Vincennes about 5-10 min away depending on your end location.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"My family and I loved our week long stay at this beautiful Airbnb in Vincennes, IN. The location is right on a main road, but in a peaceful rural area. I enjoyed seeing rabbits and American robins during the day and numerous sparkling stars in the sky above at night. My aunt especially enjoyed the kitchen. We ended up cooking at home each day instead of eating out at a restaurant because the space really does feel like a home away from home. My family was also impressed by the amenities, which really exceeded our expectations. There was plenty of cookware, dinnerware, and linens. And most importantly, COFFEE! The weather was cold during our stay, so there being plenty of extra cozy blankets was a huge plus.
Vince truly is an excellent host. It's like he anticipated everything we'd need, so I didn't have to contact him during our stay with any concerns or questions. If available, I would like to stay at this property again. Thank you."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful (the back porch is where all our time was spent) and the property manager was extremely helpful and friendly! Amazing stay

2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house is a fantastic stay, especially if you have young children. The play structure and thoughtful kid-friendly touches like board and card games, multiple screens throughout the home, and large private yard we’re exactly the right thing for our family. It is *very* close to shopping and entertainment in town, but feels miles away once you’re there."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house is just as nice as the photos. It is well stocked with the basics and the beds were shockingly comfortable. We would definitely stay here again without reservations.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a great time while in town visiting family. We instantly felt right at home. The house is in a great spot just outside Vincennes. We will definitely be back!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,we really enjoyed our stay! it was out in the country but not far from the University.

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,all good
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was spotless and so well appointed. Everything you might need including boxes of soft tissues in almost every room!
Clear easy to understand instructions for everything that needed instructions and an owner who is easy to contact and quick to respond. What more can you ask?
The sun room is the crowning glory, with a view that is calming and restful. I watched a squirrel on the play equipment and thought he'd go down the slide, but he didn't. That was the only disappointment of our stay!
We would most probably rent again when visiting family in Vincennes.
The Burton's, Orlando, FL."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wow, I have stayed at quite a few airbnbs and I have never seen one that was so thoughtfully appointed. The kitchen and bathrooms had every amenity you could think of and everything was carefully labelled. The design and layout worked beautifully for our family. if you are thinking about staying here, don't hesitate! I hope we have a reason to come back to Vincennes someday."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is a fantastic home! Plenty of room, has everything you could imagine, great kitchen, sun room was great to hang out in, the owner and caretaker are great and were very accommodating. Has all the Tech you want, TVs and stuff, nice grill, big yard etc... Highly recommend"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place for us to be able to have plenty of room for hanging out together, big living room and dining room, also enough bedrooms for everyone to have their own space. Full eat-in kitchen, nice to get groceries and the kids have the snacks they enjoy and saved money by cooking meals. Code entry made it easy for coming and going, no keys to keep track of. Quiet neighborhood was nice for taking walks with the kids. They even discovered a swing set across the street at the church. Great place, will stay again when visiting family."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Traveled from Florida to attend granddaughter's graduation from Lincoln Trail College. Couldn't ask for better place to stay. Peaceful, able to relax after day of packing up. Recommended by daughter who also stayed here last year."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful stay at Kaylees for all the out of towners coming together for a funeral. It was such a better experience to have us all together in a house instead of separate hotel rooms while going through the emotional toll of saying goodbye to someone. The house was spacious and comforting and clean. The outside traffic can be a little noisy occasionally, and in the dark it would be easy to miss the house other than that - perfect stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super nice place!
2023-10-01,5,Group trip,"Kaylee’s home was very safe,clean and comfortable.She made our stay feel like we where at home.Very respectful host wouldn’t mind staying at her home.Thanks for the hospitality kaylee!!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The listing was just as described, no surprises. We usually stay at a hotel in town when we visit but it's not convenient to host visitors in a hotel room --- the living room in this rental was spacious with lots of room for our toddler grandson to play and the rest of us to sit comfortably. I didn't have the need to contact the host as she was proactive in providing needed information but based on communication received, I feel she would be responsive. I would rent this property again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Kaylee was extremely responsive. The place had lots of extra space. We appreciate staying there.
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,I would have liked a 11 or 12 checkout time had to hussel for 10. I will ask for later next time.. No complaints… Robinson is a wonderful town!!! Thank you very much and pet friendly!!

The house was literally 2 blocks from the 3rd tee box and right down the road from everything else that was needed. Kaylee allowed us to use our portable gas grill (used in the driveway away from the house), and we ate great home cooked meals like we were at home. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"House was well worth the money. Everything you needed in the kitchen big living room and a couch you’ll think about just staying asleep on. Neighbor is peaceful, we grilled out on the back of our truck each night. Wish we could book it again."

There are plenty of places to relax and enjoy time with family. There is a full kitchen with working appliances, a huge living room and dining area with a comfy couch!

I did not realize that at first."

The house is simple but comfortable and clean. And Kaylee was an excellent host - quick to communicate with us and answer our questions. The house is on a busy road and there is some traffic noise. If you are a light sleeper, pack ear plugs. We always travel with earplugs so it was no bother to us. This home is a great value and served us very well."

2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This is a three level house. The upstairs is a very quiet place with two bedrooms and a little living area and full bathroom. The kitchen, family rooms/TV room, and master bedroom are the most wonderful places for family together if you have a big group. Very spacious. The basement is huge. The beds are great, but the noise level of the heating and air-conditioning unit is very loud. The family that was going to sleep down there ended up sleeping upstairs. However, it would be a great area for playing games, and let kids runoff steam. My family enjoyed this place very much."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a little expensive for us only because we only needed 3 beds I could have got a smaller one but it was well worth the price especially if you needed all the beds they had available

2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"This house was perfect for our needs. We were pleasantly surprised by the addition of bunk beds in the master bedroom which was great for our 2 kids. The only reason this house was not a 5 was due to the location. The neighborhood is okay, but we pulled in Friday night to the smell of marijuana from the neighbors. We also heard loud mufflers throughout the night and a nearby bar blared music until 3am. That being said, the house was plenty spacious and clean. I would recommend this house if visiting Washington."

2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We chose Naomi & Steve’s Washington home bc it was an hour’s drive to Holiday World. We could have chosen somewhere closer, but were smitten with the home when we came across it. It had plenty of room for our crew of six not to be cramped. It was perfect. Definitely worth the drive.
It’s location was right in the heart of the town with restaurants, bars & grocery stores only minutes away.
The home was freshly remodeled with everything we needed. We couldn’t have asked for anything better for the weekend we had planned."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay with the family. Very clean, inviting, and comfortable. Lots of room for everyone, close to everything you need, and Naomi is so great! Very responsive and nice!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This property is immaculate! It was better than its own description. We knew from the pictures that it would be spacious but it was even better than the pictures. Each space was carefully decorated with small resting areas away from the main living area. Perfect for group and family travel as it provides quiet areas for people to rest and relax.
The beds were EXCEPTIONALLY comfortable. The best I've experienced in nearly 10 years of using AirBnB.
Naomi was very responsive to any questions or comments and I enjoyed our limited interaction.
Definitely a treasure for the town of Washington and the surrounding Knox and Daviess counties.
P. S. We ate breakfast everyday at Benjy's and were never disappointed."

It is situated on a semi-busy road and has several off-street parking spots. We had a positive experience!"

2020-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay - have stayed there before when in town on business.
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,The house was more than what I expected. The pictures do it no justice. There’s so much space I didn’t know what to do with. Fairly easy to find. Just might book it again in a few months!!!
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay. Small town, good food at Bobe's"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house has been remodeled, and still has that “new house” smell that makes you feel like you’re the first to stay-which we loved!

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Grace has everything ready for her guests. The apartment is comfortable, spacious, and well-located in Vincennes. She answered your question promptly."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Grace's Downtown Loft Apartment is better than the description.
While it is described as two bedroom, 2 bath, the apartment is roomy! With bedrooms on opposite ends of a long hall, all sleep perfectly.
It is an renovated old building when you walk in, but trust me, keep walking!
The decor is industrial (open beam ceiling) meets country chic (adorable chalk painted retro outside/modern inside refrigerator), meets glam (gorgeous lighting and massive clawfoot soaking tub). Her style is impeccable.
No worries if you forgot something because Grace certainly did not. There are plenty of closets with hangers, a filtered water pitcher, a basket of hair clips by the soaking tub, 3 types of hair curling irons, clothes iron and steamer, a variety of book genres, comfy sofas and beds, lots of towels, and new kitchen appliances.
There is plenty of parking nearby. The ability to carry your luggage up a high staircase is a must.
I'll no longer select the Hampton. Grace is truly a super host!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot!
