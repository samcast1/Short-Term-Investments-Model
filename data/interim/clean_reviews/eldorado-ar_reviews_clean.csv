2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very comfortable and so clean. We were in town for our son's wedding. We had a great stay.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family visited for a graduation, we had a wonderful time,great experience very clean home, beautiful spacious back yard ,quit/peaceful and private. There is no tv in the rooms but no big deal we brought our projector for at night and used the wall for the screen connected it to our laptop it worked our just fine. This host was very responsive and the instructions were easy to follow. We didn’t encounter any issues during our stay. There was a gas station right across the street and Walmart 7-10min away. I highly recommend this host we will definitely revisit this place every time we visit Arkansas. If in doubt don’t be it’s worth it book this host. 10/10"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is my 3rd time staying at his property and the place is always spotless and amazing. I’ll be back every time we’re in the area.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Manpreet's home was spectacular. Very clean, everything was new, felt very at home. Manpreet himself was great to communicate with and a pleasant experience. We will defiantly book again when in town."
2024-04-01,4,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay. The house was perfect for our family. Very clean and cozy. The town had an issue with their sewer system so we ended up cutting our stay short, but Manpreet was on top of trying to figure out the problem and a solution. We couldn't have asked for a better host! We look forward to returning in the future!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Manpreet was a great host! Responded quickly to my request, and also responded quickly if I messaged while we were in Camden. The only complaint is that the walls are thin and that neighborhood is very noisy.
Not a complaint, but noteworthy - both beds are firm, as well as the living-room furniture, but they are all also immaculately clean!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Big place with all the necessities you need and close to downtown Camden. Recommend staying here !

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely beautiful home. We would definitely stay again. Home was clean and provided all the necessary supplies. We loved the personal touch. The only thing that could have been better was the grass was not cut other than that it was perfect. Large back yard and plenty of space on the inside. You you are a person that enjoys a tv in the bedroom, there is no tv in neither bedroom but that was ok for us."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,The clean house and location were good. The surroundings were also quiet. This is the accommodation I want to use again:) I had a good stay

2024-03-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice little apartment, in a historic building. Everything was very very clean and tidy. The WiFi was messed up, but other than that I have no complaints. Very good little apartment for the price."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"we enjoyed the comfortable bed and cozy kitchen,felt right at home"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Airbnb was cute and clean! We informed the host ahead of time that we would be arriving late into the evening and they were accommodating and allowed us to check in late.
2023-11-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Found the location very easily. I had a little trouble understanding the code for the building, but that was more my fault. The kitchen had dishes in the sink, so I put them away. The building is very old and there are several very nice tenants living there but unfortunately a few smoke, you could smell the smoke inside the room. Having the room next to the road made sleeping a little tough, you can hear the vehicles as they pass by. Otherwise, this wasn't a bad place, just a few issues that could be resolved."
2023-09-01,4,Stayed over a week,"The picture doesn’t do it justice. Very quiet, clean..good location if you’re planning to attend an event downtown. Close to hospital for traveling medical professionals."

Owners were very accommodating and responsive. We will definitely use again!"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed one night,"This place was very clean and comfortable and easy to access. It was perfect for a quick overnight stay on a long road trip. I think the only thing that could be improved upon is better lighting when parking outside. I couldn't park in the front of the building where it was better lit due to it being a full parking lot. I had to park on the side, where it was quite dark at night. Luckily, I figured out that the window above the bed looks out directly on the parking area where I parked my car, so I could literally park directly under my bedroom window and have my car right outside a few feet away. I would definitely stay here again if I were passing through town and needed a quick overnight stay in the future."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,So easy to communicate and so responsive and kind!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Mumtaz and Dinu are amazing hosts. The apartment was spacious enough and clean, with recent renovations.

2019-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"We only needed a place for the night to sleep. Bed was comfortable but only one bedside table. We needed one on each side of the bed for our CPap machines. The side of the faucet for hot water was broken in the bathroom, therefore, no hot water to shave. House is dark and stuffy. You have to remove your shoes at the door but no chair by front door. Clean beautiful wooden floor, no carpet. Beautiful antique furniture in the bedroom. House needs un --cluttering. For the price it was ok."

Very clean, great location and just a beautiful little home. Jamie kept great communication for anything that I needed. I really can’t say enough about this stay except I know where I’ll be looking first for when I’m in town again!"
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place close to downtown and the Arts District. Also an easy drive to the golf course (Mystic Creek) if you're looking for someplace besides a hotel. Bed is comfortable and as an airbnb host ourselves, we appreciate adequate places for plugs and USB ports for chargers."
2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"El Dorado is a great weekend adventure, the shops and people are Americana at its best. Jamie knew what was happening in town, and had great recommendations. We were already discussing what we plan to do on our next trip back... before we finished packing to leave... the house is also wonderfully peaceful to sleep in... but still set your alarm just in case... check out comes too early."

2019-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Jamie's home was quite welcoming. Jamie himself is very open and friendly. He was very accomodating to any requests that I had and gave me pointers on the local scenes/scenery. His home was about 12 minutes from my job and there was never a problem with traffic. Many good restaurants in the neighborhood, and Walmart not far away. I had a great stay for close to a month. Thanks for sharing your home with me Jamie, hopefully your home will be available next time I have to be in the area. I would love to be a part of your home again. Thank you."
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, location, location! This home is perfectly situated for going anywhere in El Dorado. Based in the downtown area, it’s just 6 mins walk from the Main Street where the stores and cafes can be found.
The house is very pleasant and I felt at home right away. Of course much of that was due to the warm welcome I received from Jamie, the host. He greeted me, showed me around and made sure I had everything I needed, including taxi numbers (I don’t drive) and then the house was mine for the next three days.
I was able to avail myself of the washer and dryer and cook which was much appreciated as traveling involves a lot of take out and carrying around dirty clothes.
I was happy with how clean the house was and delighted my host had made the effort to be available for any questions.
I would stay here again. Definitely."
2018-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Clean, close to downtown, quiet not a lot of traffic and a comfortable place to stay!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"3rd time staying at this location. Cannot say enough about how hospitable Jamie is from afar. Great place. Great amenities. Great stay. If you’re looking for a great place with an even better price, this is your best bet. Best AirBnb in El Do! Thank you, Jamie!"
2018-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you're interested in events in El Dorado's downtown, the location is great. I was just in need of a place for me & my little dog midway on a long car trip. Again, easy access back to my route home. I felt like I was in a friend's house."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable, quite with slow traffic, home feel, and very close short sidewalk trip to down town."
2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space and absolutely perfect location in town! Walking distance to the square and Murphy Arts District.

The bed is super comfortable. The shower is amazing and Jamie is super nice and helpful.
You can't go wrong here!!!"
2018-09-01,5,Stayed one night,A really cool place to stay. We were just blocks from the event we were working. And just a few miles from a great Chinese buffet. The home has a style of its own. My wife and I loved it. Really cool decorations around the house and comfy couches for reading. How I would imagine a home in France would look. Our host dropped in for a bit to grab a few things and awnser any questions we might have. Very nice and relaxing. It was like staying at an old friends home.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great little place close to downtown. Great directions for check in/check out, even if he is not available. Bed was comfortable and lots of outlets for phones/CPAPs, etc. Great place to stay and highly recommended."
2018-07-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"Jamie is a nice fellow and his house is conveniently located near downtown and the arts venues we wanted to visit. And he has a beautiful cat! However, if your taste does not run to artificial flowers and plaster of paris cherubs, you may be a little surprised. And if personal privacy is important to you, and you would prefer to be able to control the temperature of your room, you may prefer a hotel or motel."
2018-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,Jamie is a great host!
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location, walking distance to downtown. Eclectically vintage decor with a big room and lots of privacy. The cat kept me company and is super sweet. Although I didn't meet him until I was about to head out, Jamie, the owner, is a an engaging guy with knowledge of the local area and a pleasure to talk to. Staying here gave me the authentic Southern Arkansas experience I was looking for."
2018-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,had the place to myself. close to downtown. very comfortable.
2018-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Second time I’ve stayed and I would recommend this place to anyone needing a place in El Dorado! Jamie has got a good place for an incredible price. The hospitality that is shown is second to none. Well done!

Close to downtown and quiet neighborhood. I couldn’t recommend this stay enough to folks! Thank you, Jaime!"

2018-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Room was spacious and clean. Made and permitted to feel as we were at home. Wonderful screened in front porch on a quiet street.

I would try Air B&B again after this experience and if I ever find myself in El Dorado again, I would certainly stay here again."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,The place did not have a hair dryer or a Microwave and that would’ve been nice to have. Other than those things the place was just what I needed at the time.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,I really enjoyed his hospitality and he was helpful and gave me privacy while I was there. If I’m ever in that area again I’ll definitely be contacting him to see if his place is available!!!!

2024-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our time in El Dorado visiting with family. The space was perfect for our family of 5. There was more than enough space for us to not feel cramped. There were loads of books and games. The hummingbirds and squirrels were entertaining to watch on the back porch. Every piece of art and decor had a fantastic story attached to it. The beds were very comfortable.
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,If needing a place to stay in town I 100% recommend here!!
2024-03-01,5,Group trip,Janice was great we really enjoyed the time there will come back again
2024-02-01,5,Stayed over a week,"house was great, well decorated. Janice was great with communicating and flexible with check out times."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We always try to stay here when seeing family in town. Its a wonderful home in a great neighborhood. Lovely home and the host is very nice and easy to get in touch with! Repeat customer for sure!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is an amazing place to stay, and Janice makes everything extremely easy.
I am a retired Marine and have been called extreme in my attention to detail. Janice and the rental met all my expectations.
Will definitely stay here again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Great place to stay conveniently located to el dorado. The place is very large and has everything you need. Located on a large lot in a quiet neighborhood. Janice is very welcoming and was extremely helpful throughout our stay!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place in that little town!
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"1st off, Janice is a very bubbly and welcoming host! She is very communicative and is always ready to help. The home was way more spacious than I expected, I found myself frequently staring at the living room in awe of how large it is. There’s tons of sitting room and the place just feels ‘homey’. The antique nature of the home, plus Miss Janice’s unique taste in interior design gives the home a refreshing air of mystery. It is the perfect place for a mens retreat. I even wrote my vows for my wedding in the office study.
The only real “drawback” for the home, is that it wasn’t built with more bedrooms. The place feels like it wants to hold minimum 8-9 people comfortably.
My stay here will be etched in my memories forever, my wedding weekend would not have been what it was without this home. Thank you Miss Janice, for your kindness and hospitality!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Janice was amazing! Super friendly, very accommodating great attitude. the house was in a very nice neighborhood and loved the feel of the house looking forward to staying there again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This house was so peaceful and quiet. The neighborhood is lovely and there is no through-traffic. The home is very large and spacious - lots of room to ""spread out"" and relax. The lawn is extra large, too. Our dog enjoyed his daily outings. We enjoyed sitting on the porch listening to the birds and watching the squirrels (so did our dog). Janice was a wonderful host - she brought breakfast goodies at check-in (she came to meet us and show us around the house) and even shared a watermelon with us! She is such a generous and friendly person. Meeting her was such a treat and it made us feel like we really were staying in ""her"" home."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful place with tons of fun and eclectic decor. Open floor plan was great for a family gathering. Chicken coop in the back was a great addition for the kids!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The House that Jack Built is one of a kind and our family really enjoyed our stay. It’s a beautifully decorated mid century house and there is so much to look at and discover there. The furniture, art work , cool books and games made our time there so much fun. The back patio is a great place for watching birds and drinking coffee. Janice, our hostess was kind and courteous and I appreciate all of her thoughtful touches throughout the home. I would definitely stay here again and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone traveling to El Dorado, Arkansas. Great neighborhood, beautiful home."
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"I loved Ms Janice personality, she is a very nice lady and she was very detailed came by to show us the place .Me and my family enjoyed our stay very roomy and peaceful.I would recommend this Airbnb to my associates and will come again if I come back to eldorado.Thank you Ms Janice."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home is a beautiful Midcentury modern jewel in El Dorado, AR. It is huge inside and open. There are 2 full beautiful bathrooms and 1/2 baths. The den is huge and seats at least 16 people I would guess. There’s also a very cool outdoor deck the length of the back of the house. There are 4 lovely bedrooms and and an office. There are two beautiful Midcentury dining room tables that 6-8 and a kitchen breakfast area. Upscale kitchen appliances including a chef’s dream induction cooktop. This is just a stunning home and I would rent it again just to study the beautiful architecture of the home and the artwork inside.
The grounds are beautiful too.
A 2 car carport and fantastic privacy on a street that has one way in. One of the loveliest in El Dorado.
The description doesn’t do the house justice!
Janice is an incredible host and a wealth of knowledge about the home and town.
For this right brained girl this house was the most amazing I’ve ever stayed in."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely home in El Dorado. Plenty of space for multiple families. Janice is a great host.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very friendly town our whole trip! Great house!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great space for multiple travelers at any age. My 90-year-old in-laws were grateful for the walk in shower with hand rails. Dogs loved the big backyard and small fenced in area. We all loved the spacious gathering room. Very generous amenities in the kitchen. Tons of games and if you bring kids, a closet full of toys. Wonderfully quiet street and classic mid century style home. Glad she has shared it with us. A gem in El Dorado!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was one of the best Air BNB experiences I have had. Janice was an excellent host and the house had everything we needed. I will definitely book next time I’m in El Dorado.

2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"The house was more then we could have asked for. We were looking for a place for 6 of us to stay and not be on top of each other. We had so much room. Toys and games for the little ones were there as well. And so many fun things to look at in the house.
It was easy to find and Janice met us there to go over everything and was just a message away if needed.
The house was located close to Walmart and not far from the main ""highways "" for traveling out of town.
If needed we would definitely stay again."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house that Jack built was one of the best Airbnbs that we have stayed in. Very large house Immaculate in every detail. Janice the hostess has put so much time and effort into the thoughtfulness of everything from extra essentials to the decor. 5 star all the way and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Don’t miss this very special treat!
2022-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house and location were great, convenient to main area of town and highway access and in a quiet neighborhood. Janice was available for any concerns. The games and backyard were great for our 8 yr old. There were alot of unique features to the home. It is an older home and has an old house smell. Would recommend a professional deep clean for things in the nooks and corners high and low that are missed in a basic clean."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Janice will meet you at the the house at check in and show you how everything works in her large one story home with a big private yard (backs up to trees). Very fun and interesting décor that takes you back in time. Fully stocked kitchen with everything you need to cook (we even BBQ' d one night and grill was clean). Close to everything (restaurants, gym, shopping, golf). Janice is very easy to work with and has flexible check-in and check-out times. We would recommend and plan to come back next year."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Janice is absolutely the best host!!! She made sure we were comfortable and has ever easy for us when we got there!

Plenty of toilet paper, paper towels, garbage bags etc. It might be a tad dusty for some, but our family did not mind. Overall great place to stay and I would recommend."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"5 stars in every category. This home is perfect for a relaxing and peaceful stay!!! It's great for everyone in our family-from my 8 year old son all the way to my 80 year old dad. The home is very spacious and comfortable. They have tons of games to play, a huge yard with giant trees, and a great, quiet street for family walks. The large window in the kitchen was fantastic for early morning coffee before everyone else is awake; Tons of birds and nature to take in. We will definitely be back. Thank you, Janice!!!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,Janice was an extremely welcoming host and her home was exactly as advertised! It was perfect for our needs for the week and we had absolutely zero issues. She was very responsive and check in and check out we’re a breeze. Will definitely stay again!

2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect location! Private but close to everywhere we needed to be.
The hummingbirds were a hit. The large family room made it perfect to relax. The layout of the bedrooms allowed everyone to have their privacy."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a loss in the family and wanted a place to stay that was more accommodating than a hotel. This place was a dream!
The details of the home are amazing! There is a piano we played church hymns on. So much room. We were so comfortable and in 60plus years of coming to my mother's home town, we've NEVER been this at home!!! We did not want to leave!
I've never rented a home where I did not need to bring any essentials. Given the reason we were here, we didn't pack very well. This host and home provided everything we needed. It is sooooo quiet. We needed that! The floor was so smooth and cold on the bottom of our feet. We actually kicked off our house shoes to enjoy it! There are different types of lighting everywhere. The house is so big you can section it off with lights and have your personal time while the family sleeps. The bathtub recesses into the floor with a slight slant for soaking. My Favorite! This home also provided a handicap accessible shower!!!! A God Send for my father-in-law. There are so many toilets.....no waiting! The fireplace sitting area is a dream. The iron work radiates beauty. The kitchen has a soundproof ceiling!!!! I found a 100 year old Sears and Roebuck Catalog Book! We looked and admired the photos from when the home was built. You can see the proudness in the families eye's and what a lovely family. The sliding doors to the outside are smooth and quiet. The backyard is absolutely stunning! Just sit and watch. You have your own live nature show! Hummingbirds, woodpeckers, deer! The host, Ms. Janice, made sure my family was comfortable. She stayed in contact with me. She even phoned to make sure my elderly father in law was doing ok within the home. She truly cares. There is also a lower bed for which my father used due to knee surgery, he had no problem getting in and out of bed nor to the restroom. You feel so safe while you are there. We are in love with this home and we will definitely be coming back! Thank you Janice for everything! We really were at home.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect a phenomenal host, beautiful and clean, large mid-century home in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood where you can sit on the deck and watch the birds and humming birds eat.

2024-06-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"This was our third stay here. The floors were filthy, there were no batteries in the TV remote, but mainly, both beds had no mattress pad, just plastic around the mattress and a thin sheet. This made the bed very hot, noisy when anyone moved in bed and just plain uncomfortable! No one was able to rest. Also, there are no hand towels provided for either bathroom. This could be a great place with a little TLC."
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"this ""apartment"" Is old office building. the half bath is so small and basically in a closet. The only way to get in with keypad is through a bedroom so no privacy in that room. the washing machine was broke, handle on dryer is broke. dishes was dirty and very little pots and pans. the bed linens are extremely old. only TV in the living room. no hand towels for bathrooms. 6 bath towels and 3 wash clothes. its definitely old pictures on listing. the outside is so trashed and extremely dirty."

2023-12-01,4,Stayed about a week,"place was quite clean and comfortable, the kitchen was a bit awkward with the cabinets on the left side of the sink being close to a wall. I would stay there again."

2023-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"I was a little disappointed that Jamar never reached out to me up on booking or 48 hours prior to check in, as stated in the listing. I had to contact Jamar on the afternoon of check in just to get the door code. Thankfully, he responded quickly up on my inquiry. I was also disappointed that once we arrived after 10:00 p.m., we realize that there was nothing in the kitchen for morning coffee, so we had to go back out to get coffee and filters. then when we got ready to make coffee the following morning, the coffee maker still had coffee in the bottom of it. I do have to brag that the bed was extremely comfortable!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,Quite and nice place!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay!! Would have stayed longer but was only there for buisness. The stay was peaceful and quiet. Everything was just like he described. Spacious kitchen with 2 bedrooms, 1 full bathroom, and a 1/2 bathroom. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again if in that area. If I had anything at all to say, I would say, he should add TV's in the bedroom. I had my grandbaby and I couldn't turn the TV off of coco melon. Lol"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"If your looking to enjoy the downtown area look no farther, location was perfect, walking distance to food and local shops. Jamar is quick to reply and the area is quiet and relaxing, thanks again for extending our stay on short notice. much appreciated"
2023-05-01,3,Stayed with a pet,"We come to El Dorado twice a year and want a space that accomodates our small dog. This unit is in a very old complex in older part of town.
Pros: Convenient to town, good space, nice flooring, easy to enter, one level, A/C works well, good hot water in shower, quiet, nice TV with streaming shows, internet. Plenty of toilet paper and paper towels.
Cons: Unit was very hot and musty upon entering. Did not feel it was prepared for us. Unit needs a deep clean with new rugs, clean walls and baseboards. Washer and dryer work but handle broken on dryer. Both need to be cleaned. Found a few hairs on walls, toilet, and comforters. Towels were few and thin, no kitchen towels at all. No hangers or hair dryer. No luxury touches that we have seen on most similar units were have used with AirB/B. The coffee maker is small and does not get very hot.
Would stay here again if the cons are resolved. Appreciated the stay."

2024-06-01,4,Stayed over a week,"In town for a long-term job. The house was better to come to after work than a hotel. Cindy was very responsive when questions asked. Notified me when mowers would be there. Everything worked as it should. Couch a little uncomfortable but it served its purpose.
I had to extend my stay for a week and was able to do so easily. Would book again if available."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It’s a very cute and well updated cottage close to downtown. I especially loved the kitchen with a full size gas stove that connected directly to a screened back porch. In between visits with family this was a great home-base for the trip. Definitely recommend

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"There are a lot of things that I really enjoyed about staying the two nights at this airbnb.
There were welcome snacks and two Sprites. Inside the nice large refrigerator there were several bottles of water, and the ice maker was very good. The kitchen had pretty granite countertops, a huge farm sink, a large five burn stove, a keurig with lots of k cups, every kind of pot needed for cooking, nice dishes, glasses, cups, several different kind of dry goods, salt and pepper, olive oil, etc.
The television was awesome and very easy to use. The key code was very easy to remember. There were many towels, hand towels, and wash cloths to use. They have large capacity washer and dryer, iron, ironing board, even laundry baskets. The plug for the internet was very near the bed which made it easy to use. The ceiling fans in most rooms were wonderful and the air conditioning was perfect. In the bathroom, they had cotton balls, q-tips, and name-brand shampoo and conditioner. It has a nice front porch and a small screened in back porch. The bathroom door is a barn door and even under the vanity there is a tiny barn door to open it. As you can tell, I really enjoyed my stay. And the host was wonderful. I could not have been more happy."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My granddaughter/I really enjoyed our stay at “the cottage on Elm St for several reasons:

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This cottage is lovely, and it made the perfect home base for our weekend in town for the Snow White storybook ballet. It is conveniently located to the downtown square and a host of other places you may be going."

Thank you for the stay."
2023-09-01,2,Stayed with a pet,"First of all, I want to say that Gregory as a host was phenomenal. Our problem was that the Airbnb didn’t meet our expectations. Gregory cannot control his neighbors. The house across the street is falling apart and the next door neighbor is a hoarder. As a female that usually travels solo, I would definitely not feel safe. Thankfully, I had my husband and dogs with us. A couple small problems and Gregory was addressing the issues immediately after we informed him.
The price is probably fair for the area, our expectations were higher due to all the great reviews. The price is probably a better indication of the area.
Thank you for your help Gregory."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great stay had a big and private parking area. host was great. will come back.

2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Extremely pleased with our stay. Gregory went above and beyond when I stupidly locked us out of the house by accident. He took time from a family event on a Saturday to come right over and unlock the door for us so we didn’t have to wait for hours outdoors in the heat.
The house was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay there very much. We were in town to visit a very ill relative and it was very nice to have a clean, restful place to relax after visiting."

The place was quiet during the day and Gregory was really top notch about handling the one issue we had while there. the new refrigerator went out he was there the with in a few hours with a new one.

My son had NO ANXIETY which was a blessing he is a 3yr old with ASD. The pictures, the decor, it feels like a home that was steeped in love throughout the years, truly. We wished we could have spent more time enjoying the home than visiting family. Amazing hosts! Amazing job! We are still in awe at how it checked every box on the list of things we wanted and needed for our short getaway. Thank you Beverlee and Keith your home was truly a home to us."

This cottage would standout in any setting! The amenities were just what we needed for such a family trip as this ... spacious, quiet, full kitchen and multiple bathrooms. I would rate Beverlee's listing a 4.7/5, will definitely recommend and look forward to returning for another stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The photos posted do not do it justice. It was absolutely beautiful!! We had everything we needed plus more. Quiet little neighborhood. Very cozy and the decor was amazing. First class! Would love to stay again!!!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From the moment I opened the side door off the car port of Killgore Cottage I was in awe. Attention to decore, ambience and cleanliness were immediately apparent. On a stifling Louisiana day the house was enticingly cool with AC and ceiling fans running. As I moved through the house lamps provided a dimly lit path revealing a collection of vintage treasures and the overhead light switches. It was apparent I was both expected and being invited in.
As a lone traveller I felt safe in Killgore cottage and in the residential neighborhood I temporarily joined.
I found it ideally situated for my purpose and during the hottest part of the August days a welcoming retreat.
From condiments to soaps and cleaning supplies so many extras were provided.
I left Haynesville contentedly knowing I have a cozy Louisiana home to return to on my next visit.
Beverlee and Keith are amazing hosts; they’re friendly and welcoming, very responsive to communication and considerate of guest privacy."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I cant say more! It was a pleasure to come back to the cottage every day! This place was the second best part of a miserable trip and weather! (Seeing my son was first best!). I’m from Ecuador, and had sticker shock daily on this trip! But the cottage felt worth the money during a trip that I may not be able to make again! I’m 76 yrs old, and the trip from Ecuador was really hard. But Beverly and the good people of Haynesville gave me peace and comfort❤️ thank you! Thanks to Jimmy Dale Williams too 🥰

It was truly special to stay in Haynesville, the home of our ancestors, and being able to stay in this wonderful home with all the amenities one could ever think to need, with the additional feeling of true Southern living, well, it doesn't get any better than that! So any other descendants of Haynesville or anyone visiting Northern Louisiana - this is a must stay! Beverlee ... you 've done your town proud! Thank you from all of us - we will definitely be back!"

We even got to know the mail man!
For families with a little one; a special room is close to the Master. The third bedroom is large and all the house is decorated very nicely! Very clean! Perfect!"

Definitely better than a hotel stay.

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing place to stay in a wonderful and sweet community! We will continue to utilize this place when visiting family. We highly recommend!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a super cute, recently remodeled, fully stocked for a long term stay, three bedroom home, located about 2 blocks from a park and almost in the middle of the tiny town. The front porch is perfect for sipping your favorite beverage and watching the neighbors drive by. The screened in back porch is shaded by a large tree and presents a relaxed place to contemplate. The large back yard, shaded by the same tree is a wonderful place to do yoga & watch the neighborhood birds. Basically everyone is friendly and will wave at you as you sit on the porch, walk around town, or talk to you if you run into them at the Piggly Wiggly. There are a handful of restaurants in town one can support. The downtown area has great potential. I personally feel that if the town had a few festivals during the year, perhaps a farmers market (not sure if I missed one), got the downtown spiced up with perhaps local artists, farmers, beekeepers, lemonade stands..whatever the peoples talents are, this town could be even more amazing. From this cute home to the church bells ringing throughout the day to the trains that slowly pass thru town, occasionally blowing their whistles, & the wonderful people. You may just want to stay longer. : )"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, comfortable home, wish we could've stayed longer. We evacuated Ida here, and feel blessed that this beautiful home was available to stay in for the short time we did. All amenities present, the beds, super comfortable, quiet neighborhood, and nice, generous host. Thank you again."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,10/10 southern charm and hospitality! The house is wonderful and so comfy! The town is a great place to be with church bells to be heard and everyone is so polite and helpful! Friendliest place we have been to in a long while! This house is a must stay if your in the area! Absolutely outstanding!!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very charming, quite and comfortable little home in the middle of nowhere! I would drive out of my way to stay! If you need a cozy home feel, this charming little spot will brighten your day!"

2021-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Kilgore Cottage is definitely worth the stay. The house is very beautiful and surprisingly large. Beverlee does a great job providing everything that you could need. The hospitality goes above and beyond any expectations. If you are even close to the area I would highly recommend staying at the Kilgore Cottage. We will definitely stay again!
2020-12-01,5,Group trip,Nice house big comfortable beds and clean spacious rooms and kitchen they have everything you need for stay for some days we recommend this house
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We needed a place to gather our family over Thanksgiving as our cabin on lake Erling was too small for our entire family. My wife and son and my sisters family were perfectly comfortable. The child size bedroom was perfect for my 6 year old niece. The house was spotless, well appointed and comfortable. Couldn’t ask for a more perfect place for a trip to N. Louisiana."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful cottage with a wonderful view of the lake. Very quiet and peaceful.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a beautiful little spot on the lake. It was so quiet. I didn’t use the outdoor entertainment area, but it was an awesome space to just sit and relax."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jesse’s Place was a very nice private setting and was the perfect place to relax. We enjoyed the yard space and the outside entertainment covered patio. I recommend staying here.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Jesse's place was fantastic. I loved sitting in the fenced yard watching boats on the lake. The house was really well-designed and did not feel like a tiny house at all. We learned from Jesse the building started life as a sno-cone stand before he moved it to the current location and completely renovated the inside. The outdoor kitchen added living space and we enjoyed many meals at the dining table. The house is only a few miles from Homer, and the Herbert S. Ford Memorial Museum in the former Hotel Claiborne on the downtown square is worth a visit. Jesse was quick to respond to our queries and was very flexible when we had travel issues due to weather. We will definitely return to Jesse's."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A wonderful place to stay while visiting Lake Claibourne in Homer, Louisiana. Jesse was the perfect host, I was able to charge my boat and launch nearby The Tiny House was very clean and well organized. The Sleep Number Bed made it a 5 star for me and my husband! We will be back. Thanks Jesse!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jesse’s place was nice and cozy! The outdoor kitchen was awesome. Communication with him was easy and we enjoyed our trip. My son had a high school fishing tournament on the lake and this was a perfect place for us to stay and spend some time fishing for the weekend.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Jesse was a great host! We enjoyed a peaceful and quiet weekend getaway. The house was great and there was a big backyard with a great view of the lake. Jesse made us feel very welcomed and was very easy to get ahold of to answer any questions. We plan on returning soon
2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay!! The pictures don't do it justice, excellent cozy home with plenty of room. The outdoor area was amazing and peaceful. Great place to unwind from a long day at work and enjoy good scenery"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Great place to stay!! Quiet and away from town , great way to wind down from a busy day. The pictures don't do it justice, very clean and cozy. There was no water when I stayed but still very peaceful and the outdoor kitchen is a great place to cook and enjoy a day off. I would definitely recommend staying here everything else in the area is more expensive and not as nice. I will be staying here again"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed over a week,My husband works on the road so this was a long term stay. He was there approximately 3 months and the place was perfect for what we needed (I went and stayed a few times). The view of the birds flying across the water is amazing to wake up to. Loved being able to walk out the back door on to the private dock to go fishing. The outdoor patio area had everything you could possibly need to cook outside and enjoy the scenery. The neighbors were really nice and the neighborhood is very quiet. The house itself is literally a tiny home but has pretty much everything you need. If I had to make one suggestion for folks staying any length of time is to get yourself a portable clothes hanging rack because it doesn’t have a closet. But the rack worked out great. Jesse was a fantastic host and was very responsive to the gazillion questions I always had. I’ve stayed in many AirBnBs before but I’m actually going to miss this place.We will probably try to rent it again for a long weekend sometime.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very nice home, the pictures do not do it justice. The outside deck/kitchen is amazing! Just steps from the water and the kayak was so much fun."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My wife and I were just looking for a nice place to do some bass fishing for the weekend and stumbled upon this beautiful tiny home. Jesse was a great host, he made sure we were taken care of. He knew we wanted to go fishing and purchased a second Kayak, just so that we were comfortable. The pictures that are listed on this property do it zero justice. This place is beyond amazing! The outdoor area is gorgeous and the amenities, especially for a tiny home are impeccable. Definitely look forward to booking again. If you are questioning it, please just do it. Well worth the money spent. Thank you Jesse and the Witt Family!"
