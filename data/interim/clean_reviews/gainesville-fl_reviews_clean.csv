2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This tiny home was so adorable and perfect for our Memorial Day weekend getaway! It’s centrally located within an hours drive from a bunch of beautiful springs. This quaint shipping container is such a unique experience and we’ll definitely be back here again!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The shipping container tiny house was the perfect option for my long-term medical assignment. Very convenient location, has easy parking, and a very safe location at all hours of the day or night. Location is very close to the medical centers and local shopping. I am planning to stay in the shipping container tiny house for my next assignment of 36 days. Easy individual access and peaceful location."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The tiny container was pristine and perfectly comfortable for my husband and my short trip to Gainesville. Vanessa’s instructions for self check-in were very clear and intuitive and made finding the space a breeze. The inside is super cozy and squeaky clean, and the bed was also very comfy!
We didn’t have any face-to-face time with the host, which I honestly prefer. But Vanessa was on top of communication with us and available for anything we may have needed from her. Staying here enhanced our weekend and I couldn’t recommend it any more!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Vanessa offered a wonderfully whimsical tiny home experience. Excellently designed with high end amenities, a co portable mattress and cosy living space, this shipping container tiny home has everything you need and nothing you don't want. close to great restaurants and bars and entertainment on Mai. street"

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I highly recommend this BnB! It was a nice area to get away for a weekend. Everything is pretty much walking distance but due to the weather it was driving distance lol. But it was a nice cozy little getaway home for two people. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay!

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the stay! Vanessa described the place clearly and the instructions were helpful, the only thing i WOULD say if i had to say anything is that prior to the instructions of check-in at booking i was not aware this was behind someone’s home but that could have been my own misconception! I didn’t really find it to be any issue of privacy tho, as it is gated in it’s own little area. Very clean and smelled brand new inside, people who live in the home were very nice as well.
Full five stars from us :)"

2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Impeccably appointed, aesthetically appealing, sooo clean and neat (there wasn't even a leaf or weed in the pebbles outside), private, quiet, lovely.
Vanessa communicates every thing you need to know beforehand. And, being in Gainesville (UofF), the location is just one turn off a main road, and then literally only 4 min from Main and University restaurants and music. I have absolutely nothing to complain about here!"

I had to have surgery at shands, both my husband and I stayed the night before my surgery and my husband stayed the rest of the weekend there while I was in the hospital.

This was a nice, quiet location in a neighborhood setting and the unique container was not visible from the street. Great tiny home experience. Very secure. Thanks for the unique vacation!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed here while visiting Gainesville for the first time and looking at UF. Vanessa’s place was lovely. From the second I walked in the door I felt safe and secure. It was extremely quiet and everything locks up. There were curtains that blocked every window if you’re someone who enjoys absolute privacy. Not to mention the bnb was fenced in it’s own private yard with a gate that also locks. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely choose to stay here again next time I’m in Gainesville.

Perfect location for easy access to downtown GNV and UF or for a quick excursion to Orlando. Such a clever idea to provide an opportunity to try tiny house living while exploring a new city.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"I’ve always loved the idea of living in a container home, so it was so exciting to get an opportunity to spend the night in one, and it didn’t disappoint!
The communication and instructions prior to arrival were perfect.
Once we arrived, the unit was set to a perfect temperature and calm music was playing to set the mood. The unit was small, which we were expecting. However, everything was laid out so thoughtfully that it actually felt bigger than it was, and was comfortable for two people.
Thank you Vanessa and family for being such great hosts and for such a cool experience!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I absolutely enjoyed our stay at Vanessa’s Tiny Home Shipping Container. We celebrated our anniversary this past weekend and it was nice to be downtown and walk the city. I would recommend this AirBnB to anyone who asked!

2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The perfect little place for me and my daughter. it was an adventure sleeping on a loft bed but fun indeed. It looked like the pictures. Sheets were super soft! Only would have liked curtains for the windows so I could have slept a little later.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as described, excellent check in instructions complete with photos, very responsive and communicative. I really felt like Vanessa wants her guests to enjoy themselves. It IS very tiny-so just be prepared. And the loft bed could be a challenge for some if a late night sojourn is needed. But Vanessa made sure I knew what I was getting into before I even booked-so I LOVED it! The little touches in the space and with the write ups after confirmation were perfect. Book it. And enjoy!"

We wanted something unique and were really happy when we found Vanessa’s place! This container provides everything you need - from cozy bed to hot coffee in the morning. I really liked the Swedish style of the place. Despite the small space, you will be able to find the place for all your clothes, shoes or other items. The backyard is great, especially in the morning - it feels like you’re in the forest, close to nature. I would definitely recommend this place and we would be really glad to stay there when we’ll have a chance"

2022-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had always wanted to try the tiny house experience for a few days, and this was a charming and functional space with lots of light. If you are a pro basketball player, this may not be for you - see ""tiny"" in tiny house. The space was very functional, clean, and quite nice. The location is quiet, just far enough away from good restaurants (you must supper at Harry's) to be out of the bustle, not too far to ride a bike."

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you have ever watched shows or seen posts about shipping container or tiny house living and been curious to know what it's like, check out this outstanding Airbnb! Every single detail is perfect, from the natural light to the setup to thoughtful extras like pockets for your devices - and Hot Pockets in the freezer which were so appreciated when I came in late and didn't want to leave again to find a snack! I also used the bike which was great, much like the classic bikes I used to ride around Amsterdam when I lived there. Super professional and responsive overall a '10.'"

I wish I could have stayed longer to check out both sleeping spaces. The bed was SOOO comfortable I didn't want to get up! The hosts are darling and very helpful and accommodating.

Would highly recommend this airbnb and will defiantly stay there again! 10/10 experience!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Had the real pleasure of staying here for an extended working trip. The container studio is open, airy and spotless, so it's super-easy to get comfy and relax. Also thoughtfully furnished and appointed with a well-equipped kitchen featuring a not-so-mini fridge and a surprising amount of counter and table space. Then there's the roomy, plush and supportive queen and the deep-seat sofa you can just chill on forever. And the container's stationed on an adorable, perfectly private compound in the hosts' yard, yet completely fenced off and separate from it, and adjacent to a pretty wooded lot that has a knack for attracting a bumble bees and cool forest butterflies like red-spotted purples. Makes for really wonderful mornings sippin something you brewed in the nespresso. Ample opportunities to partake in greener practices are a seamless part of the container's design and the compound, too. And Vanessa and John are great. Responsive, friendly, and sent tips on what was fun to do in in the neighborhood (which is walking distance to historic sites like the Thomas Center and biking distance to downtown and UF) when I was there, but hung back and let me do my own thing. I prefer auto-pilot stays, so that's a plus for me. Almost didn't want to check out."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"An amazing house for families traveling with small children. Clean, charming, well furnished, and equipped with toys, toddler utensils, child locks, and other amenities that are very useful for little ones. Our 16 month old loved finding fun surprises all over the house, from the air conditioned Florida room with a view of the twinkling porch lights and garden, to the variety of toys in both closets. I hope this house is available again next time we’re in town!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very charming place, I had everything I needed and there were even snacks that came in very handy. Thank you for all the little touches. Hope to stay here again."

I unfortunately had a family emergency I had to check out early for on the last day; Melimeli was SO understanding and helped me with navigating how to deal with the airbnb while I was also dealing with family. If I am to come back to Gainesville for work, I would 100% stay here again ☺️"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a successful stay which overall met our expectations. What stood out was the cleanliness of the house and hospitality of the owner. The inside was very warm and comfortable. We also appreciated the streaming services and Wi-Fi. My only critique is the driveway and walkway which were super muddy on a rainy weekend, and the location not being perfectly ideal. Overall, though, we were pleased and appreciate our host very much."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had to come to Gainsville for one of our service dogs to get emergency heart surgery at UF Animal Hospital. Due to the circumstances around our visit, we weren’t sure of how long our stay would be so we had to take it day by day. Mel was so understanding and accommodating. She was able to accommodate our scheduling and short notice extensions of our stay. She made the housing part of our stay very easy and smooth.
The house itself was very comfortable and decorated beautifully. The beds and furniture was very comfortable and the desk made the unexpected need to work remotely a lot easier.
Definitely a great stay, and compared to the other homes listed in the area, I think she’s priced very fairly. A lot of other homes in this area seemed to be over priced for not as nice conditions."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I stayed here twice, this is a great place to stay and Mel is an amazing host. 100% recommend."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved this rental for a quick sleep before heading down to Disney. My kids really enjoyed the toys. Everything was clean and the pack and play was easy to find and set up. Maybe it was just the fact that we had driven 10 hours that day, but the shower was surprisingly good.

The entire home was very clean, too."

The yard was great, nice yard with tables and chairs for coffee and pastries from nearby Curia or Afternoon. We loved the small touches like the kid toys the closet (our kid loved the mini basketball hoop), the container of stuff in case you forgot toiletries (we didn't need it, but it was nice to see as an option if we did), and the body wash / shampoo in the shower (so many places don't have soap, which blows my mind).
In short, Melimeli went above-and-beyond with her space and we appreciated it. We'd definitely stay again next time we want to explore the area."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This host thought of everything!
There were thoughtful items placed throughout the cottage to make your stay even more enjoyable; from that book that you didn't know you want to read, to plenty of toys to keep a toddler quite busy, and even a ""things you might have forgot"" box.
I would definitely stay here again! Very clean! Located right on the corner lot, which makes it easy to find (we did not hear any traffic). Still in plenty of nature and peaceful spot!
Really enjoyed this lovely, comfortable cottage and will stay here again on our next visit to Gainesville!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The cottage is adorable! Well appointed and thoughtful touches. Great location close to UF. Fire pit was great place to relax. Melimeli was very responsive. Hope to be back!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was perfect. as a Airbnb host myself I truly got some ideas. Will stay here again
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was comfortable, it was well stocked with new furniture and kitchen. The house was exceptionally clean, but it was located right next to a fairly busy road. The street light was shining into one of the bedroom’s. There was a very nice fire pit in the backyard. Hosts left some snacks, cola, and water. So it was a nice treat after our long drive."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a very pleasant stay in the house. Everything went very well.
This is a great location. You are easily in and out of the city, while being surrounded with nature.
The interior of the house is very comfortable and had everything we needed for a few days.
Having a lot of space outside was also very convenient, to eat or relax.
Would highly recommend."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great communication, well appointed cottage with good flow of space. The outside areas were a pleasure, the front covered porch for reading and bistro-style dining, very spacious and uncluttered home with good access to both streets.
It does have some significant traffic during the morning and late aft commute times but overall quite pleasant.
Loved biking along 36th st and rd...very interesting homes and huge live oaks in this shady neighborhood!"

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I traveled to Gainesville with my 12 months baby to look for grad schools. Melimeli’s place was very convenient for my trip and my circumstances (traveling with a baby). The place was very clean. I know this should be standard, but when you are a mom, this becomes your priority number one, trust me. This place exceeds my expectations. I loved she had a little space in the house dedicated to babies. There were a lot of toys for my baby to play with. She even has a portable bed; this is so cute. I enjoyed the outdoors a lot and the location. She was very communicative. When we arrived, we had some water and sodas in the refrigerator, which I found to be extra caring details."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Absolutely adorable little cottage. I highly recommend this listing and host. Every detail of the house was thought through and she had everything we needed for our stay and some. She was responsive and easy to work with. We will definitely rent again when we come back.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Melissa’s place is just amazing. The house was super clean. The bathrooms had shampoo, conditioner and soap. The location is perfect, only 6 mins away from downtown . Kitchen had everything we needed it (olive oil, sal, pepper, sugar, coffee and creamer).
I spend most of my days in the sunroom. My stay was just perfect, I will definitely come back 💙"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cristian’s place was practically brand new. Everything was spotless and most of the items such as towels, linen’s, hairdryer, etc. seemed like they had never even been used. He gave very detailed instructions on how to get there and how to check in. He responded immediately and was very flexible when I requested a late check out. His space felt cozy and bright. He really made sure to think of his guests needs with all the extras he offered, including plenty of coffee pods, disposable coffee cups, creamers, and so many toiletries. I had a great stay!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was spotless and well stocked. They seem to have thought of everything. Comfy bed too.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Christian’s Airbnb. We loved the personal welcome board and were surprised with the number of amenities with this condo. It is very close to UF, the VA, and restaurants. The condo is by a main road but it was mainly just the sounds of cars passing by and the very occasional sounds of sirens. The neighborhood is quiet and could occasionally hear the upstairs neighbor’s footsteps/voices during the day but it was minimal and was quiet from 10pm until the next morning that it was never a bother to us. The place was so comfy we felt right at home when we walked in. We truly appreciate Christian’s quick responses and hospitality during our stay. We highly recommend staying here!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christian's place was perfect for a quick visit to Gainesville, FL. I am a UF alumni, and I came to Gainesville for the UF vs. FSU game. I was a little panicked that we wouldn't find an affordable place to stay that was near and walkable to campus and other fun spots in town. Christian's place was priced perfectly, and it was the sweetest little spot to stay in. Very clean, organized, and cozy! Would recommend if you are spending some time in GNV!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay. The place was clean, comfortable, well organized, well maintained. Had everything we could possibly need and then some!

Cristian has the place exceptionally well stocked and everything was in perfect working order. The blackout curtains were magical! Don't trust your GPS, use Cristian's directions and you will find the unit right away."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"I really enjoyed my quick stay at Cristian’s Sage Haven! It was perfectly located and very well equipped with everything you could need for a day, week, month, or longer. It’s right near the University of Florida, Shands UF Health hospital and the VA hospital, and close to downtown. It would also be a great place to stay for a Gator game. Cristian was very responsive and provided all the details I needed for an easy check in and check out. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it for anyone making a trip to Gainesville."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed staying at this listing. It looked exactly like the pictures and had a lot of shopping/food places around. The only complaint is that there was some construction going on on the house during the morning, but i’m guessing that’s temporary."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Jonathan’s was exactly what we were looking for: it was peaceful, private, and pristine. We kept marveling at how beautiful the trees and wildflowers were. We felt right at home, and Jonathan was very helpful, even allowing us to check in a bit early, which we appreciated immensely.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would gladly stay again."

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here for a weekend getaway and it was absolutely lovely. The apartment is beautifully decorated, the bed is comfortable, everything was perfectly clean, and the property itself is serene. We were able to visit Paynes Prairie, Micanopy, local museums, antique shops, etc. but still enjoy the convenience of having restaurants and shopping nearby once back here.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Awesome quiet location. Very clean, great shower, and comfortable bed. Enjoyed the decor."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was very clean and very quiet. The only thing was at night it was very dark out and the solar lights on the stairs were not working.

Everything we needed was provided for a nice stay

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathan's airbnb place is a gem; luxurious elegance, in quiet park-like location, close to everything in Gainesville - all at reasonable price. Great for teleworking, being a tourist, visiting the campus or health resources.
From superbly clean and artistically decorated inside I went out, to a porch, sitting , working next to a bamboo bushes, away from the main road, yet, just few minutes from the major street in Gainesville. I will certainly look up Jonathan's airbnb whenever I stay in that area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We knew Jonathan's place would be great but it was even better than we expected. Clean, HUGE and so comfortable! Great location with a Publix very close by. The property is large and set back off the road so it's very private, yet close to everything. We've booked with Jonathan before at another of his properties and he's an amazing host. Couldn't ask for more!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, secluded place. Felt right at home. Jonathan was a great and responsive host."

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jonathan's place felt like entering a private garden enclave. You leave a quiet street and enter a huge property backing onto a stream. There's a private patio with table and chairs to sit outside. Inside the place was well appointed stylish and super clean. There's no living/sitting area - but we didn't miss it as we were busy all day and evening. There's a big grocery store 5-minutes walk away.

Perfect space for a romantic and worry free weekend."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great experience here. The place is just as described. Fairly short drive from UF campus and is a hands down better option than local hotels. Would recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful and clean! Jonathan (and his mum) were friendly and clear communicators, even though we came late at night. The carved bedhead was especially well-appointed. We would definitely return if we have the option in the future!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Jonathan is a pro-very proactive with overall stay. he is VERY responsive so rest assured that your concerns or satisfactions will be taken of in short notice. I stayed here to just getaway and relax my mind for a night. This place is a meditative space. It's a very ancient design with formal appeal. It's private and peaceful; it is simplicity. I was able to hear myself think in that space as well as to just enjoy my own company and the surroundings of the place. I would very much recommend this place to anyone in search!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a pleasure staying at Jonathan's place!

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"The apartment was beautiful! The surrounding environment was very country for me, I’m a city girl. So with that I was a little nervous lol. I liked that there were walkway lights so it wasn’t completely dark. But besides my own fears, the place was very nice. The art displayed was gorgeous, the house was extremely clean, and very homey. I would highly recommend!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful home that was a little hidden. The surrounding on the outside was beautiful, the inside was decorated beautifully.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Would definitely stay here again if in the area
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This spot is an absolute gem in Gainesville- the property gave a feel of being secluded although it was very close to restaurants and a grocery store which is super convenient.

The rooms matched the description and both, furniture and decoration are thoughtfully selected and are a level above other airbnbs I visited in Florida. Everything was really clean and worked fine. Meeting some of the hosts was a real pleasure. Highly recommended."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"So peaceful! We are going to put this up there with one of the top Airbnbs we have stayed at. We liked it so much we ended up staying an extra couple of days.
It’s location is ideal as it is close to everything yet you are in a park like setting. It was very easy to get into the unit and has everything you require including a very comfy bed! We were looking for a quiet getaway as we had been travelling for three weeks prior and Johnathons place checked all the boxes.
It has a little patio set on the entrance deck and we had our supper and lunch.
Highly recommend!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect space for my work trip to gainesville.
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,No oven or stove. It was mentioned by other reviews. I believe the owner set up this way on purpose for some reason. No stove/oven and the smell from carpets can’t make me to get a felling of home.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jonathan was a fantastic. His home was very neat and tidy. The home is an excellent location so tranquil and peaceful. Jonathan’s home is well maintained, priced at an awesome rate. If you are looking to stay in the Gainesville area. this is definitely the place."

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jonathan’s place was very comfy and we felt right at home. The only thing we wished he had was stove top plates or toaster oven or maybe air fryer. Just something other then microwave and toaster. The air bnb next door was quite quiet so didn’t have any problems there. We did hear once in a while a car down the road racing. But that’s out of his control. I still say definitely stay here! Not everything can be 100% but his was about 99.9%!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great space, exactly what I needed for my work trip to Gainesville."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The location is awesome, off the beaten path, wooded, serene and has a peaceful rejuvenating energy. The studio is beautiful it's much bigger than it appears in the online pictures and when you first walk in it is very pleasing and welcoming. The decor and furniture are sturdy and of good quality. The studio was spotless. There was an out door patio with table and chairs where we really enjoyed sitting out in nature and admiring the surroundings. This was definitely worth the trip, definitely worth the stay and definitely wort the price."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place and the host are amazing. If you ever need a place to stay for 1 day or more you can't beat staying here.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband's daughter stayed in this lovely studio while visiting us, and had only positive remarks! Everything was so nice, so clean, and well-appointed--even the thoughtful provision of coffee!

Superb communication and hospitality from the hosts. They are very active in improving the grounds and landscaping. Location is very central. Appreciated the private entrance and porch sitting. Not equipped with cooking capacity at this time since it is a studio so plan accordingly but would like to see this added in the future. Fantastic overall experience.

This was the first I traveled by myself - no worries at all!!! Thank you for making feel like I was at home.."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was perfect for our quick trip to Gainesville and Ryland is an awesome host. I would recommend staying here to anyone and would definitely stay here again. Thanks!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"I had wanted to stay at this location on a previous trip but it was always booked. What a nice, clean, new and peaceful location. I slept like a baby in the comfortable bed, sound proof and with night time tea. I am a huge coffee drinker and it was so nice to have non-dairy selection and a local coffee to try too!! The view out the front door makes you feel like you are really on vacation with beautiful foliage, fruit trees and pretty local birds. A real sweet find. Ryland was always a text away and responded with any questions. There are a ton of restaurant's and bars in either direction off University Dr. I highly recommend staying here you will enjoy it very much!!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We agree with the large number of very pleased reviewers! The place was perfect: clean, comfortable, quite and even had a bird feeder outside the glass door visited by a pair of cardinals. My wife had a med appt at UF, very close by. Before the appt, we visited Kanapaha Garden and the Harn Museum of Art, also close by. A month ago UF canceled and rescheduled the appt; Ryland was very gracious in adjusting to this change. Very nice visit."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our short stay in this impeccable, well designed, small studio. It had everything we needed and was comfortable and peaceful.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in Ryland's studio worked out well for us. We were in Gainesville for an appointment at the University of Florida and Ryland's place was close enough to the university so that access to the early-morning appointment was quick and easy. While close to the university, the studio avoids the hustle and bustle of the campus as it is located in a quiet neighborhood and had onsite parking (always a plus!). Ryland was very responsive to our questions and needs, and we appreciated his recommendations for places to eat and sightsee - great to have a local's viewpoint. The studio itself was clean, well-designed and comfortable. We will be happy to return there in the future."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our time in Ryland's Studio, and will be using it as a base for future visits to enjoy the diving around Gainesville. Everything was clean, orderly, and better than expected. Great privacy with a pretty back yard. Our only recommendation would be to bring a mattress topper if you are a sensitive sleeper like us.

2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,Ryland was a great host and the house was very clean. There was one bug but I think that was just a fluke because the place itself was very tidy.

The outdoors was very beautiful but I was not able to enjoy because of the cool weather. I’m sure whenever it is warm enough it would be very relaxing to sit outside. The inside was very neat and beautifully decorated. The host provided plenty of towels and even coffee and chocolates. Everything was very close and easy to get to from there, including shopping, dining and entertainment. I would recommend Ryland’s place to anyone that needs a place in Gainesville Florida. Five stars from me!"

Whether you're in bed, admiring Buddha in the garden or in the kitchenette, appreciating the high-end finishes on every square inch of this place. Cathedral ceilings with set-in windows surround. He spared no expense.
Morning coffee on the patio was heaven. He had everything one could want to make the perfect cup. Even the cups were perfect. Again, Ryland spared no expense.

Situated within a quiet and established neighborhood just off the beaten path of University Avenue, this cozy apartment is within walking distance of plush campus green spaces and bubbling brooks. Safe pedestrian walkways lead to a wide range of coffee shops and local restaurants of all varieties.
Ryland, our gracious host (who also had a hand in its construction), provides clear instructions for check-in and departure. The unit is a modern and stylish efficiency; immaculately clean. He even provides coffee and, better still, chocolate! Ha!
As a single mother, traveling alone with my daughter, it was very reassuring to know that Ryland and his family were accessible and kind. I am so grateful! Thanks, Ryland!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This little slice of heaven was not my first choice for quick after holiday staycation but when the 1st host didn’t respond in time I decided to book. I’m a firm believer in everything happens for a reason because Ryland and his space were absolutely perfect. I read the overview so I expected short showers BUT the water stays hot way longer than expected! Everything was super clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the charging port w/ multiple chargers was a nice touch! They provided us quick assistance w/ check in and a detailed list of restaurants nearby. I forgot my vape pen and he even mailed it back! Stop looking just go ahead and book already!!"

2022-07-01,4,Stayed one night,👍👍thanks so much for short night here
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I attended a conference at UF, the conference hotel was asking more than $320 a night for a three night stay, so I scoured AirBNB and found this gem. It is quite new, every interior surface is immaculate and modern. It is cozy, but much more generous than a hotel room. There is a private, small deck area (it was 98 degrees and 100% humidity during my trip, so I merely admired it from the comfort of the air conditioned studio apartment). It was exactly as described, the host was very proactive with communications, and I was even able to make excellent coffee in-room using the provided French press and accoutrements. I asked about and was given a roster of dining options, too. During my stay, I could not hear any outside noise at all, it is located in a fairly quiet residential neighborhood. I had a perfect stay and would re-book in a heartbeat should I return to Gainesville. Thank you, Ryland!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed over a week,Checker and his co-host Ken took such amazing care of our family! They were so sweet and kind and made sure we had everything we need.

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Overall, it was great (see my other review for more detail)."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay as usual!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"The hosts were great and the room was just what we needed for our trip.
It was a bit heavy on the religious side of things (ex: overtly Christian decor, WiFi password, and Bible on the bedside table), which was not a particularly big deal for us but may bother others with more religious trauma.
Otherwise, there were no issues!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Checked was great. He was very communicative. We came in later at night and he put out signs to help us find the room that night. The room is quaint and well kept. Close to UF campus.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Checker's place is one that I always want to go back to. We felt right at home. The place is inviting, and time and consideration were taken on his part to make us feel real special and welcome.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, Comfortable and Cute! The accommodation’s and location are superb! Close to UF. A great place!"
2023-11-01,4,Stayed one night,"Checker's place was clean and well-supplied with amenities. The location was easy to find, and the neighborhood was quiet. My only issue was communicating with Checker during check-in. The door code for the room was not provided with the check-in info, and the hosts said they would greet me when I arrived and give me the code then. I messaged them through the AirBnb app ten minutes before arriving, and I saw that my message was read by Checker. When I arrived, however, nobody was there. I sent another message and waited. After a few minutes, I texted the number that was provided by the host (which specified texting rather than calling). No response. I then called the number and left a message. Finally, a few minutes later, Checker came out to greet me, barely even offering an apology for making me wait outside for 20 minutes. If the hosts insist on providing the door code in person (instead of just sending it ahead of time), communication needs to be better to avoid these situations."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable with super friendly hosts. Would definitely stay again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was as listed. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. Space was clean and well kept. The host did an amazing job checking in and making sure everything was to my expectation. Will stay again.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and safe neighborhood. Quiet room. Great mini split air conditioner.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stayed at Checker's Garden Room and it was great! They were super attentive. Any questions I had they would respond right away. The room looked exactly as it did in the pictures. Very cute and full of little touches to make you feel welcome and comfortable. I was visiting my son who goes to UF. The Garden Room is very central to everything. About 15-20 minutes from everything. I would definitely recommend it if you are ever in Gainesville!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a great and affordable stay. Our hosts were very responsive and made sure we were satisfied with our stay. The room was very clean as well. I would recommend anyone staying in the Gainesville, FL area, to stay with Checker! Thanks again!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy & host was very nice!!! Would come back for sure!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect! The room is cozy but not too small and has everything we needed. He even stocked the fridge with soda and water!
I use Airbnb a lot, and Checker has something in this room that is REALLY hard to find - an actual freezer in the fridge! It’s apartment-sized so keep that in mind, but it’s not just a tiny frozen shelf inside the fridge compartment. It’s got a separate door and there is definitely enough room for a few days worth of meals.
Then there’s the outside - the garden in the back is absolutely lovely and lush. I worked there and I loved it as my office!
Lastly, Checker himself is a great guy - a wonderful soul who was warm, welcoming, and helpful.
We’ll be back!! Thanks Checker!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the PERFECT place for me to stay! I travel alone to teach classes and I felt so secure and safe at this home.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,this guest suite was a perfect place for my husband and I. it was located in a great area. the host had a cute little sign welcoming us on the bed which felt personal and it was overall a nice little gesture!! included little snacks and drinks in the fridge. it was amazing!

2019-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the convenient location of this place for our trip to Gainesville and Manatee Springs State Park. Checker was very kind and helpful, and he made the check-in process much smoother than expected. They accepted our reservation on very short notice so we are grateful for that! Lastly, the place has everything you would need and is very private from the rest of the house."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best AirBnbs in Gainesville. I stayed a week and would have happily stayed longer. Cannot be beat for the location - close to everything - cleanliness, friendliness, and quiet. The bed was comfortable and I loved having a fridge in my room so I could store my food without feeling like I was taking up room in the kitchen fridge. There was a huge amount of closet storage too, which helped me as I have a lot of stuff for long term stays. I had the whole half of the house to myself including my own bathroom (just outside the room in the hallway, but still around the corner/ hidden from view of the rest of the house) and this made me very comfortable. As a single woman, staying here not only met my standards but Cassia made me feel at home and welcome. Would definitely stay again."

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a return visit to Checker’s comfortable home. Lovely , quiet neighborhood and relaxing accommodations with very comfortable bed. Easy access to activities in and surrounding Gainesville."
2019-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderful stay, my first bnb stay with airbnb and at Checker’s. Raised the bar for my expectations at future locations!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I’ve spent 2 wonderful days in Checker’s house. Great location with beautiful nature, stylish interiors, very clean and comfortable room, large separated bathroom. The atmosphere of the house is really fantastic! Next time I’ll stay here with a big pleasure!"
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,lovely home. lovely people. amazing value
2019-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I had a relaxing stay in Checkers lovely home. The bedroom was immaculate and the bed was quite comfortable. Nice amenities in a tranquil setting.
2019-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Clean, Convenient and quiet. It was perfect for my needs. Thank you very much"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place, super cozy! Hosts are so kind and communicative. Nice neighborhood too. Highly recommend for travelers looking to stay, be it short term or longer!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"A little hiccup about the definition of “suite” and what was included in my reservation but the property manager and owner were more than willing and able to correct it immediately.
Otherwise, the space was clean and quiet and private. I typically prefer areas with separate entrances (I work nights, so it makes life easier for everyone) but the house was large enough, and the suite separate enough, that I was comfortable with the location.
I really appreciated the extra touches - including snacks, coffee and mini fridge! - of the space. Bed was comfortable. Place was perfectly clean.
Thank you!"
2019-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,This fit the bill perfectly. I just needed a temporary place to stay while I looked for an apartment. Easy access around Gainesville and nice amenities in the room. Thanks!
2018-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,This home is in a great location. The communication is second to none. It’s a very clean and comfortable home. It was like staying at s friends place while they were away. I highly recommend this stay.
2018-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent accommodations.
Exquisitely comfortable space in every way.
I will definitely want to come back."

2018-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very convenient location. House was very clean in a nice residential neighborhood. Check in and check out were seamless. Responded instantly to all messages.
2018-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had an amazing stay and wished we had stayed longer :) Definitely coming back to Gainesville. Loved staying in a residential area as opposed to in a hotel. Nice, soft bed and cosy home."
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,I stayed in a beautiful room with Immaculate furnishings. I had my own private bathroom that was sparkling clean. My hosts were friendly and check in was a breeze. I highly recommend this place and I travel with Airbnb all the time. Will definitely use them again.
2018-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Checker and Gloria were great hosts. Their house was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. The location was just north of Paynes Prairie and UF. The hosts were super sweet and happy to have guests. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"
2018-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"A lovely extremely clean room in a separate wing of the house. Spacious closets, well lit and secure. . The bed seems brand new, as do the linens. A nice firm quality mattress. Big screen TV, internet access, very quiet and comfortable! I slept very well. Checker and Gloria greeted me warmly at the door and everything was explained very clearly. The house is conveniently close to a big CVS, Fresh Market, gas, etc.. I’d definitely stay here again! Highly recommend!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"As expected, great stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Fit the description very well. Good option as an affordable place to spend a couple of days near downtown
2024-06-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed our stay here, it was just enough for a quick trip to Gainesville. I will say if someone is staying in the other unit, be aware that there is no soundproofing between them and the sound carries very easily. Overall pleased with this airbnb."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice, clean, and quiet. I would definitely stay there again!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We’ve considered buying a shipping container home and we really wanted to stay in one to get the full experience first. We also would always rather stay in unique homes rather than hotels. This was certainly unique and spacious for two average sized people. It has some comfort amenities like AC, fan, TV. You’ll want to bring your own coffee/tea and any creamer additives for those drinks. The view outside is private and peaceful."
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great experience to stay in something unique!
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very unique and creative property.
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Stayed for a couple of nights as a research student and enjoyed my stay very much! The location is great- it's private and surrounded by a lot of greenery and wildlife. About a 20 minute walk from downtown.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wow, unique stay, great location, amazing value and comfort!
I stayed here for a couple nights with my husband as we were visiting friends around Gainesville and Alachua, and it's a perfect cozy getaway for a single person or a happy couple.
I was a tiny bit skeptical about a shipping container but for the money that weekend, I couldn't beat it and interestingly, it's even better in person than in the pictures! It is SUPER comfortable, SPOTLESS and feels spacious... the bed was better than many hotels, and the shower water pressure and temperature were perfect.
They packed everything you'd need for a short stay into a small but perfectly organized place. We didn't need to cook but there is enough there to make small and basic meals for sure.
The property itself is very private and super quiet, great if you like to sit outside and meditate in nature (we do). Close to a ton of stuff in downtown Gainesville!
Better than ANY hotel in the area at this price! Would absolutely re-book."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place felt very comfortable
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,nice stay
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy and unique place! Would come here again!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Leandro’s place was excellent for our needs! The space itself was clean, neat, and comfortable enough for one to two people. It made our mini-vacation to Gainesville perfect! Everything worked as described. The only difficulty was finding the place because it is in a secluded area, but Leandro’s instructions were crystal clear and we were easily able to find the space. If you are a walker, you can easily park and walk from the space to the downtown area in less 15 minutes. This place is perfect for a getaway to Gainesville and we will definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,4,Stayed one night,"Stayed for one night. The mini split was leaking and cause some water to pool on the floor. Leandro was great with communication and solutions. Quiet place, clean, easy, small, pretty much exactly as described."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great spot with a forest view but still within the city
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Such a unique spot and perfect for a little getaway. Would stay again!

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable place for a single person to stay. Pretty secluded and peaceful.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I was in Gainesville for a research trip, and this location was perfect. Walkable to UF, near a Publix and a few restaurants....instructions for finding the unit and unlocking the door were thoughtful and thorough.
Clean, simple, easy stay!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is a great little place to stay! It’s secluded and quiet when you’re looking for relaxation, and peace. It’s clean and cozy! Will definitely book for future stays!"

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cool and unique, private and quiet"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were curious about the container concept and enjoyed the time spent there.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"needs a new mattress
didn't sleep at all
not in the best area of town"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Everything was clean and comfortable. Nice hot water. My boyfriend always wanted to try one of the container spaces, and this was right up his alley. It didn't disappoint and was super comfortable for the two of us. Located a few miles from great food and everywhere I wanted to be."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Hands down, this was my favorite Airbnb stay that I've ever had. The space was creative and unique. It was very quiet, and easy for me to concentrate, which was important to me because it was a work trip. It was perfectly clean and has everything you need. Leandro is a quick communicator and very welcoming. I am considering going back to Gainesville soon, just to stay there again. Definitely book this, you will not be disappointed."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,Cute container! Ideal for a short stay
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"It was very pleasant our stay .We had everything we need , the bed was comfortable, nice shower and tv. The place was spotless!! Right at the historic district .

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute space, wish the area was a little better but other than that we were happy with the overall stay!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Great for a one night layover or a weekend on the town.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome stay, and woke up to a view of a forest - really beautiful and peaceful. Would definitely come back."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My Stay Was Great! I Had Everything I Needed! Leandro Is A Great Host! I Let Him Know What I Was Missing, And He Was Responsive And Got It To Me! Everything Else Was Great! Definitely Worth The Money!!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Stay was really nice, great location!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This accommodation is super nice and clean. I loved the nature around it.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Cute design and a cozy small place but AC and heat both work amazingly. It’s hidden sort of so it’s private for sure. Very clean and nice owners.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome spot, can’t wait till next time.
Really nice tiny home build."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Can't say enough nice things about the place. The whole process went smoother than I imagined.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Really enjoyed our weekend at this location. The location of this property is very close to some great things. There is a very nice park that is less than 3 min drive away. We took the dogs there every day! Not far from good restaurants, and what I would consider downtown area. The street this is located near isn't the prettiest but we felt safe and had no issues. Would recommend for someone staying in Gainesville for a short trip!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Unique space and location, close to active retail/restaurant areas but VERY peaceful. Supremely comfortable bed. Everything you need for a short stay and some more. Would def stay again."
2023-12-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Cute little concept! The stay was comfortable and with the weather cooling off, the fire pit was nice.
The only very minimal complaint I’d say I had was the tv was lagging extremely bad and kept continuously shutting off while using it, and the shower curtain either needed to be cleaned or replaced!
The sheets were clean and comfortable and so was our stay! Would stay again if ever in Gainesville."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,:)
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very quick responses from host, nice simple location."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The perfect space for two! Exactly as pictured.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The accommodation was clean and comfortable. Good spot for our quick layover. The location was convenient to a nearby park, and restaurants."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a pleasant short stay! As others have said, driving into the area, some surrounding houses didn’t look as well kept, but the container space itself was clean and we didn’t have any issues! Very close to the main streets and restaurants. Depot Park is very close and was great for our toddler. Very peaceful wooded area in the morning. Notified host about some trouble with the tv remote and some missing toiletries but still a great, unique, lodging experience!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Love staying here, such a cool spot and close to everything!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was the perfect little getaway for me. My favorite part was when you open the beautiful curtains you can see amazing plants and greenery giving it a jungle type feel. The place was immaculately clean and decorated very nice. The bed was comfy and you even have a remote control to change the temperature. It was perfection! I will be booking again.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent experience from booking through checkout. Very clear directions with outstanding communication. Pictures and positive comments are accurate. Extremely clean, comfortable, and cozy. Shower was sizable and had great water pressure and temperature, bed was nice, kitchenette useful. It’s such a cool space including the privacy of the woods. I walked in the evening to Depot Park. Safe area. Conveniently located to UF. It was quiet, peaceful, serene, and good value for 1-2 people. If this is a fun place you’d like to try, don’t hesitate; there are reasons the overall rating is so high…it’s legitimate. Thank you for an outstanding stay. I would definitely book again in the future."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful stay and such a cute unique place! Will definitely stay again when we are in the area! Thank you!
2023-11-01,3,Stayed one night,"Felt like an u safe area, and the unit was fine but did hear the other side showing and farting. The whole lake has a weird musty old persons house smell to it. I thought it would be a cool experience, especially for the price I paid, but I wouldn’t do it again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"great little spot at a great value. close to downtown, but also secluded and private. very clean and comfortable. good communication from the host. would absolutely stay again!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed about a week,Place has everything you need if traveling in the area. My only slight complaint is that I could here the people in the other unit at times.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"A hidden gem and a really nifty AirBnB concept. Though, out of the box thinking maybe current and hip… you’ll definitely love the thinking they did inside this box."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super cute and cozy! Really beautiful view with the bed.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Nice little container home- enjoyed my stay.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fun stay! We enjoyed the concept of the ""tiny house"" and it was just what we were looking for to enjoy the weekend. Troy's directions in light of the phone insisting we go a different direction were perfect. Wished we had time to enjoy the firepit- maybe next time!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very unique, cozy little space! Comes as advertised, very clean, modern and gets the job done. The space is quite small, that would be my only drawkback...suitcase was just in the middle of the floor as I couldn't really find another space for it. However, for a short 2 night stay, this place was absolutely fine. Really pleasant waking up to the greenery outside the glass wall. Would recommend"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great for short stays or new experiences! The container itself is clean and equipped with amenities. There were a few bugs but it is normal due to its nature/location but did not bother us. WARNING: the area at night can be noisy since it is near downtown (music blaring, etc.) if you are a light sleeper and cannot stand noises this place is not for you. The surrounding areas may feel a bit unsafe, please be careful (especially at night). Other than that the location is all the way in a secluded dead-end area, very private. The fireplace was lovely after walking downtown. Thank you Leandro!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I came up from south Florida to visit a few of the springs they have in the area. I wanted a nicely placed place that wasn’t to big as i wouldn’t spend to much time there. Troy’s listing was perfect for what we needed. The place looks exactly like the pictures and was very clean, it has everything you need. Troy and his team are very responsive and helpful. The college town of UF is also about 5 minutes away so there are PLENTY places to pass time or find food. I HIGHLY recommend troys listing!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,always a great stay!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,nice and quiet place host are awesome
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place to stay. Clean and simple.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Nice place, clean house"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect little spot to stay. I would absolutely stay again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Skip the hotel and book this precious stay! I love finding unique places to stay for a night, and this was perfect. It had everything I needed for a quick stay in Gainesville on the way back home to the Keys from Nashville. I felt like I was out on a quiet campground and only wished I had one more night to enjoy the space a little more, build a fire and explore around. Whether a quick stay or a weekend in Gainesville, I'd say book this unique little spot for sure!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Troy is a wonderful host, very responsive and caring. The place is cute and simple. Seclude and quiet. I watched deer stroll by my window."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Always love staying here!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The shipping container was quite a cute stay! It was super close to downtown Gainesville and anything outside of downtown was no more than 15 minutes.
There were quite a few bugs, but nothing that couldn’t be taken care of.
I would stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Quintessential Gainesville. Not too fancy. Welcoming. Beautiful trees and plants all around. Low key comfort. Loved our stay.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a very unique place would definitely stay again very clean and a nice view of greenery in our unit B very attentive host and very close to everything in Gainesville!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I enjoyed staying here. It was a very close drive to the campus yet still very private. I would stay here again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Truly enjoyed this stay. It was a cozy home away from home.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Comfortable & peaceful, will definitely book again"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a pleasant stay at this nice and affordable space conveniently located near the downtown area. When searching for the location, using car directions on G-maps will definitely assist you (When using the walk directions, it took me down an adjacent road that didn't have a clear pathway to the Airbnb). The unit is located on a small dirt road that passes by 2 small houses. The shipping container was a neat experience and it provided all the essentials necessary for a comfortable stay.
One thing to note is that walking around at night might be a bit intimidating due to the condition of some nearby houses needing some care. However, despite this, I didn't encounter any problems during my stay and would certainly consider booking this place again in the future."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Soo cool!! perfect little spot for my time in Gainesville. Close to everything, very comfortable."
2023-07-01,3,Stayed one night,The place was in a secluded area which offers lots of privacy! Staying in a shipping container was also cool to cross off my bucket list! Unfortunately I did not get much sleep as the AC unit made a clunking noise all night and then I saw 3 wood roaches. The host did respond and apologize but I had to cancel meetings the next day since I only got 2 hours of sleep.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Was a beautiful location. Peaceful and quiet.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great stay! Cute little home in a great location for us! The hosts were very great with communication.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved our stay in the Container!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked this place while we were driving back to Orlando from North Georgia. Great spot for us to land for the night! Couldn’t have asked for better. Secluded yet close to Main Street to grab dinner. We are both Vegetarian and loved the vibe at The Top, worth checking out for dinner/drinks. Definitely recommend!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying Here was certainly one of the most interesting Airbnb experiences I've ever had! Really nice and well ke kept home that was a short drive from the University of Florida / Gainesville downtown. Price wasn't so bad but keep an eye on the cleaning and service fees, since the list price isn't exactly accurate. Would definitely consider staying here again."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a unique place coming from a shipping storage container to a tranquil place to stay.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We came into town to spend some time with family and we loved our stay! Feels like you’re not even near downtown! Comfortable and clean. Would recommend to anyone! Will definitely book again when we are in town!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Love My Stay
Will be Back😊"
2023-05-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The tiny home is perfect. It was very comfortable and cool for a different kind of stay. We're locals and this has the potential to be a great getaway. We did have issues with our unit neighbor keeping us up all night with noise, but Troy and his partner were very friendly and helpful after we let them know. I truly believe had there been someone else staying next door, our time would've been an amazing experience.
Overall, I'm grateful for their understanding and assistance. Plus it's nice to see some recommendations for local spots we know and love."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Awesome stay, really cool spot. It was cozy and as described. Would recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We spent the night to celebrate my boyfriend's 50th birthday and loved it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay! It’s nice to have an affordable option to stay when everything is so expensive right now. The tiny house had everything we needed. My boyfriend is 6’2 and he felt comfortable getting around inside the bathroom/shower. There are bugs that tend to fly in when you open the door at night, but that’s to be expected in the summertime of Florida. All in all, would stay again!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a unique and unforgettable experience! Loved it!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Place is exactly as listed. No issues and made for a quick, easy and pleasant stay."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Excellent craftsmanship, nice finishes beyong great service!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"There’s an amazing place called Depot Park less than a mile away, great for family a huge playground, splash park and food options! I could have spent my entire time there…"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,I had a wonderful stay. The place was really clean and cute. The bed was really comfortable too. Loved being so close to town but felt like I was in the peaceful woods.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"First time for my husband and I staying home in a shipping container over night!
Inside and outside were perfect"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,The place was PERFECT! It was clean and well maintained! We will definitely be back
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed my stay and Troy was an excellent host. If the photos intrigue you, then you won’t be disappointed. The environment has the serenity of the country while being close to the amenities of the city."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Unique experience in a small, clean and well appointed space. Great communication and check in process. Close to downtown."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Troys place was a great week getaway! Love how the container home was decorated and kitchen was very clean and easy to use. Would stay here again
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,This space is amazing and feels like you’re lost in a forest! Troy was amazing and responsive! We really enjoyed our stay
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"we stayed for a quick overnight, it was as described and very cute! thanks!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great weekend stay. My husband and I comfortably stayed two nights. Super clean bathroom and kitchen area. Great location, just a few blocks from Depot Park and a short drive to restaurants and shops. Loved the unique stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,great
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Love it
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Troy's container Airbnb was a fun stay! It was perfect for my work trip. It got a little damp inside at times, but the A/C unit has a dry setting that helped. I'd stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thanks for the stay!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay! The place was clean and was the perfect place for a weekend getaway! Troy responded quickly and was super helpful!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Awesome experience!!!
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"COOL unit. Easy access and close to UF/town. Clean and perfect for a short stay. Pay attention to Troy's helpful hints, like close the door so to prevent mosquitoes coming in. Troy leaves some nice little essentials such as sunscreen and insect repellant, sugar, salt and pepper, but there is nothing like coffee. There is a sketch house next door and a trailer in the lot that is a little off putting, but I am a 6 foot male and was unconcerned. Overall the value is there for cost, cleanliness and proximity to UF. They do allow dogs, and this would be a GREAT spot for a dog owner as there was some runaround room for a dog. I would stay here again, especially if I were going to football game and tailgating, as you could probably have a nice little tailgate in the unit lot first before going to game."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a simple, uncomplicated stay in all the best ways. It is very clean, with all the necessities for a comfortable stay. I was there for the weekend with our dog to visit our daughter at UF. The container is small but has all you need from great wifi to a good size shower and good water pressure. I was able to have quiet mornings with plenty of lovely streets to walk the dog. Very close to Depot Park which is a lively Gainesville outdoor space. I would stay again."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice rental

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, original and affordable. Perfect for a getaway."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great stay!
Even though this was a tight space, it was perfect for my fiancé, my cocker spaniel and I. There was enough room for her bed to sit well on the floor. The view from our window was a great thing to wake up next to and just begin the day! Thanks for the stay!!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I love container homes and this one did not disappoint! The space is super comfy, well-organized and had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. The location is a short drive away to good restaurants. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in the area."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was really cute. Close to downtown but far enough away, too. The window of unit B is over looking some pretty woods— our dog loved looking out of it. It’s very cozy!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Location, comfort, quiet, and great hosts. Great place for being out of town on business or a quiet weekend away!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cool Tiny home/container! Friendly & very responsive. Thank you!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We enjoyed our stay at Troy's place. The description, amenities and location were all as described. We would stay here again if visiting the area. You can walk to the local park from this location. Peaceful surroundings."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent accommodations for such short notice & helped us along the way entirely, thank you Troy!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We wanted to try something different and this storage container was perfect! It was the perfect size for a couple & very clean. Downtown Gainesville is close & I like the location of the Airbnb, it’s private and tucked away but is a short drive from things to do. Troy was kind and responsive. The only thing to take into consideration is it is split in 2, so you may be able to hear someone if they’re in the attached unit. We would recommend this space to anyone!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Really enjoyed it!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place! Great host, location and price!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay! Super convenient location but felt very private and comfortable.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Very cool place in Gainesville to stay if you are passing thru and need a place to rest. Lives up to the ""tiny/container"" description with the semi-remote but beautifully done. Not far from 1-75 and minutes from Downtown Gainesville."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Love love love
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Tiny homes are the place to stay now!!!! Loved it💕
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,This was an amazing stay and would do it every time I come to Gainesville
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"perfect size,location and overalljust adorable little spot. will definitely consider for future cisits"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Green Container is a beautiful little space with a nice little kitchen area for one or two people wanting a little get away or a place to hangout and explore the Gainesville area. Troy is very prompt in communicating and accommodating. I will stay again if I’m in the area.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a perfect stay in Gainesville for my husband and I passing through. We only stayed one night, but would have been comfortable staying longer. Tony provided great communication and very cozy accommodations. The location is great being right near depot park and close to downtown. The container home is clean and trendy."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Exactly as described. Perfect and quiet stay.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I really enjoyed my stay in Troy’s tiny home!! Communication was perfect and Troy was more than accommodating to last minute requests. I look forward to staying here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Cozy cool version of a tiny house
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the shipping container! Quite a unique experience. The bed was comfortable and we loved being able to look out of the big window into the woods behind us. We were provided with everything we needed- including bug spray and sunscreen which was very nice. There were also citronella candles outside if we wanted to hang out in front. Being a Florida native who grew up in the woods, I'm used to the critters, so if you're not from here definitely heed Troy's warning! We felt right at home and had no problems finding the location. We were close to town and all it took was a 5-6 minute car ride to get to where we wanted to go. I highly recommend this spot for those who enjoy the outdoors as it feels very immersive."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cool stay
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The storage container room was nicely decorated inside and comfortable. The location is good. We enjoyed and thought it was a good value.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place. Very central to tons of stuff in the area. Quiet location no worry about college kid ruckus.
The container is nicely decorated, very comfy and the bathroom/shower was great. Will definitely be back again."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, cute and cozy. There is a beatiful, relaxing nature view from the bed through sliding double door. Very attentive and quick to respond host."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking to experience container home living, this location will provide you with that. It is within close proximity to University Ave and UF ( 5-10 min) where there are endless dining options. The container home is quiet if you are ok with being off the beaten path. Troy was friendly and swift to respond."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This was a great little space for my husband and me. Very close to everything. The inside was clean and comfortable.
2022-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This place is perfect for one or two person stay. A lot of places near by to eat and have fun. The only bad thing was I couldn’t find it at the beginning. The gps keep sending me to a different place, but Troy was quickly to respond and help me to find the place. This place has eveything you need for a few days stay. I’m a travel nurse and always looking for places in the area to stay. I’d definetely book this place again soon."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb is perfect for one person, and has everything you need! (Might be a little tight on space for 2 people). It was very clean and comfortable and a great value. I would stay here again! One tip I have is to follow the written instructions for arrival instead of just using the address in a Maps app."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and great location!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Cute place and very unique! Felt very comfortable in our stay and had a lot of little things like tea, bug spray, etc."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, great location and clean! It was a great experience:))) We will do it again!"
2022-08-01,4,Stayed about a week,Was a great stay overall! Had everything I needed to stay and close to some great things at Depot Park. Truly a unique experience I would recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,what a cool spot. great central location close to downtown. the perfect amount of space for 2!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Neat experience staying in a conex box. That was….. different but very pleasant and close to things. Shocked at how well a conex box look.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The place is comfortable, good location and the host is the best!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Super clean and cozy! Great location near downtown. Very easy communication with hosts. I loved the big picture window out onto the Florida jungle scape :-)
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"If you are a fan of alternative spaces, you are in for treat! If you couldn’t care less, This place will make you a fan! The very small space seems magically larger inside. The often ingenious use of space is complimented by the upscale-industrial design is well suited to steel containers.
I particularly appreciated & loved that they did not shy away from adding the comfy necessities of life today, minimal well-appointed kitchen & bathroom , nice towels, a huge flat screen where you can Netflix & Chill from the equally comfy bed or couch. Plenty of outlets and surface space that can easily be moved to suit your needs. It’s a fun and unique space that
I highly recommend!, & look forward to future stays and workshops."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was cute and clean, the percolator was a plus. I had a great time."
2024-06-01,4,Group trip,"Enjoyed our stay in this lovely home. LaTisha was an amazing host, patiently answering my many questions and was always prompt to respond. The one issue we encountered during the stay was quickly resolved, allowing us to relax and truly enjoy graduation weekend at UF."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Overall, this is a very beautiful home! The place was extremely nice and exceeded my expectations! The beds were very comfortable and it had a very spacious kitchen with everything you will need! The host was very responsive and helpful whenever we had a question or concern. We would definitely book again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host/ manager have a strong attention to detail. We particularly liked the koi pond and the friendly fish that were always happy to see us. Details including leaving fish food for us to feed and bond with the fish. There were relaxing and luxury details throughout the house. Truly enjoyable.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Latisha was a very kind and responsive host! She responded to any questions that we had in a timely manner. She walked through the instructions and made us
feel at home. I would recommend the Modern Muse House."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Modern, spacious and beautiful Airbnb! Great location very near to University of Florida. The heated pool and spacious back yard was where we spent the majority of our time. Plenty of seating for everyone. The waterfall was relaxing to listen to. The koi pond was as a delight - we enjoyed feeding them. Plenty of seating in the living room for everyone. I liked the no shoe policy as we have the same in our home. We would highly recommend this Airbnb!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house is amazing. You feel like you are in Miami, but it is Gainesville Florida. The toilets are a whole new experience...one of the best features. The furnishings, yummy blankets, games, pool, spa-like bathrooms, and overall aesthetic is INSTA WORTHY!! The pool is nice and heated, and the outdoor firepit made it nice on those cool spring/fall Florida nights. I have stayed here twice, and I will stay anytime I am in the area. They think of everything, coffee, hot cocoa, fish food for the koi fish, games, cozy blankets, laundry, and high level entertainment options. I would not stay anywhere else when I am in this area...only thing missing is a hot tub!!"
2024-02-01,5,Group trip,"Everything about this home was perfect for what we were looking for. It was clean, spacious, and had good energy. We especially enjoyed the heated pool and outdoor seating! LaTisha was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. We will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,LaTisha is a very kind and helpful host! The home is beautiful and very clean. The backyard is a gorgeous and peaceful place to rest and spend quality time with family or friends. I loved feeding the Koi fish. They are beautiful and so friendly and interactive. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful home
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,What a wonderful stay we had in this home. Everything is as described. We have stayed at many Airbnb's I have to say this home set up is fabulous. I wish all Airbnb's had as much thought as you have put into the accommodations with this home. Such a good job.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome stay from start to end
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"LaTisha and her her property manager were wonderful hosts. They responded very quickly, they were very helpful, and very nice. It was a comfortable and amazing experience staying with them. I would gladly stay with them again!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,All great!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Exactly as pictured. Very comfortable and clean. Wonderful host, answered all our questions quickly. Would absolutely stay again"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed about a week,We were in town for a surgery at Shands and the home was close to the hospital allowing us to easily go back and forth.
2023-09-01,5,Group trip,Amazing house with numerous upgrades. Clean and host was extremely helpful. Well stocked home with all you could need for your trip!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Place is great
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great space super clean and the fish are amazing
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"It certainly is beautifully decorated and updated. The supplies they offered were wonderful, such as shampoo, conditioner, disposable, razor, and shower scrunchie. Slippers robes were provided, which I thought was a great touch. There is a scent being put through the AC ducks which took some getting used to. I would only suggest take better care of the exterior pool areas. Close to Gainesville airport which was great. Dropping family members off. Perfect location for attending university of Florida graduation."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Have stayed here multiple times. Loved each of our visits and looking forward to our next one.
LaTisha is a fantastic host and the property is absolutely gorgeous. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place to stay. LaTisha was very helpful and responsive even for silly questions… The only complaint or opportunity for improvement would be removing the cameras on the pool. I understand the need for them at the entrance but it’s a bit creepy for my wife and daughter having them pointed at the pool.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LaTisha was no less than a fabulous host. Readily available and the communications clear and precise. I’m coming back to Gainesville in the near future and Latisha home will be my destination.
Hands down the best Air BnB experience ever. I can go on and on, if you dare to entertain another location, you have already made the wrong decision."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was great, comfortable, and very clean. The most amenities I’ve ever had in any other airBNB. Better than a hotel! You don’t have to bring anything with you, just your clothing. I Will definitely book this house again.
Thank you Tisha"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Best Air BNB!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This property is truly a luxury home. We absolutely loved the relaxing modern aesthetic. Beautiful pool and spa like furnishings throughout the home.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"LATISHA WAS PHENOMENAL. WHAT A GREAT HUMAN BEING AND HOST. THIS IS PERHAPS THE BEST AIRBNB IN THE GAINESVILLE AREA.
THE HOTEL VIBE THEY WENT FOR WAS FLAWLESS. THE BEDS WHERE SO COMFORTABLE THAT I HAD TO ASK LATISHA WHERE SHE BOUGHT THE MATTRESS AND WE JUST ORDERED ONE FOR OUR HOME.
SUPERB IN EVERY SENSE."
2023-03-01,5,Group trip,The house was absolutely gorgeous!! Would recommend to stay here! Very clean and provided everything you need.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved staying here! Had everything we needed and more. Being able to feed the koi fish was such a cool extra little bonus. The house was very clean, spacious, and fully equipped. It is more of a high tech, modern home. Pool was comfortably warm throughout our stay, even on days when it rained/ was cloudy the majority of the day. Would definitely book again"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great. Great location. Beautiful home :).
2023-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,The house looks beautiful but it wasn’t functional living space for me. The smart home aspect was too much for me and even the kids had a hard time using Alexa. That being said we did have a great time in the home the pool was amazing.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the best Airbnb ever! It is beyond amazing! This fish are super cool! It felt like a spa!!!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Spacious beautiful house in Gainesville. Nicely renovated and decorated. Cozy backyard and family area inside.

The pool is heated so nicely and the house is wonderfully designed and decorated. This is definitely our favorite AirBnb experience so far. LaTisha is so professional and nice. We arrived late and asked for some info and she immediately responded even though it’s very late. Wonderful wonderful wonderful!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean and modern. It is Very peaceful.
Heated pool is a must."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a great luxurious experience with everything you can think of. So nice that we are going to visit it again at the end of our trip. I don’t know why there’s not a picture of the koi pond by the front door because it’s so beautiful and cute! The host even provided us some koi food so we can feed the fish. It is one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever visited.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"This luxury abs comfy place can give you and your family an excellent time . Both inside and outside are beautiful. We enjoyed the pool , fire pit and everything else ."

2021-11-01,5,Group trip,"This is a beautiful home in a really quiet, nice family neighborhood. It is very convenient to UF (my Gator rode his bike to the house to meet us) and also 2-3 blocks from a Publix & Fresh Market which was great for quick errands. The beds were very comfortable and all bedding freshly laundered. The back yard and deck were a great gathering place for the beautiful Florida November nights and the fire pit kept us warm! My family (husband and I, two college sons, and both sets of grandparents, and our dog!) spent thanksgiving there (in town for UF/FSU game) and the house was beautifully decorated for a great fall celebration. Thanks again! The host was VERY responsive any time I had questions with an open text thread during our stay. Great place for an upscale stay in Gainesville!"

2021-08-01,3,Group trip,"The house was absolutely beautiful. It was also well stocked with almost everything you could need on vacation. I would recommend this place. However be sure to inquire about all of the rules and expectations prior to purchase.
The host LaTisha was very responsive.
However we had a few issues during our stay and some of those issues were not resolved. We were also immediately blamed for the issues. I have a great reputation with Airbnb. I reported everything to her as soon issues occurred. The AC/fans in both small bedrooms did not work this was not resolved during our stay. The master bathroom toilet started leaking into the bedroom I immediately cleaned it up so the property was not damaged and promptly and respectfully contacted LaTisha. She sent out a plumber. Then later text me informing me that wipes were found in the pipes. I personally stayed in this room and used this bathroom and only used the toilet paper provided by the Airbnb. After explaining this I was informed a claim would be filed through Airbnb and airbnb could handle it. Which did not seem fair or understanding to me when I am certain that wipes were not used during our stay. Her personal staff informed me and my guests that the plumbing system was old and often backed up. We then encountered a huge amount of maggots after only being there 1 night. We had a small amount of trash placed in the appropriate trash cans (not full and only there for a short time). Maggots swarmed the back patio and patio doors. LaTisha did send someone to resolve this issue. However, long after the issue was resolved her staff continued to hang around the house making the guests uncomfortable. She did not leave until almost 10pm and she initially arrived at 3.
We paid a $250 cleaning fee but we’re asked to throughly clean everything or told we would be charged extra from a website hidden from Airbnb. All these rules and hidden charges were not disclosed until after purchase of the Airbnb.
Outside of these issues the place was immaculate. Again Latisha was very responsive at all hours and for the most part very helpful."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place and accurate listing. Very thoughtful listing with a lot of nice details. great stay.
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"LaTisha was an amazing host with great communication. She was readily available whenever needed & always responded promptly. The house is even more stunning in person. Super clean and fully stocked with absolutely everything you may need for a perfect stay, you name it they have it. The pool area was so relaxing with a zen like ambiance. Book this smart house, you will not regret it!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"This is truly a luxury home! Saltwater pool and outdoor entertainment areas are lovely. I had not experienced an Alexa controlled home before, and that was fun. Beautiful high end finishes and furniture. Comfort in every aspect. Lots of bonuses including robes, snacks, koi pond, and signs throughout with helpful hints on utilizing the features of the home."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,WOW 5 stars! Enjoyed ALL the amenities :) it was a profound home with really Zen vibes. The best home in Gainesville I’ve had the honor to enjoy its shelter! Highly recommend.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house was beautiful and the pool was fun! Our host was always available and the neighborhood was was super friendly. We will definitely look at this house again for future stays!

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is an absolutely beautiful home. Everything was incredibly well thought-out. Ms. LaTisha provided several notes throughout the home (for the non-smart home travelers, such as me and my wife) on how to operate the Alexa system. The decoration was incredible, and the outdoor living space was everything we could’ve desired. We will definitely be making a trip back to Gainesville just to stay at this home!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures truly do not do it justice, there is luxury and quality at every turn. From the gourmet kitchen, to the the massage tv and the living room, even down to the high end toiletries. We were even pleasantly surprised to find a koi pond, and the host even provided us with fish food so we could feed them. The salt water pool is perfect temperature, and the yard and landscaping is private and wonderful."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is well located, super clean, comfortable, with a lot of amenities. It became my family’s best choice in Gainesville!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We liked this five star AirBnB and both Hosts so much we came back for a second stay! Our second stay was just as great as the first. Our Hosts were very helpful with everything we needed during our stay. They went above and beyond our expectations to make sure we were comfortable. Breakfast was delicious each morning. They are both interesting to talk to with a great sense of humor. Their TV with Netflix and HBO Max was great for binge watching. The large window in the bedroom lets in a lot of sunlight and the window blind makes the room dark at night the way we like it. Their bed is super comfortable in the large bedroom. Their neighborhood is quiet during the day and night. Safe neighborhood to walk in during the day with many stores and restaurants. We highly recommend the Adam’s Rib Company Restaurant up the street. Their brisket is the best! Our Hostess made delicious fried zucchini and shared it. I highly recommend this very clean AirBnB. Thank you both for another great stay!

I was able to leave my extra luggage in their garage. The bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed and lots of sunlight. The two closets were spacious. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean with soft towels. The shower was hot. The breakfast each morning was delicious and I really appreciate it being ready when I woke up from over sleeping. I hope Ilona will forgive me for getting her up that early! It was nice to talk to her and her husband in the kitchen and have some laughs. I enjoyed tasting her husband’s delicious baked dessert that made the house smell like yellow cake mix! I walked the neighborhood & stores several times in the daytime and it was clean and safe. Lots of restaurants. I highly recommend this AirBnB with this very kind, down to earth couple. I wanted to stay longer but the schedule wouldn’t allow it this time. This room is my favorite…"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay was brief but it was absolutely perfect for my needs...a quiet and private bed and bath that was apart from the rest of their home, immaculate, and very comfortable.

If you're looking for a comfortable and affordable place to stay in Gainesville, I highly recommend this property."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Ilona's place is tucked away in a little community at the top of a hill. Her husband checked me in as Ilona was out of town. I had asked for a secure and safe place to store my bicycle overnight and they provided space in the garage for me. The bedroom is right off the garage with the bathroom across the hall. Everything was super-clean. The bed was comfortable for naps as well as overnight. I did not take advantage of the continental breakfast Ilona offered. I was out cycling at 7am to avoid the hotter part of the day. The house was quiet and peaceful. All I needed was a bed and a shower for a weekend of cycling in Gainesville. Ilona's house exceeded my needs and gave me my night away from home. I would certainly stay there again.
