2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This location was perfect for our family (myself, husband and two yr old). It’s within walkable distance to the memorial children’s park my family always visits when in Tyler. And close to the city park. The hospital is less than four minutes away. You do hear helicopters, but it’s expected due to the close proximity of the hospital but also it’s an opportunity to pray for the occupants and be grateful for your health. The home itself is so charming and welcoming. It felt like our home the minute we walked in. There’s lots of antique/vintage interior elements to explore, like a hideaway vintage ironing board in the bedroom and phone. There’s a wonderful selection of vinyls for the music lover located in the living room. Along with lots of soft blankets and a ridiculously comfortable velvet sofa. The king bed became a haven and has a down feather comforter which, if you’ve never slept with one, you’re missing out. My family and I will most assuredly chose this location again!!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"10/10 recommend staying here! Was perfect for my husband and I. Bed is super comfy, the tv’s are huge, bathroom is so clean, and it was in the perfect location! Would definitely stay here again."

2023-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"This is the most beautiful Airbnb I have ever stayed in! We felt so relaxed in such a peaceful neighborhood with historic houses all around. It’s very close to downtown and some good local eateries. The furniture was all very comfortable, the home was spacious, and everything was in good working order. Only issue we had was the bath tub not draining. Great place for couples to stay or a family since there is a pull out couch which we didn’t utilize."

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Amazing 🤩 I will be back. Location is only minutes from downtown.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Jennifer's place, ""The Tyler Rose"" is the sister of ""The Peacock,"" where we stayed this past June. Everything at the ""Rose"" was great: decor, comfort and style. The king size bed is awesome and the large, traditional bath/shower washed all stress and road fatigue away. A unique feature to the ""Rose"" is the larger side patio for outside lounging, weather accommodating. The house and the neighborhood has a palpable feel of comfort and peace. In a addition to partaking of Bruno's Pizza (fantastic again) and True Vine Brewery (also fantastic again), we enjoyed a morning brew at the Foundry Coffeeshop, yet another discovered Rose City gem. We remain steadfast in our decision to go through Tyler rather than Dallas on future trips. We hope to stay at the Tyler Rose or The Peacock every time."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great bungalow, lovely neighborhood, easy access, and wonderful host. The new deck is a nice addition to the kitchen area, and we really enjoyed our stay in this cute little house. Feels much bigger than it looks. Not over decorated with too much stuff, and the mid century kitchen vibe was perfect. My family loved the house and felt right at home immediately. Host Jennif was helpful and friendly, and communicated super fast. 🖤🖤"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I cannot say enough of how fabulous The Tyler Rose is! My daughter and I had the best weekend get away and what made it so special was the detail and unique surroundings of our accommodations. Jennifer has thought of everything and from how immaculate and spotless her home is to that amazing bed! I cannot say enough! Jennifer was so responsive with any questions and even let us check in early! Even when there was a power outage / to no fault of anyone but our Texas heat!! - Jennifer was prompt and even refunded our money for the 2nd night when we decided to head home. And this was after giving us a HUGE discount to stay a 2nd night since there was a rare opening!!! I absolutely cannot wait to visit again and stay at the Tyler Rose! I have already shared this gem with so many friends and families!

The home is a beautifully restored vintage duplex which has kept its original charm. The bed and furniture was super comfy and decor so welcoming. I would definitely love to come back and stay again soon."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"Even though we were there for a very short period... we had an extremely late check in due to a funeral, we enjoyed the space as much as we could. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were wonderful. The air conditioning cooled us off quickly so we could get right of to sleep. The heat has been something! Thank you so much for quickly replying to us with our questions and offering to be available, even late in the night if we needed. Your bungalow was just beautiful!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jennifer's place a great getaway for the weekend. It was clean and cozy. She was proactive in making sure we were comfortable.
Only issue was lights coming on or going off everytime the neighbor (its a duplex) turned theirs off or on. The lights are remote controlled and apparently on the same frequency.
I am still giving 5 stars because Jennifer has already made plans to have electrician work out the kink or switch fixtures in one of the sides.
Also the location is great being only a few minutes from the square and maybe 10 from the zoo!"

It was the perfect little cottage style home, with everything you need to either cook a meal and lounge at home or sneak away to some fabulous restaurants and relax on the back porch.
A nice touch of home my husband and I loved was the puzzle and games available.. it was a wonderful and unexpected touch that felt like home.

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous, cozy and perfectly clean home. The bed is very comfortable, seriously. The bathroom is super clean with plenty of soft towels available. Shampoo, conditioner, body and hand soaps were all high quality and not overly scented. Kitchen well equipped, we did not use the oven/stove or microwave. Dining area is spacious for 4 people in a home of this size, same for the living room. We appreciated the beautiful art in these spaces as well, very much added to the charm of staying in Tyler in a bungalow. Hosts were wonderful and answered any and all questions in a timely manner. This is a duplex, you may hear guests next door if it's occupied, this is expected and not unreasonable.

Living room has clean furniture, nice decor, huge TV, well equipped kitchen, clean bathrooms with plenty of wash clothes, towels, liquid body wash, shampoo & conditioner. Shower curtain in master out-of-this-world! Took note for my home. Host is responsive & must have a great cleaning crew. Laundry area is on the opposite side of the bedrooms, past the kitchen with detergent provided. There’s a door to close out the bedroom side of the house from the living room & kitchen areas - I believe for privacy. Weather was cold in Tyler - heater worked great, slept nice and cozy. Home has 4 beds in 3 beautifully decorated bedrooms - 1 king & 3 queens - all with the most comfy memory foam mattresses! We got the link to get for our home. There’s white clean linen & walk-in closets in all bedrooms. 2-sink vanity in master bath. Safe neighborhood. Thanks!"

Gustavo was very responsive to us when we discovered the issues. One of our picky issues is lighting. The living area is either bright as the sun or too dark in the evenings.

2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our family enjoyed our stay at the Sweet Tea and Magnolia house. With 3 bedrooms and 2 baths we could not have gotten a better value or privacy for my husband and I as well as my daughter’s family. The place was immaculate and only 10 minutes from our niece’s wedding venue. It was also within walking distance of a pretty park which my granddaughter loved! If we are ever in Tyler again, we will be staying here!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My home away from home when visiting Tyler. This was the perfect Spring Break spot for me. Coffee on the front porch in the morning, songbirds serenading, the most comfortable of furnishings…this home has everything needed for the perfect getaway. I am thankful for such a wonderful place to stay when I come to town."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a girls trip for the Fresh 15 run for the weekend. We arrived at the house a little early and was able to message Angie and she let us right in. The house was spotless! The bathrooms are always a main concern for me and I cannot tell you how clean they were. We were all able to get a restful sleep because the beds were all comfortable to us.

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,"Stacey and Angie were more than accommodating. They both went above and beyond to ensure comfort for my family while my mother was staying in the hospital after a massive surgery. Angie even brought over extra blankets to help our family feel warmer with the cold weather that moved in while we stayed. The location was only about 6 minutes from the UT East Texas Hospital and was close to many restaurants off of the loop. The beds and furniture were comfortable and the house was spotless and clean.
Our family felt right at home."

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very comfortable and immaculately clean! (Sometimes “clean” just means “not dirty” but this home was absolutely spotless!) Fantastic home for families - spacious bedrooms and large main living area, plenty of versatile seating. Great communication from owner and local host. Driveway is very steep, so use caution. Neighborhood is nearly silent - great place for light sleepers. Convenient to local colleges and to basically anything you’d need.

This home is tastefully decorated with the most comfortable of furnishings. Every night was the best night's sleep ever! Those swivel chairs placed so you can sit and look out the front window are the coolest!! The home was spotlessly clean and spacious. The neighborhood is beautiful, safe, and quiet, yet close to anything you could possibly need. Communication was excellent. When we arrived, it was after dusk, but there were a few lights left on to make the home look so welcoming as we pulled up. After a long day of travel, we appreciated not having to stumble around in the dark. There are so many great things to say about this home and these hosts, but you will just have to check it out for yourself! This home exceeded all of our expectations and is now on our list of favorite things that we love about Tyler. We can't wait to return!"

2022-06-01,3,Stayed with kids,"Size, layout, and decor of the home was great, had lots of nice touches. However we had issues with hot water during our stay that didn't get resolved while we were there. It is an older home, saw a couple of bugs inside. Didn't fully agree with some of the communications I had with the host and co-host and for that I wouldn't stay again or recommend to anyone else."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house. Quiet neighborhood. Very comfortable beds. Very communicative hosts. Very pleased with our stay. I’d stay again if they’d have us.

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stacey and her local hostess, Angie, are exceptional!! Stacey did a wonderful job of communicating with me throughout our stay. Once we knew we would be arriving late, Angie, went to the home and turned on the lights for us and gave us a door code for us to use.
In Stacey’s home there are many amenities for you to enjoy including new memory foam mattresses, comfortable sheets and towels, washer/dryer and a well equipped kitchen. The natural light coming through the windows created a warm, inviting space to relax in.
We enjoyed staying at Stacey’s house and look forward to another stay in the future!"

2024-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a great time spending a few days out in the country with the sheep and farm dogs. The location is secluded, but close enough to go into Tyler for restaurants, shopping and other activities. Everything was great, and Lydia was very helpful."

2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,It was a relief to stay at Lydia's place. Finally a forest again after a long time prairie and meadows. Wonderful location with a beautiful cottage.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect country retreat. Wonderful smell of the surrounding pines. The accommodations were every thing we needed and clean. We loved the feeling of seclusion being off of the road and out of sight of the highway, but with the home of the owner near by we had a sense of security. At the same time we were given our privacy. The sheep and the dogs were fenced in. They were curious but friendly. Lydia responded quickly to my questions via texts. I would suggest bringing your own snacks, food and drinks so you don't have to leave once settled."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The cottage and the setting are beautiful and exactly what I needed. I was looking just to get away from the city and enjoy nature. It was perfect for that, but it’s also nice to know there’s so much to do nearby. Lydia was very responsive and friendly."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful peaceful place in the country. Surrounded by trees and animals. Loved the little cabin. Everything you need for a nice nights sleep. Safe place if you have a truck full of treasures. Very clean!! We go antiquing and would definitely book again.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage is a peaceful and beautiful escape to the country. The place is immaculate and exactly as described. The kitchen is well appointed. The shower in the bathroom is surprisingly large with abundant hot water. The instructions and communication from the host was fabulous. I have stayed at many short term rentals across numerous platforms and this place stands out as one of the best of the best. I cannot wait to return. The place was fabulous.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"It was a perfect place for us, everything needed was there. Surroundings are beautiful. Though we were a little surprised that the host just waved at us from the car passing by and didn't greet us personally. But everything else was just great."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place to stay private and so comfortable and relaxed place to stay over the weekend with you love or someone special
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We absolutely loved this charming cottage! We stayed after a long day of driving and felt right at home. The cottage is great for just two guests and has everything you need and more! Nothing was missing that we needed and the area is extremely quiet and peaceful! We experienced a great breeze in the morning and we took our last few minutes sitting on porch and enjoyed the scenery. TBH if I go missing its because I came back to this place to get away from city life!! My only regret, is that we couldn't stay longer!!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was very cozy!
2023-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute cottage! It was a very peaceful stay, and we enjoyed how far set back it is from the road! It definitely felt like a mini vacation in the woods, but we still had the convenience of town only 15-20 minutes away! I recommend taking your own drinking water because there wasn’t a water filter pitcher to fill, or a jug of water anywhere. And the tap water isn’t filtered. So that was the only downside of the stay. We tried to drink the tap water, but it had a strong chlorine taste, so we ended up buying a ton of water for us to drink during our stay."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The small house was perfect for us and our dogs. It’s a great value and the host communicates well. The working dogs and farm animals make it a very unique stay I would gladly stay there again.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was great. I will book again
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Cana cottage was the perfect little spot to enjoy the pines and nature of Tyler. It’s a good spot to stay if you want the nature feel but still a short car ride to coffee shops and downtown Tyler. Lydia was very responsive and communicative. Both her and her husband were very nice and friendly! Everything was exactly as pictured in the ad. My dog and I really enjoyed taking walks on property, up and down the long gravel drive way and we enjoyed watching the sheep in the evening! I also really like that Lydia had a bible in the space and had it turned to Luke. I ended up reading the book of Luke for the weekend. I would def return. I will say, the rooster does crow at alllll hours of the day and night- sometimes at 2 am. So if this is something that bothers you, I would be mindful. But there is absolutely nothing else I would change. I had a wonderful stay!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A wonderful quiet peaceful place to stay in the Tyler-Lindale area.
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our stay at Lydia’s place was short, but we absolutely loved it! The accommodation are exactly as pictured and described.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"I just loved Lydia’s farm stay. Roscoe & Bear helped me find the right location & hung out with me for a while.
I will definitely stay here again. It’s one of my favorite air bnbs that I’ve stayed at & I’ve stayed at so many! Thank you, Lydia, you’ve created such a peaceful respite! I loved the Bible in the bedroom. Good night time inspiration!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very nice place. The only issue we had was our dog not wanting to be friends with their dog. Their dog is very friendly, ours is when he's in the mood. But Lydia and her husband brought Bear in so we could walk our dogs. Everything worked out well."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed my time at Lydia’s place and it is tucked away in a really pretty area with lots of trees. We did have some difficulties with the dogs however Lydia was responsive and assisted us with putting the dogs up during the rest of our stay. These are working dogs and they do seem fairly young, so one of them was following the car as we went up the drive and we were a bit nervous/scared because we didn’t want to hurt them on accident. We drove up the driveway slowly and when I let Lydia know about it she was helpful and kind. The area is quiet and cozy, perfect for a getaway!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,I enjoyed another wonderful stay at Lydia’s place! Everything was great!

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My stay at Cana Cottage was wonderful. I was immediately greeted by two cute pups Roxy and Bear. It was very quiet and peaceful. One night even rained and the sound of the drops hitting the roof and thunder made for natures best sound machine for sleep. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick secluded getaway. The host was responsive and the place had such a cozy vibe. Thanks for everything.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Very cute tiny home. Very peaceful. Sweet sweet dogs to welcome you to the property. We enjoyed our stay.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place to stay the bed was a bit uncomfortable
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My husband and I came for a quick 2 day trip. The home was beautiful and clean, exactly as pictured. The only thing that didn’t match to me was that they give the impression it is secluded and private, and while it is secluded from the road, it is right next door to their house, which you cannot tell from photos. However, they were quiet and we never even saw them. If that doesn’t bother you, it’s a great place to stay!"

2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was such a gem! I’m thankful they kept Roxy out so we could love on her. She was the best and helped us feel right at home. As for the place it was absolutely perfect for my fiancé and I. I appreciated the Bible next to the bed and the scripture on the decor. It’s tough to find places that have that but I am beyond glad we did! I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re in town.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,We had a great time! We would go back!

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful place!! Such a cute little set up. Loved seeing the little babies right by the front 🥰
The farm dog was the SWEETEST girl ever. Her and my dog were instant friends. She was trying to push her way inside the home, and wouldn’t leave once she got inside- without a lot of coaxing 🤣
But we’re huge animal lovers so we don’t mind at all! 🐾
Definitely worth the price!!!"

There was some wildlife that added excitement to our evenings, but we didn't feel any danger, just noises in the woods. The cottage is perfectly done in build, layout and cleanliness. We loved the decorations and amenities. Lydia responded to my inquiries nearly instantaneously in a clear and pleasant manor. Their sweet dog, Roxy, is such a character. We loved her wagging tail greeting us each time we drove up to the cottage. She treated us and our dog as if we were welcome to her home anytime. We will stay here again in the future as needed and recommend it to others."

It was quiet and surrounded with trees. The guest hosts were very attentive and responded to our questions very quickly."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Cana cottage was well appointed and matched Lydia and Weston’s description.
The cottage was just lovely with thoughtful furnishings, a comfortable bed and quality amenities and necessities. The hosts were in the process of clearing some wooded area on their property for a short walking trail which will be a very nice addition to their property across a small creek that is already there.
I really enjoyed watching the sheep and cows on their property and interacting with their very friendly Great Pyrenees dog, Roxy.
There were some unfortunate disturbances and disruptions during my stay which unfortunately made my trip shorter than desired but
Lydia and Weston and were very kind, understanding and flexible in remedying the issues at hand.
They both take great care of providing a welcoming atmosphere for their guests
and are really wonderful and caring hosts. Thank you, Weston and Lydia for your hospitality."

The spaces were an amazing blend of classic Texas ranch, light and bright contemporary, and modern farm house with a touches of colorful artwork.
There were 8 of us with 4 adults and 4 teenage boys. There was plenty of room for everyone to spread out. The boys spent most of the time playing ping pong and pool. The adults enjoyed the light and airy sitting room by day and bistro style patio in the evenings.
Jen was a fantastic host. She was incredible prompt and had amazingly clear instructions for everything."

The living room had a nice sectional sofa and the dining area had very comfortable chairs where we played games.
The location was very close to shopping and restaurants.
It was a little close to a busy street which made it noisy if you wanted to sleep past 8:00 am.
I would definitely recommend this place and hope to rent it again."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Samuel and Amber’s place was an epic gem that can honestly be named “my favorite AIRBNB I’ve ever stayed in.” Yep, that’s right. I loved the ambience, the layout, and the amenities. The downtown flare was what I was hoping for so, weekend noise was not a bother. Walkable distance to some favorite coffee and food spots. Proximal distance to anywhere in Tyler. Safety was never an issue and noise within the building was minimal. Loved!"

2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was awesome to stay, the location is in the heart of Tyler. You're literally 2 cartwheels away from the bars. This loft definitely has its own vibe, the owners knocked it out the park with this one, if you see it open take it.
You won't regret it!"

Thanks again for sharing your beautiful loft with us!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great downtown loft right in the middle of everything! Easy to find, great view above the city so still peaceful. Beautifully appointed and well-maintained! Will be our go-to spot for any future Tyler returns. Thanks!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is not a place to stay, it’s an EXPERIENCE! The drive downtown to get to this place is pleasant to the eye with all the historic and eclectic buildings and shops. The instructions given to get there and inside were crystal clear and most helpful. The place itself is remarkable. Clean, minimalistic, and so much charm. The exposed brick walls were gorgeous. The huge floor to ceiling windows looking over the downtown area were perfect for watching the nightlife as well as the beginning of a new day. The double shower is a must use and the skylight above it was on point. The bed was super comfy. The robes were ultra fluffy. Ceilings fans, ac, nightlights, amazing smelling body care, wine glasses, etc..so many well thought out details for a perfectly romantic stay. Yes, you can hear music and cars and sirens and people-but that’s all part of the downtown vibe!! Book it. You won’t regret it. Except if you have mobility issues or lots of heavy luggage-cuz them stairs are a workout."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very fun downtown location. Easy to get to restaurants.

2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay - everything was perfect.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely beautiful inside. Parking is alittle weird, but host was quick to respond. I stayed and a Saturday, be sure you are aware it above the local hangout scene in downtown Tyler, so pretty loud till 12 1 in the morning. Not my cuppa tea but, Absolutely amazing. Your body molds to bed and shower is awesome."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great urban chic place in the Tyler Square. Close to a lot of restaurants. Easy to get in and out. Stylish. I would stay again.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"So let’s skip past the obvious… the space is cool. Exposed brick walls, dramatic windows, super cool velvet green couch… just yes all around. But what they didn’t show you in the photos are the truly hidden gems of the space… vaulted ceilings, uniquely stunning internal architecture, a skylight that illuminates the kitchen in the mornings…and literally the best naturally occurring architectural acoustics I have found in my travels! And beyond all of that… it is clear that every piece of this space was done with intention… you know you’re being invited into a space that is loved and crafted with thought. It’s just a cool space. I will likely stay again when I visit Tyler. The bar next door is great… plus you can crank up your music unapologetically with a bar next door! Definitely use the robes if you stay they are amazingly soft and the dual shower is fun even as a solo traveler… personally, I went for hot water on one side and cold on the other…my hair was impeccable when I left!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Love the spot!! Came downtown for dinner and drinks and it’s such a gem when available. Thank you so much for hosting us - Until next time!
2024-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"Overall positive stay, but with a couple hiccups. It was a beautiful spacious place with a nice mix of historic and modern. Everything was clean and comfortable. We loved the location except for the very loud music and base from 10-2 on Saturday night. We paid for early check in and there is a miscommunication about when it'd be ready, and then when we tried to get in there was an issue. We ended up paying $35 for only an extra half hour. The app would not allow us to check in early and the key pad had dead batteries. They came right away to replace the batteries and helped us with the app. I'm sure that doesn't usually happen. It was a great place to stay, just be aware of the loud bar below."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,An amazing place in the heart of downtown Tyler
2024-01-01,5,Stayed one night,This place was stunning. The pictures don’t do it justice. You can tell a lot of time and effort went into creating such a unique place. It definitely fit what I was going for with my photography session. 10 out of 10!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Other than having a hard time finding my assigned parking spot (because the number was faded) it was a wonderful stay. My wife loved the view from the couch and I couldn’t get her to leave hardly.
2023-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"nice spot if you visit with your spouse but if your looking for something more less noisy and more relaxing this is not it. it's right next door to a bar that is very loud and it smells like dog or animal urine in the hallway going up to the apartment . As soon as you walk in it's very beautiful and there is a lot of space I love the kitchen and bathroom and the window view.
Just ask questions before choosing is all"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. As advertised. Close to all that's happening in Tyler
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a fun place to have when you’re out in downtown for the night! We spent the whole day walking the square and when we got tired we walked up to the apartment and took a nap before we headed back down into the square! You get typical noise for being above a bar in downtown but the sound was never disturbing or annoying, we slept like babies. We will be back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Excellent hosts and cozy/spacious place on the square! We will definitely be booking this place again!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed over a week,What a wonderful apartment! Samuel and Amber are excellent hosts. I highly recommend their place.

2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Overall, a fantastic little place to stay! Super cute. Light sleepers DO consider that by mid-week music from the sports bar downstairs can be heard. Otherwise, no complaints."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Excellent spot downtown, well appointed, luxury accommodations with convenient amenities. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a last minute East TX getaway & I am thankful I got to stay here. I loved this place, window views, location & clean! I walked around the corner to The Foundry for a tasty drink. I stayed on a Saturday night, there's a bar nearby. I heard the music & people in the area but that didn't disturb me. I was up around 2 am inside & I saw police lights down below outside. Someone was getting arrested. I felt safe upstairs & behind a locked door on the street.
Just FYI, there is a tall flight of stairs from the street level to this unit. I had to walk it multiple times. Could be an issue for someone with mobility issues.
Bed is firm but I slept good.. It really is a beautiful space. Thank you."

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Man. One of those spots that really showcases Airbnb’s best qualities— cool, personal, downtown location with high quality decor, vibes. Clearly personal touches; only Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in with a Chemex and fresh, local coffee. Walking distance to tons of great food. Be sure to check out Culture ETX and its speakeasy. Cool find! Only complaint, and really probably more of a personal preference, was the bed was more on the “firm” end of the spectrum for my spouse and I’s liking. Overall tho, top notch, would come back in a heartbeat🙏🏼"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Stylish stay that was perfect for our quick getaway. Very close to some wonderful restaurants. Makes a great anniversary or couples weekend type stay in East Texas without the need to go into the city. All the style while getting to spend a few extra hours with each other and sleeping in - instead of driving.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a really cool place to stay. The history of the building was important to us and the hardwood floors and tall celilngs were a dream. My kids at UT Tyler want to move into this apartment or one like it!! I told them Good Luck :)
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Our stay at Brick Street was superb, beautiful place with a historical ambiance.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,"Gorgeous, clean sophisticated space with lots to do within walking distance. Condo isn’t as well-stocked as what we’re used to, so don’t forget your coffee or toiletries (there are a few toiletry items available for purchase, which was unusual but handy if you’re desperate)"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a great place to retreat
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Lovely apartment in downtown Tyler.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great city loft with lots a character and clean.
2022-12-01,4,Stayed one night,"This loft was very nice. Decor and furnishings were just right. The space looked clean. Minor complaint: 1. It is very irritating to have a checkout of 10:00 am -- even threatening in the house guest book you'll charge extra if the guest stays at all past 10:00 am -- and then on top of leaving so early, have the guest do several chores. It adds stress to the morning when you're there to enjoy yourself and instead you have to wake up earlier to make sure all chores are done and get out in time. Just something to consider."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Great downtown location and close to the hospital. Host was very responsive and accommodating for a few hiccups. Took the time to bring us what we needed. Loved the design of loft and the view was great of the square and Christmas lights.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, Samuel & Amber were very responsive when we needed their assistant. Relatively close to everything, located downtown. Walking distance from bars and restaurants. Very unique place, loved staying here. Would definitely stay here again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,This is as our second visit and we loved it just as much as the first time. The hosts were very responsive to our questions. The loft is in a great location and made it easy to walk to the local bars and restaurants.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"Kind and accommodating host. The apartment was really moody and clean, it had this really pleasant smell like vanilla or bourbon! Not really a Knock on the Airbnb, but downtown Tyler had a little less going on than we imagined, so it made for a good time in the apartment. Definitely recommend to stay here!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sam & Amber's place was beautiful. The loft sat on the second floor across from the old town square. There were several coffee shops, restaurants, and sports bars to choose from. There were also places to visit near by with a quick drive. They were very friendly. We had a wonderful time!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Perfect place! I traveled to take an exam at Pearson VUE and the place was only a block away. Loved the adjustable lighting specifically for some studying. Quiet and peaceful.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I traveled from Dallas to Tyler to play with a band at a venue one block from the loft. My wife came along with me so we could meet up with family from the area and stay the night.
The loft was wonderful and was just like the photos and the owners were very quick to respond with my questions.
I would recommend this loft and we’ll hopefully stay again."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a cool & unique place to stay! Will def be booking again!

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Such a cute space and perfect for a couple! Easy to get to and great location.
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely lovely! A gorgeous exposed brick, amenity driven, centrally located space. It was like I wasn’t even in Texas anymore! I loved being able to walk everywhere, extremely safe. The bar next door was a bit loud but that was just a few songs that I think caused like sounds to carry over but it died down so fast. Can’t wait to come back, I don’t have enough space to write all the good things to say!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Enjoyed the stay. Always a pleasure staying with Sam & Amber!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,I’ve stayed here a few times and I’m always grateful for the comfy digs and central location.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Amazing place. Great location. Beautifully appointed. Very responsive and helpful hosts. Would definitely stay there anytime we are in Tyler!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This beautiful loft is a very comfortable place to stay in downtown Tyler. The decor is so pleasant and comfortable. The ambiance urges you to relax and forget about the world outside. The location is convenient and the free parking was nice. We didn’t mind the stairs; it was easy to get our suitcases to the loft. We enjoyed the complimentary coffee, roasted recently, along with leftovers from a nearby restaurant, for breakfast one morning. The towels and bathrobes were thick and luxurious. It was always interesting to look out the floor-to-ceiling windows and see what was going on in the downtown square."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Brick Street King suite is a great hidden gem.
Imagine you're hanging out in a small town square, enjoying good food, libations, and overall good vibes. Then when it's time to rest you simply unlock a nondescript door in a historic brick building, escape up the stairs to a luxurious modern suite with a grand view of the square you were just on.
well imagine it no more. Experience it with this unique Air BnB!
The suite was clean, with a full kitchen, although chefs may want to bring their own knives.
upon entry the reveal is quite astonishing!
looking for a fun stay in the midst of Tyler? or just looking for a break from hotels when traveling for work (as I was) you won't be disappointed.
Sam and Ambers communication was excellent. they will make sure you have everything you need!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved our stay at this downtown loft! It was clean, convenient and thoughtfully decorated. Much better than staying at some random hotel! As a heads up – the mattress is very firm! It wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable, just different from what we’re used to. All in all, and excellent place to stay in Tyler if you’d like to be close to everything."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Perfect little place! Spotless, swanky, romantic little getaway for me and my hubby. The location is perfect. It’s walking distance to so many downtown options. We loved having a drink at The Judge bar in the Thomas Hotel then an amazing dinner at Prime102. Samuel and Amber were great to communicate with and they have decorated this space beautifully. I will definitely be booking again!"

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Communication was better than any other AIRBNB I have ever stayed at. The loft itself was just dreamy. My fiancé and I both loved the vibe. It was perfectly clean and had amenities available in case you forgot them. The voucher for free coffee from 1948 coffee co was a plus and it was delicious. 1948 Coffee co is such a cool addition to Tyler and is absolutely worth the stop. 10/10 to all of it.

The house has a beautiful view of picturesque downtown Tyler.
Not too much noise around, sleeping was never disturbed. The bed is firm, not hard. There are two sets of pillows with varying firmness. The sheets are soft, as are the towels and robes. A double shower in the spacious bathroom was spectacular.
Parking.
Know that the street near the house is one-way, so check your navigator to maneuver around to the back of the building.
The apartment overlooks a trendy part of the area with shops and eateries worth your time. There are also museums within walking distance.
Truly a treat, this apartment is perfect for a getaway."

The local hotels are underwhelming and overpriced, especially if you’d like to bring your dog.

I would highly recommend this over a hotel and would request to stay again anytime I’m in the area. It was a great value."

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If I could give this home and the hosts more stars I would. This location was a little bit of a drive from where we where at but so worth it. The place was clean, inviting and absolutely gorgeous. It has a great lay out. Lots of room for everyone. Lots of coffee pods, towels, and trash bags to lee things tidy. The hosts where responsive right from the start we had Great communication. I had a last minute addition of guests and a small pet so I sent them a message and I wasn’t sure how to go about adding them. They responded and said there was not problem in doing the addition. The house it’s self is absolutely gorgeous! Beds where great, pillows where great and the couch was big and comfy! I loved that there was no clutter. It’s was fresh, bright and crisp is the only way I can describe to to make sense. We felt so at home, by far the best place we have ever stayed. Quiet neighborhood. Enough beds for my entire family. The hosts where so helpful & made sure we were good! 20 out of 10!!"
2023-07-01,3,Group trip,"The house was new and comfortable. Enough space for our party of 4 adults and 3 children. Plenty of towels, plates, glasses, pots/pans, utensils. Unfortunately, since the house was so new, the neighborhood was still under construction. Every morning we woke to the sounds of hammers, saws, and nail guns between 6-7am. There were no curtains on the windows and the sun came in pretty early. We couldn't sleep in during our stay. There were also several crickets we killed and ants, probably also due to the new construction in the area. The rooms, kitchen, bathrooms were clean, but all the floors needed mopping. We also found hair in the sheets and bath towels. I found the bed to be comfortable, but the other the adults in our party thought the beds were too firm. Close to restaurants, grocery store, gas station."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Traveled with our dog on a last min. business trip and this place was great. It is a new development so if you want to do any walking/jogging you will need to drive down the road just a bit to a local park. The house is new so everything works perfectly and is in great condition. The beds are memory foam but are extremely firm, which was the only down side of the the house. We loved the sofa so much we asked where they got it and are buying one for our own house. :) If we are ever in Tyler again, will try to stay with this host again."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful place and more than what we needed for 1 night stay. I wish we could have stayed longer. Lydia's place was peaceful, quiet and private, a nice break in our travels throughout Texas. Bed was comfy but if an additional one was needed, there's another one in the loft. Kitchen amenities was top notch and well organized. And did I mention there are goats, dogs, and chickens nearby? And the whole place was surrounded by trees? A perfect place for anyone to recharge. If antique shopping/browsing is your thing, nearby are antiques stores in Tyler and Gladewater, the latter being the antique mecca of East Texas!"

Know that you will have to get in and out of a barefoot claw shower tub. That might be a little tricky for some.
I wish there was a little space to sit outside. But, overall a very, very nice airbnb."

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lydia and her husband were very nice and welcoming. The place was absolutely everything I needed. It was in a private area, absolutely stunning countryside. I would recommend this airbnb to any of my friends planning on staying in the area. When I come back I would like to try out the little cottage they had as well."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"I wanted to find a quite place in that particular area of Texas to view the 2024 total eclipse with my wife and daughters and Lydia and Weston’s place was absolutely perfect! Very peaceful if you want to get away from it all and the property has every amenity in very nice wooded surroundings, the hosts are very friendly and helpful and they have the friendliest pair of dogs we met during our entire stay in the US!"

Our dog played with their beautiful dogs and got to see and be around sheep and chickens for the first time and hated to leave. We had the pleasure of meeting Lydia and Weston and they are a delightful young couple that were so welcoming. Highly recommend!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lydia’s place was amazing! Super cute and we loved that there were lambs right outside. The whole space felt clean, welcoming and spacious."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I absolutely loved this place. The animals added a cool factor to me. It was about 13 minutes to town. It's secluded, quiet, and peaceful. I'm a small town girl and was solo traveling. It was perfect. It was modem with rustic touches. My only wish is a tiny, cheapy table to set my food or drink on while parked on the couch. Lydia is super quick to respond. I loved the bed, but if you like a firm bed, which I don't, this may not be the bed you. I will be back the next time I have class 3 days in a row."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We really enjoyed our stay, felt very much at home... like staying with family. the owners are very easy to talk to, friendly, and helpful."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect for my short stay! Very clean and tidy.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lydia's place is a wonderful getaway outside the city of Tyler. When you are on the property, you feel like you are in the middle of the country even though the city is nearby. The sheep and dogs were a wonderful addition to the experience. i found myself hanging out with the dogs for about an hour each night. Lydia was amazing as well. She answered all of my questions within minutes. I can't wait until my next trip to Tyler. I will definitely be coming back to this exclusive Air BnB."

2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We absolutely loved it! It was very private, the host took privacy to a perfect level!

All in all was a very good Christian ran business!!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My fiancé and I really enjoyed staying here during our vacation. It was quiet, super cozy and nice, gorgeous views and so fun to see the animals on the farm. Definitely recommend a stay here!"

2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a nice time at Lydia's Place. It was clean & spacious for our little babymoon. Our trip goal was stay at a place my 8mo pregnant wife didn't feel like she needed to clean or nest in. This place worked great.
Future guests may want to bring oil, salt, & pepper if they plan on doing some cooking. WiFi is also spotty, so load up some movies on your tablet just in case. 👍🏼"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lydia’s place was peacefully tucked away in the piney woods, but easy to find. It was spotless, and comfortable. There were clear instructions and plenty of conveniences/amenities. I wasn’t there long, but do look forward to returning soon."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We have stayed at the Shop for more than 3 months and loved it from the beginning to the end. It is very comfy and very clean, and the location is both peaceful and beautiful. Weston and Lydia are one of the best hosts that we have had, always responsive and super friendly. This place was our home away from home in Eastern Texas, and we definitely will stay here again if we are back in the area."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Lydia and Weston were incredibly kind and generous hosts! The property was peaceful and beautiful, and the shop was spacious, immaculate, and perfect for our stay! We needed a place to stay for the night on our cross-country move, and we are so glad we found this Airbnb as it was exactly what we needed to rest, regroup, and continue on our trip. It was especially nice to have so much space (inside and outside) to stretch our legs after being in the car for so long. There was a comfortable couch, large TV, dining table, full kitchen, full bathroom with washer/dryer, a bedroom and a loft - truly everything we needed and more. Finally, the dogs were adorable and so were the sheep! FIVE STARS - highly recommend!!!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very charming and as people who personally prefer peaceful country surroundings it was perfect for us. Yet close enough for the reason we were in town. I would highly recommend. My husband raved at how clean it was and loved the on demand water heater. I would definitely use again next time we are in this area.
The dogs that roam the land are lovely and super friendly. We enjoyed seeing the farm life too.
I recommend this place 100%"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Absolutely loved this stay! The farm life makes it feel so warm and inviting! Seeing the goats and waking up to roosters crowing was great! There was so much space for my pup and I. We had been on a long road trip, so it was nice to be able to move around! The kitchen was well stocked and the whole place stayed nice and cool.
Heads up, the short gravel driveway to get to the rental area was very bumpy and rough, and there's a decent hill to go down/up. Not 4x4 needed rough, but it was definitely worth mentioning. 10/10. Will stay again if I'm in the area!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,We loved Lydia’s place and my girls are already asking to stay here again!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I absolutely loved my stay at this property. Tucked away from the main road, it offers a sense of peace and tranquility that's hard to come by. The farm atmosphere is a true highlight; waking up to the sight of chickens and sheep really added a charming touch to my experience.
The place was exactly as described—totally clean and completely accessible. The hosts were wonderful, going above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Their attention to detail did not go unnoticed.
I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle while still wanting modern comforts. It truly offers the best of both worlds.
I look forward to staying here again the next time I find myself in East Texas. A fantastic experience all around!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the stay! The host was super nice. I thought it was a wonderful stay even though I was only there for one night! I LOVED the bath! ❤️ the clawfoot was awesome and relaxing very spacious and enjoyable!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"While only staying one night, the shop felt so cozy! I would normally get a hotel room for a short-term stay, but the at-home feeling is exactly what we were looking for and this matched our expectations. The property is beautiful and the sweet dogs on site were a bonus!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had an absolutely wonderful stay! Lydia and her husband are some of the nicest most down to earth people that you will ever meet. It was very peaceful and homely feeling. If you need a place to stay in Tyler I highly recommend staying in one of their Airbnbs!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lydia was a great host, and her place was really great. Super clean and new and exactly what we needed for a private spot in the country.

Highly reccomend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,AMAZING! Place was absolutely beautiful and the perfect place to stay. Lydia and husband were extremely kind and helpful. Bear and Roxy were adorable and my girls loved playing with them as well
2023-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"We stayed at the Shop for more than 2 months and absolutely loved it!!!
It is a brand new place that is spacious, beautiful, clean and had everything we needed. The little loft provides extra space and privacy for any visitors. The living room has a very nice and comfortable L-shaped sofa for us to relax and watch TV after dinner.
Weston and Lydia are delightful hosts who are very responsive and friendly. They went out of their ways to make us feel welcomed and made sure that we had everything we needed.
A huge plus for the Shop is that it has a 220V power outlet that allowed us to charge our Tesla at night with our mobile charger (without the permanent wall charger). Definitely recommended for any Tesla owners!!!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay in the townhouse was amazing! The game table was the perfect touch! The fenced in back patio provided much needed privacy.
Nancy also stocked the counter with snacks and waters. The beds were comfortable and TV’s worked perfectly.
The power went out due to storms in the area, and Nancy was quick to respond and had an emergency flash light and candle kit in the pantry.
10/10 experience!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed over a week,"A spacious and very comfortable simple apartment, in a quiet area, ideal for long work stays, totally new and very clean."
