2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,We really loved this stay. The location was perfect‚Äîrelaxing but also a two minute walk from restaurants and the boardwalk and water‚Äîand the house was clean and cozy. Terri was communicative and the instructions for check in and check out were clear. We felt very lucky to have stayed in this house for our visit to Solomons Island.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My husband and I spent our anniversary weekend at Teri's lovely home. What a gem! Right in the heart of quaint Solomons Island and walkable to shops and restaurants. The house was spotless and very comfortable. We will be back!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,She was an amazing host and her place is beautiful. Stayed here for tiki bar opening weekend. Walking distance to everything. Had the best weekend!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I stayed at Terri‚Äôs home while visiting our mom. Her house was perfectly located around shops and restaurants on the island. Terri was a great hostess reaching out to us several times to see if we had any questions or concerns. We will definitely stay at Terri‚Äôs when we return.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terri‚Äôs place was a wonderful location. The place was very comfortable and very accurate to the description and pictures.
Very nicely furnished. We were very comfortable and felt at home.
Terri was very responsive when we asked a couple questions as well as flexible on the check in and check out times.
We would use this again if we are in the area for another visit."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,I was at Terri's place for a month and have a great stay. There are many restaurants within walking distance. The morning sunrise as well as the beautiful sunsets are worth the trip itself. The house was just as pictured and the kitchen is plenty big for cooking meals. Pots and pans are a nice quality and clean up well. The beds are comfy and the bathrooms are roomy too. There is plenty of closet space for all your belongings. Off street parking is a plus since I can see where it can get pretty busy during the summer. I hope to stay here again next year!

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"To say this was a perfect place to stay for a relaxing time would be an understatement. Terri is a Great host and always takes the time to answer any question you may have, even when she's out of the area at the time. This location was perfect in the sense of being close enough to walk around to different restaurants and attractions. The description is spot on and the house was very clean and stocked with the right amount of amenities for a short weekend getaway. When you ask would we stay here again? The answer is we've already begun looking at two long weekends for next year to stay here. Thank you Terri, for going above and beyond in helping us enjoy our time away from the norm."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We had a wonderful trip to Solomon‚Äôs Island. The home is lovely, and the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. It is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It was stocked with everything we needed. We enjoyed spending time on the upstairs and downstairs porches. The location is perfect with easy walking distance to many waterfront restaurants and the boardwalk. We look forward to visiting again."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Thank you! Great hosts, great location, and great spacious place!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Had never been to Solomons Island but it‚Äôs very. Harming and Terri‚Äôs place was equally so. Clean efficient and a super dog friendly area (right next to a Tiki bar that welcomes dogs!). Terri was quick to respond to any questions and I‚Äôd definitely recommend her place for anyone looking for a few days away by the Chesapeake.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"This is the cleanest and cutest AirBnb! The decor is wonderful. The place was so clean. It was stocked with everything you could need and in a very chic way!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at Terri‚Äôs place was excellent! The photos honestly did not do it justice. The house was very charming and so clean. We enjoyed the little touches like supplies for coffee and fresh herbs.
Terri was close by if we needed anything and to offer recommendations. The weather was not on our side but the stay was so nice we didn‚Äôt even mind!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great experience.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"When we first stumbled upon this waterfront on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Terri is the most thoughtful, gracious host.
She provided us with all the information we needed. The home is just perfect! Kitchen is great and contains everything one needs.
The beds are comfortable, bathrooms and both downstairs & upstairs porches are excellent. Location is incredible.
Terri had excellent recommendations and was of great help. Her & her husband Joe went way beyond to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable.
Thanks Terri and Solomons for a wonderful trip!
We will be back!! üòä"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay and look forward to the next time we're in town to visit our family! The house and location were the best on the island. Terri was more than accommodating. Can't thank her enough for the hospitality. We'll definitely be back.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place is a great location. Everything on Solomon‚Äôs Island is in walking distance. Loved the porch area.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful time ........the place was just as the photos represent Terri and Joe were great !
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My wife and I had a wedding on Solomon's Island to go to and liked how close this property was. This house is perfectly situated for any event on the island, after parking our rental car we didn't get back in it until the day we left. Peaceful walks around the island in the morning, and lazy afternoons chilling on the porch or sundeck. Thanks Terri!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful home and location just steps from the Patuxent River, restaurants, and the famous Tiki Bar. Terri‚Äôs home is beautifully appointed and we felt right at home as soon as we walked in. Terri was proactive with communication and checkin/checkout were a breeze."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The house is gorgeous! It is in walking distance to the boardwalk and restaurants. The kitchen has everything we needed for cooking meals. There are some seasonings in the cabinet along with cooking oil. I also love that everything is provided for coffee in the morning, not a lot of places have coffee so this is a huge plus for me. Easy check in and check out instructions. We will absolutely come back to this house when in Solomons."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Solomon's MD is one of our favorite destination but we have never had an opportunity to stay right in the heart of the boardwalk. Terri's place is perfectly situated. Absolutely beautiful home. Perfect location. She was also available right next door for any questions. The decks and views are extraordinary. The only challenge we had was the WiFi with a few of us trying to use it simultaneously. Otherwise, I can't imagine it being better."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"I loved the wrap around decks both lower and upper and the harbor views. The home is beautiful with a sophisticated cottage asthetic, full of light, very private. Easy to walk around solomons island right out the front door. In summer, Fridays and Saturdays will be loud from harbor and Tiki bar till 10 pm, but it didnt bother me. People having fun! Beds, kitchen, bathrooms and linens outstanding. I hope to return often!"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was our first Airbnb experience. If all the future ones come close to this one we will be very happy. This little house isn't so little. The full kitchen and living room were absolutely amazing and the bedrooms and baths upstairs were even better. If we were ever to get a beach/sea side cottage I would want it to be an exact replica of this one. Oh, and the sunrises and sunsets were an added bonus as well as the close by/walkable restaurants and bars. Terri was extremely responsive to our questions and also gave spot on instructions on the property. When we return to the area in the future this will be our go to spot."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great location and very cute place!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, comfortable and sparkling clean! Great location on Solomon‚Äôs Island. Easy check in, comfortable beds and furnishings, outside decks, beautiful waterfront views!"

THE KITCHEN WELL SUPPLIED FOR OUR NEEDS"

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,One of the nicest places I‚Äôve stayed! Beautiful home conveniently located. Great host. Very friendly and had local recommendations!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house is airy, open and nicely decorated. There are 2.5 bath rooms, one downstairs and one each for the two bedrooms. It‚Äôs a great location with views of the water and just steps away from the boardwalk. The beds and linens are comfortable. I love the corner gas fireplace. The two porches are great. I will stay there again my next visit to Solomon‚Äôs. Terri is very helpful and responsive to any need."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,was in the area for work and was everything we needed. The place is very nice and the area in Solomans is beautiful. Would highly recommend Terris place and would definitely stay there again.

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was great!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim‚Äôs was a great place to stay in Leonardtown. It‚Äôs close to the center of town. Easy entry whenever you get there. You enter into a foyer and go right up the stairs ‚Äî private entry. Clean and tidy. Very large room with a California king bed. Bathroom is shared with one other guest, but I never even saw the other guest. It worked out fine. Nice loft area with a fridge, toaster, coffee, tea, and water. Kim is very responsive. It was a great stay. I highly recommend it."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I stay at Kim's as often as I'm in town. I would recommend for any out of town working professional who is in the Leonardtown area
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim is an excellent communicator. She quickly responds to messages. Check in was easy with a code. I only stayed here for 1 night for a wedding nearby so I did not get to explore the area. However, Kim has a list with recommendations."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had an opportunity this week to stay at Kim's Airbnb this week as I was working in the PAX River Area. Her place is always clean, quiet, and private - ideal for a professional that works away from home at times. I stayed in the bedroom with the King Bed. While both rooms are well arranged, clean, and have everything you would need for a stay away from home, the bedroom with the King Bed is absolutely spacious and decadent to stay in. I find Kim's place extraordinary value and will try to stay there, if possible while I am in town."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's is a wonderful place to stay. The house is modern, well appointed and spacious."

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim's place is a great place to stay. It's my choice of location whenever I am in the area for work. The bedrooms and bathroom are spotless as is the common rea upstairs. Check-in is easy and it is a great value for the price.

2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was perfect exactly as represented good location, very friendly"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I felt very comfortable during this stay. Parking wasn't great, but not really a problem either. I felt like my truck was in the way."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great gem of a place. Super quiet, very clean, and very comfortable. The large welcome sign to the right of the entry door took away any confusion upon arrival. The stairs were a little tricky to negotiate with heavy luggage because the handrail did not extend to the bottom. The check-in instructions said the name was on the door. It took me a little while to figure out that it was the name of the accommodation rather than my name. The door had its own lock and key, which was nice too. I would highly recommend this super comfy room. It was perfect."
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay at a great price. Very clean, comfortable, and quiet. I would definitely stay again."
2023-05-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim and her husband were friendly hosts and kept to themselves as we did. The room was comfortable and kept at good temperature. Rooms are separated enough for privacy. Bathroom was clean. Drawbacks are they do have pets. One dog, one bird. Which did make noise but if you‚Äôre used to pets like we are you‚Äôll be comfortable. If you‚Äôre not religious this couple and their home is so if that makes you uncomfortable this may be a problem. The home and room are older fashioned (I.e. furniture etc) they do have an additional person who rents out their house as well. Otherwise my girlfriend and I recommend staying here. Especially if you‚Äôre looking for somewhere close to the local hospital and local shops, the town square, the waterfront, etc"
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Stayed for a night and everything was alright. Very friendly and humble hosts. Very comfortable and peaceful. Would love yo stay there again!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Kim‚Äôs home is located in a quiet single family neighborhood. It is very close to a hospital & accommodations were as advertised. Leonardtown is a quaint little town with a handful of local dining options. I would stay again if in the area.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Thank you Kim!
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim was a very gracious host! The room was impeccable, bathroom awesome, and accommodations were above and beyond. All around amazing stay and highly recommend to anyone for any trip! Will stay again when I'm in town, God bless!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Pretty much one of the greatest AirBnB experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Quiet, peaceful, easy to access, and communication was superb. Such a cozy space! It made my first week at my new job an absolute pleasure. I highly recommend!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,It was very comfortable and quiet. A wonderful place to stay. I would happily recommend it! Very flexible check-in. Kim was wonderful! Fiona was a doll!!!
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was fast with communication. Everything was perfect! From the nice neighborhood, clean and beautiful room and shared bath, to the yummy, fresh, hot keurig coffee in the morning. Highly recommend !!! Great value!!!"

Beautiful decorations
In every location
Great place.
The best location

Beautiful room"
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"What a wonderful surprise! Kim's immaculate home, which is located in a very safe, upscale neighborhood, was so comfy and well-appointed! Thoughtful details everywhere...from the personalized welcome sign on the guest-room door to a personal bath mat, shower mirror, tasteful Valentine's decorative accessories, and a fully stocked coffee/tea bar in the lounge area. The bed was super comfortable, the wall-to-wall carpet fresh and fluffy, and the room was spacious. I felt so guilty paying so little for such a great stay that i scrounged around in my purse and luggage to find a few extra bucks to leave on the dresser. Lol. Thank you, Kim, for your attention to detail. What a great night."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I enjoyed my stay here, Ms Kim is very polite,respectful, friendly and helpful right on time service. I wish her Gods blessings."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim's AirBnB is clean, comfortable and a great value. Convenient to Pax and other southern MD locations. You feel at home when you walk in the door. It really is a safe, cozy place to stay and work."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim's home was absolutely beautiful. My brother, stayed in her home while visiting us, and had nothing but fantastic things to say. The location was great. My brother didn't get in till almost 2am and it was no problem, he said the bed was super comfortable and overall a great stay. Thank you Kim for making my brother feel right at home."
2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great host very clean
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Kim was amazing, her home is warm and welcoming, the room is spacious and relaxing."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is definitely a keeper. Kim and her Husband are great hosts. The bed was super comfy, and the shared lounge and bath were perfect. The location is 2 blocks from St. Mary's Hospital and any traveling medical professionals would find this location Idea. I was up very early every day and returned late, but there were no issues with my schedule. Its about a 15-minute drive to California Maryland and 25 minutes to Base Gates with plenty of shopping locations. But never in a hurry driving through the lovely countryside. Affordable and friendly...Even for Dallas Cowboys Fans !"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, private (even though shared bathroom. This was better than I expected. I recommend Kim‚Äôs house!!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Another great stay! I highly recommend.

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A great place to stay. Owners anticipated our every need. Their home was clean, beautifully decorated and made us feel very welcome."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The home and room were spotless, the room was very spacious, comfortable, and quiet. Great choice for a place to stay if you're in the area for work."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I'm a country boy at heart, kinda simple. There are two rooms here, I stayed in the big room. For me it felt like a suite at a hotel. Room is large, king size bed, very spacious w/walk in closet. If Feng Shui is your thing, the peace harmony balance is perfect: plants in the stairway, esthetically pleasant paintings/art work, cool color pillows/soft comforter, calming aroma (air freshener) scent. Very relaxing. The kind of room you want your room at home to feel like. It's a relatively new home, so bathroom is clean, comfortable, still has that new (ish) home feel.
No kitchen access (ice), but mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker w/multiple flavors.
Personally, I can be kind of a dick, critical, a bit hard core. On a scale of 1-10, I don't usually give anything higher than a 7, on anything. 8 is a big deal. If I'm being honest, for my stay I give them an 9."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Kim has provided an excellent, stylish, clean space for those who need a place on business travel. Everything needed for setting up a workspace or just kicking back and relaxing. Highly recommended if you find yourself in southern MD!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay it will not disappoint!
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Another great stay. Clean and comfortable. Thank you!
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely loved it. Its beautiful. Its set up to be very private and pretty much separate from the rest of the house. I like that. Im the type thats a private person but I only stay in the county for work so I don't want a whole place to myself. This place is perfect for the price and privacy. There were so many homey touches. In the loft area, I thought man it would be nice to cuddle up on the couch with a blanket. Guess what? There were some blankets! Everything was thought of! I will stay again. I'd rather stay here than my hotel. When I need to book my next stays, this house will def be ahead of the hotel! If youre a travel nurse, this place is amazing. Its like a few blocks from the hospital. Its so close!"
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Nice hosts, clean spaces, and good selection of coffee pods."

2021-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was a really good experience. The space was as intended and they were extremely respectful of my privacy at all times. I went there to simply take a few days out of my house to get some focused work done as I have a loud environment with the kids. It was perfect for that I would certainly go back. Everything was as or better than expected

2020-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're a traveling professional and you need a place to stay this is the place. I travel a lot and this sure beats staying in a hotel. It's very quiet, and has a wonderful queen size bed and sleeping arrangements. It is very nice, clean, and convenient to restaurants and shopping.

2019-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I usually have a difficult time sleeping anywhere away from home, I felt just at home if not even more at home during my stay.

I would rate it 11/10 if I could rate it that high!"

2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great as always.
2019-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"This was my very first Airbnb stay and was for about 10 days. I have to admit that it has already set an extremely high bar with regards to a positive client service experience ‚Äì both from the Airbnb Customer Services team AND the Hosts. Being someone who travelled often for many years, I felt like I was staying in a 5 star hotel room but without all the hassle of hotels. The Hosts provided a perfect hideaway with spotless facilities and prompt attentiveness to my every need. We can read about the features and amenities at any of the properties available, but the comfort of the bed is not something that can be easily discerned . . . this king sized bed, with an assortment of pillows, made it so easy to fall asleep. I have now reserved several additional weeks with them."
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,My stay was wonderful!
2019-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Kim‚Äôs place is beautiful. There was a small mix up in communication on both sides but everything ended great!

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The location and apartment are great! Everything inside was clean and organized.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was truly a retreat and home away from home in a quaint walkable town with lots to do. Beds were extremely comfortable, kitchen and bathroom were well stocked, and it came with tons of local recommendations. We would definitely return if in the area again!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I am new to air bnb and this is only my second one. Great experience. Leonardtown is a great place to visit. Very walkable town

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect! It was our little hideaway close to home while our floors were being refinished. The space was very comfortable and exactly as described. Kitchen is well equipped and lots of pleasant touches from nice linens to reference books of the local area. Located in a great area, 3-5 minute walk to several restaurants, pubs, bakeries, and the wharf. The space/location was quiet even though it is in a small apartment building. The only time we heard/noticed neighbors was early in the morning as they were getting ready for their day. We would definitely stay again."
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place!!
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very nice place and Haley makes you feel like home. Wonderful hospitality, highly recommended;-)."

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great spot to enjoy the town. Perfect for small family or a couple. Clean and neat. Will book again.
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment was very clean, but on top of that it had many nice touches (K-cup coffee machine, snacks, a pillow that said ""Maryland"") that were sweet and helped put us in a vacation state of mind. The location was central. Haley/hostess was responsive."
2024-01-01,5.0,Group trip,Great spot!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was the perfect place for our stay! We were in and out a lot due to visiting with loved ones and the central location made it so we could be flexible and adjust to some last minute changes due to a family emergency. Highly recommend!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Haley‚Äôs place was awesome. Easily walkable to coffeehouses, restaurants, and bars. The apartment is comfortable and well appointed. We had a great stay."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Amazing location with exactly what we needed. The bunk beds were a favorite and the best thing for a family! Thank you so much for a very clean place for our family.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Adorable place, very clean and new. Had a little trouble finding it, but probably would have done better if we arrived before dark. Great location for walking around town. This is specific to me because I am very sensitive to chemicals, but the ""new"" smell (paint, furniture, not sure) bothered me. I had emailed beforehand and was told they didn't use fragrance in the sheets/towels, and this was true, so I slept well and wasn't bothered by fragrances while sleeping. And I'm sure in time the paint smell will disappear. I only put this on for anyone like me. My daughter was with me and it didn't bother her. So, all in all, we had a great time."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very clean comfortable space. Great restaurants within walking distance
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great spot in the heart of everything. We had such a good time walking around the shops in the square, going to the wharf and eating at the local spots. Would highly recommend staying here if you're coming to St. Mary‚Äôs County."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was our family‚Äôs first time in Leonardtown. We were visiting family for thanksgiving and needed a place close to their home to stay. So clean and neat. They also had left water bottles in the fridge for us and some chocolates. Beautiful touch.This home was perfect! There was a lot to do walking distance. It is located in downtown, you can walk to cute shops and restaurants and a short walk from the water. We stayed during thanksgiving week, so there were activities to do too.
Haley was so helpful and communicated with us as to what activities were happening near by on the day after thanksgiving. Our family of 4 (2 teenagers) had a great time! Highly recommended!!"
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Charming apartment in a great location. Our family of 4 with 2 smaller children loved the place. The kids were excited about the bunk beds and the adults enjoyed the walkability to several restaurants and bars. The apartment is wonderfully appointed with everything we needed for our stay and included several nice touches and details.
Would definitely stay again and already sent to link to family for when they come to visit."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, exceeded expectations. Hope to stay there again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The apartment is in a central, convenient location. Restaurants and shops are right around the corner. The pretty wharf park area is a short 1/2 mile walk. We had the chance to meet Haley. She is responsive, super nice, and very helpful. We parked in the free central parking area, which is accessed off of Park Street from Washington Street. Leonardtown is not large so even though the unit is right in the middle of things, it is quiet."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay at Fenwick Retreat. It was a very clean, quite apartment. The restaurants close by were amazing. If we come to this part of the states again we would stay there."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for our baby shower at The Fenwick Inn and needed a place near the venue and restaurants. This airbnb was perfect! It is right in downtown Leonardtown and is walking distance to shops and restaurants. The apartment is beautiful and the right size for a couple or small family who needs just a small place to sleep and relax. The beds are very comfortable, and there was coffee and snacks in the kitchen. Check-in and out was seamless, and Haley was a very helpful and kind host. We would definitely book here again!"
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Haley's place was very quaint & cozy, great location, and communication was fantastic. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to noise from other apartments in the complex, which it sounds like is being attended to!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Cozy. Great for one family.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was my 2nd stay here within a week or so of my last stay here ‚Äî had to visit my folks again so Haley‚Äôs place was perfect for another trip to handle business. It was super clean and cosy as always.
Parking outside the apt is always easy, accessible & available.
After my last review, more spices & cooking supplies were added to the kitchen, which was helpful! I really appreciate this cute lil place a lot and definitely will be staying again later this month during another family visit.
Thanks Haley & Travis ‚ú®‚ò∫Ô∏èü´Ç"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Haley‚Äôs place was perfect for our needs. It was exactly as described in the listing. It was an easy check in. Her place is peaceful and the decor is beautiful. We will definitely be staying again when we are back in the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Really enjoyed my stay here! We were visiting our elderly grandparents who have retired in the area and this stay really revived us after long days of handling family business (iykyk).
The place was BEYOND clean and cozy. It was just really peaceful and uplifting after a long day. Definitely pack cooking oils & spices, if you plan to stay here, because there isn‚Äôt much available in the pantry beyond salt & pepper.
The area is super walkable and has cute spots to eat at, not much but a enough for a night or two. People were fairly friendly in the area; it‚Äôs not very diverse but it is southern Maryland so I didn‚Äôt have very high expectations for that anyway.
Other than that, everything was great. We plan to stay again during a future visit to see our folks."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful spot in a great little town. I really enjoyed my stay!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,this place was so cute. It had to be the cleanest Airbnb I've stayed in. when we couldn't find the entrance because I didn't read the entire instructions she sent us she answered on the first call and was so helpful. Make sure you read the stuff in the email she sends you the day before so you know how to get in. If we are ever in the area again we will def be booking again if it's available.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,GREAT host! Very responsive and easy to work with. The personal touches were much appreciated! Would definitely stay again.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful home and lots to do in town. Will definitely book again!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was the cleanest and most well-stocked place I have stayed. Haley gave very clear instructions on check-in and check-out processes without giving guests too many responsibilities to remember before checking out. I HIGHLY recommend this place and will stay here again if I return!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a lovely, peaceful retreat at Fenwick. Check in was a breeze, the kids adored the bunk beds, and the kitchen was stocked with all the right bowls, dishes, pots and pans, and utensils. Everything was clean and inviting. The neighborhood was darling to walk and explore. Such a great spot. We hope to visit again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean, photos accurately reflect what the place looks like. Great little town with good restaurants and coffee shop."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful place, with wonderful hosts that are very responsive and helpful."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a great time at Dave and Karen's place. It was a perfect weekend get away. Beautiful area. Private and able to just sit and breathe. Would come back again
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay if you enjoy fishing! Dock right in the backyard!!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen have truly thought of everything and are such gracious, friendly hosts. From booking to check out, we didn‚Äôt want for anything! This place is an absolute gem nestled away from the busy main road, and packed with amenities and a gorgeous water view. We had such a relaxing time and loved sitting out on the patio watching Jax the chocolate lab play on the dock and in the water. I have already told so many people about this place. We can‚Äôt wait to come back, bring our boat, and experience it all over again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I ended up finding Dave's spot on accident but do not regret it one bit. I was planning a trip to the racetrack and was bummed to find out the only air bnb available was 30 minutes away. Little did i know this would be the best experience I've ever had. Blue Heron is a beautiful home with a nice pool table, fire pit, and kayaks for everyone to use. I look forward to next time I head to the track and get to stay at Blue Heron again."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Blue Heron is an impressive and very fun property. It is large, clean and comfortable. It is stocked with every possible amenity you will need or want- from a pool table, to high speed internet to kayaks and canoes. Dave and Karen very friendly and they make sure your stay is enjoyable. I highly recommend this place!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Nice place
2024-02-01,5.0,Group trip,Dave and Karen are excellent host. The house is just as described. Very beautiful clean and quiet. We loved our stay. We 100% recommend to anybody staying in the area.
2023-12-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,The space is in a beautiful location. Is is well kept and the kitchen in particular is better furnished than most vacation rental properties. Grocery stores are less than 5 minutes away. Dave was proactive and responsive with communication. Thank you!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The most serene and beautiful piece of property! Hosts were amazing and I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the private patio gazing at the water, blue herons, wood peckers, and more!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The perfect place to stay on the water in Southern Maryland. Quiet, peaceful and beautiful location just off the Patuxent River, feels extremely secluded, but is close to everything. Dave and Karen have created a wonderful experience for travelers that value natural beauty and solitude. We will definitely stay here again."
2023-10-01,5.0,Group trip,"Beautiful peaceful place on the water! Dave was very kind, responsive, and accommodating. Fire pit was easy to use and Dave even built a fire for us before we got there- just had to light it."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I can't thank the hosts enough their understanding and flexibility in helping my family have great weekend. They were responsive and accommodating and the place is even nicer in person than the pictures show.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen were perfect hosts, we have zero complaints about our time at Blue Heron. The space was nice and everything was set up very thoughtfully, would stay here again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"fantastic trip! thanks to Karen and Dave, our last vacation of the summer was perfect and exactly what we wanted - a chance to unplug and enjoy the space and the people around us. they were very responsive hosts and would absolutely love to visit again!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,Dave was an amazing host! The house was absolutely beautiful.. We will most definitely be coming back again!!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was a beautiful, clean, and cozy place. Dave was very responsive to our needs. We will be back as this is an awesome place for some R & R."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing, just being there makes you feel happy and relaxed. We were there only for a few days but managed to rest and feel connected to nature. house is nice and very comfy, has everything you need and more.
Karen and Dave are very friendly and great hosts, we would love to come back to stay with them again.
Grateful for this experience!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Tranquil and quiet, immaculately clean, with lovely water views. Front deck has tables and chairs for outdoor eating, plus charcoal grill. It looks out over a large sloping lawn to the riverfront. There is a capacious fire pit‚Äîhelpfully stocked with wood‚Äîwith Adirondack chairs around it. A dock is right on the property, with canoes and kayaks for use.
Small kitchen is well stocked, though no dishwasher. Having a washer/dyer is a real plus! Bathroom is shared between the two bedrooms, so there are two sliding doors to contend with. The rental is the bottom half of a house (hosts live upstairs) but there is private entrance and it‚Äôs a fully separate unit. You hear normal (soft) sounds of people upstairs, or on the upper deck. The hosts are very friendly and helpful, while simultaneously considerate of your privacy. Nevertheless, you do feel the presence of others, which may or may not be to one's taste. Overall, a really wonderful place, and we‚Äôd come again."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Blue Heron. The photos don‚Äôt even do it justice. The space is clean & comfortable, the kitchen is well stocked and the property is just gorgeous. Dave & Karen we‚Äôre very kind and accommodating. We would stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Highly recommend staying here! It‚Äôs a great location and the place was immaculate/fun to stay at! The billiards table was a standout and we felt super comfortable there. Plus being able to the kayaks out was a nice touch :)
Dave and Karen were fantastic as well!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place on the water.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A very nice place. Very quiet and peaceful.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen were superb hosts! We needed the flexibility of an earlier check0in and later check-out due to our son's sports events and they were very accommodating, which was appreciated. The kitchen was extremely well-equipped and there were plenty of towels for our family of 4. The setting was beautiful and quiet and we felt comfortable as soon as we walked in. Thank you both for your wonderful and warm hospitality!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The host Dave was very good with communication through text. The living space was clean and stocked, and the property was secluded away from most other houses, but still in a very accessible area. I felt safe leaving my car in the driveway overnight, which was a necessity for me personally.
The only thing that felt a slight bit strange was being in someone else‚Äôs house while they were home. Even though we knew that before booking, I felt as if I had to be much quieter than I normally would be (whispering later at night, TV noise, cooking) but it was easy to adjust to.
With that being said, I would definitely recommend this AIRBNB, and plan to come back next year."
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We were here for a family event in March. Just wondered how beautiful it must be in the Summer and Fall? Will definitely be using this location again.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dave and Karen's place was tremendous. We have been coming to the area for years for big swim meets staying in hotels. The Blue Heron was hands down the best place to stay. It felt like being at home...I highly recommend it.
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen's place was perfect for our weekend getaway! It was clean, peaceful, and everything was very well organized. I would highly recommend this Air BnB if you are looking for a quiet, relaxing place to stay not far from Solomon's Island with plenty of things to do (watch movies, play chess, hang out by the fire pit, play pool, etc)."
2023-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We loved their home, a very beautiful space with amazing views. They went above and beyond to make sure we felt at home from the moment we walked in. Our reservation was last minute and they took great care of us. I will definitely be coming back to stay again."
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We came into town to see my son and our first Grad Daughter. We arrived late 10:30pm and had no problem checking in. Daves place was absolutely perfect. The setting was beautiful by the water. The place was very clean and looked just like the pictures. The Host Dave was very friendly and made you feel welcome. Dave did a great job communicating with us. He even let us park around back because my 91 year old mother has problems walking so we were 30 feet from the door. We would definitely recommend this property. Thanks Dave
2023-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Just a perfect getaway. Would love to come back as part of our summer vacation.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The best place we have ever stayed at. The attentions to detail will meet ever need. Great location and setting! Owners are always available and communicate very well!
2022-11-01,5.0,Group trip,"A wonderful place with great amenities. The thoughts, details, and hospitality to accommodate are some of the best you‚Äôll find. Would highly recommend for a peaceful getaway on a lake."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen's place was perfect for our girls' weekend. They were both very helpful in answering all of our questions (and allowing us to share their granddaughter's birthday cake!!) We enjoyed comfortable mattresses, kayaking, playing pool and chess and the fabulous view of the Creek. We ventured out to St. Mary's, Solomon's Island and Leonardtown, all very close. I would highly recommend Blue Heron to anyone visiting the area.
Thank you Dave and Karen....we hope to return soon!!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very nice place. Kayaking was easy in protected creeks or can go to more open water. Hosts are very accommodating.
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The place was great, plenty of room for the 4 of us. Everything was clean. Loved sitting outside and enjoying the view."
2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,Dave and Karen are great hosts and are super friendly. Their property is a real gem. My family and I really enjoyed our stay there. We even had my sister and her fianc√© pick us up on their boat to go fishing on the Patuxent from the boat dock right in Dave and Karen's backyard. The fire pit outside and the pool table inside were a great touch as well.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you are looking for a lovely quiet place to get away and enjoy the water, this is the place for you!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Comfortable and peaceful apartment and backyard. Highly recommended.
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave & Karen were gracious host! I love their place by the water. We went to fish but because of the rain that didn't happen, but we had a great time there! Pool table kept us entertained! The best part was sitting outside on the patio watching the rain over the water, it was so peaceful!
We loved it! I hope they will have us back!"
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Dave and Karen's space is the best Airbnb we've visited in all of our travels. The location is a hidden gem- tucked away down a quiet gravel road, situated right on the edge of the water, but at the same time close to everything- parks, fishing, sightseeing, shops and restaurants. The perfect balance of activities and downtime.
The space is immaculate. Clean, spacious, well stocked. We had everything we needed to cook our meals, including plastic ware for outdoor dining. We enjoyed the fire pit, patio and the benches on the docks. We made use of the kayaks and pool table.
Dave and Karen were extremely attentive hosts. They responded immediately to all of our questions and they went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.
We highly recommend this Airbnb. We will certainly visit again."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"we had a wonderful stay! Dave & Karen's airbnb is beautiful -- large, clean, in a location that is beautiful/feels super secluded yet is really close to stores/parks/restaurants etc. we had a lovely fire in their huge firepit (which Dave had built for us in advance! so thoughtful!), paddled around for a bit in the kayaks, hung out on their gorgeous deck, played a few rounds of pool, and just in general had an absolutely fantastic time. they're total airbnb pros, the check in process was beyond smooth, they're very easy to communicate with, and they just overall seem like really nice people. we would definitely stay here again!"
2022-03-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"First off The property is AMAZING! Huge bay style window facing the backyard with an outdoor fire pit and patio right on the water is a breathtaking view! 2 spacious bedrooms w/ a huge common area ( think kitchen, gameroom, and den, dining room open floor plan) We were a little apprehensive since it is an apartment DONT LET THAT FOOL YOU! The property has a woodsy cabin feel to it. We had all the privacy of a detached home! Dave and Karen..... exceptional hosts! Wonderful people to sit and chat with. If you need anything they are on top of it! When my wife, mother and I showed up Dave even brought the golf cart around to transport our belondings to the door! What can I say the best place we've stayed at in Maryland! We fly out every year for our grandsons birthday. Hope its available next year!
P.S. both Mom and the boss(my wife) fell in love with the place and the hosts! That speaks volumes!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful peaceful home on the water! Wonderful hosts! Clean, relaxing and close to so much in southern MD! I loved my stay here! Will come back for sure!! You will not be disappointed if you stay here!!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen were more than accommodating, kind, and happy to help out with any questions I had during the stay. They were excellent hosts and I would absolutely love to go back to their listing if I‚Äôm back in the area. I really appreciate the efforts they put into making the trip easy, carefree, and comfortable. The place is absolutely gorgeous and has everything you could need to make your trip perfect. Thanks Dave and Karen!"
2022-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Very clean place in a great area. Close to a variety of restaurants. Hosts were not intrusive. Would recommend to people staying in the area in the future.
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic fully self contained walk out apartment. The interior is very welcoming, extremely well furnished and styled. This gives you a feeling like you really are at home, instead of some sterile overnight motel. Everything is very well maintained and of course clean. Great kitchenette with washer dryer combo, which is perfect for longer stays. And oh very comfy beds. The added entertainment extras (pool table, board games, wifi, TVs, etc) also makes the stay even more enjoyable.
Dave and Karen are perfect hosts providing excellent communication, both before arrival and during the stay. And while they do live upstairs, you only really get a sense that someone may be upstairs, and that‚Äôs only very occasionally. But with the separate entrance and magnificent outlook, Blue Heron offers great privacy and is a fantastic place to stay."
2022-01-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The Airbnb is located in a beautiful area and the place itself is very quaint. One thing to note, is that the noise between floors is not minimized. Due to this, it gives a lack of privacy."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location on the water, with many nice restaurants & hiking trails within a short drive. As other reviewers pointed out, you can hear footsteps from the owners' upstairs unit, but nothing beyond that. We stayed in the winter, so didnt do too much kayaking/fishing, but definitely appreciated the fast wifi, billiards table, and fire pit (a pre-made fire was even waiting to be lit when we arrived). Would certainly consider staying here again if ever in the area."
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen have a great place. Very cozy, and they were uber communicative for checking in and checking out. I recommend staying here!"
2021-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a relaxing beautiful stay. We enjoyed looking out at water and soaking in the nature. It was quiet and relaxing. Just what we were looking for. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom was clean. Kitchen was clean. Loved the accessibility and how looking for things were made easy with labels.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderfultime! The place is very nice, fun and clean. We really enjoyed the pool table and the chess board! Great design to have the bathroom between the bedrooms. We didn't cook but if we did, the place had it all. Dave is highly communicative for anything you need. Yes you can hear the upstairs floor a bit as shared in other reviews, but it's not disruptive and we found it less so in the bedroom. It is a lower level unit and the light is great, the windows in the main area have a beautiful river view. When we went it was cold so we didn't use the boats but they had many to use! Would highly recommend!!"
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed at the Blue Heron as part of a vehicle move during a military change of station. Dave was super flexible and helpful accommodating a U-Haul car hauler. Awesome little spot right on the water‚Ä¶ wish we had a little more time to relax and enjoy the great location and view.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful setting. Very attentive hosts. Would return if the opportunity arises.
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Was a great stay! Recommend this place!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"You will not be disappointed with your stay !! Everything was amazing!!! The view, the property, the home, the hosts. All of it! Even with having one full day of rain, we were able to have fun as a family inside because the place is set up with a pool table and chess board! We also brought games and watched movies. Plenty of space for the three of us and on the sunny days, that pier is amazing!!! Karen even brought us some homemade muffins on the rainy day!! Super friendly and accommodating. We came to celebrate our love as a couple and a family and we will definitely come back again!!! If it hadn‚Äôt rained, we would‚Äôve enjoyed the kayaks. Oh and the sunrise is amazing on the water and the sunset out front over the beautiful trees is also quite lovely."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fabulous location, right on a cove off the Patuxent River. In the morning, you can actually watch a blue heron swoop onto a platform in the cove, scouting out its breakfast. Spotlessly clean, well equipped, good furniture, reliable internet, nice pool table. We never got a chance to go out on the water, due to the unusual flood tides in the Mid-Atlantic our weekend, but the location has both canoes and kayaks [two person]. Nearby, we had a lovely hike in Calvert Heights State Park [$5 for MD residents, $7 for others]. This location is close to many services, over on Three Notch Rd. , and a short drive from St Mary's original settlement and many other local sites. Sat morning, just up on Three Notch, there is a small but very nice farmers market. We cooked in for three nights and found the kitchen to be just fine. The place has two bedrooms; we were two, but it can easily handle four. Friendly owners, who communicate quickly and effectively. The very model of what airbnb should be."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We enjoyed a memorable stay at Blue Heron! Our hosts Dave and Karen communicated well and check-in was super easy(we were even able to check-in early which was a nice surprise!). Upon check-in we had some nice touches waiting for us, including, a bottle of wine, chocolates, and a fire pit loaded up and ready to light! Blue Heron was clean, comfortable, and absolutely beautiful. There is so much to see and do in the area. We hope to come back and stay longer next time. Many thanks to Dave and Karen for sharing their place."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Dave and Karen provided us with great accommodations and wonderful hospitality. They have such a lovely property with a waterfront view and a tranquil atmosphere. Also, it's a quick drive over the bridge to Solomon's Island for quality restaurants, shops and even more scenic vistas. I would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended."
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent stay!! Beautiful home right on the water. We were welcome to the fire pit, kayaks, canoes, pool table.
Close to Solomon‚Äôs amenities as well! Would definitely come again and hope to stay even longer next time!!"
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was one of the best stays! We will definitely book this again. The amenities along with this lovely apartment was much more than we expected! I would 100% recommend this place for a nice get away! Dave was great and answered all questions I had.
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Dave and Karen‚Äôs place was a true delight. Beautiful area and lots to do outdoors just a short 10-15 minute drive away. The property is gorgeous and I enjoyed sitting outside near the water while having my morning coffee. Hosts were responsive and their guidebook was very helpful. Will definitely stay here again when I‚Äôm in the area!
2021-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful tranquil setting. Everything you need and nothing you don't. Indoor and outdoor fun, great access to cove and can even kayak to small beach area. Just perfect."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Bring your fishing poles
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"David‚Äôs place is great. The view of the creek and just all around peacefulness of the neighborhood was exactly what I needed.
Even though it feels like you‚Äôre off the beaten path, it‚Äôs very close to many restaurants, coffee places, grocery stores, everything you need.
It is a downstairs unit, so you can hear some noise, but it was never disturbing or overly loud.
The hosts were great at communication and have set up a truly lovely place."
2021-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful! Best Airbnb thus far in Maryland! Home away from home. Don‚Äôt look any further!"
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Oasis on the Creek. A++, we loved our stay on the creek. The host is gracious and the accommodations are perfect for a getaway. Enjoyed the ease of water activities, kayaking, crabbing, and fishing. Plenty of MD blue crab that can be scooped right up. You wont find a better getaway that is still close to everything in the area. Quiet, tranquil and lots of fun for all ages. Clean and modern throughout. We will stay again, our new favorite stay-cation. Thank you."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"A home away from home destination. Our family of four packed a lot in a few short days: museums, state parks, hikes, beaches, shark teeth finds, shopping, theater, and seafood dinners. Blue Heron provides a healthy dose of relax and play. I would highly recommend Blue Heron to anyone who wants be away and still feel at home."
2021-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"We had a wonderful stay at Dave and Karen‚Äôs place. The location is quiet and peaceful and the hosts are great and very friendly.
We enjoyed using their new double kayak to visit the surrounding area and we had a great time around the fire in the evening. We played cornhole and pool, we also went to visit the Annmarie sculpture garden and the PAX aviation museum. The place is closed to a lot of great restaurants.
Definitely recommend! Thank you for hosting us :-)"
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place! AMAZING home, wonderful hosts, and an awesome location.

The living space is spotless, well-appointed, and super comfortable, and the creek and property are beautiful. Dave and Karen were terrific and accommodating hosts. 5 stars."
2021-07-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Our stay at Dave and Karen‚Äôs was fabulous. From the stunning view through the wall of windows that brings the picturesque outdoors in, to the perfect location for work and play, to the wonderful hosts, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better oasis. Super relaxing and peaceful, the Blue Heron is a gem. The windows look straight out to the water, as do all the comfortable seating options right outside your own door. Rain or shine we loved spending time out on the spacious patio that is completely covered. It‚Äôs a beautiful space to walk out to in the morning with Keurig coffee in hand. Staying true to its name we were excited to spot the herons, plus bald eagles, during our stay. Everything about the place is super comfortable ‚Äì the layout, the lighting throughout the space including the beautiful lighting over the pool table, the firm mattress and reclining sofa. There is a desk with a large screen set up in each of the bedrooms, perfect for working remotely. It is obvious that a lot of love and thought went into the design and comfort throughout the place. The location is perfect for fun explores nearby though the Blue Heron feels like a destination in and of itself. Solomons Island and Myrtle Point Park are minutes away, and the historic St. Mary‚Äôs ‚Äì with a great bakery ‚Äì and Leonardtown are less than a half hour away. Centrally located, everything you need is also minutes away ‚Äì grocery stores, restaurants, etc. Dave and Karen had superb food recommendations. We especially loved Hidden Harbour and The Front Porch. It was great to also have the kitchen and an outdoor grill to cook with the stunning view. Thanks for an amazing stay!"

2024-06-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We really enjoyed our stay at Teresa‚Äôs place. Really nice and relaxing views of the river and sunset. Did some kayaking and had a nice family dinner in the backyard with a beautiful view and breeze coming from our lovely Chesapeake Bay. We also visited Point Lookout Lighthouse and Beach, got coffee in the town center (Leonardtown), took a boat to the St. Clements Island from the local museum and learned about the first landing in MD and enjoyed driving around Solomon‚Äôs Island."

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place is totally worth if for nothing else that you get to be right on the water. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the place was cute and really clean, but it was so nice to be outside, hearing the water, and making a fire. I would totally come back."

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My daughters and I had a wonderful short stay for a couple days over spring break. Although the weather didn‚Äôt cooperate Teresa‚Äôs place was beautiful and I‚Äôd love to come back in warmer weather. The home was immaculate and had so many thoughtful amenities. The only thing I‚Äôd note is that there‚Äôs a house being built two homes down. I was up early because my girls are young, but if you‚Äôre looking for peace and quiet it could potentially be a bother. I didn‚Äôt find it one at all, though. Wonderful stay and we hope to be back sometime!!"

I spent each day down at the private beach where I read, relaxed, listened to the waves and was even greeted by a couple of blue herons. My favorite part was watching the stunning sunsets each and every night. I also enjoyed the fire pit under the stars. The neighborhood felt safe and was definitely quiet. The neighbors and their dogs were very friendly. The cottage was very comfortable, clean and tastefully decorated. The popcorn, k cups and Hershey Kisses were nice treats, too üòä. I surely enjoyed my time and definitely plan to go back!"

Walking into the house we were welcomed by the amazing view and refreshing cool AC. The home was extremely clean, tidy, and cozy. The kitchen and linens were all stocked with everything we needed, even Tupperware which I greatly appreciated as we did do a bit of cooking during our stay. The cottage is small but the perfect size for our family of 2 adults and 3 kids under 6. Teresa‚Äôs thoughtful touches of s‚Äômores ingredients in the cupboards, Hershey kisses in a bowl, and a binder full of tips on the area were much appreciated.
The beach was amazing we loved all the little pebbles and although there were lots of jelly fish my kids loved catching them with sifters and tossing them back in.
We loved exploring different areas including downtown Leonardtown, Solomon‚Äôs island, and St. George‚Äôs island all a short drive away.
A truly wonderful trip made even better by our comfortable stay."

I will come back when I get a chance."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Had a peaceful and nice stay‚Ä¶
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was my first Airbnb experience & I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better getaway. Teresa is a great host - book while you can!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is beautiful! Perfect beach getaway. Teresa was very responsive and welcoming, and the place was very clean and excellently-stocked. We would definitely love to come back soon!
PS for those religious about their coffee: the house has a Keurig (and Teresa was kind enough to also provide K-cups)"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Teresa's cottage is not only perfectly placed, but perfectly perfect! It was so clean, fresh and beautifully appointed. Had everything we could possibly need. The kayaks were fantastic to make use of and saved us from the hassle of bringing ours. We loved the firepit looking at the water on a cool June night. The beach front was great & the neighbors and general neighborhood was very quiet. The Potamac views from the cottage are expansive. Southern MD/ St. Mary's penninsula is rather rural (wonderfully so), but there was loads to do in a short distance from the house, including a sunset cruise at Point Lookout Marina (maiden voyage) that allowed us to bring a picnic basket & wine for dinner. St. Mary's City archaelogical park was well worth a visit (we are history buffs), as is Leonardtown. Great restaurants in the area like the Front Porch in Leonardtown & Pier 450 on the water near Point Lookout, right on the water. So much to say in a small space! Thank you, Teresa!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Nice little getaway!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Teresa‚Äôs place is beautiful and charming, we had a relaxing stay. I loved all the details, thoughtful assortment of snacks for the occasion. My 7 year old an 18 month old had a great time, we will come again."

2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"The weather didn‚Äôt totally cooperate during our stay, but we made the best of it! The house and the little beach were just what we were looking for during our short family getaway. Great for little ones who like playing in the sand!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Newly remodeled, spacious inside and very comfy bedrooms, furniture, bathroom for 4 adults. Backyard to private beach off Potomac River, spectacular views horizon views. Cable TV with plenty of channels, newish full size washer/dryer, quality appliances. We were so relaxed by tranquil river sounds and views did not feel need to use our phones, even forgot to try WIFI access. Neighborhood entrance down gravel narrow private access road was bit challenging and parking esp for a 2nd car very tight but we made it work fine."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Teresa‚Äôs place is lovely. The view is AMAZING and the place was very clean.
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,I stayed here with my daughter and my brothers because we went to hday and needed somewhere to stay we loved it so much we want to come back sometime soon great space

2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Far and away one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had. Teresa was an amazing host. Very responsive, checking in on us and offering many suggestions for our specific family. She also provides all the supplies you need to have a lovely time. The space is larger than it looks in pictures and was the perfect size for our little family. The private beach is great and easy to access. My son (age 3) asked if we could move in, so I don't think there's a better review than that!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This little cottage was certainly ‚ÄúPerfectly Placed‚Äù. We stayed for just a couple nights and it was such a cozy and comfortable stay. Everything was clean and organized. Loved our stay here. Would highly recommend! Teresa was great and super quick to respond to questions. Thanks so much for providing such a great space.
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Exactly what we needed. We both had a long week at work and didn‚Äôt roll in until almost 10pm - Teresa was kind enough to let us take our time checking out the following day, which made it even more difficult for us to leave such a perfect little spot. Rolling into the little beach town, people had bonfires going and it reminded me very much of the days/nights I spent on John‚Äôs Island/James Island, SC in my younger days. Thank you Teresa!!!"
2023-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfectly Placed is exactly as it‚Äôs named, Perfectly Placed.
It was so cozy but not so cozy that your on top of each other.
This sweet beach house is peace on earth. The neighbors were friendly and the neighborhood was just the sweetest, you know the kind you almost don‚Äôt find anymore. At night I felt safe enough to leave the door open to hear the waves.
Ahhhhh, so much to be said‚Ä¶
If your looking for a weekend getaway to find some peace and have a joyful time, this is it!!
Thank you Teresa for being such a great hostess!"

As SMCM alumni, we will be back."
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,So glad we found this place! We were in town for a wedding and it was such a nice calm getaway.
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for peace and tranquility, this place is for you! Even though we experienced heavy rain during our stay, the lovely furnishings, attention to detail (puzzles and games, candy, drinks in the fridge, cozy throw blankets etc.) and the incredible view of the water kept us happy. When there was a break in the rain, we took advantage of the kayaks and beach. The beds could have been a bit comfier, but everything else was high quality. As others have mentioned, the design and decor of the house is magazine worthy. This small space packs a punch! Definitely recommend."
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This AirBnB is wonderful! The yard and private beach make for such a relaxing stay and the house is a great size for a small family.

2022-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Gracious and responsive host of a cosy, well-stocked private beach home. Teresa described the property perfectly and was lovely. This is the perfect spot for a short getaway from the city. Wifi could be stronger and beds are a bit soft, but otherwise a good place to watch beautiful sunsets and frolic in the water. Recommend!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was perfect for a relaxing weekend. The neighbor even gave us some fresh eggs from their hens. We also enjoyed the beautiful sunsets.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This home is nicely named: perfectly placed. The view out the large back windows is amazing, calming, beautiful. While the home is smallish, the layout makes for bedroom privacy and the living room space is separate and relaxing. Really well designed and feels plenty spacious.
Clean and open. Perfect.
Also, thanks to hosts for such nice stocking ‚Ä¶ some fun snacks, toiletries in case you forget, and water stuff for playing in the bay.
We‚Äôll definitely come back. One of our favorite AirBnB places."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Teresa is a great host. Very responsive and her place was very clean and has all the basics you need. Grocery stores are not too far in case you need something. We loved the location and the small private beach. Perfect for anyone that wants to enjoy a quiet time. Teresa recommended some nice restaurants in Leonardtown. She also has a very well put together binder at the cottage that gives you these details. There is something to do for everyone. Highly recommend it and will visit again.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of 4 fit quite nicely in this cozy cottage. Enjoyed kayaks, board games, fire pit, grill and a movie in the living room before bed. Spent a nice day in Leonardtown for brunch, shopping and ice cream before playing in the water and beach for hours."
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Teresa‚Äôs place is lovely! Perfect for a small family getaway. The place has everything you need for a fun time, including kayaks and life jackets.

Our family loved the stay."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay here! It was the perfect size for my family of 4 which included two small kids. The house is beautiful inside and must have been recently renovated because everything looks brand new. Very nice to have the little beach right in the back. The kitchen had everything you needed for cooking which was nice too! Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice quiet spot.
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Teresa's place is cute, clean, and very bright with the beach right outback. Use of the kayaks was a big plus."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house was just so lovely! Teresa was the most responsive host I've ever experienced. The house does not disappoint. The location is perfect!

We will definitely be back and would highly recommend to anyone!"

2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is a cute house in a beautiful location! The beach is shared with the neighboring house but everyone we encountered was so friendly and welcoming. The kayaks were great and we were able to kayak to a beach nearby. The water in the house does have a very strong sulfur smell and make sure to turn lights off inside and outside the home at night to prevent bugs from coming inside!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,we had a great time. Nice and peaceful

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Great location for waterfront scenery (including the back yard facing the sunset), and the house is fixed up really, really nicely inside. We were not looking for a beach vacation but rather just wanting to explore this corner of the country a bit for one evening and morning while passing nearby as part of a longer trip. We (just two of us, using only one of the two bedrooms) found it great for that purpose. We chose to go out to dinner and breakfast in town, 20 minutes away, but the kitchen would definitely serve well for a family of 4 or 5 staying for a week's beach vacation and cooking."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect home to relax, unwind and recharge. It has an incredible view of the water right from the living room, offering spectacular sunsets and equipped with everything you need for a memorable experience. Teresa was super responsible to every inquiry I had and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable‚Äî she even had her husband bring a brand NEW gas grill to the property and in time for our stay. That made a huge difference for us since we spent a lot of time outdoors grilling! As soon as you enter the home you feel like you are in a magazine worthy cottage and every room is beautifully and tastefully decorated. I cannot say enough good things about this home and the host. So glad we found this place and we cannot wait to come back!"

2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place is great. The views are spectacular, and the beach is so nice- you can swim all day there. Everything feels so easy going, and we truly love the views. The sunsets are beautiful! Be sure to check the night sky- we had starry skies.
The house is well stocked with all the essentials, cooking stuff, towels, and it‚Äôs very comfortable. We stayed there with our 9 year old son- it‚Äôs a great stay.
Very nearby, there are plenty of stuff to do from state parks to visiting Leonardtown. We went out for dinner and have to say the food at one restaurant in Leonardtown is so good. If you need to get groceries, there is a nice grocery store 10 mins away.
Overall, this was a wonderful stay, the beach and views - perfect. Indeed, this is perfectly placed."
2022-05-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family had a wonderful time staying here! This was our first vacation with a toddler and it was an absolutely perfect place for us to start. We loved relaxing on the beach and playing in the water. The house was very clean and welcoming and was perfect to relax in after a day of swimming and hiking at a nearby park. We had everything we needed and more. My son was especially excited to have popsicles in the freezer ready to go! We even got to meet the neighbors' and their sweet dogs!
Teresa was great with communication and quick to answer questions and share tips before the trip. The home is in a quiet neighborhood but still close to good restaurants and other things to do. We look forward to returning next summer!"

The house was beautifully decorated, and you can‚Äôt help but relax in this setting! It‚Äôs about a 20 minute drive to downtown leonardtown, and note that you basically need reservations everywhere on a Saturday night."
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Spent the weekend at the little cottage and felt completely relaxed on Sunday when we left. The breeze off the Potomac River was perfect and the sunsets were amazing. Spent Saturday morning enjoying the beach and doing some shell collecting. The cottage is small but the inside space is well laid out. The four of us did not feel crowded. The large windows in the back give a great view of the River and help make the place feel open. The place was very clean and still has that renovated new smell. Teresa was a great host. We will be returning here soon!

The pictures to this immaculately clean and beautifully detailed home away from home do not do it justice. It‚Äôs hands down the best airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. You can tell the hosts took great love and care in making this place comfortable for their guests, all the little details and the fact you could literally eat off the floors it was so immaculately clean. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud- not too firm but not too soft, just pure heaven. The location is pretty perfect- easy to locate and within walking distance of everywhere you want to go. The views of the water and the docked boats was so peaceful. We loved everything about our stay, so much that within a couple of hours of getting home I booked our next trip for this summer. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to book here - I guarantee you will be absolutely delighted! Can‚Äôt wait to return in July - thanks to Jackie & Eddie for such a wonderful stay."

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We stayed here while we were in town for a wedding. The house was clean and comfortable, and Solomons seemed like a really cute town with lots to do. The weather was really bad during our stay so we didn‚Äôt get to go out on the water or explore the area much, but we really appreciated being in a nice house where we could veg out. We would definitely come back!"

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Unbelievable stay! Jackie's home was gorgeous, comfortable, sparkling clean, and conveniently located near my family and friends. The view of the water and boats was spectacular! Everything was A+ perfect, and that's a grade given by a retired teacher, who always expected superior student performance for high grades. Many thanks for sharing your lovely home with me... It was picture perfect!"
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was amazing. Already booked for same time next year. The house was beautiful. Outside space was awesome. We spent time on the patio, bedroom balcony and by the fire pit. Inside was beautiful - pictures do not do it justice. Very nicely appointed. We shopped in her little boutique. Perfect location, within walking distance of everything. Jackie always responded quickly. So glad that she wants to share with others!! Thanks Jackie and Edward!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Little House on back creek. Beautiful home, pristine and clean, cozy and everything wonderful. We didn't want to leave. It was everything and more. We can't wait to return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Wow! What an incredible stay. Even better than advertised. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This unit is simply breathtaking. The view is as picturesque as the picture. Great host.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time staying at Jackie's Airbnb. The location was a short drive from Washington, DC and was a perfect place for a small weekend getaway. Restaurants and shops are in walking distance. Jackie and her husband were great hosts!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We wish we could give Jackie & Eddie's place more than 5 stars!!! The house was amazing!!! From all of the furnishings to the peaceful backyard on the water! We enjoyed every minute being at the house, we just wish we could have stayed longer. We were two couples and there was plenty of room. There are 2 bedrooms one with a king bed and the other with a queen bed. Both bedrooms have incredible en suite bathrooms with very large showers. Everything is decorated impeccably. Jackie and Eddie provide soft towels, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, soaps - which were a great touch and saved on having to pack all of those things. The kitchen was also well stocked with everything you would need! There was even water in the fridge for us when we arrived. Lots of great restaurants, ice cream shops and gift shops are all in walking distance. It was also great meeting Jackie at her spa and gift shop which is in front of the house. We definitely want to come back!!! Thanks for a great stay!!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful home ! Would definitely book again
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We have stayed at many AirBnB‚Äôs and this one was our favorite so far. The home is absolutely pristine, the photos simply do not do it justice. The entire town is walkable from the house, the home backs right up to the water and Jackie is very friendly and accommodating. If we ever return to the area we would love to stay here again!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We spent a few nights in this great newly renovated home in the small island community. There are plenty of things to do and places to eat a good meal within walking or biking distance or a reasonable drive. The home is spotless and spacious. We used the fully-equipped kitchen daily. The included kayaks offered a great way to see the area from the water. We enjoyed music from a restaurant across the inlet, too."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We enjoyed a wonderful weekend stay at Jackie's Little House on Back Creek. The location is very convenient and within walking distance of several restaurants and other activities. The house is very well designed with a modern fully equipped kitchen and luxurious bathrooms. The house's amenities are very well thought out. We'd just note that the master bedroom is very bright in the morning (at least in summer). We are hoping to visit again in the future.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Jackie's home is absolutely stunning! Great location to relax and walk to local restaurants and attractions. Jackie is a wonderful host!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and clean. Very responsive. Hosts even dropped off crabs for dinner!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely time and they were great hosts. The decor and location were amazing. Would love to come back and stay again.
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Very enjoyable vacation. Edward even suggested where we could purchase blue crabs and brought by a few supplies for us to eat them out back. Enjoyed using the kayaks and spending time around the fire pit as well.
Wonderfully designed and decorated home for a very relaxing time."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The house is absolutely beautiful and there wasn‚Äôt a detail they missed. Extremely clean
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house appears to have been recently updated or remodeled and was spotless. The house is located within easy walking distance of many restaurants and local shops.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place was perfect. My husband and I wanted to get away on the water and this was exactly what we were looking for. The house is brand new and was spotless. From the moment we walked in it felt comfortable.
Jackie and Eddy were responsive from the moment we booked until the moment we left .
The area had great restaurants and things to do but it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming.
We will definitely be back, possibly as early as this fall."
2024-06-01,4.0,Group trip,"Wonderful and peaceful waterfront location. Enjoyed hearing the birds singing in the morning, the yoga room, and making s‚Äômores by the fire at night. Great family home!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great location right on the water, and a convenient ~5 min drive to the Solomons Island attractions and amenities. A good spot to use kayaks, and other outdoor recreational activities.
Host Kyli was responsive and attended to concerns in a timely manner during a holiday weekend.
Pay attention to the location on maps prior to arrival, our GPS units only provided a general area of arrival.
Would stay here again, thanks Kyli."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a lovely cottage. Beautifully renovated, on a dead end street and on the water. And a great location, close to everything you could possibly need. Who could ask for more! We really appreciated the peaceful setting coming back after work. Nice equipment kitchen for making meals as well. Also appreciated the washer and dryer as well as the vacuum for tiding up. We were very comfortable and would definitely love to return."
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"such a cute, cozy place to stay in SOMD. It felt like home and was a short driving distance to my family‚Äôs place in Mechanicsville. It was a quiet neighborhood which made it extra relaxing. Take a walk around the neighborhood if you get a chance. If you‚Äôre new to Maryland-please check out Solomons Island, Calvert Cliffs, and Point Lookout. This location is perfect for all the site seeing. üíú"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"While a little tricky to find at night (mainly gps issues on our end), this place was phenomenal. Kyli is incredibly communicative and kind and helpful! We would absolutely stay here again."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay here! It‚Äôs a beautiful property near the water complete with a deck, fire pit, and swing set. The main downside is that much of the plumbing in the house is installed in odd ways, making it tricky to get water temperature the way you want it sometimes. But overall, the house is nice, and I‚Äôd recommend it as a good place for families to stay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"had an amazing stay, it was very peaceful, very clean and exceeded my expectations! the host is very nice and responsive she was amazing and always responded! if your looking for a nice quiet and peaceful stay this is the spot!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This was our first time visiting this area and we will be back! The property was perfectly located on the water and close local attractions. Kyli was extremely accommodating and very communicative throughout. Hope to come back in the summer and explore more of the area.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was our second time staying at this Airbnb. We come to town for Swim meets at the college and this is close to the hotels-but allows more space and privacy. Full size washer and dryer is a plus. Note to help renters- there is no ice maker in fridge-so if you have a need-pick up a bag. We love being close to the water-parking is easy and not too far from grocery stores and restaurants.
2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Great location. Great overall experience.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Loved it! Would love to stay again!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Property as described. Clean and easy access. Washer and dryer in unit and all newer appliances. Nice to have a view of the water and quiet setting. We were in town for a swim meet-so good space to relax between sessions. Space allowed for my son to have quiet space to rest while I could work/cook. Easy drive to the main road with restaurants and shopping either in California or Solomons Island. Assume in summer months this would be great for kayak/paddleboarding. No cable TV, but you can log into streaming accounts."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The house was delightful! Spotless and brand new! We will definitely come back!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,Terri‚Äôs place was beautiful and exactly as pictured/described. She was super friendly and flexible when I added our pups and one more person to our reservation. We had a great wknd and will definitely stay again!
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We loved our stay. It was the perfect place for the two of us. It was quiet, relaxing, walkable to the boardwalk and shops/restaurants."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I just returned from our stay at Terri's place. We loved everything about this Airbnb! We have been visiting Solomons for many years, but this is the first time we have stayed on the island proper. Once we parked our car Thursday afternoon, we didn't move it again until we checked out. We walked to The Pier, the Tiki Grill, and Cryptic Pizza for meals, all delicious options. Terri's place is darling in every respect. The interior space is homey and comfortable. The deck/garden area is a delight. We spent as much time outside as we could. The queen-size bed is very comfortable with high-quality sheets. The kitchen was perfect for us, and we were able to log in to our home streaming services in the living room. Parking is an absolute dream. We've never been closer to the door than the driveway of Terri's place. Don't miss a chance to stay at this lovely location."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"A quaint abode in a lively yet peaceful corner of town, within walking distance of many things to see, do, and eat!"

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This was the absolute perfect stay in Solomons! There is a view out the windows of both sides of the peninsula. Fantastic area to go for a walk, and great food just up the road to walk to as well. Host was responsive and I felt like this place was home. Also, easy parking. That doesn‚Äôt exist everywhere in Solomons!"
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Beautiful place!
2024-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, and loved the location!"

2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,The place was very clean and perfect for exploring Solomons Island. Cute town. Water views from her place. Would go back.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"We came into town to visit friends who live on the other side of the river not knowing much about the island, so when we arrived it was such a nice surprise. The place is right at the end of a beautiful boardwalk and next door to plenty of restaurants and river and marina views. The place itself isn't huge but it doesn't feel small, was perfect for wife and I and our dog. Everything spotless and well thought out, we really enjoyed our stay!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I stayed for our anniversary! The perfect, peaceful weekend getaway!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Just what we needed for the weekend.

2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is the PERFECT getaway if you want a few nights away! It's cozy, clean, quiet, tastefully decorated, and centrally located to be able to walk to anything you want to do on Solomons Island. We enjoyed walking the island and seeing the sights of the marina, the waterfront, and the beautiful homes! Walkable and everyone is friendly, couldn't have asked for a better weekend getaway. We will definitely be back sooner than later!"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Very nice and comfortable that is within walking distance of some very good restaurants. It was perfect and just what I was looking for. Terry was very easy to work with and very responsive. Thank you!
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Awesome location, cute & clean and up to date"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Terri‚Äôs plan is so cute and our favorite place to stay while exploring southern Maryland. The studio apartment is neat, tidy, and uncluttered which makes me feel very comfortable. This was our third stay and recommend it all the time to family and friends because of the great location, walkable neighborhood, and many food options."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Amazing cozy little place right on the water! Plenty of restaurants walking distance!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terri‚Äôs studio is cozy, sparkling clean, has everything you need but it‚Äôs not cluttered. We had 5 splendid days in Solomons Island and will certainly be back."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Island Breeze was the perfect mix of simplicity and charm! We felt right at home yet spoiled with the added luxuries of water views as well as high end restaurants, bars, river side pier and historic sites all within short walking distance. We truly didn‚Äôt want to leave. Would absolutely recommend others to stay at this gem!"
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Classy adorable place, location perfect, host absolutely the best. Walked to restaurants and shops."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Terri was extremely responsive and super friendly. The unit was perfectly outfitted for our visit. Super close to several restaurants and beautiful water views.
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent and easy last minute stay with my 8 month old baby. We brought our own crib and high chair. All the reviews are accurate. Terri is truly a wonderful host and the place looks even better in person. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book here!
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, quiet and within walking distance of shops and restaurants."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with a pet,"Terri's place really outperforms the description! There is a little deck area where I got to enjoy a coffee one unseasonably warm morning. Views of the marina across the streets and a little grassy walled in garden area where my dog could sniff around off leash. Solomon's Island is peaceful and isolated, with a little boardwalk nearby. Nice to be able to walk to anything and also to do a complete circle with the dog to enjoy the beautiful views. So many people out walking their best friends, so my dog got to socialize too.
Terri was always a text away and very friendly and responsive. The place was ideal for me, central to everything I was in the area for. Solomon's gets crazy busy in season, so this would be ideal if you wanted a few days to explore the cute shops and restaurants without having to worry about parking or driving."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely amazing stay! Terri was super friendly, even offered an earlier check in. The house was perfect for the two of us for an out of town getaway and close enough to walk to all the good places. She made me fall in love with Solomons Island as it was our first time there and we are already planning a return when it‚Äôs warmer!!!!! The bikes were such a great added touch btw. We felt like we were in our little world. No outdoor noise at all and the deck was a very good spot to enjoy waking up to."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,What a gem! I felt bad for my colleagues stuck in lame hotels.
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"What a great spot! The apartment was exactly as advertised - very clean, well-furnished, nice touches like having the kitchenette stocked with coffee/tea/etc. The location was even better than expected, with plenty of restaurants/shops/things to do within walking distance, but also a friendly neighborhood feel. Terri was a fantastic host, providing clear and detailed information ahead of check-in and making sure the apartment was spotless and set up for arrival. Highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Fantastic location and great place to stay! We were able to walk to all the great restaurants, check out the sunrise by the water, and enjoy the area in just a few steps out the door. The house is perfect for a weekend trip, very clean, and Terri is very responsive to any questions we had."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Absolutely perfect! Terri is a wonderful host, and the apartment was immaculate. Loved waking up and having the water views from the private deck. Provide amenities were very thoughtful. Will definitely be back!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"My husband and I decided to have an impromptu night away and stumbled across this gem! It was pristine clean, cute and quaint and affordable. It was decorated nicely and had a homey feel. We loved it and will stay again. Terri was extremely prompt with communication and was very sweet and kind. Parking was tight as we have a big truck and it was a shared driveway but that couldn‚Äôt be helped, we managed. We love the island and enjoyed our time. Thanks Terri!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed one night,Perfect spot for 2 and practically on the water. Within walking distance from several restaurants as well.

2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"We had a wonderful stay at this adorable little studio apartment! Everything was spotless and we appreciated the fresh floral arrangements! The location is right in the heart of everything and we were able to walk to my company function. Had the weather been on our side, I would have loved to sip my coffee on the deck over looking the water. Maybe next time‚Ä¶ :)
Thank you, Terri for everything!"

2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Having been to Solomons many times and knowing the area, I was extremely happy to find that this location had been turned to an AirBNB. The fact that they completely remodeled the house with great detail and then this space turning it from a garage to a studio apartment was top notch. If you didn't know going in, you never would have. The touches in the kitchenette were great, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was all you could need. All the little amenities included made the trip relaxing. I am already looking to rebook and maybe add another long weekend getaway staying here for next year. Terri is a wonderful host that communicated when I asked questions even though she was on her vacation. She has a loyal renter from now on."

Location is pretty great, walkable to pretty much the entirety of Solomon‚Äôs island and within 2 minutes of the Tiki bar. I appreciate that there was filtered water readily available for us in the fridge as our plans to bring a brita fell through.
A few things to note, the Tiki bar is super close so when they have a music night, you may hear some residual music coming from that direction. Also very minor thing, but the locking mechanism of the door was a little confusing initially, to lock the door, make sure the bottom lock is turned when you close the door otherwise the door will not lock automatically.
Overall really enjoyed the stay and would definitely would stay again in the future."

2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Sheer perfection! That‚Äôs all I can say about Terri‚Äôs little house. It is immaculate, and the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. All furniture is comfortable, and I never had a problem with the temperature in a seven-night stay. There‚Äôs everything you need for coffee and tea, and there were even oats during my stay. Every detail, from the fresh flowers inside and out to the way the towels were laid out made me feel that my comfort and needs were considered. And the place always smelled so good!
The location is beautiful. You‚Äôll be close to the water to watch the boats come in and out. The island is a wonderful place to walk, especially the boardwalk. You can shop a few quaint stores, hit a few bars, or enjoy several nice restaurants. You can go to church or go get a massage! And groceries and more serious shopping aren‚Äôt far away. Being alone, I especially appreciated Terri and other neighbors being close. It‚Äôs a safe place anyway, but that was even more comforting. I plan to return to this perfect little house!"

2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We were hoping for a calm, restful get-away in a waterfront community and our stay at Island Breeze on Solomon‚Äôs Island really hit the spot. The apartment was cozy and welcoming, decorated with loving care in a nautical theme with many polished amenities. A deck just outside the door was a perfect place for sitting and watching boats at work or drifting in and out of the harbor. It rained one afternoon and we enjoyed feeling snuggled inside on the comfy bed and couch, with waterfront windows on either side. The apartment was an easy walk to the pier and many delicious restaurants, and around the corner from the Chesapeake Bay Research Center. Learnardtown, full of local art galleries, is only 25 minutes away. Highly recommended!"
2022-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terri‚Äôs place is cute, efficient, and shipshape. We love the walkability of Solomons and there are so many neat things to do in the area on both sides of the bridge. Short walks to food, Calvert Marine Museum, sunrises, and sunsets."

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Wonderful accommodations for the two of us. Coffee, tea, creams fresh flowers and even fresh figs right from the tree, we‚Äôre a welcoming treat. The location was perfect to enjoy the Island flavour. Evening walks on the flowering tree lined board walk boasted spectacular sunsets over the bridge. Numerous restaurants to choose from with seating to enjoy water views. It was picturesque beyond expectation with water and boats everywhere. Our hosts Terri and Joe were absolutely excellent. They are sincere and generous!
Absolutely memorable!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"The pictures make this place look comfortable and charming, but the pictures don't do the space justice.

We'll be going back again."

Enjoyed walking to the local restaurants and to the boardwalk to watch the sunset in the evenings. Did not hear any noise from neighbors or local establishments once inside the apartment.
Took a relaxing boat ride around Solomons from the Maritime Museum. Also enjoyed nearby Annmarie Gardens and Calvert Cliffs State Park.
Only had two days here and wish we could have stayed longer to use the bikes!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"This place was wonderful! Location was AMAZING and we really enjoyed the place, including the porch.
One small thing to be aware of is that while the window shades offer great privacy, in our experience, they let in a bunch of light. So when sunrise is early, it can get pretty light in the room early.
I highly recommend this place!"

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Terri‚Äôs place I s a perfect studio apartment for two. Beautifully arranged. Very clean.

Terri‚Äôs place was perfect! Plenty of space, a cute kitchenette well stocked with coffee, sugar, and a variety of creamers, and a lovely little deck that was perfect to enjoy a drink on while baby slept inside. Terri was also kind enough to provide a pack and play so we didn‚Äôt have to bring ours. The location was great - just a short walk to all of the restaurants and right down the road from the Tiki Bar. Calvert Marine Museum is just a mile away as well. Terri was very communicative with helpful info and anticipated all of our needs, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better last-minute trip and we look forward to visiting again in the summer!"
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location in the middle of it all‚Ä¶ close to dining and night life but still peaceful. Great walks in the morning or evening with great views.
2022-04-01,5.0,Stayed one night,"Terri‚Äôs guest house was awesome!!! It was a small cozy space yet had plenty of room for bed, kitchen area and living room seating.
The layout and design was super cool (reminiscent of a school hallway with the checkered floors and cinderblock lower walls).
We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better space with a wonderful cross breeze on the deck, having been on a corner with water on both sides. The bed was cozy, unit super clean and Terri was a great host and even better, an easy same day check in for us last minute guests.
We highly recommend this place and it is within walking distance to many restaurants in Solomon‚Äôs."

2022-03-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"Terri‚Äôs place was just perfect for my little family. Although location was well appointed, restaurants we wanted to try weren‚Äôt open during our stay. It looked like the city/county was preparing for summer as construction was ongoing on the sidewalks and street. Getting around on a stroller to get to restaurants on that side was challenging. We managed and we enjoyed our stay nevertheless.
Terri was responsive and accommodating. I highly recommend."

Would definitely recommend staying here!
2021-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I go about once a year for a personal retreat. This year I chose Solomon's Island and was very happy with the location. Terri's place was clean and pleasant and exactly what I needed to get away to journal, plan and just enjoy solitude and silence.
Calvert Cliff Park is about 10 min away if you enjoy hiking and being in nature. It was nice being by the water and seeing boats.

I savored my experience & highly recommend Terri & Island Breeze.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I was looking for a quiet place on the water to celebrate my 60th birthday with family away from the busy Memorial Day crowds at the beach. Rachel‚Äòs home was perfect, spacious, clean, and comfortable for our adult family of four. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. We spent hours on the pier relaxing, reading, and taking in the spectacular views of the water. Made great use of the kayaks that we really appreciated having at the house. We also enjoyed biking on the Three Notch Trail, and had a great dinner at the Front Porch restaurant. Rachel was a wonderful host, very responsive and friendly. Would definitely recommend this property."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place on the Potomac River. Easy to access the beach front. This is my second stay and will be returning in the fall. Sunsets are beautiful, love the sound of the waves and sitting on the pier."

Everything is listed and accurate and even better in person. Rachel was a wonderful host, and we are already booking our next trip back!"
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a beautiful place to relax! The cottage is much bigger than I imagined it from the photos ‚Äî a lovely surprise ‚Äî and it had all the right mix of cozy and upscale. The kitchen is expansively furnished with appliances, glassware, cooking supplies, and this might be the first time I ever stayed in an AirBNB with more compostable coffee pods than i actually needed.
The deck and dock are simple but stunning. You.just can‚Äôt beat the sunsets.
Looking forward to returning. Thanks, Rachel!"
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay. The cottage was very spacious and having the private beach and dock access just a few steps away was amazing. Definitely recommended.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Rachel was a proactive and friendly host! Their home is absolutely beautiful and peaceful. Though we stayed during a costal flood warning, the amenities and natural beauty of this home made it enjoyable. Very private but close to plenty of restaurants and shops (roughly 20 minutes away). Lastly, this rental is FULLY STOCKED! From books to basics, everything was carefully designed."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Great stay! Wonderful views, dock, and beach. Very kid friendly space and materials-- games, books, and toys. We had a relaxing and awesome time."
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We really enjoyed our stay. Nice place with everything needed to be comfortable. The view and the water setting was the real draw to this place. No disappointments there!
Would certainly recommend to family and friends."
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"It was a very relaxing stay. While the weather did not cooperate and spent most of the time inside, we had a good time. We also drove around Chesapeake Bay. The house was very spacious and very clean. Thank you for letting us stay at your place, Rachel."
2023-09-01,5.0,Group trip,Everything you could possibly need is supplied. Very nice house!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We can‚Äôt wait to go back! Wonderful quiet and picturesque place in which we were happy to just stay and enjoy. There is stuff to do in town but‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt feel the need to ever leave! Lots of amenities for inside and outside: games, tv, fast internet, books and fire pit, grill, beach with umbrellas chairs and other supplies! Rachel even made a s‚Äômores starter kit welcome gift, just add firewood."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Stayed here with my family and enjoyed crabbing off the private pier and taking in the beautiful views! Rachel was responsive to all of my questions and her guidebook was very informative. Would stay here again!
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My fianc√©e and I had a great time at Rachel's home to celebrate our engagement! The home was a great weekend getaway for us, with wonderful access to the beach and dock out in the back yard! We had a wonderful time and hope to take another trip back!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,She is a great person to communicate with.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is our second year renting at Sunset View in the summer and it was amazing! The home has lots of space and the pier and view just can‚Äôt be beat. The hosts have really thought of almost everything and make it easy for you to just come with your luggage and make yourself at home. We used the beach toys, kayaks, chairs and umbrellas to enjoy the days. The grill and solo stove were great to use too! The home is perfect for families, friend vacations, or even a writing retreat! Leonardtown has a lot to offer in addition to the comforts of having major grocery stores, pharmacies, and other things in larger towns/cities. We enjoyed the Ruddy Duck, The Front Porch, Crab Knockers, Ye Olde Towne Cafe, and the bigger Salted Scoop. We can‚Äôt wait to return."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The cabin was exactly what we were looking for. A really comfortable space for our family and amazing views of the water. The beach and the dock were great for the kids. Definitely want to return!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house has everything that I can imagine about a beach house. It was a beautiful place and memory.
2023-08-01,5.0,Group trip,"If we could give 10 stars for this stay, we would! Host was easy to communicate with and thorough. The cottage was even more beautiful than the photos shared, and the views were studding. Interior was clean, organized, and cozy. Kitchen has everything we needed to cook our meals, and even offered everything necessary for a blue crab boil! I would highly recommend booking with Rachel."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay! House is beautiful. Had everything we needed and then some. Really appreciate the basics being included, like toilet paper, soap, paper towels. Kitchen was well stocked and had some spices, salt, pepper, etc. Beds were really comfortable! Extra blankets and pillows came in handy. Great game selection! We enjoyed the table on the covered porch to play cards when we needed a break from the sun. Bench on the dock was lovely. The shed was full of all the fun summer activities: 3 kayaks, 2 boogie boards, life vests, sand toys, beach chairs. We happily used them all. Rachel recommended long sleeve and pants rash guard swimwear and I‚Äôm so glad I purchased some for my daughter. There are definitely jellies in the water, though the amount changes day to day, and she was able to enjoy herself and have fun. It was also nice to have a second beach to use just a short 5 minute walk away.
Highly recommend!"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was such a well appointed home! From the cozy bedrooms to the fully loaded playroom, we felt right at home. We used the dock for crabbing, the firepit for s‚Äômores, the kayaks and boogey boards, and the provided games.
Rachel was an excellent host, answering our questions immediately. She always went above and beyond!
The private dock and beach were perfect and they had everything we needed for a relaxing day at the beach.
The jellyfish (a local seasonal issue, I believe) kept us out of the water a good bit, but we found plenty to do other than just swimming.
Some of our favorite local highlights- Solomons Island, the Ruddy Duck, and Slice House. We also day tripped to DC."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Lovely, peaceful place on the water. Amazing views outside, thoughtfully decorated inside. We had 4 adults with 2 teens and it was a perfect week!
If you‚Äôre planning to swim, be aware that you will see some jellyfish in the warm months ‚Äî we took Rachel‚Äôs advice and brought some long sleeves & pants so that we could jump off the dock worry-free.
Had a great time ‚Äî would definitely return!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"We had a relaxing and fun time together as a family! We fished off the pier, kayaked, enjoyed reading with our toes in the sand and water, hiked at St. Mary‚Äôs state park, made a few visits to the quaint little Leonardtown to visit the local shops (especially the Social and the Salted Scoop) and to Solomon‚Äôs Island to have some seafood!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I highly highly recommend this beautiful beach house to anyone visiting the Leonardtown area. The house was spotless, well-stocked, organized, and really spacious. The deck, private beach, and backyard seating were also fabulous! My family and I spent a lot of time there enjoying the peaceful views. Rachel is also a really wonderful host; very responsive, helpful, and made great recommendations for local restaurants. It‚Äôs an excellent location for a quiet vacation."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our small family had a wonderful, restful time away from home at Rachel's home. The kids (8 and 10) loved doodling on the pier and the adults enjoyed the bench on the end of it. The summer sounds of the cicadas and katydids at night were great to listen to after dark. The second story bedrooms were bright and uncluttered and very inviting. The kitchen was well-stocked and had everything one could want. We would recommend this rental wholeheartedly!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Group trip,Peaceful and release. Great location for a weekend getaway.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a great stay at Rachel‚Äôs beach home! It was our first getaway with our newborn, and the house was perfect. We had a nice/peaceful time on the beach. Leonardtown has plenty of cute/delicious restaurants and a nice walking path around the wharf. The house was clean and spacious; perfect for a family vacation. The host, Rachel, was extremely responsive and accommodating. One last thing - the bed and pillows in the primary were extremely comfortable. It‚Äôs not very often I get good rest at an air bnb."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a blast! We stayed during the fourth of July, and the neighbors set off a huge fireworks display! It was amazing!
Jelly fish did end up showing up, but it was expected with all the storms we had. Regardless, that didn't take away from all the fun we had playing cornhole and kayaking and crabbing. I would love to come back again in the future!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Our family of six had a wonderful time at the waterfront cottage. With kids ranging from 7 yrs to 6 months we loved how easy and amenity filled the rental was and our kids enjoyed every square inch of the house and neighborhood. From the backyard pier and beach to the board games and books we had so much fun around the home. We saw a bald eagle, cranes, watched an epic thunder storm roll in and even saw a dolphin from the back deck. The high chair, crib and sound machine were awesome to have since it meant one less thing we had to pack and all the smart TVs were super easy to navigate with perfect wifi for the couple hours work we had to knock out while we were there. We were also very pleasantly surprised with the area. Knowing nothing about Leonardtown we had so much fun exploring all the various activities within a 20-30 minute radius including the Calvert Marine Museum, Historic St. Mary‚Äôs, Piney Point Lighthouse and so many lovely restaurants and shops. Thank you Rachel!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We didn‚Äôt have the best weather but the house was equipped with everything we needed to continue the fun inside. Wonderful stay for parents and the kids. Great get away!!
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our second stay and it was better than last year. This year we brought fishing gear and fished and (attempted) to catch blue crab. We spent everyday outside. Our toddler enjoyed the freedom of running around the yard, watching bumble bees, birds, rabbits and the neighborhood chicken. We loved our stay and highly recommend it for families with young kids."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Thank you Rachel for sharing your beachside home. It's a perfect casual spot for quiet family gatherings and enjoying beach activities. There was a lot of space inside for us to enjoy with our daughter's family. They had the upstairs bedrooms and we had the privacy of the downstairs bedroom. The large TV was a hit with our teenage grandson as were the kayaks. The sandy beach was perfect for sand play and relaxing with the beautiful vista.
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Such a lovely spot and a very kind and responsive host! We loved reading on the pier, eating dinner outside and swimming. Thank you for a great stay!"

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"My family spent a very lovely weekend at the Sunset View Cottage. We thoroughly enjoyed the waterfront property. The house was well-equipped for young kids - our kids had a blast with the toys and books provided in the family room, as well as the beach toys. The kitchen is well-stocked with pots, pans and utensils - we made a few nice meals. The beds were comfortable and the rooms spacious. Rachel was very responsive and accommodating. She provided clear and helpful information about the property and nearby eateries. I would highly recommend this property."

2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This was our first ever Airbnb, and the experience was easy and stress-free. The house was lovely in a quiet neighborhood. Our kids had a blast having their own beach right outside. Thanks Rachel, you will definitely see us again!"
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Overall everything was great. The only thing that we missed was a dishwasher. Probably the fault of Airbnb: it was not listed in amenities with strikethrough. The games available for kids was really good. Did not find that anything else was missing in the kitchen; we brought things from home that were not necessary.
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful location, and everything was just like in the description. Highly recommended. Would stay here again!"
2022-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful home, wonderful location! The house was perfect for our last minute getaway. Rachel gave us all the information we needed for our stay. So nice to watch the gorgeous sunset right from the dock. We made some great memories. Would love to come back!!"

Communication with Rachel was great and fast, and she provided all the details we needed for our stay in advance which was super helpful in my planning. The house and property was as described (very clean and lots of seating available both inside and outside for my group), and we had a great weekend of fishing and crabbing. It was definitely the relaxing and quiet vacation we needed to recharge from the city. Would definitely visit here again and recommend them as hosts!"

2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay here with our 18 month old.

We took advantage of the deck and beach front almost every day. We‚Äôre already looking forward to next year!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Rachel's home is wonderful for a family vacation!  Our family of five was really able to unwind and enjoy time together at this beautiful riverfront setting.  The house was super clean when we arrived, and it is easy to keep clean with wood flooring and no clutter.  The kitchen is very well stocked with everything we needed to prep some meals.  We loved the back deck, the beach, and the dock.  Highlights for us were the great crabbing from the dock and kayaking!  There are many fun touches for kids - a child-sized kayak, books, games, and a little table.  Rachel is terrific to communicate with - she was very helpful to us and answered our questions before our stay thoroughly and promptly.  We would absolutely love to return!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Beautiful cozy private cottage! We loved the house and the beach. It was a very relaxing stay.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We absolutely loved our stay at the Sunset View Cottage. The house was exactly as pictured and it was really lovely. You can tell that a lot of care went into the remodeling and decorating. This house is perfect for families or groups of friends to enjoy.

2022-06-01,5.0,Group trip,"Excellent communication from our host. The house was a wonderful location with great views. The house was perfectly suited for 6 adults, but we could tell it was well equipped for families and young children. Highly recommend for a weekend getaway with friends."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible! Rachel was available for communication through the whole stay, but we didn‚Äôt need to reach out because everything went seamlessly. Definitely check out all the recommendations for food, we loved the pizza and seafood place she recommended. The view of this place is gorgeous with unbelievable sunsets.

2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,"Mary was an Amazing Host and the space was comfortable while being away from home!! The location was a few minutes drive from restaurants, beaches, and attractions, while still feeling quietly placed. There is a wonderful park a couple of miles up the road and the area was an Amazing retreat!!! Mary helped by sending clear instructions on how to find her space and how to access it before I had left to get there and answered questions quickly and professionally!! Thank You for being an Amazing Host Mary!!!"
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"My stay at Mary's was uneventful and pleasant. It was certainly a break from the urban chaos that I am currently living among. The apartment had full amenities -- kitchen, bathroom, queen bed and ample lighting. What it did not have was an automatic heating system. My first night there the temperatures inside dropped into the low 60 degree F. region and woke me up. I proceeded to plug in a small electric space heater that had been left in the kitchen which provided a symphony of fan noise as I went back to bed. As I was attending an event in the early morning hours I was glad to wake up again to a warmer space as I rushed to prepare for my outing. The apartment is well situated and allows easy access to the main road leading both north and south.. It is located amidst a single family residential development and has a beach town ambiance. The apartment also did not have a bathroom exhaust fan and so seemed a trifle musty due to the proximity of the Chesapeake Bay."
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very quiet area. It‚Äôs by the fire station so you can hear sirens every now and then but that didn‚Äôt bother us. Affordable and has everything you need for a stay.
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed about a week,"Super CLEAN!! Comfortable for a short stay. Coffee maker and coffee, plus toaster. A kettle for boiling water would have been nice. Even though there's a full-size refrigerator and refurbished range, don't plan on doing much cooking with the few pots, single pan, and lack of other necessities like hot pads. Everything seemed to be done/acquired as cheaply as possible."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Marys place was so nice and peaceful. Exactly what I needed while traveling for work. Mary was so kind!

2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful space for someone traveling alone or a couple. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom, great kitchen, and very quiet."
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"The lodging was quiet and comfortable, particularly the bed. The air conditioning worked well, which was needed since the heat index outside was in the 80s (nighttime) and 90s (daytime). The Airbnb was as advertised. The apartment is situated in a residential neighborhood, and the location can be a challenge to locate (especially at night) without GPS. The nearest restaurants and grocery stores are about two miles away."

2022-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"One of the best places I've stayed in the area! Clean and comfortable. The ONLY issue I had, which is probably a non-issue for most, is not having curtains on the entrance door window or bathroom window. I have a light sensitivity due to a medical condition and the entrance door despite having these cool blinds built right inside of the window, let's in a lot of the neighboring porch and holiday decor light at night. Mary is absolutely wonderful. She gives thorough, easy instructions for check-in/check-out, and made me feel comfortable about contacting her if the need arose. I have another stay booked at her place in a few weeks!"
2022-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Mary is wonderful to work with. The place is perfect!

The host was very professional and quick to respond to any questions, etc. The check-in was easy, and the bed was comfortable. A hotel room at the same price point cannot compete with Mary‚Äôs place. That‚Äôs my story and I‚Äôm sticking to it. If you want more bang for your buck without sacrificing quality, then look no further. What more can I say? There are hosts. Then there are Superhosts. Mary is a Superhost. My wife (she‚Äôs not easy to please, lol) and I would definitely stay again."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a wonderful place to stay. Bed was very comfortable, the kitchen was well equipped and Mary is a fantastic hostess. Great stay and well worth the money."

Nice place and had great communication from Mary. Thank you!"
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Very clean and neat. The bed was comfy. There was much appreciated coffee, water and ice available. Only drawback was no USB ports so I had to run out and buy the cube thing to plug my chargers into the wall outlet.
I would definitely recommend this place or stay again if I‚Äôm in the area."
2022-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,The place was great! A nice get away!
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Mary‚Äôs place was exactly as described - clean, comfortable, and close to the bay but not walking distance.

Heads up: most of the beaches around there are private for residents only, but there are a couple of public beaches that are awesome. Flag Pond Park was our favorite."
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is such a cute and very clean studio apartment. This is the second airbnb of Mary's that my husband and I have stayed at and we have had great experiences with both. We were a little unsure about the apartment experience but it was great. Very quiet, nice neighborhood, and check in is so easy. Mary adds many homey touches too!"
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great value. Very quite and lots of nature to explore without leaving the neighborhood. I really enjoyed the near by Beaches and Lakes. Also very close to Solomons island. The food in the area wasn‚Äôt the best so it‚Äôs not the best destination if you like eating out a lot when you travel. Overall I can wait to go back :)?
2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,cute and comfy stay for a weekend getaway.

2022-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I recently stayed at the Morning Light Apartment while completing a sailing course in Solomons. It was less than a fifteen minute drive to the sailing school. Being able to park in the driveway and having a door directly into the apartment were both appreciated. The apartment was clean and met all my needs. Communications from Mary both before and during my stay were helpful.

2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and son recently had the pleasure of staying at a charming little cottage that had everything they could possibly need for swimming at St. Mary's College State competition weekend. From the moment they arrived, they felt right at home. The cottage was cozy and well-maintained, with a comfortable bed, plenty of storage space, and a fully equipped kitchen where they could prepare their meals which is important during competition.
One of the things they loved most about this cottage was all the little extras that were included. They really had a great time and definitely enjoyed their stay."

Tammy & her husband are there in the immediate area every weekend to do whatever might need to be done. If I text/call her about something she always responds in a timely manner. The cottage is completely equipped with everything a guest might need to be comfortable. The location is just perfect for us. All of our immediate family live in the area. Either just north our south of the cottage. Another BIG plus. The cottage is only several miles away from grocery stores, work out centers, movie theaters, great restaurants, and churches. We wish we lived closer to utilize the cottage more during the year."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great find! Absolutely worth the price. Everything was spotless, and communications were clear and prompt. The only thing to be aware of is, yes, it's literally around the corner from the boat slips etc so there is the occasional horn sounding etc. I'll take that over a hotel any day!It's a great location, tucked back in a little neighborhood next to the water, it's still right near the middle of town. Short drive, easy access to shops on one side, or go over the bridge for scenic restaurants on the waterfront!"

The cottage is close to both of these places. We will definitely be back!"

2023-04-01,4.0,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay at the Cozy Cottage. Tammy was a great host and very responsive to my pre-visit questions. The place was nice and clean and well stocked with anything you might need for cooking although we didn‚Äôt do a lot of cooking since we were only there for a few days. Convenient location right over the bridge from Solomon‚Äôs and lots to explore in the area with a 6 year old. Wish we could have stayed a little longer. The only quibbles we had was the mattress in the front bedroom was a little soft for our tastes but the one in the back bedroom was good. Also I‚Äôm sensitive to smells/perfumes and there was a plug in air freshener that was a little over powering for me. We unplugged it while we were there and opened up the windows to get some fresh air and that worked. The water, being by the coast, does have a sulfur smell as other reviewers noted but Tamm left 4 bottled waters in the fridge. If you put ice cubes in it, was fine and even my picky 6 yr old didn‚Äôt notice."
2023-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect in every way! Everything you need is here! Comfortable, modern, great amenities. I have every intention of returning!"

I cannot, because it was literally EXACTLY what someone who is a self-professed type ‚ÄúA‚Äù, OCD individual needed. C-O-Z-Y, C-L-E-A-N & C-O-M-F-O-R-T-A-B-L-E‚ÄºÔ∏è This cottage was immaculate, one of the cleanest places I‚Äôve stayed, this includes 5 star hotels! Tammy is very attentive and friendly. I was able to meal prep, wash and dry laundry, all while watching flashback reality shows on the Roku tv. The cottage is in close proximity to everything, no detail was spared in the remodel of this cottage. I walked the neighborhood and enjoyed the views and sunsets.

The cottage was super clean and had all of the utensils/extras one might need. The beds and couch were very soft (since people have different preferences for firm vs. soft mattresses/couches, I'm just noting this in case it helps.)

2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I really got the peaceful weekend we were hoping for! Tammy was very communicative and helpful. The neighborhood is quiet and the house itself is more spacious than it looks in the pictures. Cozy, but not cramped by any means. It was nice and clean and the bed was really comfy. I would recommend bringing your own drinking water. The tap water is really sulfurous, which I'm sure is typical for the area.
The location was really convenient. Driving one direction about 5 minutes gets you to a bunch of stores and restaurants, and 10 minutes the other direction gets you to Solomon's Island. We enjoyed a nice hike along the river at Myrtle Point Park, also about 5 minutes away. Calvert Cliffs is a really nice but longer hike, and that's only like 20 minutes away. The whole area is really beautiful and close to the water."
2022-01-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"It is such a neat place. We also found all the things that we needed (towels, utensils, soap, toaster, garbage, laundry) handy. Close to the bridge which was a plus.

2021-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I had family visiting and got this AirBnB for them. They loved the location and its proximity to Solomon's island (just across the bridge). There was plenty of driveway space for our 3 vehicles. Check-in was smooth, and the host was great with communicating. One minor complaint is that the tap water tasted slightly of sulfur; otherwise, everything was perfect. I would recommend staying here."

Additionally, Tammy keeps the cottage in pristine condition! Tammy is wonderful at communicating if she and her husband will stop by and mow the lawn, if regular maintenance will be occurring during your stay, and about any other items that pop up. The cottage boasts high-powered WIFI and a smart TV to access all of your favorite TV shows and movies. As a student, I experienced no problem using zoom or taking virtual tests for prolonged periods of time with the cottage WIFI. If you are planning a longer stay, the neighbors are very kind and welcoming (one even warning me during the gas shortage where to go and get gas!). This cottage is amazing for the single traveler and small group alike. I definitely intend to visit again and highly recommend this cottage for your travels."

The hosts, Roxanne and Egon, are so warm and gracious, they were the icing on the cake for my stay. I felt right at home.

Access to laundry and a simple kitchen was very handy, and the little backyard was so pleasant! Highly recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"Roxanne and Egon are the most gracious hosts that I have had the pleasure to stay at. Their unit is completely self contained and private, with private access, amenities and conveniences of a fully furnished apartment. Their home is close to most conveniences and beaches in the area. The hospitality and warmth is quite phenomenal and I had the experience and joy of staying at a home away from home while I was visiting. The fishpond, and outdoor porch is quite peaceful and very nice. The hosts took me to watch fire works with them, invited them to the concerts in the area and also provided a wealth of information about the St. Mary's area in general and the myriad set of activities to do while staying.
Overall, it was a delightful stay and I am definitely coming back to enjoy Roxanne and Egon's hospitality."

It was a great house for me because the space was spacious and clean and had everything I needed.
There is a beautifully decorated garden, pond and many trees, so you feel like you are in the forest.
I stayed for two months and enjoyed walking around the neighborhood every morning. It's quiet and so peaceful.
The location is also good with restaurants, grocery stores and shopping malls close by.
Above all, the hosts Roxanna and Egon are really kind, gentle and respectful.
I truly felt like friends and family not host and guest.
They recommended delicious restaurants, local festivals, and places to visit, and I was able to make special and good memories thanks to them.
I hope to visit again.

The area in the back was a beautiful, serene pond and garden/wooded area. It was lovely to sit by each day. That area attracted wildlife (birds, frogs, pond with fish) and it was wonderful. The apartment itself had everything you could possibly need for your stay. It was clean and spacious. There is nothing they missed or forgotten to provide. Despite not having a full formal kitchen, there is a small portable stovetop and connection toaster oven. The bathroom and bedroom have everything you need and extras + more. Great place! Totally recommend for any of your needs if you are in the area."

2021-05-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,"The place looks so much nicer than the pictures. They provided us with everything in regards to amenities. They thought of everything, we didn't even need to contact them during our two weeks because everything we needed was in the apartment. This made it easier for us to focus on work and vacation. The beds and recliners were extra comfortable. The sauna was a huge bonus. Overall it was a little oasis for our work retreat and we would love to come back again.

Once inside, you'll easily see there are many things that will make for a pleasant stay. If you are into taking a real sauna, there is one of those, too!"
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had an amazing stay!
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,Great location and price. Definitely recommend if you need a quiet place in Lexington Park.
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This is a fantastic relaxing setting with quality amenities. The hosts are kind and considerate, and respond quickly to communication."
2020-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful space with very kind hosts! would fully recommend.
2020-09-01,5.0,Stayed over a week,Such a wonderful place. The owners are great people with genuine interest in visitors. They go above and beyond to make the experience wonderful and comfortable. The entire section is very private and one can even sit out on the patio and enjoy the little stream with fishpond. Their are many additional amenities that are available. I have stayed at several BnB's and this one was by far the best experience. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Second time I have stayed here and just like the first time, the stay was an excellent experience!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Roxanne‚Äôs Airbnb had everything I needed. Very spacious. I enjoyed talking with Roxanne and her husband.
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Nice, spacious and clean. Sauna was a bonus!!!"
2020-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful place to stay. I felt very welcomed and she went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. I will definitely try to stay there again and again.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great spot and location. Decor simple and a clean look/feel. The fish pond and the trees makes for the perfect spot to relax and meditate. The sauna an added bonus for the price you will pay.
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,A super comfortable and homey place! We stayed here for a long weekend while my son competed at a swim meet at the nearby college. It was a great space for us - we each got a nice bed and space for ourselves and were close to the stores we needed. Very relaxing space with thoughtful touches - I even used the sauna one afternoon. It‚Äôs very clean. Roxanne and Egon are excellent hosts!
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space would have been a bargain at twice the price. For a comparatively small space it was incredibly well-appointed with pretty much anything you would need for even a fairly long stay (washer and dryer, mostly-full kitchen, full bathroom, private entrance, two large TVs, Netflix and Amazon Prime, a full bed and pull-out futon, dining table, living room area with recliners) without feeling the least bit crowded or cramped. Pretty much the only thing missing is a full stove, but with a large toaster oven and large induction hotplate you won't miss it unless you plan on cooking Thanksgiving dinner there. On top of all that, there's a lovely outdoor patio with a fish pond, and an actual sauna in the space itself (something I've never seen anywhere else!) There are also numerous accommodations for people with disabilities and mobility issues, which while we didn't need them ourselves spoke of great thoughtfulness and care on the part of the hosts.
Speaking of which, the hosts, Roxanne and Egon, live upstairs of the space and were gracious, attentive, and informative. They gave clear directions and came to greet us, gave us tips on things happening in the area and on getting around, but otherwise gave us our privacy with only the very occasional sound of movement from the floor above. There were numerous little touches that showed great care and attention to detail -- clear labels on the remotes to let you know which to use, a variety of charging cables if needed, a well-thought-out house manual, plus a special note and treats since we were there for Valentine's Day.
All together, even though we were only there for a single weekend, it was quite probably the best Airbnb experience we've had, and we really can't recommend it enough. We only wish we could have stayed longer."
2020-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful!! Such a cute space and extremely peaceful.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Very gracious host that did great job communicating. The room was exactly as advertised and fit our needs perfectly.
2020-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Everything was clean, and the place is beautiful. I have no complaints. I loved the privacy given, and appreciate my hosts.
I do have a word of advice for future guests:
Be aware of noise. The ceiling of your stay is paper thin with regard to noise, so keep that in mind for any plans you might have that go beyond the quiet hours."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,This basement apartment was a great fit for our needs. Roxanne & Egon welcomed us upon arrival and helpfully described how to use the lights / remotes in the space. Clean & easy. The backyard has a small waterfall and pond against the backdrop of trees. Enjoy!
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This space is the best deal for your money you could possibly get if you are looking to stay in the Lexington Park area.
The apartment is spacious, with a kitchen that includes everything you could want with the exception of a full oven: they provide a toaster, a toaster oven, and induction plate for cooking; ample dishware; and a large fridge and freezer with ample filtered cold water.
The bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is spacious and nice, and there is a large closet for storing excess items you might have.
Complimentary features include 2 TV's with Netflix and cable, and candy which is left in a bowl on the table. The internet was plenty fast for my purposes, which include the occasional online gaming.
The hosts themselves were very hospitable. I had dinner with them one of the nights I stayed there, and another night they let me use their oven to heat up a frozen pizza. They are also intelligent and cultured people, who I found relatively interesting to be around and talk to.
The house and yard beyond the apartment are beautiful, well-maintained, and peaceful."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Roxanne does a wonderful job, she is welcoming, the place is very clean and it's in a quiet location. I would stay here again."
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great location near the Solomon Islands. This home provides a nice relaxing environment to unwind. They have a sauna and nice amenities.
2019-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Host(s) cared that I was able to relax and enjoy my stay. They care for the apartment which is well above average in amenities, I will definitely return."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Great private space, close to NAS, very convenient. Will definitely stay again if possible."
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I felt like home as soon as I arrived . They have not left a thing out and the home is literally in the woods and it‚Äôs is a beautiful local to wake up to . The host couldn‚Äôt get any nicer if they tried and I hated to leave because I wanted more time there .
Work obligations kept me busy .
They should call it Shangri La as that‚Äôs how it felt to me !!!"
2019-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"chose Roxanne's place for its location. we spent the long weekend in the Lexington Park/Solomons Island area to check out the bike trails. nicely situated place, very peaceful and calm. being from baltimore city, we are so used to taking precautions for safety and keeping our biking gear on heavy lock down, but the entire time we were at Roxanne's we felt completely at ease and safe.
the basement is spacious and very clean, we were comfortable enough to spread out. we made dinner, watched tv and basically has a great time being away from the urban life for a few days.
would definitely return."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place, very clean. The patio is a nice place to sit and enjoy the birds and other wildlife."
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great hosts! Accommodations were very clean and it was so peaceful. Everything we needed was right there.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Always a great time when I come here.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed about a week,We loved our stay and wish we could have spent more time enjoying the garden pond out back. Roxanne and her husband were very friendly and accommodating. We enjoyed meeting them and they gave us great advice on the area. The AirBnB was very clean and had everything you would need if you accidentally forget anything or choose to make an at home meal in their supplied kitchen. We would definitely recommend them.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Really enjoyed our stay here! Perfect spot for a quiet get away that is still close to shops and sightseeing. The apartment had everything you could need and was perfectly clean. Hosts were welcoming and offered great restaurant suggestions. This place is a gem! And quite a bargain for all it offers.
2019-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Terrific space and amenities for a multiple night stay. Cozy and clean. Very hospitable hosts. Much more comfortable than having been in a hotel room. We look forward to staying again in the future.
2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,Great space for singles or couples who want an apartment to spread out in.
2019-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Spacious, clean, well designed and a great value. this is a nice quiet house in a safe community with thoughtful hosts."

2019-07-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"A cozy, quiet space that is easy to live in for two people. Great amenities. Very gracious hosts"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joanne‚Äôs property was really beautiful and super cute, perfect for our family. It‚Äôs the right amount of space for a stay, and super comfortable. Loved the back yard on the water. 10/10. Definitely would stay again."
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"This place was a dream perfect for our little family. We spent everyday in the backyard enjoying the water views and fishing on the pier.
You‚Äôre just mins from stores and restaurants and the home is on the most peaceful street so you get the best of everything.
Not only that but Joanne & Bob are the kindest and most gracious hosts.
This will be our home away from home when we come to town to visit friends and family.
Thank you for an amazing stay!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, relaxing house and property! Only a two night stay but it was so relaxing. Weather wasn‚Äôt the best but I Loved sitting in the living room and looking out to the river. Our second day we were able to be outside!
Bed was comfy! Shower was great. House was very comfortable for us.
Everything you might need was available for use: salt pepper spices, bottled water, Saran Wrap, baggies, aluminum foil, soap, paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags, etc. anything you might need. Very well stocked.
Joann and Bob kept in touch and were available for any questions we may have had. There is an information booklet with info you might need for your stay regarding the house and local information.
Looking forward to staying in this lovely home again . . . Soon!
Thank you Joann and Bob!"
2024-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a lovely stay at Joanne‚Äôs. The little cottage is gorgeous with lots of attention to detail. One of the best beds I‚Äôve slept in too from an Airbnb. So peaceful and hope to return.
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed our stay! Our 17 month old daughter loved watching the boats and being by the water. We enjoyed the peace and quiet and meals out back watching the river. Thanks Bob and Joanne!
2024-04-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"A beautiful house in a beautiful location. It was peaceful and relaxing with all the amenities to help you feel right at home. The view alone is worth the trip, but the inside was just as nice."
2024-04-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"Enjoyed our stay at this cute airbnb which the pictures accurately reflected. Beautiful waterfront view and nice, quiet neighborhood. Hosts were very responsive and provided all the amenities needed. Wish there had been a more comfortable workspace. The wicker chair and small table were not the best for working remotely all week. Maybe would have been ok if it was just a day or two. Even though the backyard is private, window coverings on all the bedroom windows also would have been nice. The host did let me know after that they have shades on order. Another item to note that I don't believe was in the description is that it is on well water. Not an issue as they provided plenty of bottled water."
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We loved our stay. Beautifully decorated and gorgeous views. Would definitely book this property again.
2024-03-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Cozy, quiet, relaxing and beautiful view of the Patuxent River. Great hosts! Was in the area for work and this home was so much better than a hotel room."

2024-02-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joanne and Bob are fantastic hosts! The home was perfect for the week, will likely return! Thank you both"
2024-01-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Great place on the water. Relaxing and inviting.. nice area.. definitely recommend
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"This home worked perfectly for us. You're met with a charmingly decorated home with spectacular water views. The added bonus of a decorated Christmas tree was lovely. It was well-appointed, easy to find, and you're given clear and comprehensive directions/instructions when you arrive. Kitchen appliances were nice and worked well. Cleanliness is my only slight markdown, with the microwave having missed a wipe-down, the prevalence of dust bunnies under the elevated bed, and a sad dried-up house plant with shed leaves on the floor, but these are small nits and in no way took away from the charm of the stay. We wouldn't hesitate to return."
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôve stayed twice at this location given how lovely the area is and how well the hosts provide everything you could need. Perfect little get away right on the water.
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Loved the Decorations!
2023-12-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"I could not have liked this place more- one of the best Airbnb experiences I‚Äôve had. Good location, scenic water view, very well-stocked. I would definitely stay here again."
2023-11-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This was such a cute home to stay in. The house is more beautiful than the photos can show! I'd love to come back and stay again. It was everything I was looking for. I loved all the little touches like a Christmas tree and soothing lights added. I have absolutely no complaints üëå
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"WOW !!! Talk about the perfect name to describe what you will be getting. This place was a gem. If you need to recharge while appreciating the true beauty of this area while watching the bald eagles, the watermen working their trade as you relax in true comfort... you found it"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Immaculate spacious cottage with beautiful views conveniently located to Solomon‚Äôs Island, Pax River NAS, and Leonardtown. Beautifully renovated and equipped with thoughtful amenities. The sofa and the king size bed were super comfortable. The hosts were very responsive. I highly recommend!"
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,The home was absolutely gorgeous and more beautiful than pictured! Very peaceful and clean. The view of the water from the rooms was gorgeous!
2023-10-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a lovely experience. Home is even more beautiful than the pictures. Peaceful and a perfect weekend getaway. We will definitely return in the future.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! Everything was so clean and neat and decorated so well. Fantastic water views. We definitely will be back.
2023-09-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Magnificent water views. The whole house looks out at the water! Comfortable everything. Furniture, decor, bedding. Kitchen is well appointed with new appliances. Extra touches from the hosts were greatly appreciated. You truly are super hosts.
If our travels allow, we will be back again! Thanks again for a great stay."
2023-09-01,4.0,Stayed a few nights,"The house itself was tucked in a nice quiet neighborhood. Easy to find and no issues with the neighbors. View was wonderful. The house itself was small but nicely updated. The bed itself however wasn‚Äôt great. The mattress sinks in the middle so bad that it makes it very hard to get out of. The communication with the host was pretty much non existent- besides check in info. I messaged the host later on about a propane invoice being dropped off on the door and where they would like me to leave it, and to ask about where to put trash and my message was read but never responded too. There we‚Äôre absolutely no check out instructions to follow on what to do with used towels or bed linens. The grass outside also was up to our ankles and would of been nice if it was mowed to help with tracking in grass and leaves etc."
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This is the perfect place for a romantic getaway and is only an hour drive from DC. My fianc√© and I felt like we were on vacation during the weekend here. We had a picnic looking out on the water in the mornings and sipped wine for the sunsets in the evenings. It was very close to Solomon Island where there are waterfront restaurants and bars. We also enjoyed hiking and the beach at Calvert Cliffs State Park which is close by. We had everything we needed (including a couple of small bottles of wine and snacks!) to have a relaxing time away. We hope to come back regularly!
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joanne and Bob‚Äôs place is one of the cutest AirBnB‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed in! It had more than the normal amenities. Very well stocked with everything you could think of! Including tons of fresh drinking water. The house was very well decorated and beautifully upgraded. Much prettier in person but the pictures are definitely an accurate representation. Joanne and Bob were extremely helpful and responsive. We had a wonderful, quiet girls‚Äô weekend relaxing at the home. We even got some professional photos taken on the property. Amazing sunset on the water! We‚Äôd love to stay again next time we‚Äôre in town visiting my best friend! üíï"
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Great place and stay. Beautiful view and very peaceful. Kids had great time fishing and crabbing from pier.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,This house was a pleasure to stay at. Bob and Joanne have a beautiful house with nicely decorative furnishings! I could watch the sunrise and sunset all the time there! We enjoyed watching a pre season football game on the huge tv screen. Very cozy.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Would love to stay again someday when we are in the area.
2023-08-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Joanne and Bob‚Äôs place was wonderful! The view is incredible and provides the perfect space to relax and unwind!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,"Joanne and Bob have an awesome place tucked away right by the water. My wife and I got in later than expected but that was no problem. The next morning I got up and sat on the dock to watch sunrise then took a quick dip before it got too hot. The backyard is the perfect cozy relaxation zone. Even when the heat got going a steady breeze coming off the water made every day just about perfect.
Inside the space is just as nice. Large TVs in the common area and bedroom, clean kitchen and bathroom, and Large windows to let natural light in. No Complaints here!
Joanne and Bob mentioned there were two bikes on the site so we took a quick ride one afternoon to get a little exercise. This was just what the doctor ordered for us as a summertime getaway!
Do yourself a favor and book it!"
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Made for the perfect place to get away for a long weekend. Beautiful views and great little downtown with excellent restaurants and shops. Would recommend to any couple looking to get away & relax!!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Possibly the best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in. The place looks just like the pictures! The place was clean and very cozy with great views. Really nothing else we could ask for!
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,We had a great stay at Joanne and Bob's home. It was a beautiful space with an amazing view. They were great hosts - responsive and hospitable.
2023-07-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful private, quiet location on the water. Daughter love crabbing off the dock. Close to the restaurants in the area. Beautiful sunsets lovely backyard with shade. Definitely recommend."
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,"Joanne and Bob were very responsive, helpful and kind hosts. We loved the house! It was perfect for my family of three! Loved the view, the comfort and all of the added amenities. If you like crabs, you can catch crabs and fish right from the pier! That was an added perk that was not noted but we were very excited about. I was here for work so we didn‚Äôt spend much time here during the day but it was certainly the peaceful spot I had hoped for before and after work. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to everyone!"
2023-06-01,5.0,Stayed with kids,Excellent retreat in Southern Maryland!
2023-05-01,5.0,Stayed a few nights,Me and my wife stayed here for the holiday weekend and really enjoyed our stay. We have stayed at many Airbnb locations and this is easily one of our favorites. Joanne was the perfect host. We will booking again soon.
,,,"After leaving, got a frantic call from the husband. In a very unproffessional manor, demanded a payment of $90 to clean bacon grease left behind on the stove. He said that was not included in the $85 cleaning fee! What?
He also demanded $300 for a replacement comforter in bedroom. He claims we left blood drops. All three of us sayed there are in our 60's. We have no Knoledge of stains on the comforter. He keep repeating ""Would i come to your house and do that""! Hearing my conversation, my brother spoke with this scammer and ended up giving him his credit card, I never would have. Very Dissapointing ending to a wonderful family get togather. It's a shame! Enjoy yor Stolen money!"
