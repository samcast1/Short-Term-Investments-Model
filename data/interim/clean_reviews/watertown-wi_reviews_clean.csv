2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,"It is a great house and the owner made us feel very welcome. She lives on the property but that didn't feel like an invasion of our privacy in any way. On the contrary, she was the best neighbor you can imagine."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay! The house is beautiful and super comfortable. We especially loved sitting on the front porch to enjoy the sunsets. Thank you Kathy for making us feel so at home and welcoming us with such a lovely and generous gift basket and note. It was one of my best airbnb experiences to date. Can't recc enough!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had a great, relaxing stay at the Inn. It was very clean and cozy. Loved the kitchen, even baked cookies, but ate most meals out at local restaurants. There were plenty of good places to eat and shop in Watertown. The bed was very comfortable.
The host was very responsive and helped with local recommendations. I highly recommend the Inn to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very cozy. A perfect place to rest and relax.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Host was very accommodative when we let Kathy know we would be arriving late. The house is well stocked with everything needed and we were greeted with a nice welcome basket, wine and cheese. Not expected but very kind."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place to stay, very clean and comfortable."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amaizng host. Only best words and true american experience outside the city. Perfect getaway place. Again best experience with the Host, thank You!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Kathy was an exceptional host!!!! We had the best time at her ‚ÄòInn‚Äô and will definitely stay there on our next trip to Watertown. Kathy was extremely responsive and provided lots of little extras that made us feel right at home the minute we walked in the door. She even shared some of the fresh vegetables and fruit from her garden - and it was so good!! We had 6 women in our group and never felt crowded in the house at all - there was plenty of room for us to visit, cook and relax. I can‚Äôt say enough about how much we loved her house, her personal touches and her hospitality. Thank you so much Kathy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,"What a beautiful home on the countryside! Kathleen was a fantastic host and available for any questions we had, making sure our stay was top notch. The house is just a walk away from the Bennett Barn making it a great place to stay following a wedding."
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,Great host! Lovely home! I‚Äôm completely satisfied with my stay :)
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed in lots of Airbnbs over the years, and this is one of the nicest. Our host was incredibly thoughtful and friendly, and the house itself was simply gorgeous‚Äîso well appointed with everything you could possibly need and beautifully decorated. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. A delight!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Super clean and comfortable! We loved all the extra amenities, too."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house was so great for our family gathering and Kathleen was so welcoming. I highly recommend this for anyone with kids. The garden and swing set were a huge hit and I could live on that porch forever.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such a good experience for my husband, me, and some nieces that we were picking up from college nearby. We loved our two-day stay there and hope to visit again! The inside of the house is absolutely charming and homey, and the quiet area around made it nice for relaxing walks outside. Kathy was a kind and hospitable hostess, but not overbearing. She was flexible when we ran into some schedule changes and made us feel completely welcome. We've already recommended this place to others! Thank you for making our get-away a very pleasant experience."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathleen left us a basket of goodies and a sweet, handwritten note of welcome. She was quick to respond to texts but we had few questions since the instructions we got ahead of time made check in and check out a breeze.
3 comfortable bedrooms (4 beds), a wrap-around porch with a beautiful view, 2 nice sized bathrooms that were squeaky clean and stocked, and a huge kitchen were the highlights for me. Finding out that Kathleen is a retired special ed teacher (and I'm just entering the field) was wonderful and we had a nice talk on her porch. She's so personable! And she is available to chat OR give you total privacy.
We were in town for an event in Watertown (a play at the college) which was an easy 10 minute drive. Not far from. 94 but feels like you're in the country... A very nice retreat. Thanks to Kathleen for making this place available to travelers like us!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay, friendly/responsive host, peaceful setting, perfect for our family. We will definitely stay again next time we're in town."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at Kathy's home. Everything was home-y, cozy, and well stocked. Loved to have the fireplace in the winter. Bedrooms were comfortable and great big bathtub!
Kathy was responsive for quick questions. We'd definitely come again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,charming old farmhouse with lots of character and treasures to discover. stayed with a baby and another couple for a wedding and it worked very well‚Äîhad everything we needed to be comfy.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy was so helpful and kind, there was everything in the house we could need. The house itself was amazing especially the porch. We wished we could have stayed longer."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great stay. Kathy was so kind, helpful and accessible. My family ate our supper on the wrap-around porch looking at the barn and corn fields. The weather was absolutely perfect, which may or may not be Kathy's doing. The beds are comfortable, the showers hot with good water pressure. The old house has the charm of the place I grew up with improvements that made it just a little nicer than ""the good old days."" I would love to stay here again sometime."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Incredible house, beautiful front porch that's perfect for morning coffee, and Kathy was super helpful during check-in. If I'm back in the area, I'd love to stay again!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The host for this property is generous, gracious and accommodating. This home is exceptional and provides comfort and beauty - perfect home away from home! Highly recommend!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Kathy, was an amazing host!! She made us feel so warm and welcome and the house was exactly as pictured. If I‚Äôm ever back in WI- I‚Äôll definitely be staying here again. üíõ"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The farmhouse was fantastic to stay! Super welcoming and had a WI gift basket for us. It was a great welcome back to the area and a fantastic, peaceful setting to see family. Highly recommend!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Private and peaceful stay. We loved the house and wrap around porch. The host was really thorough, answered every question, we had a welcome basket. We truly felt at home."
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"This is a delightful, rural home close to some small WI towns. It's handy for a couple of wedding venues, and not too far (about an hour) from Madison. Filled with reminders of Midwestern life, there is lots of comfortable furniture, plenty of extra linens, and an ambience that is purely small-town America in mid-1950. With that, though, comes reliable WiFi, flat screen TV's, and modern appliances. The owner is generous with her stocking of the kitchen for guests, and agreeable to occasional additions to the guest list."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Quiet and charming
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,This place is amazing - inside and out! Extremely spacious and clean. The porch and outdoor space is incredible. We look forward to staying here again in the near future!
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,"My husband, some of our wedding party and I stayed here during our wedding weekend and we had a wonderful stay! The house is right across the street from the wedding venue Bennett Barn and I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone getting married there! It was so handy to be so close to our venue and Kathy was an amazing host. She thought of everything we could have possibly needed and then some! She was also very understanding with checking in and out and some of the craziness that comes with weddings (people stopping by, lots of stuff, lots of running around, etc). We can‚Äôt say thank you enough!"
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,"10/10 place. very comfortable, cozy and well stocked kitchen. we will be back!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin is the perfect spot for a relaxing and peaceful retreat! I look forward to staying here again :)
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,Wonderful peaceful place by the lake. Cozy and beautiful. We enjoyed our stay and wished we could stay longer!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Gorgeous secluded house on a lake! Nicki was so generous to allow us to bring our pack of pups and they had the best time! The perfect, most relaxing weekend with family thanks to the sweetest host!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,this place is beautifull. we love the fishing and the beautifull scenery. the house is very confortable. my family made great memories. Nikki is an amazing host. any questions we had she was quick to answer. We hope to came back again. I highly recommend this beautifull place.
2024-06-01,5,Group trip,We loved being right on the water! The cabin was cozy and clean and our family of 9 loved it. We would stay there again.
2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"We had a great time at the cabin! The views are spectacular, the space is private, it really feels like you are getting away from everything. The cabin is very cozy, but yet spacious. We will definitely be coming back again!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nicki's cabin was a fantastic stay! It was definitely a great value and everything was as advertised. Check in and check out we're extremely easy and communication was good to make sure that all of our needs were met. The cabin was extremely clean and a fantastic place to relax. We would love to have another visit.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This relaxing retreat is exactly what my family needed. I wish I had scheduled more time off work and a longer stay. We laughed at how close we were to town, yet it felt a million miles away. You won‚Äôt regret booking this cozy cottage!"
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"The description matched what we experienced. My family & I went away on a Mini trip for the weekend I will say that if you‚Äôre looking for a cabin that can hold about 9 people this would be good but slightly tight. We got to watch the sunrise bright and early which was fantastic! Unfortunately, due to the weather we couldn‚Äôt experience the outdoors activities for the exception of a bon-fire which felt nice watching the scenery. Overall, it was a relaxing weekend for the family. Would recommend it."
2024-01-01,5,Group trip,"Nicki was very responsive and very understanding! We had a girls trip during a snowstorm here and it was really magical, perfect place to drink hot chocolate and catch up with the girls. Although, having ten girls and one bathroom may have not been too well thought out by us! Thank you for letting us stay here, we had a blast!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet place to enjoy, this is the spot"
2023-12-01,5,Group trip,We enjoyed our stay for Christmas. We did miss the Christmas tree she had in the cabin 2 years ago but loved the new electric fireplace. The cabin stay was as nice as the first time we had stayed there 2 years ago and we appreciated Nicki's flexibility in arrival and departing times and that pets are allowed. It was clean and the kitchen had about everything we needed. There was even coffee :) . It was a great stay at the cabin!
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was so peaceful and restful. The sunrises were amazing. We enjoyed our stay. It was lovely.
2023-11-01,3,Stayed with kids,Mouse dropping in the kitchen and cupboards. Sheets had big holes in them and lots of dead bugs under the beds
2023-11-01,3,Group trip,"Let me start off by saying that the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. It was a relaxing weekend and it was so peaceful. Now to the other stuff‚Ä¶the cabin was dusty and dirty. The sheets seemed to be dirty and the futon in the master bedroom had a sheet on it and it was DISGUSTING(luckily we did not have to use it). The master bedroom carpet had stains all over and it was overall dirty. You could see cobwebs through out the cabin and there were mice that got into some of our food that was on the kitchen counter üòû. The beds were decent. She did warn us of the neighbors and I‚Äôm not sure if it was them or not, but they were parked behind our vehicles because they were out hunting. The hunting is not an issue, the issue was how tight it was and it was hard to turn our vehicles around to get out as there is NO way to back up all the way out because it is a steep and bumpy drive down to the cabin. It is sad the price we paid for how dirty it was. They need to do some DEEP cleaning!!!"
2023-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Nicki's cabin is a really nice place to stay with friends or family for a getaway. The cabin was nicely furnished with furniture, cooking gear, and a grill. Overall we had a good time, and the place was comfortable, but there were a few small issues with running out of gas and blankets. The sleeping situation is tight but cozy if you have 9-10 people. The bathroom is spacious and comfortable."
2023-10-01,3,Stayed with kids,"I just felt like there was no refresh to the house before we stayed there. There was alot of dead and living bugs. Lots of cobwebs like nobody's dusted for a while. Ive stayed in tropical places and I didn't even see as many bugs as they had here. I can definitely see a couple but you name the bug it was there. .And when we came in, they had plug in air fresheners everywhere. They were so strong they made me feel sick. Cleanliness is the most important thing when I stay at a air bnb."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Perfect location on the water for a weekend get away
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This cabin is so cute and gives a nice view and access to the water. We loved having our vow renewal there with our closet family. Would recommend and we plan to return again! (:
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very beautiful and private, lake property! This is a great place to unplug and enjoy nature. The grill was pretty rusty on the inside but some aluminum foil helped. Nicki kept us well informed. This was the start of our Annual Cabin Friend Trip! Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Hidden treasure on a lake of its own.
2023-08-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nicki was a responsive and friendly host. The cabin offers a secluded getaway with a great view of the sunrise.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Great place for a secluded getaway!
We stayed here for some quiet during the fourth of July. We really enjoyed that this property was the only property in sight and there were probably only four other houses on the entire lake.
The property is exactly as described. Furniture was in good shape and the beds were comfortable. The outdoor area is comfortable with a can't beat view. The lake is not for swimming (muddy and very shallow) but we loved using the kayaks Nicki provided. She even has a foot paddle boat (we didn't try it though). We brought a stand up paddle board which was perfect on this lake since the water is so calm.
Overall we had a great time and would recommend staying here."
2023-07-01,4,Group trip,"Overall, we enjoyed our time at Nicki‚Äôs cabin. We enjoyed the secluded location and lack of neighbors. However, the yard was much smaller than the pictures to support having dogs and the lake was very shallow and not clean which didn‚Äôt allow for many activities. Nicki was very responsive when we had an issue with the grill and her husband fixed it timely, although the end result was still a moderately functioning grill."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the pelicans, privacy - the sunrise on the lake."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"So peaceful! Exactly what we were looking for to work remotely with our little one and our dog. Each morning, evening and throughout most of the day the only sounds we heard were the birds and fish jumping. Lake has geese, ducks, herons and pelicans. We even saw a couple of deer out on the point stopping for a drink. One downside (besides having to leave at the end of our stay) - there is no screen door. It would have been nice to have the door open to catch the breeze while inside. Still fantastic and would stay again."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Secluded, quiet and private"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,great place to stay in a peaceful environment
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place. The most noisy thing outside were the geese parading their goslings for us to watch as they swam on by. üòÇ Thank you for sharing your property with us.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is great for a family to spend a couple of days away from the craziness of life. It has elk the amenities you would want and the host, Nicki, is great. Please visit!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Nicki was so responsive and kind. We even had an issue with the coffee maker on our first day and she came over with a new one. Wonderful host, thank you Nicki"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a great time with family in this place.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lake was beautiful, and the cabin was very comfortable. It was private and quiet.
A little treasure."

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Had a wonderful time and its a beautiful place
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was our second time staying at Nikki's cabin and it was even better than the first! We'll keep coming back whenever we're in the area!

2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Great getaway with a beautiful view of the lake. This was the perfect little cabin for our family trip, I highly recommend !!"
2022-12-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful place, cozy, quiet, private, clean, we hope to return at another time of the year because we would have liked to kayak, it was a great Airbnb."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nicki's beautiful cabin was just what we were looking for. Nicki was extremely helpful and flexible. We celebrated our family Christmas here and made wonderful memories we'll never forget. There are 7 of us and there was plenty of room. We attended an amazing Christmas concert at Luther Preparatory School, which made this location perfect!! If visiting during winter months we would suggest bringing extra blankets for snuggling, there are little space heaters to use but an extra blanket was needed. A visit to Berres Brothers Coffee is a MUST!!! We will definitely be back!!! Thank you so much Nicki, God Bless"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay. The sunrises are quite beautiful, and the cabin was perfect."
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, quiet, serene - gorgeous view of lake!"

2022-11-01,5,Group trip,Accurate to the description. And the cabin is wonderful the view is very relaxing and it makes for a wonderful getaway.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great spot - cozy house on the lake and gorgeous view. Perfect for kids and dogs. We made use of the kayaks and the paddle boat every day. Great hikes just a short drive away. Perfect weekend getaway. Nicki was very responsive. You‚Äôll love it!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is still a great place to stay! Fall is a beautiful time up there, and this cabin is a great place to experience it."

2022-10-01,4,Stayed with a pet,Nice retreat
2022-10-01,5,Group trip,Amazing place!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house is just beautiful. And Nicki is the best! She responded to all my questions and she always close by in case we needed anything. It was a lovely, restful weekend in the perfect lake house."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This cabin is a lovely place to spend the weekend with family or friends. We enjoyed the view of the lake, bonfires in the evening and making meals together. The kitchen had everything we needed. There is a lovely view of the lake from the front doors and you can sit at the dining table and enjoy the view."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Quiet and cozy! We absolutely loved the rustic cabin and will definitely return next year!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Super clean and very well-equipped cabin on a beautiful lake. Take a chance to get away from the chaos and get back in touch with nature while on the water in the canoe, paddle boat or kayaks. We will certainly visit again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This getaway cabin is located right on the edge of the lake. It is definitely a hidden gem. It felt like we were in the middle of the woods, which we loved being secluded from everything. My family and I enjoyed grilling outside as we viewed the lake. At night we had a bond fire and made s‚Äômores. The cabin inside had all the utensils to make breakfast or a cup of coffee. We also went into Watertown and went to Mullen‚Äôs Dairy Bar. We also went to Riverside park and fed the ducks (bring bread). But we mostly stayed in as the beautiful cabin gave us a getaway retreat that we were looking for. All in all we had an amazing time and we hope we can stay again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a wonderful secluded cabin on the lake. We had the lake to ourselves the whole time we were there! Not sure if that's normal, but we're not complaining. We've never fished much, but managed to bring in a few bluegill, catfish, bass and a HUGE walleye. So exciting! Cabin was very clean and comfortable. Just a few minutes from stores and restaurants, which was great! Would definitely recommend."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The cottage was lovely and equip with everything needed. Wonderful getaway!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed over a week,"Fantastic location, there are canoes and table tennis to enjoy, quiet and peaceful. The sunrise is magnificent. we saw pelicans on the lake. Awesome stay and Nicki was indeed a super host."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful place, great outdoors. Bring your own drinking water. Nicki is a great host!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"1,000,000% as incredible as described. The most amazing waterfront property that literally took our breath away. Nicki is truly the Super Host she's badged as! The tranquility of the cabin and lake are something we'll be back for. A perfect stay for us as we traveled from CA to be a high school graduation! The master bed was as comfortable as our own! THANK YOU!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is a really great little lakeside cabin. Very quiet and peaceful, with great sunrise and moonrise views. Highly recommended to get away from the daily grind."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Such a beautiful cabin. Had everything one needs, including plenty of bowls, colanders and even wine glasses. One of the most comfortable beds I‚Äôve ever slept on. Even had a washer/dryer. Simply fabulous. Close enough to Madison for a dinner out. We hope to stay again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Beautiful cabin with a gorgeous view of the sunrise over the lake each morning. A wonderfully secluded space but close to some cute some towns for shopping, eating, hiking, etc. A great time had by all!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you're looking for a cute cabin with an exceptional view to spend some time away, this cabin is for you!
Our host Nikki was quick to respond to any questions we had, and made the check-in process streamlined."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great little cabin with a beautiful view. We visited our daughters at Luther Prep for the weekend and had a great time staying here.
2022-03-01,5,Group trip,"This cabin was the perfect place to have our getaway girls weekend! Great lakeside location and was so cozy, clean, and comfortable! Nicki is an excellent host! So kind, friendly, great communicator, and accommodating! She worked with our schedule for a later check out time at no additional cost and provided the upmost hospitality. Would highly recommend this cabin for anyone!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Simply beautiful ! The lake view, the cabin, the peace and quiet of the surrounding was just wonderful. Exactly what we expected. Will definitely be back!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Great place!
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin is absolutely beautiful! Super clean with everything you need for a quiet, relaxing stay. The long driveway starts in a restaurant parking lot, which is pretty busy on Friday nights. So be prepared to navigate through some tight spaces to get in and out after ~7 pm. Every other night of the week was super easy though! Overall, it‚Äôs a fantastic find."
2022-01-01,5,Group trip,"The cabin was so amazing! We stayed over NYE weekend. It was so quiet and relaxing. The place was so we'll equipped with everything we needed to make meals (we spent the whole weekend cooking and eating). The floors are heated!!! Honestly, i never knew i needed that in my life but it's now what i really need. It was freezing cold outside but so cozy inside. So clean too! Nicki was so nice and helpful with parking (it's a downhill drive, terrifying with the snow) and arranged for us to park in a neighborhood restaurant parking lot. We would love to come back in the spring/ summertime."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"We had a lovely stay at the cabin for Christmas Eve that was decorated for the holidays. It was well furnished, clean, and very cozy. It was the perfect place to gather for our family. The setting on the lake is beautiful and being tucked down away from the highway it was very private and although it could be a little tricky to get to it, the host gave good directions on how to get there. The host Nicki was wonderful in being very accommodating and in her communications with us. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it !"
2021-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Nicki‚Äôs place is gorgeous! Amazing location and cute cabin. We were disappointed to learn the fireplace could not be used but we still had a good time. Thank you Nicki for hosting us!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Stunning view and peaceful, it was great coming home after our wedding to get away from it all. Will definitely come back for when it is warmer and try a canoe or kyak"
2021-12-01,4,Group trip,Nikki's place is better than advertised. Highly recommend staying here!
2021-11-01,5,Group trip,Lovely cottage with beautiful views. We had a great time there. The cottage was spotless and nicely furnished. The sunrises on the lake were fabulous. Nikki was so responsive to our questions which we really appreciated. We‚Äôd love to go back again when the weather is warmer.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nicki's cabin was AMAZING. It was exactly what we were looking for in a weekend getaway. HIGHLY recommend staying here.

2021-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great view! Great cabin !! Very private and relaxing.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was clean, cozy and inviting! We cooked meals, grilled and made a fire outside at night. Everything we needed was there. The beds were very comfortable and my 6 year old loved sleeping in the bunk bed. Nikki has two kayaks and we went Kayaking on the lake which turns into a river. The water was pretty calm and the paddling was nice a easy. We saw tons of fish jumping and lots of different kinds of birds. It was a very relaxing trip. The water does have a sulfur smell, which we read in a review, so we brought some gallons of water to drink. Nikki did provide some bottle water too. It was a great time!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Such a beautiful cabin right next to the lake! The cabin had all the amenities that we could ask for plus more! Although we didn‚Äôt use them, it included a grill, camp fire pit, & kayaks! We brought our 11 month with us and the cabin already had a pack & play & baby gates! Nicki is very quick to respond to any needs you may have. We did have a minor issue with the septic backing up, but Nicki had a sewer company out & fixed before we returned that evening. We were very happy with our stay at Sunrise Retreat!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful setting, beautiful house, comfortable bed, very responsive host. Private, relaxing setting. We hope to stay here again."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"This is place and the host are hidden gems! Rooms were squeaky clean. Nikki was very thoughtful and kept BBQ grill, kayaks, beers, basic supplies stocked before we checked in.
We locked ourselves out & forgot keys inside the cabin, Nikki & her husband drove down at 12pm to help us enter the cabin. You cannot ask for a better host!
The location is perfect with private access to the lake. If you‚Äôre looking to unwind and/or celebrate an occasion with your friends/family, this is the place you want to be in. Calm and safe."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at Nicki‚Äôs cabin. Nicki was very accommodating and responded quickly to any questions. She was flexible with our check-out time which was extremely helpful. The cabin was on a wonderfully peaceful secluded small lake (Hahn Lake), with fish routinely leaping into the air or pretending to be small sharks; and flocks of lake bird formations in the air and lake. We saw a bald eagle and a heron. The cabin was tidy and had everything we needed to feel at home. The fire pit is available and we really enjoyed the cozy indoor fireplace. The open concept of the home on the ground floor is very conducive to mingling yet there‚Äôs lots of room for doing your own thing. The view out of the front doors is unbeatable ‚Äî sitting there whether indoors or out, you get the feeling of what lake living is all about ‚Äî heart-opening. The ample kitchen is terrific for cooking and entertaining though we did neither and we appreciate the clean and dull sets of crockery and cutlery; plus drawers full of kitchen tools. If you like going out an evening or two for meals we recommend The Grist at Lake Mills for dinner. Two days in the getaway was enough to recharge us. Have a wonderful stay!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Perfect weekend getaway. Description of house is spot on. Close by to multiple small towns if you want to go shopping or just see what they have to offer. Calm, peaceful, and definitely can't wait to go back again. Thank you for having us."
2021-09-01,5,Group trip,"A hidden gem! My group of friends booked a last minute trip and loved this place! Looks 100x better and bigger than the pictures. Very clean with the exception of some bugs on the walls/windows but that‚Äôs expected with the location. Beautiful view right off the lake, even the lake is bigger than it looks in the pictures. The house was fully equipped for any kitchen/shower/bed needs. Nicki was quick to respond when needed. The neighbors cute dog came over one day and spent the whole afternoon with us until we found his owners nearby, such a special surprise! Nicki also provided 2 canoes and we brought our own floating tubes and fishing rods.
All in all, we LOVED our weekend here!!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a gorgeous place to stay. The view of the river, and covered patio really made the space feel extra private. The owner is very friendly and nice, but will leave you be all at the same time. I was surprised at how many cooking devices there were to choose from to make food! Didn't need an actual stove because of that. I didn't make use of the entertainment additions but they looked like lots of fun, and were kept up nicely."

They even gave me a potato to try a trick I learned to remedy over salted soup. They had some logs in the fire pit and a partial bag of ice in the freezer, both possibly in response to my inquiries about our plans and needs. Beautiful , relaxing space. I love the kayak option and my daughter loves the paddle board and family dogs. My husband enjoyed the squishy outdoor couch and the air hockey table Something for everyone!üòä"

2022-12-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"What a pleasant get away! We were there at the best time - we got to see the fast running huge river freeze over with ice over 4 day stay! So lovely! Lots of space for playing games and bath is big as well.
We would like to have hotter water available for washing dishes and the bed would be lots better with a topper - too hard! Otherwise we enjoyed our stay - thanks for sharing your lovely home! Happy holidays! Peggy and Dano"

The indoor space was also very comfortable and nicely decorated. My sister especially enjoyed the fireplace."

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Rock River Haven was a very spacious and peaceful apartment after our busy family wedding. The views of the river were lovely as well as the sounds of the birds all around the property. We enjoyed our coffee in the morning on the covered patio facing the river. MJ is an amazing gardener with lovely flowers surrounding the property. Andy entertained us by having their dog fetch his football by jumping into the river. Everything was sparkling clean when we arrived which we always appreciate. We highly recommend this property.

We‚Äôll have to be back soon :)"

We met their friendly dog upon arrival and they do have a new puppy now! Occasionally hear the puppy bark, train horns, and footsteps upstairs as they walk around. It was my first time sharing the house with the owners but it wasn‚Äôt too weird. Very friendly host. Indoor fireplace gets the basement really warm! Great location between Milwaukee and Madison so we visited a lot of places."

It was a perfect little relaxing get away for two. Lots of space. Tons of amenities (ping pong, giant jenga, board games, movies, books, kayak/canoe, hot tub). Beautiful view of the river.
It‚Äôs the walk out basement of the hosts‚Äô house. It has a very private back patio area with hot tub and plenty of places to lounge. Because it‚Äôs the walk out, you may hear some noise from upstairs. It didn‚Äôt bother us at all.
If you‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll get visited by a nice kitty and doggo!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A comfortable basement apartment with a great view of the river and loads of things to do. The apartment itself could be your vacation destination with all the things to do. MJ is a great host and very friendly. She bends over backwards to make your stay wonderful.

He was accommodating when we needed a slight change of plans and responded quickly to any communication. The home is well-appointed. When comparing it to other airbnb's, I appreciate how it had what we needed, was comfortable, and was nicely decorated in a simple uncluttered way. Mark also has cabinets and drawers clearly labeled in a nondistracting way. I wish we would have had time to use the firepit, but our time there was unfortunately too busy for that. Maybe our family will get to do that next time!"

We traveled to Watertown to get away from Chicago for a week and we felt like we could cook, sleep, work, and relax in the space. The house is close to the downtown and we walked for ice cream, coffee, and even to Walgreens."
2020-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Richard‚Äôs place was just as expected. I liked how it was a short walk to all the downtown shops, eateries and the river. He was very prompt in returning my requests and even helped me out pronto when I locked myself out by accident."
2020-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Very cute, comfortable, and clean space. Fit our needs well. The only issue we had was the toilet. There was a note saying to hold down the lever of the toilet to flush, which we had to do for the entire flush, and sometimes a second time...it may be time for a repair or replacement."
2020-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard‚Äôs place is beautiful, spacious, comfortable, clean and in a great location. The kitchen had everything needed to cook a meal. Parking was on the street right in front. Walgreens and downtown Watertown was a very short walk. We loved staying there!"

2020-02-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The place was quiet, spacious and cozy. The place had a great kitchen and large fridge with all the essentials for cooking and eating meals.

2019-11-01,4,Stayed one night,Very clean and comfortable place. Was a little disappointed when there wasn‚Äôt any shampoo or bar soap for shower though. The toilet needs replacing as it didn‚Äôt flush well. Everything else was wonderful.

Richard made check in & out very easy & any communication was responded to in a timely manner. Was very convenient to visit our daughter attending college at Maranatha (only .75 mile). Can easily make meals in or there are several options near to eat out. On street parking was no problem at all. Quiet street- Lovely historic neighborhood."
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is one of the loveliest places I have ever stayed in through Airbnb. It is close to the main part of town in an impressive and quiet neighborhood. It is centrally located between Milwaukee and Madison. Super clean and beautifully appointed. Communication with Richard is immediate and pleasant. Loved everything about this apartment-Victorian. Wonderful amenities. Will definitely stay here again.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Richard's place was great for my stay in Watertown. It was convenient, comfortable, and welcoming and had everything that I needed. I hope that I get to stay again the next time that I visit my daughter at Maranatha."

2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Richard is a great host who responded quickly every time we asked. We found the B&B private cozy and perfectly located for our two night stay in the area. It would also make a great base to stay for an extended time given the full kitchen and Wifi.
We loved the neighborhood and felt very safe on the edge of this historic district. Watertown has everything you could need for practical purposes. We were looking emergency supplies for a wedding arch assembling and attaching the floral arrangements as well as toiletries and food: within 3 minutes drive was an ALDI, Walgreens, Ace Hardware and Jo-Ann Fabrics. Everyone was so friendly and helpful.
It was our first two story AB&B and we enjoyed the bedroom and bathroom being separate from our living space especially when one wanted to nap and another to be up and about. Of course we don‚Äôt have any challenges with accessibility, just note a continuous stairwell is the only way up."
2019-09-01,4,Stayed one night,"Fitz's Apartment was a great spot for our night in Watertown. The suite was clean and featured some lovely little touches that made it very homey. Was perfect for our one night, but would be excellent for someone looking to stay even longer because it includes a full kitchen, wish we would have had a bit more time to spend there. Very charming place that you won't regret booking!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Richard was very accommodating. The neighborhood is quiet and filled with beautiful historical homes. Nice places to walk and view the river. Bed was comfy. Loved our stay.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved this place! The outside may look like it hadn‚Äôt been updated since grandma lived there, however the inside is fabulous. Great location. If I could have given 10 stars for value I would have"
2019-09-01,4,Stayed one night,Richard's place is beautiful. It was in a nice quiet neighborhood. It was easy to find and it was very clean.
2019-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,Richards place was perfect for my 3 month contract with UW. He was a great host and was always available when any needs arose. I highly recommend his place to anyone seeking a short or long term stay.

2019-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great place, conveniently located, very comfortable."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This was a great place to stay. The apartment is cute, has a lot of charm, and more than met or needs. It was wonderful to be able to bring the dogs with, and the backyard was fabulous for them (leash is a must because of the river!). Margaret communicated everything to us proactively, and we had a great stay!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed one night,This Airbnb was a great find for a graduation at the University of Wisconsin- Whitewater. Very nice town and walkable!
2024-04-01,3,Stayed a few nights,"****This is the lower level of a split home. It is an apartment.*****
Margaret was a gracious and responsive host and the property was as in the photos. We were highly disappointed that this stay was mislisted as an ""entire home"" instead of an apartment and the front photo of the house omits the entrance to 914 1/2."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Glad to have a very nice place to stay when visiting family.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,"Had a Wonderful night at Margaret's place!
Lots of room and things you need.
Just maybe an extra blanket in bedrooms."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Beautiful home. Host communicated often and in a timely manner. Already booked another stay in two weeks.

2024-06-01,5,Group trip,I stayed the weekend with a few friends and it was a beautiful and peaceful retreat. They had wood for the fire pit and s‚Äômores supplies available which was great.

2024-03-01,5,Group trip,I was looking for a place for my friends and family to stay at for a concert in Madison. After looking through several hotels I decided to try AirBnB out and found a listing for The Treehouse. I thought it was too good to be true as it was 1/2 the price of a single Hotel room. on the way of arrival Kimberly was more than happy to accommodate for my late departure and was willing to help however she could. Upon walking in we felt instantly at home and relaxed after a long drive. we quickly unpacked our things and had a snack in the lovely sunroom. we quickly found ourselves enjoying the coziness of the loft while we watched a movie. The pool room was a great place to put on a movie and play some pool while we waited for the concert. The stay went quickly but by the end of it we found ourselves left with nothing but happy memories. So thank you from us to you for all of your hard work in The Treehouse.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our family needed to get away for a weekend and this was definitely the place to do so. It was so well stocked we barely had to leave! Plenty of space for 3 adults and two preteens to spread out and still feel more than cozy! Also extemely prompt response to an issue with the water heater! Definitely plan to come back. The soaker tub was to die for and the free bottle of wine was a huge bonus for the adults. Loved being able to just sit on the porch with coffee in the AM and play pool in the basement in the evening. Perfect little paradise for sure.
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful home in a great location
2024-02-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Thank you, everything well, a little far from the activities of sky and doas para ventamos de la snow that was our goal"

The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice, especially this time of year when all the leaves are changing. If you have any questions, reach out to Kimberley, she‚Äôs there to answer anything for you. Thank you for making an unforgettable trip for us with memories that will last forever."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was a beautiful place to stay with guests for a wedding weekend at Korth park. Kimberley was extremely easy to communicate with and accommodations were perfect.

2023-09-01,5,Group trip,"Me and 4 friends had a college reunion together at Kimberley's place. It was so beautiful and peaceful. She had all the amenities we could need, including stuff for coffee, smores and firewood. Lots of space, and cozy to just stay in or explore the area. She was extremely responsive and friendly to any messages. And the house was very clean and comfortable. We loved sitting on the deck looking out at the trees - it really feels like you're in a treehouse! HIGHLY recommend!"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a lovely and peaceful stay. We loved the outdoor deck-- it was the perfect place to relax before IM Wisconsin. Location was great- a short walk down to the lake. The kitchen was really well supplied with dishes and cooking utensils-- made for a perfect Saturday feast!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Treehouse was exactly as described and pictured. It was a peaceful retreat-and it was close to Rock Lake, without being directly on the lake-which was a good thing! It was nice to be a bit away from the lake because there can sometimes be too much activity around and on a lake, which can interfere with your ability to truly relax outside-where you want to be! But the Treehouse was perfect for relaxing-on the deck, or inside in the Loft, or downstairs on the comfy couches! At night-the sounds of the katydids and all the other creatures was such a symphony! There were plenty of kayaks for us all to enjoy beautiful Rock Lake. The beds were super comfortable, and the extra bathrooms were ideal. Thank you, Kimberley, for everything! We can‚Äôt wait to come back"
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed in, the home was beautiful, peaceful, and spacious. Kim was also great and easy to get in touch with. Can‚Äôt recommend enough"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time at Kimberley‚Äôs place! Rene three bedrooms and three bathrooms were great for our whole family to enjoy and have plenty of space !
I thought it actually had a water view which is why we booked it. Upon getting there it did not have a water view it was actually across the street and across another row of house.
But the awesome house made up for that.don‚Äôt hesitate to book!"
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,"Kim was a very responsive host who replied kindly to every question. We stayed here before and after attending a wedding at Bennett Barn and it was perfect driving distance. The lake is about a 4 minute easy walk from the house. The house has lots of areas to spend time - porch, bonfire pit, outdoor dinning table (with cute string lights!). Minimal check-out tasks, too, which is appreciated!!! Very clean, open kitchen for group dinning."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved this place. Several unexpected surprises like multiple gathering areas. We had family in the area and the house made for a great central spot to get together.
2023-06-01,5,Group trip,What a wonderful home but more than anything Kimberley was beautiful inside and out!! It was a great getaway for me and my family! And I do believe I made a new friend!!! The trip was beyond my expectations!! Peaceful
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is quite a large space. We cooked every meal, and the kitchen/grill is well equipped to handle any cooking needs. We stayed two nights, and it wasn't enough. There's plenty to do around the house/area. We had several small children with us, and there's a beach ~7m drive away that worked well for them. Kimberley also popped by to drop off some marshmallows."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A beautiful and relaxing space!. Our family celebrated our daughter's graduation from UW. It was the perfect spot for our family with lots of memories made! The house is very relaxing with nooks and crannies to hide out and be alone but also open areas for everyone to gather.

It was very relaxing and peaceful but, had a air of fun to it with the pool table and game room. The three full bathrooms were defiantly a plus as well! It was very well kept and clean and had everything we need to for a great girls getaway!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We had the pleasure of staying at Kimberley's Treehouse while working in the area. We stayed at her home for 10 days.
The area is stunning. There's a lake you can easily see from the house and it was beautiful. It was frozen over so we watched ice fisherman and people playing on the lake. We are Texans so that was new to us and fun to watch.
The house was very nice and welcoming. All bedrooms were very comfortable and everyone reported sleeping well. The bedrooms were well appointed with plenty of blankets for a comfy experience.
The three bathrooms were great and every one of the sparkling clean with linens and plenty of hot water and water pressure.
The living/kitchen area were great and open concept. We were able to cook and enjoy visiting. All the appliances were in great condition. Plenty of kitchen items to cook for a large crowd.
We enjoyed the wonderful fireplace and watching everything through the beautiful floor to ceiling windows. Highly recommend!"

We highly recommend it for your getaway!"

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Kimberly's house is even better than photos do justice. There is a ton of space and everyone for our girls weekend had more than enough space to be comfortable. The kayaks were a bit difficult to get to the lake, but that's only cause of the big hill when walking and we didn't have a car big enough to really fit. However that did not even matter, the lake is so close and has a nice swimming and launch spot! We spent a couple hours there. Kimberly's love for the space and area shows with how much she provides and how well kept the home is. This is an Airbnb is one I would definitely stay in again. Loved being able to escape out to nature for a couple days. You won't be disappointed staying here!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"Such a nice space to promote gathering and warmth. Necessities were provided and more. Close to the lake, but so much to do at the house! Would definitely recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful and spacious!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Great space for our family during our daughter‚Äôs wedding weekend.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,Place worked great for our small work retreat. Comfortable beds and nice layout for socializing. All the comforts of home. Kimberly had great communication and check in was a breeze. Thanks!!!
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This place is definitely worth every penny. You are very close to a grocery store, the lake is walking distance and it feels like you are in a cozy treehouse. The bathtub alone is worth it. Kim was great at replying quickly to any questions we had. I highly recommend this airbnb!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed an absolutely wonderful week at The Treehouse! Plenty of room for our family of six to spread out. All the beds were very comfortable, and the loft area upstairs was a favorite hang out spot. We also loved relaxing on the comfy lounge chairs on the deck, and making s‚Äômores by the fire pit. Taking the kayaks out on the lake was the kid‚Äôs favorite activity! We hope to return again very soon!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"If you‚Äôre thinking about staying here, you absolutely should! Kimberley‚Äôs treehouse is breathtaking. The kitchen area is gorgeous and the rest of the house is just as amazing. The location was perfect and my bridesmaids and I all slept there comfortably. Kimberley was very responsive and wished us all a great time. The whole house is stunning and there are 3 full bathrooms so getting ready was a breeze. The lake and trees were amazing to look at and we had an absolute blast. Thank you so much Kimberley, I‚Äôll definitely be back some day!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"You can expect that what you read is what you get and more. That all the amazing reviews are spot on and you will want to book again. My daughter found this listing on luck, but I think it found us. Wishing we had more time there, but already planning a trip back!! It was like staying with an old friend."
2021-06-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The Treehouse is a beautiful place to relax and unwind. We took advantage of the kayaks and swimming beaches. The lake is super clean and clear, which we loved. The little touches Kim puts into the place makes it feel very welcoming. House was a lot larger than we antipated! Which was a plus, everyone had a space to chill. Will definitely look to rent again."
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"Kimberley's home is a wonderful experience; a magical gem nestled in a forest of trees! The kitchen/dining area lends itself throughout the day to sunshine which you can enjoy or block out with shades. The view off the deck into the pretty tree line is very peaceful. The house next door is somewhat close; but we never saw our neighbors. The firepit location in front of the house was especially fun. We also enjoyed the rec room bar area. Thank you, Kimberley for making our mini vacation weekend memorable; exactly what we hoped it would be! -Karen"
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,We were in the area for our sons wedding and needed a place to stay for multiple family members where we could hang out before the ceremony and after. The treehouse was great and allowed us to sleep 8 and could have slept more. The thoughtful touch of having a coffee machine and coffee there for use was great. The setting out on the deck to relax in the morning with family was wonderful and made our stay special.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,"The Treehouse was not just a house, but it was truly a home. So many special touches made The Treehouse warm and inviting, from the outside flower baskets, cozy furniture, and fire pit to the inside home accents, stone fireplace, and cozy spots to curl up with a good book. And those floor to ceiling windows and back deck...amazing! Much thanks to Kimberley for being such a thoughtful and caring host."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We enjoyed every bit of our stay ! Many places inside & out to hang out & enjoy each others' company or unwind in peace & solitude. It was truly like being nestled among the trees & nature . Having the clean refreshing lake so close & use ofvtubes & kayaks was perfect after sunning on the deck. The house was very well stocked with dishes & towels & everthing we needed to make it our home away from home. Many thoughtful touches with Bible verses & throw blankets carefully placed & an oil diffuser as well as fresh herbs growing near the outside dining table.Kimberley was extremely responsive & exceeded our expectations! Love love love the Treehouse üíúüíúüíú
2021-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved the photos on the Airbnb site and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. Such a charming and comfortable get-away place! Kimberley was very attentive and we had everything we needed for our one-week stay. The 3 flat-screen TVs give you and your group plenty of options, including Netflicks, and we really enjoyed the pool table. Lake Mills is well situated for side trips to Madison, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Dells, the International Crane Foundation, Man Mound, and Taliesin. Lots to do with a great place to crash at the end of the day. Thanks, Kimberley, for providing such a lovely home as an Airbnb option!"
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,The Treehouse is a fun and beautiful place to stay! We enjoyed the nearby park/playground/walking trails as well. Kimberley was so helpful and quick to respond. We had a fantastic visit and appreciated the thoughtfulness that went into our stay!
2021-04-01,5,Group trip,"I can't thank Kimberley enough for this amazing experience. Her home was amazing, the view from the deck, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the loft, master bedroom tub, the basement rec room, everything we perfect! My friends and I can not wait to book this house again! Everything was clean and the thoughtfulness of every little thing makes such a huge difference when traveling to a home away from home! This is a must rent!"
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Unique, clean and responsive. Great space to relax and have a little fun."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Perfect place for a family get together. Best of both the worlds-cozy cottage feel and also, large enough to accommodate 8-9 people - the house has at least 5 congregation areas apart from the kitchen/dining area."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Gorgeous views, lots to do, and easy to get around! The house is just as cozy, hygge, beautiful as in the pictures. Everything was clean, thoughtfully appointed, and the hosts were incredibly responsive, thorough, and warm in their hospitality. Although we had great weather, I imagine this would be a great space to spend rainy days. Great for large / extended families as there are multiple spaces to hang and unwind, read, watch, or play. The neighborhood was great for walking and biking, and close to many different state parks and playgrounds. The house is really close to the grocery store, which is well-stocked and has a fab bakery. We wish we could have stayed longer, and can't wait to go back!"
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,Was a wonderful place to spend the weekend. Great location close to town and easy to get to.
2021-03-01,5,Group trip,"This is such a beautiful house - I walked in the door and my breath was taken away. It has so many cozy spaces to hang out in, both indoors and out. Kimberly was super responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. We had a wonderful time playing pool and board games, making music, and cooking creative recipes in the well-stocked kitchen. We hung out by the fireplace at night and woke up in the morning to sun streaming in all the many windows. I wish our stay could have lasted a week! Thanks again, Kimberly!"
2021-02-01,5,Group trip,The place was beautiful and cozy! There were so many places to relax and lounge around.

2021-01-01,5,Group trip,"WOW! This place was absolutely beautiful! The pictures does this home no justice. Kimberley was super sweet and responded to my messages pretty fast. I surprised my husband with 2 other couples for a weekend getaway and we all enjoyed ourselves. We had a slight issue with the oven and she was able to get it fixed within 30 minutes. We spent most of our time in the game room playing pool, darts, and other games. Kimberley also provides board games in upstairs loft. The view from this home was gorgeous. Thank you for being so amazing Kimberley! I look forward to reserving your your home again."
2021-01-01,5,Group trip,My friends and I were looking for a little getaway outside of Madison and this was a great place! Lots of space and cozy places to hang!

2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Treehouse was a perfect place for our family of 6 to relax for the weekend. The view of the lake through the trees was beautiful the first few days. Then it snowed and it was even more magical! The home is spacious and bright with plenty of places for us to relax, play games and even bake cookies. Kimberley was responsive and helpful at all parts of the trip - even droppinh off some cookie sheets for baking! We loved our time at the Treehouse and will definitely be back."
2020-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was cute, cozy, and welcoming. There was something for everyone to do. The grill was well kept. The indoor fireplace made the house feel very cozy and relaxing. The amenities were fantastic and Kimberley ensured we had a fantastic vacation."
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Great place !
2020-11-01,5,Group trip,Our group enjoyed spending time in the sunny main area of the house! The fireplace made it extra cozy for the chilly weekend.

If you have the opportunity to stay here, don't hesitate to take it! Thanks again for everything!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a nice cozy place to stay! The view outside was amazing especially during the fall.
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,The house was beautiful and beyond cozy! The loft space and gazebo were a nice surprise. My friends and I stayed out on the deck a lot because you can‚Äôt beat the view of those beautiful fall trees. Kimberly was so kind and welcoming and we felt at ease as soon as we arrived. Definitely recommend for a tranquil retreat or a family vacation!!
2020-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"The location is nice and is surrounded by beautiful trees. The cleanliness, style, and the overall quality of the amenities are subpar."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Kimberly is excellent with communication-answering questions quickly and helpfully. I would definite stay again!
2020-10-01,4,Stayed with kids,"If you book this space thinking it‚Äôs a cabin it will exceed your expectations, if you book thinking it‚Äôs a luxury home near a lake, it will disappoint. Overall, a good place for groups, Lake Mills is a lovely town and the host is very friendly."
2020-10-01,5,Group trip,"The Treehouse is absolutely gorgeous! A stunning, unique place for a weekend getaway."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This place was PERFECT for our family of 7! The basement is great for playing games or movie watching. We had everything we needed.

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house has a great design is in a beautiful setting. It helped restore energy into our city-drained lives. Kimberley was very easy to communicate with. We loved the kitchen area and deck which flow into each other under a canopy of trees. The location is great. Close by is Korth Park, that has a stunning view over Rock Lake. Easy access to Madison, Lake Mills, and Aztalan State Park. We hope to have time to kayak at our next visit."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Loved the space and peacefulness even with my own children there. Kimberley was an outstanding host with quick message replies. I do wish there was an option to prevent some sun from entering into the kitchen area because it was a little toasty while cooking. The location was very convenient to the lake and putting our kayaks in. Loved the extra touches with wood being supplied and s‚Äômores along with Starbucks coffee and complimentary wine. As I‚Äôm writing this I forgot to leave a message in the book for fellow families. Darn. We will be visiting sooner then later to Rock Lake!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Kimberley was a great and responsive host. Our stay was very relaxing and secluded. The grill and deck were especially appreciated.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,This house is perfect for a fun family vacation. Quick walk or drive to a quiet swimming area OR a quick drive to the boat launch at Rock Lake. The outdoor space is amazing!!! The back patio the overlooks all the trees is so relaxing!! Great space for parents and kiddos to spread out as well as tons of sleeping options. Or kiddos LOVED the loft and claimed it from the moment we arrived. Can't go wrong with the rental!!
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Loved staying here. The house had everything you could need, was very clean, and Kimberley was a great host."
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"The Treehouse is a wonderful place! Kimberley is an amazing host and very sweet and attentive to details. Our family enjoyed the kayaks, pool table competitions, grilling out on the fabulous deck, and hanging out in the kitchen playing games! It feels like you are up in the trees, but still so close to the lake! We rented a pontoon boat and spent an afternoon on the lake, too. We were so comfortable staying at Kimberley's Treehouse and hope to come back very soon! Kimberley includes a complimentary bottle of wine and the ""fixings"" for s'mores - which are 2 of her many sweet touches that make this place amazing! We can't say enough about how awesome this place is for a quiet ""get-a-way"". Book a stay here - you will love it!!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"The place was great for a few days of relaxing with family or friends. 3 min walk to the lake and just minutes drive to the public beach and boat rentals.

2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Great relaxing getaway spot! Incredibly clean and comfortable. So many great amenities. Perfect combination of modern comforts and woodsy charm. Hidden little swimming/kayak launch spot just a short walk away was perfect and so were the kayaks that Kimberley supplied! The grill was definitely another highlight for us. It was very easy to stay occupied and entertained at the treehouse when we weren‚Äôt relaxing, and we can‚Äôt wait to make another trip out! Thanks again for everything, Kimberly! You and your Treehouse are both absolute GEMS!"
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Kimberley is a phenomenal host! This place has good access to the lake to kayak or swim, and the place itself is extremely cozy and quaint. You feel as if it is your home away from home!"
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed for 4 days with 6 adults and 4 kids with more than enough shared and private space for our 3 families. Kimberley went above and beyond our expectations, making sure we could check in early when we arrived to town sooner than expected AND check out late since there were no other guests arriving the same day. She had stuff for s'mores ready for us and the house was very clean. We felt very welcome and comfortable in this beautiful home. The photos do not do it justice! You feel like you're actually in a tree house in a remote location even though downtown is just a short drive and the lake is a 2 minute walk. We had so much fun biking and kayaking around the area and the locals were very friendly. We'll definitely be returning!"
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Tree house was a great Airbnb for a weekend getaway. Kimberley is a great host and responds to messages immediately. The house is very clean and has a beautiful view. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more. 10/10!

2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place near a lake to stay with awesome outside and inside areas to relax. Perfect for a family or two to enjoy.
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is by far the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve ever had. Kimberley was quick to respond and was a gracious host. Her home had everything you could possibly want or need for a lake stay. We enjoyed using her kayaks, fire pit, grill, and spent all our meal times out on the gorgeous deck. The home is fully stocked for cooking/grilling and there are plenty of extra linens. The basement with pool table/darts was the cherry on top. We cannot wait to come back!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had such a wonderful time at the Treehouse. It was very clean and is an absolutely beautiful home. There were many activities including games, a pool table, a dartboard, and nature watching to name a few. Kimberley was very friendly and easy to get in touch with. She offered a complimentary bottle of wine(perfect for Mom and Dad) and s'mores(which my kids loved and were very excited about!) I hope to revisit sometime this summer and try out the kayaks that are also included. Thanks again, Kimberley and Matt!"
2020-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Kim‚Äôs place was a great escape, the property is located on a nice quiet street with lake views when the trees are not in bloom. Plenty of space for a small family to spread out and get work done."

2019-10-01,5,Group trip,We had a great time at the Treehouse! The top two features were a fully stocked kitchen for cooking and a fantastic bathtub. Bonus - a beautiful owl hung out with us all Sunday morning! He perched on a tree outside the kitchen window. :)
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"We were in town with friends for a wedding celebration in Lake Mills. Kimberley's place was perfect for a large group (we had 6 adults) or a family, tons of sleeping and bathroom space for everyone. Tucked away in the woods, the only thing missing for us was the beautiful autumn leaves. We didn't cook while we were here, but there was a full kitchen available. Definitely recommend!"
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"First, let me start by letting you know that our host was fantastic! She was kind and truly aware of how to make our stay the best that it can be. We are grateful for her kindness...... We stayed last weekend (early October) and the weather certainly didn't cooperate, however with her help we were able to Boat, Fish and Kayak Friday, Saturday Morning and one last ride Sunday around noon. A little weather didn't stop the 7 of us from completing our plans. The area and terrain is beautiful with many state parks. As we arrived our host took the time to show us around the property, extras everywhere to make us comfortable. Plenty of water toys for Lake Mills (a nice size fishing lake) along with safety vests and paddles! The house itself is such a great space with tons of natural light, foliage, and the best Treehouse Deck around, not to mention the large patio out front with a gazebo. The fire pit surrounded by outdoor sofas to accommodate all was lite brilliantly Friday night. Great spaces to spread out..(inside and out) .. we played games, pool, movies, fire, and music all weekend..she even has a guitar at the house that went nicely with ours! Many comfortable sleeping arrangements, plus some - pillows galore ;) We cooked and grilled all meals and set ourselves up like it was home. ""Home is where the heart is"" and there is some REAL heart in this home. Make no mistake we will be back...it's that great! THANK YOU TREEHOUSE!"

2019-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"OMG!!!! Words could not describe how amazing this place is!!!! If you live in the Chicago area and if you want to do a quick getaway this place is the place where you want to stay. The house is clean, cozy and you feel like you are at home. The pictures that Kimberley shows is what you going to get amazing!!! The deck in the back surrounded the whole back of the house, that was my favorite place in the whole house. We were 2 minutes away from the lake so we were able to take a lot of pictures of the lake. Everyone in the neighborhood was nice and friendly. Kimberley is one of the best host I ever deal with. Kimberley is a God fearing women and awesome all around the board!!! She responded immediately when you need to contact her!! Thank you so much Kimberley you definitely gave us a memory that we would never forget!! We definitely would be staying there again‚ù§Ô∏è"
2019-08-01,5,Group trip,This place was beautiful and calm place to get away. Kimberley is an amazing host with attention to detail in everything! Communication with her was timely and she truly desired us to have an amazing stay. I will 100% return to this place in the future!

2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Kimberly is an incredible hostess. From your 1st inquiry and throughout your stay, Kimberly is very quick to respond and goes above and beyond to make you feel at home during your stay. Kimberly met us when we arrived, gave us a tour and just simply loved on our family. We could not have found a better place for us all to be together. We look forward to next summer when we have 2 weddings within the span of 2 weeks!"
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Kimberley was very thoughtful and easy to work with. The home is absolutely beautiful and she provides amazing amenities. Seven of us stayed comfortably in this home. We especially enjoyed relaxing and playing games on the porch. The lake access near the house has a pretty rocky bottom so I would suggest wearing water shoes or using one of the many rafts/tubes/kayaks that are provided. There is a sandy beach that you can drive to where we enjoyed lunch outside at Hering‚Äôs Sand Bar. Overall we had a great time and would recommend this place to larger groups/families.

We were greeted with a spotless home with all the listed amenities as well as honey products from their farm. We were also treated to a personal tour of the farm and our kids got a chance to visit with the animals. The place was very comfortable and the host was accommodating and hospitable. The cows and horses were also super polite too. 10/10. We‚Äôll be back.

On the last morning our car wouldn‚Äôt start, and somebody at the farm was able to help us get it going! Excellent service and communication."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beekeeper's Inn was fantastic. Couldn't believe all the items Sarah provided in the kitchen and bathrooms. Much better stocked than any other places we've stayed at.

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Another great stay at the Inn! This was our 3rd stay and it was the same experience as before: the house was perfectly clean and Sarah's communication was quick and friendly. I am experiencing some physical limitations at this time, so the ramp into the home was a big help for us. We couldn't ask for a better place to stay. We always look forward to our time on the farm."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah's place is absolutely wonderful. The beds were very comfortable. The interior was very clean and has a nice welcoming decor. Had a very functional kitchen with lots of appliances. Nice trails to walk on. Great for kids, families, and couples. Their land they have is beautiful. Very quiet and peaceful house.

Not too far from Milwaukee and the Milwaukee county zoo as well."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely loved our stay. So much fun to walk around the farm. The house was much bigger than we thought. Everything was spotless. Beautifully decorated with lots of little touches that were so thoughtful. It was fun to see the map of everyone around the world that has visited this little paradise.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Best Airbnb! Sarah is a wonderful host who showed us all about beekeeping. House is beautiful and comfy! Super clean and has about everything we needed. So much work put into the home.
Sarah and Jim were very accommodating! We all learned a lot about cows and bees. The kids loved feeding the cows and cats! Kids even had a tractor ride! Our 4 year old was able to see a tractor from his bedroom window! We were all little sad we had to leave but plan on returning for another fun and peaceful vacation.
Thanks for a great time!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great sanctuary while attending a family reunion while coming in from out of state with grown children and 5-year-old grandchild. Very restful private location with great household atmosphere. Welcoming host who coordinated a visit with the cows, also on the property, where our grandson got to assist in feeding them. Also had an added bonus of having the benefit of ""leftover"" nonperishable foods from previous visitors."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at The Beekeepers Inn! The home was beautiful, incredibly clean, and comfortable. Lots of amenities and extras in the house and outside as well! I was sad to leave and my husband and 3 small children had a great time. Sara and her family were very welcoming and helpful. They went above and beyond to make the stay special. Sara gave us a tour of the farm and Mr. Jim let the boys ‚Äúhelp‚Äù feed the cows. We stay at AirBnbs often and this was my favorite. I hope to back some day! I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough!"
2023-05-01,5,Group trip,"Quaint farm home, recently renovated with amazing craftsmanship."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful and peaceful setting. Sarah and her family were friendly, accommodating and provided lots of information about their farm and beekeeping operation. The house itself was comfortable, homey and spotless. It had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is my second stay at Beekeeper‚Äôs Inn, and this time with my best friend for a weekend of R&R and friendship in this staycation. From the awesome card she left and creamed honey, to the hospitality of a behind the scenes tour with seeing the new calves - it was just the perfect weekend.
Sarah‚Äôs place is just one of a kind, with the cleanliness, amenities (love the Roku for shows/movies), board games, and waking up on a farm.
And Sarah is one of the kindest, most hospitable hosts.
We are planning an annual staycation here every year! Thanks again, Sarah, for everything!!!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed over a week,"The home is so beautiful, clean and bright, and calm. It was our oasis from the chaos of wedding events. Sarah and Ryan were wonderful! They had a calm ambassador in the form of Calvin the farm dog who greeted us on the porch most mornings. And the cows were great at welcoming us each morning and night. We are already thinking about coming back in the winter in a year or two, just to enjoy this great place."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beekeepers Inn was such a wonderful place for our family to call home base. Sarah & her family are considerate hosts and we truly enjoyed our stay!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"My family and I had an amazing time at the farm! My three year old loved feeding cows, holding baby‚Äôs chicks and getting a tractor ride. Sarah and her family were SO amazing and welcoming! And the home was perfect! Clean and spacious!! Would recommend to anyone !!"

2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"Communication from Sarah was great from the time of booking and throughout our stay. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly by Sarah, father-in-law Jim, and the friendly momma farm cat. The house is impeccably clean, very cozy, and is equipped with anything that you may need during your stay. The attention to detail that went into updating the house and the love and pride put into maintaining such a comfortable space is clearly evident and cannot be overstated. Sarah was generous with her time, sharing the history of and the current operations of this working farm. I will give no spoilers here, but there were several thoughtful and kind personal touches waiting for us that made us all feel welcome. I encourage anyone reading this review to book now and find out for yourself. I know that we will definitely be going back."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The best airbnb ever. So comfortable, three bedrooms, two living rooms, perfectly well furnished and incredibly well equipped. Two bathrooms.

It was a really wonderful stay, and I highly recommend it!!"

2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place!!! So clean, cute and peaceful. Perfect place to get away from the wedding chaos of all the prep work. there was a welcoming card, they had little baskets of toiletry items in case somebody forgot something, (which we did), and a gift of their amazing honey. Perfect place for our home base for our daughters wedding in Oconomowoc."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,The Beekeepers Cottage has all of the comforts of home in a beautiful and peaceful place - a tough combination to find. Sarah and her family were wonderful hosts and we hope to come back again sometime soon. This cottage is one craftsmen will admire. The kitchen has everything you need to make a great meal and a welcoming table for all to gather. Wifi - terrific / temperature control / a space to drop all of your things - if I could give it more stars I would:)
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Sarah‚Äôs place is awesome. Very relaxing setting on the farm. Gorgeous natural scenery and an easy drive to town(s)- best of both worlds. We wanted to stay off the beaten path and I would definitely recommend this place. Exactly as advertised and Sarah is a great host. Perfect communication and she‚Äôll even let you meet some of the animals on their lovely and serene property. Our little one loved staying here and so did we.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,This is a really sweet and quiet place to stay! The hosts are kind and the house is clean and spacious. We hope to get back and enjoy the farm more!

2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This stay is really perfect. Great location, friendly and engaging hosts, fun things for the kids (watch the tractors, pet the cows, climb a gravel mound!), impeccably clean house, and a kitchen stocked with any kitchen implement you might need to cook.
The house was excellent for toddlers with only one floor, some extra toys and supplies, and no precious antiques in reach. The farm was amazing for everyone and the hosts were exceptionally generous with their time - showing us around, answering questions, and helping to engage the kids. We loved exploring and have never felt more welcome at any other AirBNB.
We look forward to returning!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"2nd time on the farm. This time with baby cows which were adorable. This is just such a great place to stay. The house is clean and cozy and has all the necessities. We love being ""away from it all."" And Sarah is a friendly, accommodating host - and Jim is great too! Check in is a breeze. Everything is just easy. And the kids love the rock plies and animals. Our six year old (who requested this second stay) is already trying to convince us to go back for a third visit."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Probably the best Airbnb we've experienced! This was our second stay here and it was fantastic. Sarah is really great and she adds personal touches to make you feel welcome. The house and surrounding property are perfect for a nice, quiet getaway but there is still plenty to do on the farm. The house is in great condition and you can really tell Sarah takes pride in keeping it up. Very clean and modern. We will definitely be back!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I highly recommend this home for your stay. The owners had such great communication and the home was highly stocked with kitchen supplies and even some bathroom supplies. The farm was so cute and the owners were nice enough to give us a full tour and introduce us to all of their animals! From people who get air bnb every 2-3 months, this was the most comfortable stay we‚Äôve had!"
2022-02-01,5,Stayed about a week,If I have one more chance to around there I won‚Äôt missed this place I feel like home. And wishing this is my house
2022-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Very clean house! Sarah‚Äôs house had everything you‚Äôd need and the farm property was fun to explore. We enjoyed petting the cats and feeding the cows. The only knock on the place? The beds were a bit underwhelming but we fell asleep nonetheless so they couldn‚Äôt have been too bad. If you‚Äôre looking for a place to stay in this area, stop looking and book Sarah‚Äôs home!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a wonderful stay at Sarah‚Äôs country escape while working from home and visiting family in Watertown. Sarah and her family made us feel so welcome and taken care of. The house was spacious, clean, comfortable, and had plenty of amenities- heat, washer/dryer, TV, internet, select toiletries, and pots/pans. Our highlight was meeting the adorable animals on the farm including cows, horses, and a donkey. We are truly grateful for the memories there and look forward to visiting again soon!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Sarah and her lovely family were the most gracious of hosts and it is easy to see why they have a 5 star review. The house is cozy, immaculate, and in a wonderful location. We will absolutely be returning in the future."
2021-12-01,5,Group trip,"We loved our stay here and definitely plan to return. The home was spacious yet cozy, minimalistic yet had everything we needed. Great supplies in the kitchen, comfy beds. Appreciated the small touches (essential oil diffusers, honey, mini Christmas trees) that made it feel like home. Easy checkin/out with keyless entry made it simple to come and go while visiting our family in nearby Watertown. And the kitties and cows were just too cute! :) Thank you."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We loved our stay. Spacious, comfortable house; big, well-equipped kitchen; comfortable bed; world's comfiest leather rocker recliners; super peaceful and quiet rural setting that's within easy driving distance of both Milwaukee and Madison and great shopping en route to Milwaukee; warm and gracious hosts. We enjoyed the tour of the farm and beekeeping/honey-making operation and got to meet the cows, horses, donkey, two dogs, and seven cats (who live in the barn, so they're no bother for those of us who are allergic to cats). We took nice walks along the mowed trails on Sarah's property. Can't wait to return!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had another great stay - beautiful house, exactly as described!"
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great find. Super clean , lots of space , and on a farm. Extremely nice hosts. Cant ask for anymore!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a relaxing visit in the country-side. There were outdoor walking paths and lots of indoor games to play. The hosts were friendly and let our 6 year old feed the cats.
2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I highly recommend this house! It is super clean, spacious, and the kitchen has all the large & small appliances, pots & pans, dishes, etc. that one has at home. We've stayed here for several years now... whenever we're visiting family in the area. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Truly one of the best places we have ever stayed. Our say was even better than we imagined! Sarah and her family are so friendly and welcoming we felt right at home. We loved getting a tour of the farm and feeding the animals. The house was perfect and above our needs and expectations. We look forward to coming back again!
2021-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We found this stay to be quite relaxing. There's something serene about being on a farm. Sarah is a wonderful and accommodating host and gave us a great tour (interactive for the kiddos!) of the land and all the animals.
The kids loved feeding the cows, playing on the rock piles, and digging in the dirt.
The house itself is very clean and has a bit of farmhouse charm with the handmade cabinets and table and whatnot, while still not even feeling like a farm house. Probably because it isn't a farm house so much as it is a house on a farm. But I digress. It's a nice house. The kitchen has all the pots and pans and baking sheets and utensils and coffee makers and toasters and tea kettles you could possibly need. There's even a pantry stocked with the essentials like olive oil and foil and spices. And plenty of dishware as well.
Sarah was nice enough to set us up for a high chair for the little one as well, and there's a pack n play available to lighten your load.
We were greeted with a jar of honey made by our hosts which was delicious and a nice little welcome gift.
Check-in is a breeze and check out is just as breezy.
It's really just a very nice place to stay, and I highly recommend it if you have little ones to take along with you as they will definitely find endless entertainment on the property."
2021-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Very quiet area with very warm people who tell very enthusiastically about their life on the farm.
They enjoy hosting, as they have more than farm animals.
You will quickly feel at home there with a very sweet family around you."

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Thank you for all the extra touches that made our stay at the beekeepers cottage so wonderful! The toys and books you provided for the children were spot on! We all had a great time exploring the farm and relaxing in the well appointed cottage. This was a 3 generation vacation that we'll always remember
2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 4th visit to the farm ‚Äî it‚Äôs become a home away from home for us! We love Sarah and her family, and you won‚Äôt find a more comfortable AirBnB because Sarah has thought of everything. A visit to the farm‚Äôs honey shop is a MUST ‚Äî just schedule time with Sarah. The house is child-friendly and perfect for anyone who just wants to get into the country for a bit. You won‚Äôt want to leave!! We also enjoy the local spots you‚Äôll find in Sarah‚Äôs AirBnB guidebook. Don‚Äôt forget to stay up and enjoy the stars. Highly recommend!!"

2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"This a wonderful location to get away. We were in town for a nearby wedding and it was great to have a place to relax and unwind; especially for the fam while I was doing MOH duties. The property was great and it was awesome to have the animals and grounds to explore. We even had the chance to watch them pull honey from the bee hives just down from the house! Sarah and her family and crew were all so informative and helpful at every turn. If you are looking for a quiet country getaway, look no further!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed about a week,first class Airbnb would recommend it to everyone
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Only good things to say about this house and Sarah. We appreciated all the thought put into the house and the warm welcome from everyone, including the family dog. The house was very clean and there was everything there (and more) that we needed. We will definitely come again! Thank you, Sarah!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,"Sarah and her family are more than SUPER hosts!! The home is well appointed and there is nothing you need than your own clothes and food. I‚Äôm sure if you needed that they would accommodate that request too. We loved the farm and peacefulness of our surroundings. This is a working farm and the family is usually around. They are friendly, helpful, willing to chat and show you around the property. The walk around the perimeter is a nice diversion and sights of birds, horses and cows. A couple of friendly dogs and cats are also there - they do not come to the house, only around the barns. Don‚Äôt forget to take home some of their honey products, sold in the store at the barn. We hope to have a reason to visit the area again. Best sleep I‚Äôve had in months."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Such a beautiful home!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a great time exploring the farm and ‚Äútrails‚Äù.

The house was very clean and there was lots for the family to do together."

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,"Beautiful, peaceful, and cozy place! We enjoyed a sunny country road walk- wildflowers, grazing cows, and pretty pasture views. Very clean farm house. Nice kitchen- made biscuits, eggs, and coffee- enjoyed the fresh honey from their hives on the biscuits. Outdoor deck area with picnic table and barbecue. Hostess very kind and accommodating. Highly recommend staying here."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great time at The Beekeepers Inn.

Can‚Äôt wait to return!"

2021-05-01,5,Group trip,Great stay

2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at the farm. The house was clean, cozy, and had many small touches that made it so comfortable. Very child friendly, as we traveled with a 4 and 1.5 year old. The kids loved the farm and the animals, and Sarah and her family made us feel right at home. Sarah's father-in-law was so accommodating and friendly and let our oldest help with feeding the cows. Excellent trip and excellent stay. We'll definitely stay there again."
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was our 3rd stay and we are in LOVE with this AirBnB and everything about it!! It feels like home and I am so grateful to Sarah and her family for welcoming us. The house is beautiful and and has thoughtful touches‚Äîsuch as aromatherapy and homemade soap and honey‚Äîto help guests relax. It‚Äôs also kid friendly and has a high chair, books, and a pack and play. Things are peaceful in the country, so let yourself fall asleep in the grass or read a book on the porch. Then treat yourself with a visit to the Concord Farms honey shop, where you‚Äôll find soap, honey, candles, lotion bars, maple syrup, and more‚Äîall homemade on the farm. Sarah‚Äôs local tips won‚Äôt let you down, so don‚Äôt forget to eat some custard before you leave! The proximity to the highway makes this a fast trip for Chicagoans, in particular. We can‚Äôt wait to come back for trip #4!"

Our kids can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sarah's farm is beautiful. Its a home away from home. We stayed here during pandemic with our 4 young children. Its a great place for adults and children alike. The house is a remodeled farmhouse, the kitchen is beautiful, and the south facing deck is so sunny and relaxing. Sarah and her family live on the property in a different house and are wonderful hosts. Her father in law Jim was super friendly and enjoyed showing us all around the farm. We were able to participate in many activities on the farm including sap collection, feeding the cows daily, and petting the new calves that were born.
The wifi is powerful. My husband worked from the farm for several days. There are many walking trails around the property. There are wooded areas and open fields. Sarah also has a small store where you can buy things like honey, hand made soap, maple syrup, and candles.
The clean, beautiful house and the quiet, open space was so wonderful for our family. But what really made the experience special was the hospitality we experienced from the hosts. It was a special time for us and our 4 children, and Sarah and her family made it truly memorable."

It‚Äôs extremely clean and is well stocked with things for any emergency. You can tell Sarah really cares about her guests and the experience they have. The place truly feels like you‚Äôre at a winter wonderland, and I cannot wait to come back. Sarah responds in great time and is always there for whatever you may need. I would give 1,000 stars if I could."

Thank you so much to Sarah and her special family for welcoming us back for another amazing family vacation.

Perfect for families with children, we appreciated the kids‚Äô books and high chair, and we brought a few room darkening blankets for the windows. The house itself is gorgeous ‚Äî you‚Äôll be impressed all those custom cabinets made by Sarah‚Äôs father-in-law Jim! A huge thank you to Sarah for all the thoughtful touches and communications that made for a restful vacation! My kids absolutely loved getting to know the animals, and we learned so much together. We also loved shopping at Sarah‚Äôs honey store ‚Äî YUM. We are so grateful to Sarah‚Äôs family for their hospitality! If you‚Äôre considering booking a stay, the farm is close to 94, so not even winter weather should keep you away. Thank you again!!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the best AirBnB's I've ever stayed at. The home was amazing - wonderfully decorated, so clean, and stocked/furnished with whatever we'd need.

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful country setting. We enjoyed watching and hearing sandhill crains. The two full baths were very much appreciated, both with step in showers. It is unusual to find an AirBnB with the physically accessible entrance and layout that was available in this place. It should be noted that there are no grab bars if a guest needs that added assistance."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sarah‚Äôs place is a beautifully renovated country home, that‚Äôs perfectly located for those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There‚Äôs a lot to experience on the family farm, and plenty of outdoor activities in the surrounding areas. We found the place spotless, squeaky clean. Traveling with a baby is a handful, and Sarah was very kind to help us find everything we needed in the house: high chair, pack‚Äôn‚Äôplay, etc. We would love to return some day, and would definitely recommend to anyone."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I‚Äôve stayed at AirBnB farms throughout the US: South Dakota, Cali, and Colorado. This one tops them all.
Kind people, amazing communication, outstanding amenities.
Top it all with the sunsets, scenery, and stars to inspire you, and you have The Bee Keepers Inn. Definitely want to come back!"

Sarah and her family have made this home feel welcoming, beautiful, and thoughtfully added all the perfect touches that made us feel like we were staying with family, including welcoming gifts. Our kids loved seeing all the action on the farm, and the views from this home are spectacular, especially the sunsets. This place was very clean, and completely exceeded our expectations. Our family looks forward to returning here again and again."

2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"Sarah's place was everything we could have wanted. Extremely clean and stocked with every kitchen appliance, spice, dish, cleaning supplies and toiletries you could think of. Sarah and her husband Ryan were perfect hosts for the entire 2.5 weeks we stayed with them.
Our favorite moment of the day was feeding and saying hello to the cows at sunset. The sunsets are incredible from the deck! Depending on where the cows were grazing, they may be in the field right outside the deck. For the first week we were able to say good morning to the beautiful cows from the kitchen window!
The closest big town is Oconomowoc which has several good take out places and beaches. in the nearby area there are some great bike trails and hikes. We loved hiking around Rome pond and biking down the glacial drumlin trail, we even made a day trip to Devils Lake State Park.
All in all, this was a fantastic place to stay!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We spent the Memorial Day weekend at Sarah‚Äôs lovely home as a getaway from Chicago‚Äôs noisy city life. Sarah and her family were very kind, friendly and helpful. The house was well equipped with everything you may need in your day to day life and also had additional cute touches such as honey treats, homemade soaps and diffusers. It was true remedy spending the long weekend there, enjoying the silence and observing the surrounding nature. We will be returning in the future. Highly highly recommended!"

2020-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Beekeeper's Inn was hands down the BEST Airbnb experience we have ever had! The house was sparkling clean and was full of thoughtful touches that gave it such great character. Sarah and her family are absolutely amazing and they allowed us to roam around the grounds, feed and pet the farm animals, and so much more! Sarah wrote us a personal welcome note, wished our boys good luck with their basketball tournament, and bought them Gatorades for the games! I can't enough good things about this place and the host. We will definitely be coming back. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
2020-03-01,5,Group trip,The home was very clean and comfortable. Only a couple of miles off the freeway and even closer to downtown Sullivan.
2020-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Clean comfortable accomodations
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Beekeepers Inn is a great place to escape to! My family of 4 went here for a weekend and the host supplied us with treats, sleds, and some local tips. House was very clean and appeared more updated or even nicer than photos may display. My boys said the ""pillows were very comfortable and sledding was awesome."" Thanks for being a great host. We loved your property(sunset and horizon to West is picturesque)."
2020-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Awesome! Great location on a peaceful farm half way between Milwaukee and Madison. The house has plenty of classic charm but has been nicely updated with an open kitchen and nice fixtures all around. Sarah has EVERYTHING covered. If you forgot it, she had it there for you. Our kids loved the cows, cats, and dogs and played with the other kids that live on the farm. We had plenty of privacy and the house is so comfortable. Sarah let us snowshoe around the grounds of the farm and gave us suggestions on where to go. We were sad to leave and our kids want to come back next year. Really a great experience. Highly recommended."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We needed a home away from home for our young family and this was the perfect place for us. The house has been updated with bright and clean spaces, updated kitchen and baths as well as some original historic details that make for a cozy and charming feel. Great guidance for out of towners like us from Sarah and her friendly family. Easy to access the highway from here. We look forward to spending our Wisconsin trips here in the future."
2020-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Sarah goes above and beyond to make this place comfortable and ready for your needs. We were two families traveling with small children and the house was clean and ready for them to crawl around without worrying about breakable items on tables, accessible stairs, etc. She even had a pack and play set up for us, board books to read, and extra blankets available (plus a nice bottle of wine for the parents). The house was beautiful, even better than the pictures with a fully stocked kitchen ready for us to cook in. She had placed thoughtful touches throughout the house from extra toiletries to scent diffusers. We were very comfortable there. It made a perfect home base for a weekend visiting the area for a friend‚Äôs wedding. The location was lovely and quiet but still conveniently located just a few minutes from the interstate. Sarah was easy to communicate with and quick to be flexible for our needs. I definitely recommend this place and this wonderful hostess!"
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is so welcoming. Has everything you need and then some. Very clean and nicely remodeled Sarah was super easy to deal with. Can‚Äôt think of anyplace that would have suited us better. Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area. Thanks for making our trip so nice!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was perfect! We loved everything about our stay. The house had a warm, cozy feel so that we felt right at home as soon as we arrived. Sarah had everything we needed inside the house! Every little detail was taken care of! I loved having a charging station in the master bedroom right next to the bed, every kitchen tool I needed was available, and there were plenty of towels, pillows, and blankets. But most of all the kindness of the hostess and her family was remarkable. She quickly responded to all my questions and even delivered some herbal medicine to our door for my sick son. You will not regret staying here!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This wonderful home is in a beautiful setting with every extra touch you could imagine. We also loved that we could purchase local honey, handmade soaps, and sweet treats right in our own backyard at their honey shop Concord Farms. This is a must stay for those that want to get away from the hustle and bustle!"
2019-11-01,5,Group trip,"All the little touches were so nice, if you forgot anything, she had it! Ie: shampoo, blow dryer, q-tips, toothbrushes. Very clean too, I loved it. We even got fresh hamburger meat from a cow! It's a true farm! Her father and law gave us some. Very tasty!"

2019-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,We stayed at Sarah's place for 10 nights. BEST place ever to stay. My husband was in heaven with the cows and the farm since we have cattle also in FL. It was so quiet and the location was beautiful. Sarah's family was so friendly and always accomodating to us. A visit to the honey bee store is a must. Lots of great products to purchase. Home was exceptionally clean with lots of ammenities. Will definitely come back next year!!
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"This cozy farmhouse was the perfect getaway for 5 adults attending a wedding in Oconomowoc. It was fun to be on a farm and still be within driving distance of all the places we wanted to see in the area. The house was spotless and provided lots of open space to congregate and play games. The kitchen was fully stocked, and Sarah even left a special surprise in the fridge for our group! The beds were comfy, and it was fun to wake up in the morning and drink coffee on the deck. We absolutely loved our time together here, and can‚Äôt wait to come visit again!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is simply amazing for all the amenities it offers. The kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, dinnerware, utensils, etc. so if you're inclined to ""eat in"" you needn't worry about meal preparation. Comfortable furniture and bed. It's also sparkling clean - and easy to keep that way. Be sure to ask Sarah about their honey products - they have a ""mini-store"" in their office with honey and beeswax products, along with pure maple syrup. It's great to be able to take home a tasty ""souvenir"" of our stay in Wisconsin!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This is the best Air BnB we‚Äôve ever stayed at. The hospitality is 2nd to none! It‚Äôs extremely clean, comfy and very fun. It has comforts of a home, but a feel of a wonderful getaway. I selfishly don‚Äôt want anyone to find out about this place so we can stay here again without the worry it will be booked. This is an absolute gem!"
2019-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stay here. Sarah‚Äôs place will exceed your expectations. My best friends and I stayed her to catch up, scrapbook and shop in Delafield (just 15 min car ride away.) We loved hearing the cows outside while we were warm and cozy inside the beautifully decorated and impeccably clean home. Sarah has thoughtful touches throughout the home. We were very impressed and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2019-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Loved our stay in Sarah‚Äôs farm house! In a peaceful country setting, this house is super clean with thoughtful ‚Äúextras‚Äù placed throughout. The kitchen is very well stocked with a large variety of dishes and utensils. Lots of extra towels and such available as well. Enjoyed hearing the cows calling hello. :-) Would definitely stay here again if back in the area!"
2019-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"It has been beastly hot and humid in southern Illinois so we decided to try out a new Airbnb in Sullivan, Wisconsin. OMG it was the most enchanting place we have ever stayed in. It was decorated so lovely. Everything was new and the kitchen was something we would have liked in our own home.
It was nice to be in a place that has so many things going on: A company store , Concord Farms, where you can buy handmade soaps, both bar and liquids, maple syrup, and honey products. 44 head of beef cattle grazing in the pasture, hard to count when they all are moving around. Honeybee business with extracting and bottle filling equipment.
The weather was such a welcome relief. It made our 45th anniversary a really enjoyable time. Sarah we will be sure to come back again!!"

2024-05-01,5,Group trip,Mike and Rebecca were the best of host/hostesses! They have a lovely place. I wish I had another reason to pass through their area. I will be telling friends who take their kids to college in that area. Thank you!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The host is absolutely a gem and very communicative. The place itself as describe by two of my team members was ""amazing"" and ""incredible"". You will absolutely have everything you need for a comfortable stay like you are home. And the surroundings are serene and beautiful. Evolves communication was very confusing prior to arrival. Luckily, the actual host/owners made up for Evolve."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This a wonderful and one of a kind getaway nestled on the edge of a forest and by the Rock river. My sister‚Äôs family and I thoroughly enjoyed our four day stay and do plan to return.
My six year old nephew loved it as he had lots to do in the house, with all the board games and the fire place outside.
It looks much better than in the pictures, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a calm yet engaging (trails, kayaking, fire place, etc.) holiday. Above all, the hosts Rebecca and Michael are just superb. They make you feel at home and are always accessible. Lastly, it is a big house and Michael‚Äôs craftsmanship and wood work is on display in every aspect of the house."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Reb and Michael were wonderful hosts. We wanted to stay somewhere quiet that was close to nature without needing to endure the cold all night. Their home was perfect. The entire place was well stocked and totally charming. We felt at home. We spent most of our time exploring the land. The kid especially loved the tree house and riding his bike around the trails. The scavenger hunt was a huge hit. They were so kind to show us the inside of Michael‚Äôs shop and let us charge our car during their stay. It was lovely chatting with them and seriously, the home has privacy, peace and comfort. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing time at Reb and Mike‚Äôs gorgeous river house!

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We participated in a bike race in Waterloo and our hosts were very accommodating and allowed us to store our bikes in their garage. The facility was very clean and unfortunately it rained and we were unable to ride the boat, but it was a wonderful stay. We will return again."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We found Rebecca & Michael's place for a family getaway and we had an amazing stay at their place. This place is an absolute gem! They have a beautiful home with great energy and warmth. We felt so welcomed and at home the moment we entered her home. I would say this home was beyond our expectations. They have thought of every small detail to make the stay comfortable and exciting. Rebecca & Michael is the most thoughtful, fun host. They provided us with all the information we needed and also took us on a pontoon ride on the river, and provided us with the history of the area which was icing on the cake. The property is absolutely lovely and so peaceful. The walking paths and treehouse(!) were thoroughly enjoyable, and we had a Perfect family getaway. Thank you Rebecca & Michael for letting us be your Guests."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I stay in a lot of airbnbs and this has been the best experience. Ten and Michael are wonderful people to be around and have such a beautiful place. They have thought about every detail imaginable. This is more than just a place to stay. It is a destination.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was an absolute gem! My mother, sister, and I wanted a quiet, lovely place to get together, and this home was beyond our expectations.
The rental is the lower floor of the owners' home. I did not find that to be clear in the description. We had the entire lower floor, our own entrance, and a huge patio all to ourselves. There were easy paths through the woods to a tree house and the river, open seating areas, a grill.... it was truly delightful.
The place was sparkling clean, cozy furnishings, well-outfitted kitchen, and comfy beds. The woodwork was gorgeous and done by the owner. We literally stood in front of every door and cabinet marveling!
The owners took us on a pontoon ride on the river, and gave us a history lesson of the area.
We wished we could have stayed longer."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"So glad we found this place for our family! A Wisconsin cabin getaway with all the comforts of home. Close enough to town to enjoy stores and restaurants but hidden in the woods by the river. The bridge you can see is for a bike trail; you can hear light highway traffic but can‚Äôt see it. All the outdoor features were perfect and we didn‚Äôt have to pack anything extra to enjoy a campfire, boating, picnic, and tree house. The kids liked ‚Äúhiking‚Äù on the little trails through the wooded property. The house was clean and lovely, well-stocked with toys, towels and kitchen items. Bedrooms were comfortable and a good size. Host was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Reasonably priced considering everything that is included. Good location to take day trips to beach, biking and hiking. Highly recommend for a family with kids or just adults who want to relax in nature, in comfort!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a great house and what wonderful hosts!
We have fully enjoyed our stay. Beautiful house furnished with great attention to detail, offering quite a lot of space and privacy. The nature with the large and lovingly landscaped (beautiful trails, tree house, ...), the beautiful and gentle Rock River (great tour with kayak and canoe). Impressive craftsmanship with which the house is built. And starting from the equipment, which includes everything imaginable, to the comfortable beds, everything was perfect to relax and unwind. Thank you Reb and Michael for letting us be your guests. We will be happy to come back despite the long journey!!!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The BEST STAY my friend and I have ever experienced anywhere! This place deserves way more than 5 stars! The hosts are amazing - welcoming and available without being intrusive. We were even invited to take a boat ride down the river with them, which was the highlight of our time there. The property is absolutely lovely and so peaceful. The walking paths and treehouse(!) were thoroughly enjoyable, and we had our own large and private patio. The home is GORGEOUS, decorated with love and humor! It is spacious and has everything you might need. The hosts have thought of every detail to make their place as enjoyable as possible. The woodwork has been handcrafted from trees on the property and is unique and spectacular. It is a pleasure to enjoy such detail in care and creativity! We cannot say enough about what a marvelous place this is! Rebecca and Michael are kind and gracious people. We came as strangers but left as friends. We cannot wait to return!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The hosts are incredibly welcoming, helping us with our bags, questions about kayaking and the surrounding area. They live in the upstairs accommodations but you will barely notice them if you wish. The home is incredibly peaceful and the perfect location for a small family vacation."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,What a beautiful place to stay. Rebecca and Michael were wonderful host. Would definitely recommend and would love to visit again. Great experience.

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a delightful family getaway at our host‚Äôs home. An incredibly serene spot in a nature reserve, where flora and fauna abound. Patio areas of the home were beautifully decorated, perfect for reading, conversation or dinner on the grill.
The home is spacious and decorated with a mix of art and comfort. Upon entering, you are greeted with coffee and teas. Don‚Äôt worry, if you think you‚Äôve forgotten something, most likely it‚Äôs already there, from bug spray to sunscreen, plentiful games, books or binoculars, the hosts have it all covered. The kayaks and firepit were such fun and the river a peaceful respite from busy city life.
Michael and Rebecca were kind and generous hosts with a wealth of knowledge to share. From the lookout tower to a magical tiny cabin, we found our stay to be an incredible all around."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The amenities were great had a wonderful time
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable, cozy, canoes, and kayaks! I was fortunate to be their very first booking at this location and expected a couple things to be missing or looked over. The apartment had everything and then some! A full use kitchen complete with sharp knives and cutlery (extremely rare at BnBs), extra spices olive oil and sugar, extra towels (even robes!), artistic decor, comfortable beds & couches, beautiful river views complete with a fire pit, kayaks and canoes to use (+ life vests), and as an added bonus to the well curated grounds is a tree house to escape any insects and bring in the sunrise/sunset from 30' up. Would have stayed longer if I had the time, highly recommend!!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This stay was wonderful - Jordan and his folks Hal and Scarlett were delightful and gave plenty of recommendations that were fantastic! We would love to stay again!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a fantastic, quiet place to stay. As someone who lives in New York City, it was a welcome respite to be able to stay in this beautiful loft. First, the inside was very well done, with loft bed. There was also a nice opportunity for guests to share their stay. One band even recorded an album on Spotify there in 2020 which I can see why - It's very inspirational. The outside is also beautiful as well. A clear night, you can see the starry sky. Finally, Hal was tremendous. Very helpful and friendly. I would wholeheartedly endorse a stay here."
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan‚Äôs place is comfortable, clean and a great place to stay."

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was perfect. We woke to snow all around us and the fireplace was just beautiful. It is a very romantic spot. This surroundings are peaceful and quiet and it really does feel like you are getting away from it.

2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay here, the loft looks even better than the pictures. Very spacious, with lots of windows to see the fields (and sunrise) and very cozy.
Jordan‚Äôs dad welcomed us and gave us very nice tips for food and things to do.
We were here off-season but managed to do a daytrip to Devils lake and Baraboo town, Maddison, visited a family vineyard called Edwin Brix (recommendation!) and also a short stop in Jefferson. Can definitely recommend staying here, it‚Äôs very peaceful and relaxing"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"From first contact to check in, staying at the loft was 5 stars thanks to Jordan‚Äôs prompt attention to the details. When we arrived his father Hal was so welcoming & helpful & gave us some great travel tips for the areas we were visiting. The loft was even better than pictured & was filled with so many unique hand crafted, furniture and architectural repurposed items. A visual delight. The setting was the most serene, quiet, & beautiful country get away ever for us. A perfect place to unwind, refresh, & renew. Thank you!"

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I needed a few days in a relaxing environment, and that is what I got! Loved the property. It had historical charm, everything I needed, and it was clean. It was close proximity to beautiful nature trails which I enjoyed visiting. The couple that live at the farm were super friendly and offered me many good suggestions and were very knowledgeable about the property. The loft itself was super cozy and I enjoyed being in it during a thunderstorm that occurred. The host was very responsive when said thunderstorm caused the internet to stop working and helped get it fixed right away! All in all, great stay!"

2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything about the place was perfect and went beyond expectations. But the best part of the stay was getting to sing and play guitar in the silo. A trip a I will never forget.

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful space! I love the creativity and craftsmanship put in to this incredible airbnb. Jordan's parents live on the property and met me outside helped me carry my things into the loft. They were very helpful with local recommendations and wanted to know if there was anything I needed. Jordan communicated with me via text message and was proactive in checking with me on anything I needed or any directions. He also checked with me on my last day to see if there was anything else I needed, and commented that I didn't need to worry about any cleaning as they would take care of that. I wasn't brave enough to sleep in the loft bed, so spent the night in the wonderful bed right next to the fire. The kitchen was well stocked for any cooking needs, And there are several bar and grills and restaurants within close driving distance. I definitely want to return when I have more time! Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I‚Äôll be coming back again and again to this place. A perfect place for a vacation or work-cation!
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Second time I‚Äôve stayed here during a winter freeze. The first time, two years ago, the host helped shovel my car out. This time, the host jordan accommodated our late check out request and also offered to let us stay longer if we needed due to bad road conditions. The place is everything you need for a winter retreat‚Äîfireplace, fully stocked kitchen, tons of blankets, and beautiful views like you‚Äôre in a snow globe. First time I went with my husband for a getaway, and the second time I went for a work retreat with a coworker. Thank you so much, I will recommend to friends and family!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Would definitely recommend! The place was immaculate, and was remote enough to be nice and quiet.

Everything was just as described and then some. it was very cozy and unique setting. you've come up with a lot of good ideas with your decor and the pride shows. We also really enjoyed the tour of your other facilities on the site and would love to stay again. we will recommend to others as well.

Just a few miles from several different towns. Loved all the natural light and skylights in the kitchen. Very thoughtfully designed. I would definitely like to go back again."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,Jordan communicates promptly with guests and resolves any issues fast! The location is super close to the Glacial Drumlin trail. The loft bed is comfy but a little tough for anyone with issues with heights or close spaces.

2021-12-01,2,Stayed a few nights,This was actually a wonderful loft. The reason for the rating is due to the fact that this should not be rented out in the winter. The furnace ran none-stop as there was so much cold air entering through the wall AC and the French doors that the temp could never make it about 62 degrees. I left after only the first night as for 2 hours I sat in the middle of the space and couldn't warm up.
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"cute, comfy loft. The fireplace was so nice. peaceful and still location. perfect for writing and reading. exactly the kind of R&R I needed."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan‚Äôs place is awesome! It‚Äôs the perfect size and very clean. Driving on to the property is beautiful and you have a nice view of the yard from the loft. Will definitely book again next time we‚Äôre out here visiting family!
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Cozy and quiet place. Nice getaway
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was one of the most wonderful bnb experiences we have had. Jordan‚Äôs dad Hal gave us wonderful recommendations for the area, and they were all great. The reviews are right - the pictures did not do the beauty of the space justice. The sunrise in the morning surrounds the loft, it‚Äôs just beautiful. We had wonderful days out hiking and honestly spent our nights in the loft, curled up by the fire."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I had a wonderful, relaxing stay at Jordan‚Äôs Chic Loft. Perfect for recharging my batteries! And everything about check-in and the Loft itself went perfectly smoothly."

2021-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I said this to the host and it is honestly worth repeating: Everything went amazing. I honestly can‚Äôt think of anything that could‚Äôve been done differently for my stay. This was easily the best Airbnb experience I‚Äôve ever had.

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft in the country is beautiful, quiet and magical! I went on a solo retreat to recharge my body and soul and it was the perfect destination. The bike trail just down the road was so convenient. Jordon built this loft with creative insight and special touches to make the most of the space. I watched the stars at night from the balcony and the flock of wild turkeys in the evening. There also a great firepit to sit around at night. I'll definitely be returning for another getaway!"

2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the nicest and safest place I‚Äôve ever had the opportunity to stay. I received a warm welcome and a wonderful tour of the barn and silo. The kitchen is very well equipped and the washer and dryer came in handy when I didn‚Äôt imagine I would even need them. Very light and airy (if you like to sleep late in the morning, an eye mask might be helpful). A great escape with every convenience, I can‚Äôt wait to return."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you seek a private, comfortable, country get-away, consider this option. The location between Minneapolis and Madison is perfect for touring attractions in both directions."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Listing is as described and similarly to the other reviews, we wish we could've stayed longer! Definitely load the directions in advance and use the link Jordan put in the listing - we initially got a little bit lost because I forgot the listing mentioned this. Hal helped check us in. He was so friendly and gave some great recommendations like Kraemer's Cheese and Jelli's Market. We also had a question during our stay and Jordan was really quick with communication. Would definitely recommend and it's definitely an Airbnb we would return to. Thanks for a great stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's space is beautiful, serene; just as pictured and described. I booked two nights to get out of the city and unplug and it was the perfect getaway!

2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If you‚Äôre on the fence about booking this place, DON‚ÄôT! The pictures don‚Äôt do justice for how bright, cozy, and comfortable this loft really is and we couldn‚Äôt agree more with the other reviews about how wonderful this place is. The giant bean bag, fireplace, natural light from the skylight, and the day bed in front of the TV made it for a perfect getaway vacation!
Jordan was also easy to communicate with and provided great directions for finding the property, and once we arrived, Hal and Scarlet were very friendly and professional in showing us to the loft. While the loft is attached to the main house and there‚Äôs other airbnb rentals on their property, we felt we had complete privacy during our stay."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is an absolute dream. Comfortable and yet spacious. The skylight above the kitchen is just beautiful.

He taught us the history of the barns, showed us all of the bnb properties, and even helped fix my car. I highly recommend staying here!"
2020-09-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"This is a remote, quiet and relaxing area. Very peaceful."
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This loft really is a peaceful slice of heaven. Jordan has done an amazing job renovating such a unique space, and the surrounding countryside is incredible. If you‚Äôre looking for a getaway from the busy Chicago city, this is the perfect place to go!"
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan‚Äôs place is amazing! Unique touches everywhere. Relaxing and serene. Make sure you sit outside by the fire pit and look at the stars! Communication was excellent. This trip was extra special as we got engaged right there in front of the fireplace!! ‚ù§Ô∏è we will definitely be back!!

2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were passing through the area and looking for a reasonably priced place to stay. The apartment has some unique features that are only possible by someone with hands on skill and some creative spark. The bathroom, kitchen counter and both beds are pretty custom made in a rustic chic sort of way. Makes for a unique stay."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan's place was outstanding! It had everything we needed. His Dad welcomed us, and had numerous local tips for places to explore. Our favorites were Stable Rock Winery and Sunshine Brewing Company! We hope to visit again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Jordan‚Äôs place is idyllic. The space is incredibly unique and strewn with handmade touches that enhance the rustic beauty of the entire property. Truly unlike any Airbnb I have ever stayed in (in the best way possible). Jordan was excellent with communication and made sure that his family would be there to greet us and get us checked in (socially distanced of course). All around I wouldn‚Äôt chance any aspect of our stay here and would love to do it again if the opportunity arises
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great clean space, and the perfect size for a band to record in. Loved the stylish furnishings and the host was happy to help when we were in need."

2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This space was perfect for a short get-a-away. The small towns in the area have plenty of local hospitality, but you're also an easy drive to Madison, Milwaukee, or other places to see. The space had everything we needed to relax and feel at home, and having a full kitchen let us cook a few meals to save some money on eating out all the time. We loved the loft, Jordan has added so many personal touches, it felt so comforting. Thanks again! We would definitely come back."
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The pictures as many have said do NOT do the beauty of this space justice.

The quiet and beautiful surrounding country landscape, the natural light and the warm hospitality made this place such a gem!"

2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely wonderful.
The place is so charming and enchanting that despite the beautiful weather we almost didn‚Äôt want to venture out!!
Immediate sense of relaxation and peace when you enter this space, and the other reviews don‚Äôt lie; there are way more interesting details to this Airbnb space than what was pictured.
It was also appreciated that we had a private entrance and we were given extra privacy as this was sort of a miniature honeymoon for myself and my husband. 10/10 and we will be returning. Thanks again!!"
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My jaw dropped once I walked in! I was so amazed on how beautiful this stay was,and the Hospitality was üíØ ‚ô•Ô∏è perfect for a weekend getaway. Don‚Äôt pass it up."

The hand craftmanship is impeccable...absolutely stunning, in so many ways.

On top of all the cool amenities i saw from the pictures, there was so much that gave this place charm! If you want to relax, this is hands out the place to go. We had a great time.

2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I don't think my review can do this place justice. The hosts are some of the nicest people I've ever met. The space was incredibly clean and you can tell they take a lot of pride in their property and home and all the small details in the Airbnb. I highly recommend staying here! Short distance from adorable shopping and eating in Delafield, as well as close proximity to hiking and biking trails. Thank you Jordan and family for having us! It was an amazing weekend!"
2019-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My boyfriend and I had a nice and relaxing weekend at the loft. The space is very quaint and contained everything we needed for the weekend. The lofted bed was even cooler and cozier than we expected! There is a ton of natural light in the space and the view onto the farm is very nice. Nearby is the Glacial Drumlin State Trail which we recommend checking out.
2019-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great little escape in the country! Very private and cozy, we loved it!"
2019-10-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Great spot in the Wisconsin countryside. Lots of wonderful suggestions from Jordan. I recommend exploring the variety of small towns in the area. (I only wish I knew how to play the guitar to take advantage of the guitar wall.)

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Loft is amazing! My husband and I booked the loft for our wedding night and a mini-moon.

2019-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Jordan‚Äôs space was truly wonderful! It was very clean, very comfortable and a perfect get away from busy urban life.
The property is beautiful as well. we were met by Scarlet for check in, she made us feel right at home. We were treated to a tour by Hal, who was very informative of the property and history."
2019-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was the perfect central location for our trip to Wisconsin. We spent time in Milwaukee, Madison, and New Glarus.

2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is incredible. At night we watched the fireflies out the window from the hanging bed and in the morning we watched a storm roll through. So relaxing. Everything I want in a rental‚Äîclean, convenient, comfortable, great host, and the lighthouse farm is really cool. Wish we had more time there."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay here was amazing! The loft had everything we needed for cooking which was super nice. We went on some hikes on local trails, went to a beach nearby, and hung out outside of the loft enjoying the nice weather. There is a bonfire pit you can use if you buy some wood, this was really fun one night. The TV in the loft is also great for if the weather outside is rainy. We had a very relaxing few days and would recommend this loft to everyone who wants to get away."
2019-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was the perfect place to relax and recovery after running the Kettle Moraine 100. His parents both greeted me right upon arrival and were amazing hosts. The place was quiet and cozy. I just wish could have spent more time there to enjoy all it has to offer! I will definitely be back if I have the chance. Thanks for such a unique place.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Although we didn't spend but time to sleep at the Loft, it couldn't have been more perfect for our needs. Communication from booking to arrival was absolutely top notch! Highly recommend :)"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"If we could've stayed for a month we would've. Everything was exceptional from the reservation to the greeting upon arrival to the amenities available. I really could go on & on. The details in the loft were some of my favorites - for example, the twinkle lights on the underside of the hanging bed (I really love twinkle lights). Not to mention the incredibly peaceful nature sounds the second you open the door to the backyard. Hal gave us tips on where to go in the area, we played the instruments hanging on the walls, the giant beanbag more comfortable than my own bed - it's just all so great. We will be back soon!"
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place is magical!!!!! Highly highly highly recommend!!!!! We will def be back!
2019-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Place is just perfect. Super quiet, ultra friendly and super fast commutations, what more could you ask for. Just like being at home without being at home. Best place to take some time out and relax and forget about all of the troubles!!!. One of the best Airbnb I have been to... Jordan is just a great host, enough said."
2019-04-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is the perfect place to relax! But there is also so much to do around the area, whether you‚Äôre interested in breweries, hiking, shopping, city activities, you‚Äôll find it all!"
2019-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My boyfriend and I had a great time stating at the loft! It was a quiet, clean and cozy space for a weekend get away. We went to breweries and on hikes near by and spent time relaxing in the loft. We were a bit too nervous to sleep up I'm the loft, but the futon bed on the main floor was very comfortable."

2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,"The Ernest Inn is a true gem. My son lives in Watertown and over the years, I‚Äôve stayed at almost every hotel and Airbnb around town and nothing compares to The Earnest Inn. It‚Äôs so cozy and comfortable, and has such an eclectic vibe. I enjoy settling in, listening to records and reading books, when not visiting of course. :) Ericka has everything fully stocked, down to the toiletries, coffee and creamer, even a fan for nighttime sleeping - everything you could possibly need for an extended stay. I won‚Äôt stay anywhere else!"
2024-05-01,5,Stayed one night,We were blown away at how incredible this place is!! love all the personal touches. STAY HERE! The pictures don't do it justice!!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"This is such an incredibly cute location. Eclectic, thoughtful and cozy. For anyone who appreciates art, books music this is an absolute treat. The only drawback for us was not having more time to stay there! Kudos to Ericka for the care and details that clearly went into this location. We will definitely be back!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"We had the cutest stay at Ericka's place! My husband and I just kept saying we need to live in a place like this! It was so homey and comfortable. We will be back!
Ericka's collection of records was amazing, and everything was so chill and cozy. We played Monopoly for hours!"
2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"My husband and I booked this for a maternity photoshoot and it was absolutely perfect for that! The aesthetic was perfect - super cozy and clean. It had wonderful window light and meticulously decorated. Every detail was so thought out and it had so much character. We loved it!
We live locally so we didn‚Äôt end up sleeping there just because the bed is a full size bed and I am way too pregnant for both my husband and I to fit on a full size bed.
We visited our favorite spot, Drafty Cellars, ordered a pizza, and played the copious amounts of games available before heading home.
It was a perfect spot for what we needed it for and Ericka was extremely communicative, friendly and a wonderful host!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Always a great place to stay and my favorite when I am in the area!

2023-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"This wonderful space, above a business nestled in cute downtown Watertown, was cozy and comfortable. The host is proactive, helpful and friendly. If you like being in the middle of town, near everything, then this spot is for you. I hope to stay there again."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed one night,Just our style. nice spot for my wife and I to use as homebase for a night out in Watertown. walkable to Elias supper club. loved having the record player and all the plants! great style and location.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This apartment is super cute - a perfect Watertown stop for us visiting our family. We loved being surrounded by plants and playing the records while getting ready for the day. Also bonus points for not having a bunch of dumb rules and fees on the listing.
Two notes for visiting: there technically isn‚Äôt assigned parking. Behind the apartment is what‚Äôs listed as a 4-hour lot. We parked there for the whole weekend without moving and had no problems or tickets, but YMMV.
Also, there are 20 stairs to climb to get in the door, so be cognizant for accessibility.
But once inside it‚Äôs cozy and charming with the exact right amount of amenities. 10/10 would return."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,A perfect and affordable getaway! I'd definitely consider coming back to stay again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My husband and I had a great stay at Ericka‚Äôs place! It was adorable, very clean, and had everything we needed. Watertown was very walkable with several shops and restaurants. We loved the Elias Inn Supper Club!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"My partner and I agreed we wished we could have stayed longer! It was even better than the pictures. The personal touches and ""homey"" feeling (while feeling clean and safe!) really made this Airbnb special. Sitting out on the patio on a cool morning was a highlight of our stay. The bathroom is spacious and even as two tall people, we found the bed comfortable for a night! Ericka, thank you for a great stay! Hope we'll be back sometime."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We were so happy with our stay. Appartment very clean and has fun amenities. Everything was as the pictures show. Ericka was very responsive. We would definitely stay again.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I would stay again in a heartbeat. It was perfect!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"worth every penny and MORE. excellent hostess and accommodations informative, communication pefect"
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Was driving through the last minute and needed a place to stay. So happy I ran across Ericka‚Äôs place! It was so cozy and unique stay. Thank you again!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a charming Airbnb, filled with beautiful vintage appliances and decor. We enjoyed the whole atmosphere, and the location is great for walking to shops and coffee shops - Literatus is wonderful! Ericka was very attentive and helpful to our needs. The only drawback for us was the bed is only a double, which is disclosed in her description and, as it‚Äôs antique, it‚Äôs a little creaky :) we are both tall, so it‚Äôs probably fine for shorter people. But, all in all it‚Äôs a wonderful place to stay, and I highly recommend it. Thank you!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very charming airbnb. Loved the fridge and oven. Retro feel but also modern and updated. Also the back porch was a great place to sit and enjoy the beautful weather. Erika was a fantastic host and responded quickly to all questions
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay here was amazing! The Ernest Inn was comfortable, spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. As antique lovers, we were in awe of the curated mid-century aesthetic and felt right at home. All the live plants really brightened up the space, and the modern amenities made the stay comfortable and homey. We will definitely stay here next time we're in Watertown."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was STUNNING. You can tell that Ericka really put her heart and soul into this place. It was super clean and welcoming. The bed was incredibly comfortable, it was quiet at night, and just overall a great experience. My grandma stayed one day during the day and loved the furniture throughout and Ericka told us it was all made in Watertown! How cool. Definitely will always book when I stay in town!!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Exactly as described. Very quirky space in terms d√©cor. The apartment has everything. Lots of nice little touches. Super clean. Great shower. Lots of little touches made our one nite stay here enjoyable. There was even a Berkey for filtered water. I loved the eclectic mix of furnishing. Ericka provided detailed photos and directions to the apartment. But be forewarned the stairs up to the apartment from the street are pretty incongruous to the apartment. Also know that the bed is situated adjacent to the windows overlooking Main Street and if you like a quiet dark bedroom this may not be right for you.
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was amazing! We loved staying here, and would recommend it to anyone else!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such an amazing place! The hosts thought through every detail to make this place a very unique, comfortable and magical place to stay :) We will definitely be back."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was the perfect getaway for me. I was looking for an inspiration and cozy place to read, work on some art, and rest. When I walked in I was impressed by the high ceilings and light matched with warm wooden accents. I appreciate the use of vintage items and furniture placed so well. The bed was comfortable with plenty of comfy pillows. The kitchen with its old school fridge and stove/oven was fun. I used the stove and fridge and they worked well.
The street was only slightly noisy and to me as expected for being on main and was not distracting. Bathroom super clean.
Small cons that really feel like being picky: the steps to the apartment are steep and more narrow but there is a solid handrail. (This is mentioned.) The couch sinks down quite a bit when you sit on it but in my opinion did not make my stay any less amazing.
Overall the feel of this apartment was exactly as expected and just as pictured. Erika was responsive and friendly. My stay was fabulous would recommend!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Where to begin? This charming loft space includes a peaceful view of the river and was one of the most comfortable AirBnBs I've stayed in - awesome bed, spa-like shower, etc. We loved blasting old records and strolling around the quaint downtown. Lovely place to stop on our way to Milwaukee."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Ericka's place was wonderful!! The design and attention to detail were so well thought out. I hope to stay again soon.
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Very welcoming and historic place. Did not have time to look at everything but Ericka has it decorated very nice and cozy.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Wow! This place exceeded our expectations! It is such a beautiful space! We raved about it to many of the locals and encouraged them to check it out. I wanted to stay much longer - and felt like this truly was great weekend get away. We walked around the charming town and can definitely feel some building energy here in Watertown.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed one night,This was such a cute space! It was immaculate and had everything you could need. The downtown area is also awesome!
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"A very charming, cozy spot that was a great respite tucked in the heart of a small town. Excellent location with easy access to the sights around Watertown. We had a great time walking around and filling our days with new, fun experiences from the Main Street Cafe to the quirky toy shop and even the bookstore Literatus. We especially enjoyed the opportunity to rent kayaks from the community center and paddle along the Rock River on a beautiful summer day."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was such a charming place, right in the middle of downtown Watertown. My son and I especially loved using the vintage typewriter and record player, and we loved how Ericka decorated, especially in the kitchen.
The location was perfect for several walks to Mullen‚Äôs Dairy for amazing burgers and ice cream and to this charming independent bookstore. We were also close to the Octagon House‚Äîmake sure you take a tour!‚Äîand the nation‚Äôs first kindergarten. We also took Ericka‚Äôs advice to drive to Aztalan, and it was fascinating indigenous history. Just lovely!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Absolutely stunning! I felt like I struck gold finding this charming apartment. Great view, large bathroom, so many amenities, good selection of vinyl music, the list goes on. My boyfriend loved the typewriter as he wrote a ‚Äústory‚Äù as we were getting ready for a friend‚Äôs wedding. He had the time of his life writing with it.
The area is super cute, too! I highly recommend going down the block to Main Street Cafe. Amazing food for a steal.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this adorable apartment/loft to friends and family. Thank you Ericka and Jake for hosting us."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I can't say enough about how wonderful this little gem is! It's as beautiful as the pictures show and feels both spacious and cozy at the same time. Ericka and her husband clearly poured their hearts into every detail. Our girls loved it, especially typing messages on the antique typewriter, and there were colored pencils and paper left for them in the desk drawer, which is the type of small detail that means a lot when you're traveling with kids. The location is fantastic - for the kids it's just a couple short blocks to Mullen's ice cream, the library with a wonderful kid's space, a splash pad, and the movie theater. For the adults it's close to bars and to Literatus coffee and book shop. Ericka was super responsive and clearly committed to making sure we had a great stay. We will definitely be back!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,The place is exactly as pictured. It was very clean. We were able to manage the 19 steep stairs leading to the apartment. However the mattress was very very uncomfortable. My husband actually slept on couch. üòñThis would have been the perfect place had we have been able to wake up with out a back ache üò£. Unfortunately the bed is pretty important to us so I could not give it 5 stars. Location was great as we could walk everywhere! The ice cream shop was a favorite!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second time at this location and there‚Äôs so much thought put into this place to make it beautiful AND comfortable. Ericka‚Äôs heart is present no matter where you look. It‚Äôs convenient for anything you want to see or do. It‚Äôs easy to get around in a car and walking is a breeze. All of the added touches are what make it special though. Thank you for another fabulous stay. I highly recommend The Ernest Inn, you will not be disappointed. By the way, it smells amazing when you walk in the door."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"So charming! You can tell Ericka put a lot of thought and care into curating this space. The extensive library, record collection, beautiful plants and vintage details really made it cozy and comfortable. I loved sitting out on the private deck listening to live music coming from the nearby riverfront park. Parking was a breeze and everything was walkable, making it easy explore town. Great experience."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful stay. Beautiful apartment. Loved the record player!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Lovely, cozy place! So many details and lots of history. I wish I had more time to stay and explore Watertown."

2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Such a unique, creative, charming space! There's been so much love poured into it, you can feel it as soon as you walk in the door. I spent an hour just wandering around exploring everything, the vintage fridge and (working!) typewriter, vinyl records and record player, beautiful old books, plus clean and comfortable linens and towels. Everything was spotless, and Ericka was responsive and helpful. Highly recommend!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay at the Ernest was absolutely delightful. The space is full of eclectic charm. Very comfortable and clean. Ericka was responsive and helpful. We will definitely plan on staying here again!

2023-03-01,5,Stayed one night,The Ernest Inn was amazing and Erika was responsive and friendly. You can really see the love and work they put in to this place. The neighbor hood is quite and walkable. I will definitely be back to stay again.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is the perfect place to relax and enjoy Watertown, everything was just as pictured (if not more beautiful in person). Ericka was super helpful with recommendations for things to do and where to eat. I was able to walk everywhere in town from the until and enjoyed being so close to the river as well. 10/10 recommend and would stay again!!"
2023-02-01,4,Stayed one night,"This was a nice one night getaway. The town was a bit dreary and dead but what can ya do! Apartment was conveniently located and exactly as described. We loved the record collection. The front door not having a lock on the Main Street was slightly concerning. Other than that, space made with love."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This was such a unique place to stay. We absolutely loved it and we'll definitely be booking here again. Ericka had thought of everything to make our stay perfect. The historic restoration and atmosphere of the inn was beautiful and relaxing. Next time I plan on staying longer. üòä
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ericka's place is unique. Reminded me of an apartment typical for college students but it had better furniture. The decor was cool, lots of wood and metal. It was very clean. There were interesting books to read. There was a turntable and a nice selection of records to play. The appliances were real vintage; nice to see such things still in use. The shower was new and had nice hot water and good pressure. The location was convenient to all of the East Main Street shops, which we enjoyed very much, and Ericka was a great communicator. The stairs were a daunting challenge for this old lady, but well worth the climb. Thanks, Ericka!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ericka was so responsive and polite, the place is gorgeous and just as described."
2023-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Had an amazing stay at the Ernest Inn! Loved everything about the space, location, and Watertown. A great middle-ground between Milwaukee and Madison with plenty to do (even in the winter). Enjoyed the local recommendations and coupons left by the hosts. One-of-a-kind space and worth every penny!"
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,A wonderful experience from start to finish. We felt right at home with our stay at the Ernest Inn with all the amenities and vintage charm. Erika has done a great job restoring the property to a ‚Äúmust stay‚Äù in Watertown.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the most unique and neatest place I have ever stayed. The attention to detail is amazing.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"At the risk of gushing ‚Äî what a charming, delightful, PERFECTLY styled place. Every detail attended to ‚Äî what was old was in stellar condition and so fun (records and record player, working typewriter, vintage blankets and coffee mugs) and everything new kept in line with the 1960‚Äôs Frigidaire and icebox and farmhouse sink. Perfect amount of space for 1-2 or 3 and I could literally walk anywhere in the 9 blocks of historic district and LPS a mile away. Everything was neat, clean, the plants were beautiful, comfortable bed everything was just perfect. What a delightful space."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Vintage meets industrial feel with a splash of rustic charm greets you when you visit this little gem! There is so much character to this place from the little balcony overlooking the river to the album collection and back to the vintage appliances! It was an amazing stay. Thank you!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a great space and amazing location. Felt really comfortable. The vintage turntable and albums was a nice touch. Ericka was really on top of communicating, was very attentive but, still allowed me to feel like I was in my own space. The place was impeccably clean and you can tell they focus on the little details to make you feel very much at home. I thought traffic noise was going to be a problem but, it was quiet thru the night. loved the live house plants."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"Visual masterpiece. Truly special experience. Not to mention clean, safe, comfortable, functional. We loved it!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A very beautiful and uniquely decorated place to stay. Very clean and quiet. Highly recommend. Lots of attention to detail to make you feel comfortable and welcomed. Not a typical sterile airbnb. :)
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Fabulous place- enjoyed breakfast at a nearby cafe.
2022-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"You will ‚ù§Ô∏è this place! The vintage charm is enough to make you want to turn off all your devices and escape to a familiar, slower paced time. I enjoyed the record collection and turn table, lovely plants and the incredible decor and furnishings. Ericka was an incredible host. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book this awesome place!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The location is excellent. So convenient to restaurants and shopping. I am in town for Riverfest and this is the perfect location. The apartment is set up for everything someone could use or want. I will definitely be back next year.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beautiful stay (EXACTLY as pictured), friendly host and welcoming locals! Wish we had planned to stay a couple more days ‚Äî tons of antique shops and bars in the area. Recommend going to Mullen‚Äôs and Drafty Cellars."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was everything pictured and more! There were so many lovely touches to the Airbnb, it was such a cool space to spend a weekend in. We enjoyed exploring Watertown and the nearby area; golfing, antiquing, dining, etc.
Ericka was an amazing host, she provided great and thoughtful communication throughout our stay."
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,This place was SO cute. Absolutely wonderful experience all around.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My second visit in just a few short months because it is so charming. It's full of whimsy, great music for the record player & every other thing you would need for the best stay: books, board games, 3 ways (at least) to make coffee & a ton of information on what to do/where to go locally. <3"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"This place was probably my most favorite stay hands down. Authentic period restoration with great craftsmanship and intricate attention to detail. the juxtaposition of the hallway leading up to it enhances the ambiance of oasis when you walk through the door.
There is some mild street noise but one of the best touches is a large box fan. The mattress was a bit firmer than I prefer but it did not impact my sleep quality at all.
The entire place was spotlessly clean. The use of the antique storage is genius. The toiletries are high quality. The coffee was well chosen.
we will be making a trip out of Watertown just to stay at this place again!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"The studio apartment is so very stylish and cute! I absolutely loved all the exposed brick, wood, and metal accents. So much character! My 15 year old son (who has never expressed any opinions about interior design) wanted to just move in and live there. The whole downtown area is charming as well. Great stay!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such beautiful and peaceful space! Loved my time there, great location. Ericka was super helpful and accommodating. Will definitely stay again if I‚Äôm in the area."

2022-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Great apartment for a single or couple. Very comfortable and private. There was a little noise from traffic but didn't wake me up. I hope to stay here again in the future. Ericka was very responsive to messages.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a gem! Loved the entire place! Our Lil family enjoyed it so much! awesome amenities! We loved the industrial vintage look so much! We even got some great ideas for home projects! Plus so much natural light!

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,The host was great. Gave us all the information we needed. Had information in the building so we had no question. She took great care of the place.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay at the Ernest Inn was wonderful! The apartment is just as it looks in the pictures, very cute, and the kitchen is well appointed. Ericka was very patient with all of my questions, and her suggestions for places to eat and visit were spot on! There were neat little touches throughout the apartment that made it so much fun. The Ernest Inn was one of the cleanest places I have ever stayed, and we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend there."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Charming place, perfect for our needs. I was worried about parking but it wasn't an issue. Traffic noise was a bit distracting, but that's to be expected when you stay downtown. We'd definitely stay there again."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A lovely little treasure of a spot! Ericka is very communicative and helpful, and the Ernest Inn itself is like a sweet little art piece. A wonderful experience!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is amazing! What a find!
I was looking for a space to spend a couple of days on a solo vacation and could not have been happier. Everything about this place is charming.
-VERY clean! I usually have a keen eye around cleanliness, and I was impressed with how spotless and well-maintained everything was.
-Record player! This brought me so much joy being able to explore the albums. I loved the experience.
-Such consideration- everything you could possibly need has been considered and provided. Very happy with all of the amenities.
-Great communication- Ericka was quick with responses and incredibly helpful.
I will definitely be visiting again, and I've already shared the Ernest Inn with my friends and family."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Just an absolutely magnificent little place to stay!
It‚Äôs cozy & quaint & the detail in how everything is put together was seriously just the best.
They put up extra air beds for us & were so quick to communicate everything.
I can‚Äôt wait to come for a longer stay. ‚ú®"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"Ericka‚Äôs place is the perfect spot to relax, unwind, disconnect from your phone and enjoy yourself! It‚Äôs location is perfect to many great shops and restaurants along Main Street too!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,"What a lovely place! The vintage details are done impeccably well with what I can tell is an expert eye for design and a flare for artistry. When you pair this with the highest level of craftsmanship it culminates into a perfect storm of aesthetic exquisiteness.
The place was incredibly clean (and I am very picky about this)
I loved the bright bathroom and what a nice shower, super relaxing -nice pressure & temp
If it‚Äôs wrong to be goo-goo over gorgeous floors then I don‚Äôt want to be right
The tall ceilings are out of a story book- soooo dreamy
The kitchen with functional vintage/retro appliances is SO fun
The little deck is cute with string lights
Loved the antique credenza, table, and vanity
Hand-made curtains blocked an ok amount of light (I‚Äôm super sensitive to this)
Temperature of place is perfect
Couldn‚Äôt believe the place didn‚Äôt smell funky since it has so many interesting antiques but it honestly smelled just fine
Easy peasy lockbox check-in
Netflix/Prime/WiFi worked GREAT
Stairs are a tiny bit steep so if you are other-abled be aware
Games/books/typewriter/coffee/record player/albums/BR essentials are just a few of the many extra touches provided
Make sure you are aware of the bed size and that it is for people who appreciate hard mattresses, but an air mattress is also available if you so choose
I always appreciate all-white linens which were all quite lovely
Free parking on side street that‚Äôs not far from the door leading up to the place
This is above a cute lil hair salon on a main street but the traffic slowed by 10pm
Hosts were very very friendly and kind in communication on the app, which is always a plus
Loved all of the woodwork and tin throughout
We couldn‚Äôt stop obsessing over how well maintained & beautiful all of the living plants were through the space‚Ä¶someone has a green thumb & it shows
SUCH a cool spot!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Loved this vintage feel space. Erika went the extra mile to make it feel homey and smell beautiful. Her attention to detail shows! Would stay there again for sure!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The coziest, most peaceful and stylish getaway. Board games, record player with so many vinyls to choose from, candles, cute shops and eateries close by‚Ä¶everything we could‚Äôve asked for! It was the perfect retreat for a little R&R. The hosts are so thoughtful and sent recommendations for great eateries and activities around town. You won‚Äôt regret booking here!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautifully decorated apartment with everything you need for a relaxing get away.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed one night,Accurate profile - great space. Highly recommend. I hope to come back!
2022-03-01,4,Stayed one night,"Don‚Äôt let the look of the shared stairwell to the loft scare you, the loft itself is very clean, stylish, and well stocked in terms of kitchen tools (even a crock pot and a pizza oven)! There are lots of places to eat & shop in walking distance, including a cute game/book store with a cafe inside. We enjoyed our stay at the Ernest Loft!"
2022-02-01,5,Group trip,"Such a beautiful, unique and very clean place. We enjoyed the vintage decor and Ericka's accommodations were amazing. We would recommend this place."

2022-02-01,5,Stayed one night,The Ernest Inn is a charming and cozy stay. It has such a large personality. The retro theme and appliances were definitely cool! It took me back to cooking at my grandmas house when I was growing up and everything was in tip top shape. Everything is perfectly placed and decoration blew every expectation out of the water. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!! Help from the host was fantastic. 10/10 recommend!
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Comfortable, unique stay. Communication was excellent. Ericka was kind and courteous throughout the planning process to ensure our stay would be great."

I am very happy with our choice of venue and the backgrounds were perfect for my boudoir photoshoot!!!
Thank you to the owners. This place is a dream. I will be back just to stay in the future!"
2022-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Ernest Inn is an environment you will have a difficult time leaving! Every detail is so well placed and thought out. Watertown is such a treasure and this is the perfect place to come back to after exploring all the city has to offer!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,My husband and I had a lovely getaway while the grandparents were in town! Even one night away felt like a real treat. Everything was clean and so thoughtfully done for our stay. Thank you!
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,"I loved my time at the Ernest Inn! My mom lives only a few blocks away so it was the perfect location while I was in town for Christmas. I know Ericka and Jake did almost all the renovations on their own and I was blown away by their talent and creativity. The d√©cor give the place a rustic and idyllic vibe that made me feel like I was living in a Netflix Christmas movie (lol). Having grown up in Watertown, I loved all the local touches... the photos of Riverside Park, Tivoli Island, and the Octagon House, and the pamphlets of local walking tours which I had never known existed. The bed was super comfy and I got my first 8 hour night of sleep in a long long time. The amenities were generous: coffee from a local shop, shampoo, toothbrushes and floss, you name it. The place was clean and tidy with great natural lighting.
Ericka's instructions were concise and easy to follow. She reached out and asked how everything was going during my stay, and was quick to follow up with all my questions.
I grew up in Watertown and come back pretty frequently for visits. My mom has a one bedroom apartment nowadays and I don't love crashing on the couch, but hotels can feel kind of lonely and impersonal especially during the holidays. The Ernest Inn was the perfect solution: cozy and inviting. I'm very grateful that this kind of place exists in this location. Thanks again for the awesome experience, Ericka! <3"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing loft in historic building right downtown. We did the self-guided mural walking tour and ate our way down Main St. The loft has so many nice touches, like nice soaps, shampoo, toothpaste and cool art, and the best vintage stove. I highly recommend a stay at the Ernest Inn!"
2021-12-01,5,Stayed one night,Love The Earnest Inn. It is one of the coolest places I‚Äôve stayed with Airbnb!

2021-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved staying at The Ernest Inn! It's very cozy, with incredible vintage decor. We had a fun stay, playing vinyl records and board games, and relaxing with Netflix on a comfy leather couch. Ericka was an amazing host; very responsive and shared helpful recommendations for restaurants nearby. It's a great location downtown, but if you're a light sleeper, keep in mind there are lights coming in from the street and occasional sirens. We would definitely stay here again!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Staying at the Earnest Inn Was great for me, as I was in town visiting my family and friends, who lived close by. Unit while acquainted and charming. Be prepared to climb some stairs! The place is very clean and would highly recommend it!"

2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The style and warmth of this Inn is wonderful. It was a perfect place to get away for your first anniversary. We were just looking to get away from the business of everyday life, and we got just that and more! Erika was wonderful and recommended having Moon Rabbit (a local pop-up restaurant) come in and cook us a romantic meal. It was hands down the best experience I‚Äôve ever had on a getaway. The food was absolutely divine, and afterwards we got to sit back, relax, and enjoy the flat. 11/10, can‚Äôt wait to do it again!"
2021-10-01,5,Stayed one night,Went to visit my sister in Milwaukee and hike the Ice Age Trail. This was right near the trail and not too far from Milwaukee so we gave it a try. It did not disappoint. Pictures do not do it justice. So beautiful with little details that really mattered.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is a beautiful place! Pictures do this place justice!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Very welcoming and attractive apartment. Felt right at home from the moment I arrived.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,This is one of the best Airbnbs I have had the pleasure of staying in! Cannot recommend it enough.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Ernest Inn is a charming loft in the heart of Watertown. It was very clean and well maintained/stocked and the highlights were the vinyl records and games for me. It's within walking distance of tons of eateries and vintage stores. Ericka is super gracious and excellent with communication.
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"I recommend this vey charming remodeled vintage apartment. It is in downtown so can be a little noisy on a weekend night, but that is a minor problem. Well provisioned and very attractively layer out. We had a great time."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was the perfect quiet getaway for our small group of friends, who just wanted some time to hang out together. Lots of cute shops and restaurants around the area, and Ericka was very helpful."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Wonderful place. Must see and experience. Like time travel to the past with modern amenities. Clean and cozy!
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most BEAUTIFUL place my boyfriend and I have ever stayed at. We will 100% be coming back and recommending this place to any and everyone. So cozy and we felt right at home.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"This apartment is one of those places you wish to find during your trip.
It‚Äôs beautifully designed and decorated, it has everything you need to relax and feel Home. I would love to go back and stay more days. One or two nights is not enough. Super recommended."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Highly recommend this spot to anyone! The apartment is exactly as pictured with a Lotta great character! Easily positioned between Madison and Milwaukee, near state parks, and lots of cute restaurants and shops. A great option for a quick getaway or a short drive to popular Wisconsin destinations! Would highly recommend!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a great place to relax, enjoy the open space, listen to some records or read a book over coffee, while enjoying the central Watertown location. Erika is a great host and very communicative. A perfect place to stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I use AirBnB a lot when I'm traveling for my musical work, so I have a good basis for comparison. What Ericka has done to transform this place is magical--her artistic tendencies inform every aspect of the space. So spacious and airy. The old school kitchen appliances are a fabulous touch. Yet for all the vintage appointments, this was perhaps the most comfortable, inviting AirBnB I've ever booked. I look forward to a return visit."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Gorgeous place! Beautiful town! We loved our staycation!
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This apartment is wonderful. Excellent location in the center of Watertown. I had everything I needed and more. Very clean and comfortable.
2021-08-01,5,Group trip,"We had to make a last minute change on our vacation and I‚Äôm so glad we found Ericka‚Äôs place! It‚Äôs such a unique little apartment - very cool decor and feel in there! The entrance is not very nice looking though (steps going up to the apartment above the storefront) and smelled kind of smoky), but don‚Äôt let that turn you off - once you‚Äôre inside the apartment it‚Äôs so nice! I enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the morning to read, and we were very thankful for the washer/dryer! For us it was just a quick overnight while traveling so I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a lot to do in the town or not - there are plenty of restaurants though, and a nearby grocery store. Ericka was very helpful and responsive. I highly recommend it!!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,"Absolutely fantastic, my fourth stay!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A nice place in a nice location. I do not hesitate to recommend and we will certainly stay there again someday.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed one night,Ericka‚Äôs place is beautiful and charming and she was very kind and accommodating.
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"I really enjoyed our stay here and the care the owners have put into it is evident everywhere. I've stayed in many nice AirBnBs but some certainly take a minimalist approach to furnishing, kitchen accessories, etc. This place is move-in ready and felt much more like a home than just a place to stay."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a very unique and comfortable place to stay! Check is was very easy and the place was really clean. Location downtown was great, close to breakfast and coffee shops. I would highly recommend the stay here!"
2021-07-01,5,Group trip,Well-located and convenient to everything Watertown. Cozy quarters with a uniquely hometown artisan feel. Affordable and comfortable. Enjoy!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Beautiful and lovingly decorated! So many lovely vintage and antique items add personality to the space. Ericka was quick to communicate and had suggestions for things to do in the area. The downtown location was very convenient too.
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"I booked Ericka‚Äôs place for a quick stay to get some time away during a virtual conference. She communicated quickly and was able to host an immaculately clean Airbnb with 24 hours notice.
As many mentioned- her space is well designed, highly functional, and had everything I needed to focus and recharge. I appreciated being able to get away and would love to stay again should I need a quick retreat."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Amazing place and amazing host, you‚Äôd be foolish not to stop by!"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wow, this place was incredible. The design features were immaculate and it's clear that Ericka takes a lot of pride in offering up the most beautiful Airbnb we have seen in Wisconsin. It's close to coffee shops, a movie theater, some restaurants and the Watertown river walk which we enjoyed on an early Sunday morning stroll. It's a great place to getaway even just for a night, and we loved all the options for board games and the record player! Would definitely recommend."
2021-07-01,4,Stayed one night,Beautiful open plan downtown apartment!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,Great value
2021-07-01,5,Stayed one night,"My stay at Ericka and Jake's gorgeous apartment was one of my last nights on a nearly 3,700 mile road trip. I had stayed in quite a few spots, and was getting accustomed to the cheapness of many hosts, both in effort and materials, to make a space beautiful or a stay special. I've always loved the idea of staying with local owners and keeping my money in a community rather than it going to some global hotel conglomerate, but I was beginning to wonder whether AirBnB really offered anything special anymore.
Then I stepped into Ericka's ""Ernest Inn"" in Watertown. I spent the next ten minutes freaking out about how much effort, care, and good taste had gone into beautifully creating and appointing this lovely space. I took pictures and video, sending them to family and friends. The vintage, well-maintained kitchen appliances were trip back in time for some of them, especially.
I almost felt guilty for renting the place at the price I had. An absolute steal of a value. There is no better way to stay in Watertown or anywhere nearby in Wisconsin. Wish the owners all the best with this property and everything else they develop."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This Airbnb was absolutely gorgeous! The large windows let in so much natural light, so the space was well lit throughout the day. You can tell that every piece of furniture, every appliance, and every wall piece was intentionally selected (or crafted!) and meant to be there. Ericka was a great host and a fast communicator, and she provided numerous recommendations for our stay. Don‚Äôt miss out on the vinyls at Paramount Record Shop and books at Literatus Books! We had a great time at Ericka‚Äôs Airbnb and highly recommend it."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,Quaint little space for a relaxing getaway.
2021-06-01,5,Group trip,Beautiful ü§©!!
2021-06-01,5,Stayed one night,"We loved the retro feel of the place and hope to come back and stay again! My boyfriend could not stop staring at the awesome retro appliances and thumbing through their record collection. We both wished we'd booked more than one night, so it looks like we'll be making a trip back, hopefully soon!"
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"beautiful space and excellent hosts. the apartment is airy and cool with tall ceilings, natural wood and hand wrought details throughout. it‚Äôs a testament to the value of craft and the working with the hands."
2021-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was great! Right next to a river walk with lots of baby ducks in early June. The decor in the place is lots of fun and interesting antiques. The bathroom and whole inside of the apartment has been freshly remodeled and is beautiful. The place was immaculate. I plan on going back.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great airbnb!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very good communication and very clean space. Would absolutely stay here again if I needed somewhere to stay in the area.

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Wonderfully decorated unit in cozy downtown Watertown. Ample amenities, easy parking, and an extremely comfortable couch."

2021-05-01,5,Stayed one night,"Stylish and cozy apartment with great amenities! Communication with the host was easy, as was the check in process!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Just the greatest ambiance, very beautiful woodworking, a nice collection of vinyls to listen to including Edgar Allen Poe stories, the vintage vibe is just about in everything including the iron! We loved staying here and will definitely be back! The hospitality from Ericka I rally appreciate, she took time to continue to update me on vegan friendly options nearby and was so helpful and really caring! Love love love this stay!"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved this charming Airbnb in downtown Watertown. Enjoyed watching ducklings on the river from the balcony, walking to coffee shops and restaurants and shopping. Don‚Äôt be put off by the not-so-charming entrance and steep stairway, once you get there, it‚Äôs well worth it. Washer and dryer in the unit was very useful, lots of chic touches and vintage appliances made it so fun to stay in. We will definitely be back. Thank you!"
