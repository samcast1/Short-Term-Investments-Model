2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a blast at Shelby’s place. It’s beautiful and squeaky clean. There’s tons of stuff to do nearby but the house is still tucked away. It was perfect! We’ll visit again.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,A beautiful light and bright open plan space with nice bathrooms. Gorgeous Kentucky lawn outside and peaceful setting. Cute bunnies grazing every morning!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Second time here and we truly feel right at home!!! I absolutely love the big back patio and it's so fun to watch TV out there, especially with kids who can get their energy out on the back lawn! Highly recommend this house, and we'll definitely be back!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Our stay was perfect for the few days we visited Mammoth Cave. We tried many area restaurants and loved Garcia’s the most. Wish we could’ve utilized the outdoor space but the weather during our stay was unseasonably cold.
2024-04-01,4,Group trip,"Beautiful home! We just wish there were more accommodations shampoo,towels, cleaning supplies ect."

2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Magnolia House provided a tranquil setting and fun, open kitchen space for having a family Thanksgiving. Shelby was very responsive, even to a request for a folding table on the night before the holiday. We loved every bit of our stay and would highly recommend it!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,The perfect place for a family getaway. We will be back!
2023-10-01,3,Group trip,This house is beautiful but if you have yo use the stove oven or even the toaster the fire alarm goes off. We came in after a long day of driving and used the toaster to make my son a bagel and the fire alarm went off. Later we made some noodles the fire alarm went off again. It happened another time for a bagel again. I messaged the host to let her know the issue. She just said yea we've heard that. Well great wish you would have fixed it or mentioned it in the listing. I think its very inconsiderate personally. So if you dont have anything to cook you maybe be ok. But if you have an issue this owner offers no solution. And isn't even apologetic.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very nice home pretty close to Mammoth Cave and other attractions!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I travel a lot to this area for work and I will always check to see if this home is available. I absolutely enjoyed my time here. It feels like my home away from home.

2023-01-01,5,Group trip,While traveling to town for a family funeral we were looking for a place we could all stay. We found this place and our request was accepted immediately.

The condo was fully stocked with high end amenities. Our stay was an experience we will never forget. It is a hidden gem located on the beautiful square of downtown Glasgow.

Thanks Rachel it was super nice at your place."
2023-08-01,5,Group trip,"My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Rachel’s place. We were coming in from a nine hour drive, tired & ready to relax so we were thrilled with how simple the check-in process was. The neighborhood was very nice & safe feeling, the home appears to be older so the floors squeak & it has that old home smell (which I personally LOVE). There wasn’t any carpet in the house so for anyone who has any kind of podiatry issues bring comfy house shoes. The home is very well maintained with modern appliances & the AC worked fantastically which was a big deal to us hot natured people :) overall highly recommend."

It is the perfect house for little ones as there was nothing for our toddler to get into or break, which made our stay even more relaxing.

It is the cleanest home we have stayed in in our travels from Washington DC to California. Located in a quiet neighborhood in a nice little town about 25 minutes away from Mammoth Cave National Park, it is close to I-65. The kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, utensils and even extra frozen food. The washer and dryer are in a huge laundry room. With two bedrooms with king beds, two bathrooms and a darling room for a young girl, the house is large enough for most families. We didn’t spend any time on the back porch, but I saw a table, chairs and a fire pit on the porch overlooking a nice backyard. If you appreciate a spotless, spacious yet cozy Airbnb, Rachel’s place is perfect!"

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Came here and visit over the memorial day weekend and we could’ve not chosen a better place to relax. The Airbnb was located in a peaceful neighborhood, although there was some heavier traffic at times but nothing too crazy to distract from the peacefulness. We exceptionally loved the use of the porch given that it was screen in, which is rare for most Airbnb accommodations these days. We utilize the screen porch and were struggling able to enjoy the peaceful nature. That was the neighborhood and this secluded spot. The Airbnb had everything that we could’ve needed for our stay and was well equipped with everything. It is also a very dog friendly location although we did not have a dog with us this visit. Overall, it was a really good place and worth the trip!"
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved the cabin and the surrounding natural space. Just what we needed. The mix of weather kept us in the first day, and I appreciated the slow cooker as we made a batch of lentil soup and watched the fire all day. Well appointed kitchen, lots of clean towels, fun space.
Location proximity to the lake was also great. Would love to stay again."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My family of four LOVED this peaceful spot, which we used as a launchpad for caving, ziplining, and visiting the Corvette Museum. It was really nice to have a quiet place to return to each evening. We really enjoyed roasting marshmallows by the fire out back. Freddie Joe has clearly invested a lot into creating this cozy haven, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. He even went the extra step of inviting us to his farm so the kids could see his farm animals! So fun! Thank you, Freddie Joe!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was amazing, even better than expected. I found myself looking around even at the end of our vacation at all the fun character of the house. If you're looking for peace and quiet, this is the place. The house is situated on a cliff a couple miles in from the main street (fenced in yard), and pass quaint farm land to get there. You can even hear the cows mooing in the background from the deck and screened porch. Freddie Joe was an awesome host. He checked in on us regarding firewood. Extremely hospitable. Everyday we took a walk down the road, climbed down to the creek to search for fossils. We explored Mammoth cave NP a couple days (hiked Cedar sink trail, Domes and Dripstone cave tour & more). Went horseback riding @ Jesse James. Ate lunch at Yanseys in Glasgow. Hiked DryFork gorge (primative and beautiful!). We also just hung out at the house, sat on the deck with a glass of wine,
had fires,played games, and watched movies. Perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. TY FJ"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful cabin, so peaceful! We loved the wood and stone. We enjoyed both the fireplace and the fire pit, and the surroundings were beautiful.

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We absolutely loved our stay and would go back in a heartbeat. It was a peaceful cozy rustic place with everything we needed. The location is great if you're planning to visit Mammoth Cave, State Parks or just looking for a place away from it all.

2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This place is AMAZING and just what we needed. The closing date for our new home was pushed back and we needed a place right away. Freddie Joe was able to accommodate a same day rental and check in. The house decor had something unique in every room. The boat in the entrance hallway was really cool and I didn't even notice until day 3. The surroundings had a Gatlinburg feel and you can hear the creek flowing while sitting on the back deck. The screened in porch was also very nice. The house is only about 6 miles from various fast food places and Dollar General at the end of the road. It was very clean and convenient. We would definitely stay again!!

2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful, relaxing, cozy and peaceful stay! We immediately fell in love with this cute, cozy little cabin. Extremely clean and comfortable made it easy to relax. Attractions, shopping and restaurants are a short drive away. We had everything we needed at the cabin. We shopped at the farmers market in Glasgow and prepared a farm to table meal and had everything we could possibly need to prepare it. Very peaceful and quiet for napping or sleeping. We enjoyed sitting on the screened in porch and listening to the sounds of nature. WiFi works great so we were able to stream and watch movies.

All beds are super comfortable, even the Roll-away bed! The cabin is less than 10 minutes to Glasgow where there are several restaurants and grocery stores. Less than 15 minutes to the lake. Wifi works great and Doordash delivers. The closest neighbor is across the road. The cabin has a large backyard with firepit. We truly enjoyed our stay and consider ourselves lucky to have experienced this special cabin. We will definitely stay here again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We we’re in the local area this weekend to finalize details on a property for our relocation there.
We had had a reservation with another host that had encountered some problems and had to be changed at the last minute.
We found this amazing place and Joyneta was very accommodating and helpful in our last minute accommodation needs.
The lodge itself is a fantastic experience with lots to see inside and the views from the porch or fire pit at night are just as good.
It’s well worth a visit if your in the local area. Fantastic host and amazing property."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Went back for a 2nd time to Kentucky and HAD to stay at this cabin. Listed as described, very clean and fully stocked with whatever you may need. Very peaceful with quiet surroundings - if looking for a place to stay this place is a MUST!

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,A great place to stay we loved it close enough to everything but still away
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We absolutely loved this place! It was so unique and beautiful. There were many nice touches and we quickly felt right at home. It’s on a beautiful piece property and we enjoyed relaxing on both decks after a day of adventure at Mammoth Cave. It was perfect for our dog as well. Plenty of space for her to run around. It’s perfectly located as well with many dining options within 10m or so. We didn’t want for anything…wish we could’ve stayed longer!
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay. The house is very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed sitting on the decks and listening to the creek down below. About a 30 minute drive to Mammoth Caves. We would definitely stay here again.

Having a grill was a plus and we loved hanging around the fire pit. Kitchen had everything you needed, I liked that the full bathroom wasn't in one of the bedrooms, beds were super comfy. Loved it!"
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place is a gem! Lovely country setting is relaxing and enjoyable but Mammoth Cave and Barren River Lake are just a short drive away. We loved being able to adventure outdoors during the day and come back to a cozy, secluded place where we could grill dinner and hang out by the fire."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming! Clean & comfy, roomy, and country chic. We enjoyed the deck & the porch, the indoor fireplace & outdoor fire pit. Very quiet and leafy, but convenient access to groceries/restaurants/attractions. Kitchen great for cooking/eating. A truly unique & remarkable place!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is beautiful. It creatively incorporates various types and colors of lumber on the inside for a very interesting interior. The setting is wonderful with trees all around and a pleasant porch to sit on and read a book or simply listen to the wind through the tops is the trees. It setting is relaxing and quiet.

The outside deck overlooking the river is a very peaceful spot to relax."
2022-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This property has so much character! The views were amazing and it was perfect for a family weekend getaway, with day trips to Mammoth Cave and the Corvette Museum."
2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Amazing hidden gem close to home. Great views, plenty of space, and one of the best interior decors of any rental we’ve stayed in. Freddie Joe was friendly, responsive, and hospitable. Definitely will be back."
2021-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Skaggs Creek cabin exceeded all of our fall getaway expectations! It was super clean, quiet and cozy. It had such a rustic charm and made our Kentucky weekend perfect. Highly recommend!!!"

2021-10-01,4,Group trip,"Very clean, and beautiful cabin."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This airbnb is located just south of Glasgow in a beautiful area. One can walk down the road to Skaggs Creek. Within easy travel to the best of restaurants in Glasgow. The screened porch was super. The large fire pit was well stocked with wood. There was an abundance of towels in the bathrooms. We will be back again!

Beautiful home, clean, comfy beds and rooms.
Just perfect!"
2021-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a cute little cabin. Perfect location in relation to Mammoth Cave and other outdoor attractions. Wonderful if you have pets traveling with you. The yard is so nice to have and there’s plenty of room inside for them to play. We did have some issues with the WiFi, however I think this was likely due to the rainy weather. We didn’t miss it at all though, there’s plenty of areas to sit and read a book to relax."
2021-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Fantastic place! Simple, comfortable, clean, and well-located. My two young boys (three and four years old) had a great time climbing up and down a stowable ladder to a little loft above the kitchen. The hosts Freddie and Joynetta were very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed! Would absolutely stay again in the future!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Our stay was a dream. The cabin is as cute as it it in pictures-actually, even better in person! Check-in was a breeze-just lovely. Air con was on and very cool and inviting. Everything was very clean and tidy and all rooms had extra bedding and large TVs mounted on the walls. Two bathrooms which was very nice. The main bathroom is very spacious with beautiful double sinks. Lots of space, with two porches-one covered one not. Lots of room to dine in each as well. Kitchen had everything we needed and more. Plenty of ice as well. We met our hosts who were beyond helpful in recommending places to see and restaurants as well. Excellent communication through the app as well. We loved every minute of our stay and are already planning our next adventure."
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We really enjoyed our stay! Everything was clean and the cabin was super cute. We will be staying there again in the future.

2021-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful time at Joynetas cabin! It was a lot bigger in person. Very clean! This cabin is in a great location with so many trees around the property. We went to mammoth caves, lost river cave and the corvette museum about 30-40 minutes from the house. Close to Walmart and other stores in town incase you need to stock the fridge! Joyneta had quick communication with us which I appreciated ! Thanks again for letting us stay here ! Highly recommend!"
2021-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Wonderful cabin in the woods with everything you need to get back to nature in comfort. Wonderful architectural touches throughout the cabin giving it a true lake house feel. Very spacious for my teenage daughter and I and very convenient to get to the Mammoth and other caves, Bowling Green and Barren Lake. We look forward to coming back soon!"
2021-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin with lots of character! We found this to be well appointed and stocked. The interior is designed with a clever combination of rustic woods, metals and materials to make for a one of a kind experience. There's a canoe that hangs to support light fixtures, deer mounts and fun decor in every room to give that true cabin feel. A full kitchen and spacious bedrooms made this place a comfortable stay for excursions into Mammoth Cave."
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"cute rustic cabin. close enough to explore the caves nearby, but still more private than staying at your local tourist place. the owners were very nice and helpful with any questions we had"
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Awesome!!!
2021-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place is roomy and comfortable. Nicely appointed - the photos are accurate. Would recommend.

2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We stayed here for a trip to the Mammoth Caves and the Corvette Museum. The location was great for both. The cabin was very clean. We would definitely stay here again.
2021-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,We loved staying here! It was the perfect place for our family with 5 kids. We had all the amenities we needed but had the experience of camping. We especially loved having the firewood ready and waiting!
2021-05-01,5,Group trip,This cabin was one of our favorite places to stay in Kentucky. It was so homey and we had everything we needed. Freddie Joe was an amazing host and the location was perfect for our purposes. The pictures do not do it justice!
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This cabin was beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay. The deck overlooking the creek was perfect for mornings and evenings.
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Loved the cabin, it was a cozy and clean place i enjoyed staying at"
2021-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place is absolutely perfect! The pictures do not do it justice. It's much larger than I expected & had so many nice touches. The gas fireplace & outdoor fire pit were wonderful. (Freddie Joe even had firewood all stacked & ready to go for us!). We had to call him twice due to our not-so-good with technology issues: couldn't figure out how to turn on the gas fireplace or the TV; he answered us very quickly & even offered to drive over if we couldn't figure it out (How nice is that?!). I always judge a place by the ""thoughtful"" items they offer & this place had it all! Coffee, coffee filters, sugar, creamer, salt & pepper, soap & they even had ice cubes made already! (why more places do not do these things is beyond me). The cabin itself had SO many beautiful touches from when they redid the place: the wood work was amazing. We loved the screened in patio & the other patio that was open and literally in the woods was so relaxing & peaceful. I highly recommend this wonderful getaway. We will definitely be back! And I love that it's pet friendly."
2021-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful stay! Super quiet but close to town if we needed anything. Loved it!
2021-05-01,4,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable stay in a beautiful location. The view is great. Had everything we needed.
2021-04-01,4,Stayed a few nights,Cute little getaway! And he even brought firewood when we needed it!
2021-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Highly recommend!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What an absolute gem! The photos don't do it justice. Not only was the place extremely clean and put together, but the design touches and extra amenities made it so comfortable and relaxing. Enjoy your morning coffee on the back porch while admiring the river, watching the birds, and listening to the neighboring cows. We made the quick drive to Cave City each day during our stay, and enjoyed some great Glasgow restaurants just a few minutes away each evening. 10/10!"
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Outstanding location and amenities! Freddie Joe was very responsive and provided wood when we needed it!
2021-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Absolutely gorgeous cabin :) Tucked peacefully away in the beautiful countryside.
2021-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Freddie's Joe's place is a gorgeous rustic-chic cabin in the woods that is roomy, comfortable, spotlessly clean and near area activities. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will return!"
2021-01-01,5,Stayed about a week,Very cozy place to stay
2021-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The lodge is a perfect home-base if you're visiting the area. It sits tucked into a wooded area that makes for the perfect scenery. Our dogs loved having the yard to roam and it was far enough away from the road that we didn't have to worry. The lodge itself is one of the most unique places we've ever rented. You can tell a lot of hard-work has been put into this place. The fireplace is wonderful! We used it every chance we got! We would definitely rent Freddie's place again if we ever come back through the area.
2021-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a unique, warm, peaceful, and inviting space! We enjoyed ourselves so much and made many lasting memories spending the holidays here. The lodge was warmly decorated for the holidays, Christmas tree and all! We were able to make the short drive to Mammoth Cave national park for some gorgeous hiking. Highly recommend!"
2020-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We love staying at this cabin with our family of 4 and dog. This was our second time spending a week there. It is so cute, and they had it decorated for Christmas as well. We enjoyed drinking our coffee each morning by the fireplace. There is plenty of space, the beds are comfy, and the owners are very helpful. I highly recommend this cabin."
2020-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was absolutely lovely. Beautifully decorated surrounded by lovely wooded scenery. The fireplace was one of our favorite features; a perfect place to cozy up to when it was cold outside. The space was a great fit for our family of 5 (two kids and a dog). If you are looking for a quiet place to get away and relax, this is a great fit!"
2020-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay at the cabin! Originally a Woodsman’s Lodge in the 1940s, Freddie Joe has updated and refurbished the entire place into a warm, welcoming, rustic yet modern cabin. The photos truly don’t do it enough justice, side and back porches, great living room, fully stocked fire pit. The attention to detail and cleanliness were much appreciated as well as Freddie Joe’s communication as a gracious host. We came to visit Mammoth Cave but would love to come back just to stay at the cabin again!"
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very spacious and cozy!
2020-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved this cabin. It was so roomy. My family of 5 had a blast. The construction of the cabin was so charming. It was super clean. It had everything we needed. As other reviewers have said, the pictures do not do it justice. We honestly wished we could have stayed longer."
2020-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay and visit the caves in the area. Cabin is very nice.
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We were in town for a family reunion and the cabin was perfect for our needs. Loved that we were able to bring our dog with us. We would have loved the backyard to be fenced in so we didn’t have to keep him on a leash the whole time we were outside but the screened in porch was a great place to hang out.
As for our overall experience at the cabin we definitely give it 5 stars. We will stay here again."
2020-09-01,5,Group trip,"Upon arrival, the place was spotless. We were comfortable and able to rest and relax after a long day kayaking. Great place to stay"
2020-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place!
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"A well-maintained bungalow, charming and whimsically decorated in one-of-a-kind decor. We had plenty of space to pull in and park, lots of room in the sparkling-clean refrigerator, plenty of beds (we were only 2 but could have packed 5, or more with the extra cots), the luxury of a bath and a half, more-than-adequate heating/cooling, and two porches for lazy coffee breaks. Peggy answered our questions quickly and in an endearing way. If you plan on exercising, bring a mat because most of the floor below the scatter rugs is poured concrete. The neighborhood is calm and quiet, and the location lies surprisingly close to stores and the nearby caving attractions. Amenities which were not listed but were available included extra outdoor chairs to accommodate full family grill-outs/marshmallow roasts. A memorable experience with plenty to do and enjoy despite the rain."
2020-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lovely cottage on the cliff which syncs very well with Ecosystem in a quaint rural setting. Was perfect for our family including our K-9 child. Peggy was super sweet with very prompt responses and check-in and check-out was hassle free.
2020-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great decor and comfortable! The view out the back porch is lovely as it overlooks the forest. The screened in porch is great for dinner as it keeps out the bugs!
2020-08-01,5,Group trip,"As other leaders have said, it looks so much better in person than the pictures online. Great, secluded location and not too far from amenities. Would definitely recommend for a peaceful weekend getaway!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed one night,It was lovely and clean. The host was quick to communicate and made check in a breeze.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great cabin, would definitely repeat!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,Very nicely decorated & just a short drive into town. I loved that it had an open porch to get some sun & an enclosed porch to keep away the night time bugs. Everything was very clean.
2020-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cabin is very nicely decorated and in a very quiet part of town. We enjoyed the porches and decks. The cabin has central air, which came in handy for our stay in July. Very nice place to stay!"
2020-07-01,5,Group trip,"Our family stayed at Peggy’s place for a few days while traveling through Kentucky. As some of the other travelers mentioned, the pictures in the listing do not do this place justice. It was very spacious, comfortable and a beautiful unique property like no other that we’ve stayed at. It was well crafted out of reclaimed wood, with a large open porch overlooking the woods and river below, and another large screened in porch in the back of the house for hanging out or eating outside. Peggy communicated very quickly and gave us some great tips for thing to do in the area, and we would definitely stay here again!"
2020-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peggy's cabin was even better than we expected. I highly recommend staying in her adorable place. We stayed for a week, and it was perfect for our family of four plus a dog. There was plenty of room, and we thoroughly enjoyed the screened in porch and deck."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,"This house is adorable! Pictures don’t begin to show how cute it is. One bedroom with bunk beds and a small sofa (full bottom, twin top), one queen bedroom, 2 twin fold out beds, and a couch provided plenty of room for our group. And the outdoor spaces were great! The smart tv was handy when we had a rainy day that was planned to be spent outside! Plenty of towels, dishes, chairs, etc."
2020-06-01,5,Group trip,Great location! Very peaceful and host is very nice and quick to respond. Only thing I would improve is to put a house number sign at the driveway. Our group missed the drive way trying to find it
2020-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Awesome place to stay. Great getaway from the busy city life. Beautiful country!
2020-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Perfect stop to get away from the city. Beautiful cabin and secluded backyard for a fire.
2020-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Great private getaway when you’re looking for a quiet weekend
2019-12-01,5,Group trip,The Cabin is wonderful! Our group of 5 stayed here for a night and loved everything about it. Peggy was a great host and made everything so easy. 5 Stars! We will be back!
2019-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Such a nice quiet relaxing place to stay for a weekend getaway!! We felt right at home and the house had everything we needed.
2019-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This space looks so cute in the pictures, but honestly it is so much better in person! It was the perfect little cabin, and I wish I could’ve stayed longer! On top of that Peggy is a fantastic host, very kind and attentive! I would definitely recommend this stay to anyone!"
2019-10-01,5,Group trip,"You should definitely stay at this place if you are around Glasgow. The photos don't do it justice, it was much better than we expected."

2019-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice cabin with great finishes located not too far from great BBQ.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,Pictures don’t do it justice. Close to the Barren Lake. Private. Very responsive and inviting.
2019-07-01,5,Group trip,"Peggy's place is very nice, spacious, and the hosts are very accommodating. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and the linens were clean. We just went for the weekend, but wish we could have stayed longer. The location is nice and out of the way while still being close enough to many great activities. We only had 2 vehicles, but there's plenty of room for other vehicles, including watercraft. I highly recommend staying at Peggy's place. If in the area again we will definitely try to stay again."
2019-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,The inside of the cabin is very unique with the reclaimed wood. The pictures do not do it justice. However kitchen is not fully stocked. There is no microwave. The location is great for many area attractions and Peggy is very attentive.
2019-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cabin was very cozy and welcoming. GPS takes you straight to the driveway which is easy to get In and out of even with pulling a pontoon boat with a big duramax truck which we had no issues with. The area is very quiet and is a nice area to stay!!! The cabin has plenty of amenities, coffee pot, dishes, cookware, towels, washcloths, soaps, etc.... Peggy was very accommodating and very responsive and the cabin is extremely clean and comfortable"
2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Everything was very nice

2019-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Wonderful clean place with everything you need. You will never find a a motel room as nice and private as here. I would recommend to anyone.
2019-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This spacious cabin was beautiful inside and out, the photos do not do it justice. Everything was clean and welcoming. Not too far from Mammoth Cave National Park and Bowling Green."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Owners were very responsive!
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place in the heart of downtown with walkable coffee shops and restaurants.
Good location and ample room for a family of 5."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed one night,Great place. Great host.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed over a week,Such a fantastic host with great customer service - definitely recommended. Thank you Beth!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed one night,Great location in lovely downtown Glasgow. We enjoyed walking to local businesses. A clean and comfortable stay. Very nice!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed one night,Very clean and very well kept. Excellent host with great communication.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed one night,Beth made it so easy to check in. She gave full and clear instructions on how to get in. The place had such an interesting layout and was beautifully decorated. I had never been to Glasgow but Beth sure made me want to come back!
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great communication with Beth! The location is perfect with walking distance to some locally-owned restaurants and the Plaza Theatre where we saw a show. The place was immaculate and clean. Beth had left special things, like water, coffee, and popcorn. Parking was easy. We plan to book again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"Great place, extremely clean and spacious!"
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful stay for our cousins graduation! Christy was so attentive to us and made us feel like we were right at home! I would highly recommend anyone to stay here if/when you’re in the area!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our stay was fantastic. We were in town for our nieces graduation and the location was very close to town yet far enough out that it was very peaceful. The house was amazing so clean and had everything furnished. We made dinner one night and it had everything that we needed. We enjoyed our stay and will be using it for future stays.
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, spacious, well stocked home and property. Host was a prompt communicator. Quiet at night."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful clean house will highly recommend it
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful house. Everything worked as it should. Was spotless when we arrived. 10/10 recommend. Not far from town either.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The home was very clean and felt updated. Check in was easy, host was very responsive and messaged to check in on us during our stay. There was a welcome note and basket with goodies and a toy for our dog. The location was close to everything we wanted to do. Water pressure is good, and we never ran out of hot water which was appreciated. There is a lot of space on the property, but it is not fenced and while the road is quiet, cars do go fast, so you need to be aware with kids and dogs. The beds were comfortable, but very soft, so if you prefer a firm mattress keep that in mind. The kids room had blinds but no curtains, so it was very bright in there in the morning. It also had a very small dresser and no nightstand. Luckily their clothes are small. It was warm when we arrived, but got cold quick and the HVAC kept up easily. Overall we were comfortable and enjoyed our stay."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We felt right at home at Christy’s place! This home was even better than pictured and had more amenities than we thought! Will definitely stay again next time we are in town!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy’s AirBnB has been the best one we have stayed at so far. We could tell Christy puts a lot of effort into maximizing the guest experience when you stay at her place. The home was squeaky clean and cozy. The linens were super soft, the beds were comfortable and everything we needed was easily available. The location was perfect, and for being so close to town, it was quiet and secluded. The layout of the home had plenty of space and we all had room to spread out and relax. Four of us came down primarily for hiking and cave exploring, and this was the perfect fit. This will be our first choice the next time we come down. Thank you very much for letting us stay Christy!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"It was better than expected! Had a great time with the family. The place was just as described and better, everything was nice, clean and well decorated, makes everyone feel like we were home. Christy is a great host and very responsive when needed, will definitely keep this in mind for our next trip!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This home and the hosts were absolutely amazing!!! We had a goody bag full of snacks and waters, a sweet personalized card, a book to give us all the info we needed on the home and area, and my favorite part was a journal that guest write in about their stay. It was so neat to read the entries from previous guest and put ours in the journal as well. The beds were so comfortable, the kitchen was very well stocked, very clean bathrooms too. We loved the split floor plan. The teenage boys (and their noise) were on the other side of the house LOL. The day we left we realized we left something behind. Christy was so accommodating on making sure we got this item back when we came back through coming home. Christy was very communicative and polite as well. It was a wonderful experience. When we come back we will definitely be renting this home again.This was our first time staying at a “home” through Airbnb. Our stay was so amazing that from now on we will rent a home when we go on vacation."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,The house was very clean! The kitchen was well-stocked. The treats provided were appreciated. The house had a lot of space. There were plenty of storage for all of our things. The deck off the back of the house was nice. The location was very close to town but it had a country feel.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Christy's place was super clean and just as nice as the pictures showed. Everything you could need for a long-term stay (mine was a month) was provided. Even with the location of the house being close to town, it still felt VERY private. Backyard was Aspen (dog) approved but if your dog ""wanders"" be warned that people speed down the street VERY fast. If I'm ever in Glasgow again, Christy's place would be my 1st choice for accommodations."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a wonderful weekend stay at Christy’s place. Came into Glasgow for a family visit and it was perfect location and great for the dog! Would highly recommend staying here if you’re in the area!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Christy and Jason’s place was the perfect getaway for me and my fiancée! It was close to all the things we wanted to do in the area, and also the perfect place to stay in and just chill. Christy is an incredibly responsive host who truly cares about you having a positive experience in her home and that’s clear throughout the house! We had everything we could have needed and I’m sure if there was something we would have needed that the house didn’t have, Christy would’ve figured it out for us! The place was also spotless when we got there! Thanks again Christy for opening up your home to us, we hope to be back again in the future!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Perfect! House was pristine and incredibly cozy. Our hosts made everything easy. They were completely accessible while never interfering, and were so gracious when we asked for help. By far the best Airbnb experience I’ve had. Can’t recommend enough."

2023-07-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"This was a lovely place to stay while visiting Mammoth Cave.

It was so nice that Christy left us a personable note with snacks and water! She has a binder for people of restaurants and things to do in the area!
Some places would recommend in the area:
In downtown Glasgow on the square! Fine Arts Bistro is one of our go to places to have breakfast or lunch!
If you enjoy wine go check out the Bluegrass Vineyards! They have a large selection of wines! The tasting is 6 samples and a snack for $6.
Cave City: coffee and creamery
Cave City pizza: is open Thursday-Sunday.
Horse Cave: Farmwald’s Restaurant and Amish Bakery."

2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Christy is a wonderful host! We had incredibly responsive communication from before we booked all the way through our trip. Everything in the home was well thought out and well appointed. The things we forgot were already there. We were greeted with a warm welcome and felt right at home and cozy the whole time we were there. We traveled with our 3 boys and it was the perfect home for us to feel comfortable yet still spread out. We would absolutely recommend staying at this property and we would stay here again if and when our adventures bring us back to Kentucky! Thank you Christy and Jason for sharing your home with us to make vacation memories in! ❤️❤️

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Scrupulously clean. She left good snacks and fruit. I just need to point out for others that the stairs into the place are very narrow. Bed comfy. A/C good
2024-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My friend and I adored this place! The fresh flowers in the rooms and the adorable balcony are what made us truly love the space. It was exactly what we needed and was in such a cozy area. Would highly recommend!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Amazing place to stay and Mary Jane is such a wonderful host…HOWEVER…The stairs leading to the loft apartment are extremely narrow and windy. If you have difficulty with stairs I caution you with this choice.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Mary Jane's place is the best we've ever stayed in! It was clean and comfortable, and boasted a ton of extras, like snacks, fruit, and fresh flowers. There was even a plush dog bed provided. We loved the layout and decor, and the location was perfect. Mary Jane really goes above and beyond, and was super friendly, responsive and generous. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This is a beautiful and well thought out airbnb. It’s located on the top floor of a historic home with a private entrance and private balcony. There were so many touches to make us comfortable and feel welcome - cream in the fridge, kitchen supplies, comfortable bed, human treats and a bed for our dog. There were great suggestions for restaurants - all walkable. We went to Garcia’s which was delicious. Our host was more than welcoming. We wanted a place to stay while we explored Mammoth Cave; this spot was perfect."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lovely place to stay, we we're greeted with fresh flowers and funky decor! Mary Jane was extremely responsive and a great host. The property was just what we needed: private, quiet, clean, and spacious. This historic property has a lovely bedroom, bathroom, large living room (complete with comfy futon couch, fireplace and TV), fully stocked kitchenware, gas stove, breakfast nook with coffee and snacks, and outdoor patio. The stairs up to the apartment are steep, so this might not be accessible for guest with some physical limitations. Would definitely stay here again! The perfect spot for visiting family, enjoying the cozy downtown area, and a great place to stay if you're looking to visit any of the gorgeous local caves or Mammoth Cave."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Wonderful tree house. Host was easy to talk to and let me checked in early. Would love to visit again.

2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This is a very nice space, exactly matched the photos and description. It has a very modern, clean, urban loft feel, with touches of homey and relaxing decor. As a cyclist, I especially enjoyed a few bicycle themed decor elements! The place was impeccably clean and well stocked with anything you could need. Beth was super easy to communicate with. It is well located right off the downtown square close to several restaurants. We tried three of the recommendations that were left in the welcome instruction manual and they were all great. We stayed here on a planned visit to Mammoth Cave National Park, which is about a 25-30 min drive - Glasgow and this unit was a great find. Highly recommend."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really nice loft! Very up to date furnishings. Balcony on rooftop was a real plus. Would highly recommend this loft to anyone staying in or around Glasgow. Only 2 negatives would be nice to have latches on the bedroom doors and would of been nice to have another door added that locked at top of the entry staircase (just to feel more secure) but that isn’t a deal breaker or prob even doable just an added thing that I feel would make it perfect :) the place was very very clean and it was nice to have water in fridge on arrival.
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Forget about any other place. Beth’s place is the way to go. Every little detail made me feel right at home. The giant tub was amazing after a long day of hiking and even the small little balcony was fun to look out and watch the town. Wouldn’t hesitate for a second to stay here again!!

2024-02-01,5,Stayed one night,"Beth is a great host, she was very responsive and accommodating. A great urban flat in the middle of town. We stayed in the winter so we didn’t get a chance to enjoy the patio space, but it looked amazing. Home and decor was very inviting. Would stay again!"

2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location to explore downtown restaurants, coffee shops, and local live music on the weekend.
The place was better than the pictures and we quickly got settled in and felt right at home. We mostly ate out, yet did cook in one evening and we found all the kitchen tools that we needed. Attentive hosts!!!

The rooftop patio is such a great place to relax and unwind at the end of the day. I also loved the amount of windows and natural light that came in. The window sill was a great place to sun yourself and read a book!
I will be coming to Glasgow every couple months and I look forward to booking this beautiful loft of Beth's again real soon 🥰"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The Balcony on Broadway is beautiful and walkable to many of the shops and restaurants downtown.
The space was clean and well put together. There were waters in the fridge for us upon arrival and K-cups for the Keurig in the morning. Beth had also left a list of local coffee shops, restaurants and attractions.
Being downtown and near the police and fire station, it could get a bit loud.
I would highly recommend this stay for any one looking to be close to Mammoth Caves!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed one night,"The comfort and beauty of Beth's properties begins at the acquisition, design, location, and construction phases. These properties are architectural masterpieces. The structural bones are so well done that the properties will be as beautiful in 2063 as they are today.
Furnishings, Art, linens, appliances are all there to comfort the most discerning occupants. Balcony on Broadway is the perfect place to renew relationships with loved ones while experiencing a true Mayberryesque lifestyle."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We have stayed at many Airbnb’s and this was one of the nicest by far! We stayed here for our wedding night and it could not have been a nicer place to come back too. I wish we would have had more time to enjoy the awesome patio upstairs!! Such an awesome place!
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We LOVE this property!! This was our second stay and we will definitely stay again!! We LIVE THE rooftop deck with fireplace!! We ate at “a little Taste of Texas”, and “Sweet Basil” and highly recommend both!! We had the opportunity to meet Beth, our host, and she was delightful!! She even took the time to show us a few potential new properties that she is working on in the area!! We’re excited about those properties for future stays. Love, love, love, it!!

The apt has its own terrace which we had dinner on while watching the sunset on the 4th of July.
It’s conveniently located near very good restaurants, has parking and Beth answered any question we had about the area. It was a wonderful wonderful stay and we can’t stop telling people about this gem."

All of the appliances are modern and brand new! The balcony really sets the space apart. It was a super chill place to hang out each night. The patio furniture was super comfortable and overlooked Broadway. Our host was very responsive to our questions and helped facilitate our check-in. We would not hesitate to stay here again!"

2022-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We stayed at Beth's Airbnb for a family trip to Mammoth Caves over Memorial Day weekend. It was an easy drive to and from the national park and a great place to rest and relax after a long days of hiking and adventure.
Beth was flexible, responsive, and informative. We appreciated her allowing us an early check-in time so that we could unpack, and stretch our legs before our first cave tour. When we had questions, she answered promptly.
The accommodations were immaculate, and comfortable. We loved the exposed brick throughout. It was clear that all of the furnishings, kitchen ware, and appliances had been carefully curated. The use of space is excellent, which feels larger due to the ample natural light. The kitchen was open to the living area allowing us to engage with our children while we prepared meals. However, the space we appreciated most was the balcony area, which had a propane fire pit, comfortable and durable seating, and a large table which coverts into a shuffle board or table bowling. In the evenings we enjoyed dining outside and then putting a movie on for the kids while we enjoyed the tranquility of the evening on the balcony. In the mornings we enjoyed our coffee up there with the rising sun. It was wonderful.
As a bonus, the location nearby the town square , which seemed to have something going on every day. On Friday evening we walked over to the square where we enjoyed free live music, food trucks, and perusing the local shops. On Saturday morning we enjoyed the Farmer's Market in the same spot as the night prior. The combination of being close to everything but having the respite of the balcony was the perfect balance, allowing us to decompress and get the most out of our stay."
2024-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,we had a very enjoyable stay. right location for our needs
2024-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home was amazing, clean and cozy. My family loved the stay and would love to stay at the home again."

Location was great matched the listing and was extremely quite! locals are extremely friendly! I rented melanies place for a week long fishing trip with my dad. Location was min from the lake and min from town! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Glasgow Ky area!
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Nice place. Quiet countryside. 10 minute drive to town for stores / restaurants, 25 minute drive to Mammoth Cave NP."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We could not have had a better stay. From start to finish, everything was easy. Melanie made us feel right at home in her house. We are a foursome of elderly men on a golf outing. We’ve decided to come back here next year"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Such a convenient location, yet still a peaceful country setting. Melanie provided a wonderful coffee bar, and we enjoyed many sunrises and sunsets on the back porch, not to mention the wildlife. We will definitely stay there again!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,Thankful for Melanie and the space provided for our employees. They enjoyed their stay and felt at home. Thank you again Melanie. 💕
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was one of the cleanest Air bnbs I've stayed at. Our family felt right at home!!
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved staying at the house! It was spotless, also well appointed and maintained. We particularly enjoyed Melanie sharing the history of the house with us! The area is very rural and beautiful. Melanie kindly recommended some great local events and area attractions. We needed a relaxing break, and our stay at the house was perfect!"
2024-01-01,5,Stayed over a week,definitely recommend
2024-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"felt at home, quiet, clean, fully stocked kitchen, perfect location Close to town, easy instructions"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a wonderful experience to stay two nights in Melanie’s farm house. We will recommend this house to our friends who are interested in visiting Mammoth Cave National Park.
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"What a great find. Being originally from Glasgow and now moved away, it is always difficult to find locations that are both convenient and affordable for long stays when coming back home.
Luckily, South Fork Acres is both of those and much more!
Melanie was an extremely accommodating host who was always responsive to our messages and attentive to our needs. She even went through extra efforts to decorate the home for our Christmas season stay, a deeply appreciated touch that made the home feel like I was staying at my own grandmother's house.
With plenty of space in both the home and on the property to stretch your legs, this is an excellent place for both work and play. I certainly enjoyed reading my morning emails in the dining room with a beautiful view of the songbirds in the rear hayfield.
After staying in a few properties in Glasgow, I'm confident Southfork Acres is certainly the best combination of space, proximity to town, and overall value. Can't wait to stay again!"
2023-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very homey feeling, comfortable, spacious! Close to the venue we were traveling too! Fit our needs perfectly!"

2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We loved our stay here, even extended and extra night. This is a true home from home.
Would highly recommend and stay again.
Great property, great host.
Thanks so much :-)"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I can see why rated a solid 5! Spotless house with all the amenities you need. Super fast WiFi too. Really can’t add anything else positive that hadn’t already been said! Highly recommend.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love this place! This was our second time here and we will be back. Very clean and spacious.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had been building a house for 2 years and had not had any downtime. It was peaceful and we needed rest and relaxation. We didnt have to look at any projects to be done.
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Clean, beautiful home in a lovely peaceful setting and amazingly only 5 miles from many eateries and stores.
Wish all properties were this fantastic!"

2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Quaint house on a beautiful property. Extremely clean, nice layout. Very peaceful sitting on the back deck in the evenings."
2023-07-01,5,Group trip,We felt right at home at this charming farmhouse. The neighborhood was very safe and similar to our home town. Stores and restaurants were a short 5 minute drive away.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"What a wonderful, peaceful country home, surrounded by farmland and trees. The home has a wonderful large dining room, spacious living room with large TV, 3 great bedrooms with comfortable beds, and 2 full baths. The kitchen was ample with everything we needed. The house was decorated so darling and everything was very clean! But the best part was sitting out on the back covered porch! I enjoyed hearing the summer night birds and bugs sing their evening songs. The next day, it was so wonderful to sit on the covered porch with a cup of coffee while it rained and listen the wind blowing through the trees. Aaaah....SO restful, quiet, private and peaceful!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent location for exploring all of the caves. Loved the home like feel. Beds very comfortable. Very clean with lots of extras and a well stocked kitchen. The sunsets are amazing. Melanie was very helpful and responsive. We give this location a 10 out of five if we could. Would definitely stay again.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed about a week,We had a lovely stay at Melanie’s home and would definitely stay again. I would recommend this location to anyone looking to stay in the Glasgow area
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had trouble finding the place, but through no fault of Melanie's!
I somehow mistook the address listed on her Air B&B host profile for the address of her Air B&B itself. They are two different properties!
Fortunately, the two addresses were quite close together, and she was very helpful in getting everyone redirected.
Other than that, it was a very easy and pleasant stay! The property was clean, tidy, and comfortable, and Melanie was very accommodating. We would happily stay there again. Thanks, Melanie!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a perfect spot for us to attend our family reunion. It was very clean, close to everything we needed and a beautiful setting. We will definitely try to book again next year!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were there from Florida to do family history, clean headstones in a newly- discovered family cemetery, and visit and acquaint ourselves with all the cousins who had stayed in the area. This house was beyond our expectations from other past properties we have stayed at. It had 2 comfortable queen beds, and 2 twins in the 3 bedroom house. It had grab bars in the showers. The house has been updated nicely, and the covered back porch
with 4 comfortable chairs was so great for sitting and partaking of the country quietness. A big plus for us, as we are retired, was the wheelchair ramp which ran from the drive to the porch, making it so easy to roll suitcases without lifting up stairs. The little things like
air fresheners, night lights, keypad for door, laundry detergent and fabric softener sheets, black wash cloths for make-up removal, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc. and of course a full-size washer/dryer. They all made our stay just like home. And very clean! Thank you!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed about a week,One of the nicest Airbnb's we've stayed at. We loved the quiet country setting. Beautiful home. Very clean.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was perfect for our little family getaway. Close to things to do and restaurants, and plenty of space for our family to spread out and enjoy our time there."

2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great host. Great llace. Very responsive.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house is a quaint and rustic home on a beautiful piece of land. This quiet residence had pristine surroundings and a great view of the stars at night. Melaine's notes mentioned that they were in the process of updating the property, and I'd be excited to see the changes if we ever passed back through. We used it as a home base while visiting Mammoth Cave National Park, and we stayed just long enough to check out some of the local and delicious cuisine in Barren County."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My wife and I came in for a funeral and found Melanie place to be very homey and just what we needed my wife is a country girl so she loved the rolling hills around the home we would book it again if we are in the area

2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was a perfect location for the family and the accommodations were exactly what was needed for a weekend stay.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Melanie’s place was perfect for our young family. The area was quiet, private, and we felt safe for our kids to explore and play. The home itself was very comfortable and cozy. It was so easy to get cozy and unwind after long days at Mammoth Cave.
We travel pretty well as a family so I always have a small pantry with us and that did come in handy at Melanie’s. There was a full coffee station which was greatly appreciated and the kitchen had a great variety of appliances.
If we find ourselves back in KY we would love to stay again!"
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,Nice comfortable home
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,I truly enjoyed my stay. The description of the place and pictures were completely on point. Very cute place with a nice layout in a very quiet location. I appreciated having a few snacks provided. Nice horseshoe drive so u don’t have to back out on to the road. There was a throw that I was able to use while watching tv at night. I was also grateful for the full length mirror on the inside of the door of the bedroom. So many Airbnb’s do not have full length mirrors. Melanie left a little history of the place that I found interesting to read. I def recommend staying here. There is also a really nice back porch that would be a nice place to enjoy the outdoors when weather permits. Don’t let this place slip by.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,We loved staying in this farm house! It was so clean and cozy with close proximity to restaurants. Thank you for sharing your house with us. We would definitely stay here again.

2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The home and surrounding area is better than advertised. The proximity to not only family activities but shopping, dining, or relaxing exceeds expectations and the home itself is extremely well built, stocked, and comfortable. Highly recommend this option if visiting the area and will add the value cannot be outdone in this area as far as I can tell. 5 stars"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"If you're looking for a clean & relaxing stay, don't hesitate to book with Melanie. She hosts the perfect place!"

2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This house was the cleanest place I have ever stayed. It had everything you could possible want. We were able to cook all our meals there.

2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This home was incredibly clean, and tastefully decorated. Melanie added thoughtful touches, like a basket of snacks and laundry soap.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Amazing place. It's beautifully decorated and the location is great. Super close to everything but a country feel and far enough away.

2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"We stayed here for a family visit to Mammoth Cave National Park. The house was super clean and our host, Melanie was very helpful. It was outside of Glasgow in a beautiful rural area, but it only took about 5 minutes to get to the grocery store in town. It was an easy drive of about 25 minutes to get to Mammoth Cave. Great place. Highly recommended."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The house was amazing! It was clean, perfect size for our family of 5, and close enough to everything. Beautiful country view. Absolutely loved it!!"

2022-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We had a great stay. The home was spotless and had everything we needed. We felt totally at home. The farm and field view was a great break from city life and the covered porch was really enjoyable during the sunny day and stormy evening. It was nice to have just a short drive to the caves and parks. Garcia’s Grill in Glasgow was the best food we had on our trip.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was just what we needed for our little family! Plenty of room and clean. Easy to get in and find. Highly recommend.
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a beautiful home. It was definitely worth the stay. Will stay again if we are in the area!!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Easy check-in, conveniently located, not far from Mammoth Cave, which we were visiting.

2024-04-01,5,Group trip,"Lori’s place was great! Very walkable which was awesome! The only thing that was not even a huge deal at all was that there were no basic kitchen items like cooking oil or coffee which typically comes with an Airbnb, but we just went and got some from the local grocery."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was the perfect home base for us while we explored Mammoth Cave NP. It was super cute and peaceful and had everything we needed. My kids love the board games, I loved the washer and dryer. 🤣 Neighborhood is lovely."

I enjoyed time on the porch and patio in the quiet neighborhood, I also walked to the center of downtown just to get out and stretch my legs. I recommend this house."
2023-11-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The location was great and house looks just like the pictures. We gave 4 stars because we felt like although it was neat and decluttered, it could have been cleaner. We have little ones and the floor boards are very creaky so they woke up constantly."
2023-11-01,5,Group trip,"This house was amazing for our stay in Glasgow over the Thanksgiving holiday. My in-laws moved to Glasgow and it was their first holiday away. It was perfect for us to spend Thanksgiving together. We made great use of their board games and amenities, and it’s large enough for everyone to have their own space. They also added charging cables everywhere, which was so thoughtful of them to do. Lori was so responsive even on the holiday when we couldn’t find trash bags and when I asked to check in early since we came in earlier than expected. We had a great time."
2023-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,It was a great location for Mammoth Cave National Park visit. Our children enjoyed walking to the local park and also walking downtown.

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We love your home
2023-08-01,4,Group trip,"We were very comfortable at Lori’s place. This charming house is entirely updated and cute, not to mention very clean! We really appreciated the extra touches like the chocolate chip cookies (yum!), the games, even extra chargers by the side tables. Kitchen had all the basics but I felt could use a few extra things for convenience (pizza pan, pasta strainer, wine/drinking glasses other than mason jars.) An outside table would be nice to be able to eat outside on that big, beautiful deck! However, we did all lay across that deck to watch the meteor showers on August 12 after dark, and that was super-cool. :) We enjoyed a couple of Lori’s recommended Glasgow eateries, but besides that, we visited Mammoth Cave/trails, Crystal Onyx Cave, Barren County State Park beach, and Paradise Point (a must-go)! Glasgow itself is pretty quiet after 8 pm, but we enjoyed the surrounding area and were glad we had this comfy home base to return to in between all our adventures."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a perfect spot for our family of six when visiting Mammoth Cave. The place was charming, comfortable, and cozy, with great small touches. The host was also super responsive. Highly recommended!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"What a great house! The location was perfect as a base for exploring Mammoth Cave National Park. The house itself is in a really nice, safe neighborhood - walking distance to the main town square. Super clean and had everything you could need. We really enjoyed our stay and appreciated the host’s quick responses to our questions. Highly recommend!"
2023-07-01,4,Stayed with kids,there was a clicking sound when the air was on.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,The home is beautiful and very clean. It has all the conveniences and is well stocked with anything you should need. Great quiet location!

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Stayed here with my wife + 2 kids and father for sightseeing around the area. There were enough bedrooms and bathrooms for us to all have our own space. Felt comfortable having my young (3 and under) kids there. Fenced in yard was great for the kids. They had child gates, pack and play and games on hand. Side patio was lovely place to spend the afternoon. Fire pit was nice in the evening."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved the house. I loved the layout and the neighborhood was peaceful. It was nice sitting outside with the family while playing a ""friendly"" game of baggo."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Lori's place was the perfect place for our long weekend celebrating my dad's 80th birthday and exploring Mammoth Caves. The neighborhood was lovely and we enjoyed sitting on the porch watching the lightning bugs at sunset. The extra pack n play came in handy for my niece. Lori was very accommodating and responsive when we decided to stay an extra night. Would definitely stay again if we were ever back in the area!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay and felt right at home! Everything was very clean, great neighborhood. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The most amazing home! Truly loved it and would buy it in a heartbeat … if it was in Florida 🥰 delicious warm chocolate chip cookies when we arrived. Clean home. Warm beds. Laundry room. Hot showers. Everything you need!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great home away from home for our girls trip up to Mammoth Cave NP. Home was clean, close to restaurants and coffee shops, and in a safe location. Lori even had fresh baked cookies waiting for us. Would definitely recommend."
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very comfortable home right in Glasgow. Easily slept 5 adults and 2 kids. Would gladly stay again.
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We absolutely loved our stay in the Wanni house! It was definitely home away from home for a long weekend! The house was extremely clean and stocked with all the needed basics. We were able to move any decor to higher areas out of reach for our 2 year old, and the baby gate worked just fine to keep the stairs off limits. We LOVED the fenced in backyard - it was so nice to be able to play outside with no fear for cars. We used the firepit and cornhole boards every evening. I can't recommend this house enough if you're coming to Glasgow!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori's place was just what we were looking for! We were there for a few days enjoying a Mammoth Cave trip and it was the perfect spot. Only 30 minutes to the cave and in a wonderful neighborhood. Peaceful, beautiful home. Lori was very quick to respond when I was having a problem lighting the grill...it wasn't her fault, just a glitch with the grill itself. Got it lit and we were on our way! We had everything we needed...the place is bigger than the pictures make it out to be. The ONLY thing I'd say is that the upstairs bathroom is fairly small and there's no counter space...but hey, it's an old house, to be expected. All in all a great stay!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This was a wonderful place to stay! The house is very cute and there was great kitchen and dining space! The backyard was a fun and peaceful place to hang out.
Lori was a fantastic host - very proactive outlining everything we needed to know, and places we might like to visit. She was also quick to respond when I had a question.
I would highly recommend this home if you are traveling through Glasgow!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house with a nice yard, deck, and side patio. The beds were comfortable, plenty of seating, had power chargers ready for use on each bedside table, and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook. Some great restaurants close by, and close to grocery stores. Loved it! Would definitely book again!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great place, even better than the pics! Very clean and a super comfortable place to stay. Nice grill and it was very cool that there are charging cords for all of your electronic devises all over the house! WiFi was a little weak, but worked!"
2023-05-01,4,Group trip,Very huge space in a quiet neighborhood
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Lori's place is beautiful. The neighborhood seemed extremely safe as well. We recommend renting this property. Note that the 4th bedroom is more of a game room but with the amenities that Lori made available, it was easily converted to a comfortable bedroom."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,We had a wonderful stay. We especially appreciated the baby gate and fenced in back yard. 😊
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,This was a great house in a great location. Very convenient to Mammoth Cave and Bowling Green.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great clean place in a quiet town would love to come back
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Served as a great landing spot after our Mammoth Area activities. Spacious for our big family, just what we needed to rest."
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,What a wonderful stay we had! So clean and peaceful!
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a wonderful stay. Great location, clean, and easy to find. I definitely recommend staying here!"
2023-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The house was in a nice location of town and had a great backyard for the kids to play in. The neighborhood felt safe and was walkable.
The inside of the house was clean when we arrived and provided ample space for our families to live for a few days. The bedrooms were fairly large, and the beds were super comfortable. The kitchen was functional and had most of the basics for cooking. We did a lot of cooking at the house and found it could have used a few additional items like a larger mixing bowl, a colander, a mesh strainer, and a rubber spatula.
Overall, I would recommend this house to others, especially families with kids looking for a quiet neighborhood to stay in."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Lori was a wonderful host! We loved our stay in this charming home! The house was much larger than expected and had everything we needed during our stay! Lori even left fresh baked cookies— such a homey touch! The neighborhood felt safe and was close to restaurants and grocery stores. We were able to get to Mammoth Caves in under 30 minutes! We highly recommend Lori’s home :-)
2023-03-01,5,Stayed about a week,"This is my second time staying here for work. this house is beautifully kept, has all the amenities and Lori has always been available for answering any of my questions! I will definitely be staying here again."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nick and Lori were so accommodating and easy to work with. It’s a beautiful house and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! I would highly recommend.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us, was extremely clean and looked exactly as listed. We would recommend your home to anyone needing to stay in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"When we got to the house, the power was out from the awful storm but the thing I noticed was there was freshly baked cookies on the kitchen table for us and I thought that was very sweet. Everything looked like the pictures and it didn’t disappoint. We wanted to try some of the places on the list of foods sent to us, but due to the storm and the power being out in most places, we were unable to but we will just have to come back and try them. She brought us candles and flashlights for the power outage and answered messages quickly and efficiently. I highly recommend this quaint little house for a weekend getaway!"
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"This house was super cute, perfect for our family to explore Mammoth Cave and other attractions.
Cookies and water were left for us on our arrival which was very sweet!
We only ate out once and went to the Mexican Lori recommend, not far and we enjoyed the food.
My one thing about the house is it would be nice to add/or have as an option a heavier bed cover for warmth. I know this may seem silly but the four of us didn’t sleep well any night due to the light bed cover."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The place was great.
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with kids,Rarely does anything live up to pictures and reviews but this home certainly exceeded expectations. Home was extremely clean and well appointed. This was a great location for our needs which was a launching point to explore Mammoth National Park. Home had lots of character and was very welcoming.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori’s house was lovely! Her communication was amazing and she provided restaurant recommendations and instructions on how to enter the house days before we were scheduled to check in. The house was clean and the beds were comfortable. She had homemade cookies waiting for us, which was such a special treat and so sweet! She had all the apps on the Roku device, which was a great bonus. She had board games to play, which our daughter really enjoyed. We had a wonderful experience and zero complaints."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were beyond pleased. The home was very comfortable and the fireplace and Christmas tree were the highlights of the home during our stay. The area was very quiet and peaceful and just made our stay what we needed. Lori is a wonderful host and we will book with them again when we travel back to our hometown.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Nice place. Pics were accurate. Loves that there were power cords for multiple devices at all the beds and some tables. Nice extra touch
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,Staying at the “Wanni” house was the perfect destination for our family Thanksgiving get together. The house was exactly what we needed for our visit and the spacious backyard supplies a great location for a rare Thanksgiving Day dinner outside on a beautiful day. Being so close to a recently expanded and renovated public park with walking trails and much more was a great bonus. Thanks to Lori and her family for the house rental.
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,We would stay again!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Excellent host and a wonderful place! We have stayed multiple times and would stay again when back in the area!!
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful stay! Very clean home in a beautiful neighborhood. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find chocolate chip cookies waiting for us! The multi-adapter phone chargers in the bedroom and living room were super convenient. The house was also very baby friendly. There was a pack and play, baby gate, and optional baby lock on the cabinet under the kitchen sink. We had a 17 month old with us and had no issues!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Beautiful welcoming home, they were very attentive and responsive to all of my needs! Perfect place to stay and walking distance to downtown"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean house with plenty of space. The fresh baked cookies were a plus and yummy. Appreciated the great communication. Lori was available and quick to answer questions. Would definitely recommend staying here and would stay here again.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Excellent house. Clean, spacious and quiet. Highly recommend."
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Very clean and a great neighborhood
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"I almost hate to write this review! Lori has such an amazing place, I am afraid to let the secret.
There was plenty of room for all seven of us!. The beds were great, everything was SO clean, and all our needs were thought of. There was a plate of cookies awaiting us (which had the grandkids right away), and when I inquired about sticks for roasting marshmallows, they were at the front door in less than 15 minutes!
The neighborhood is great and everything is within walking distance.
The driving to Mammoth Cave is an easy 20 minutes.
We would love to stay again!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We loved our stay at The Wanni House. The hosts were very accommodating. When we noticed there was no playpen, they immediately brought one over and left it on the porch for us. They even left cookies on the table for us. This home is absolutely stunning. If you’re looking for a family friendly getaway, I absolutely recommend this place! The fire pit and the porch swing were such a nice touch."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori is a wonderful host. very helpful, great communication, understanding."
2022-09-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and relax spot no issues at all.

2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay! Loved the charm of the house and neighborhood! Would definitely recommend to anyone!
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,"This was a great place to stay for our family reunion! Such a sweet place to read on the back deck, play corn hole, go to neighborhood estate sales, and visit Mammoth Cave from. We loved our stay!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"First time using this word in a review- Spotless. Beautiful older hardwood floors and solid wood doors(a little creaking expected). Craftsmanship rarely seen anymore. We were there to explore Mammoth Cave. 30 minute drive and would highly recommend over anyplace closer to the park. Cleanliness A+++, Floor plan A+, Location A. Wish every house we rented was this nice."
2022-08-01,5,Group trip,Cute little house. Very clean. Beautiful neighborhood with really beautiful houses. Would stay again.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Gorgeous home. Clean throughout. Door lock was numbered which made it easy, except it may have needed new batteries because it was laggy. Loved the quiet neighborhood and privacy afforded with the fenced-in back yard. Would visit again."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect house and location! The host was also very helpful and responsive. Highly recommend!
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,Very clean and quiet. Excellent stay. We enjoyed ourselves and would highly recommend to others.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Perfect home! Would definitely stay again!
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,We were in the area to spend a long weekend with two family gatherings in Glasgow and Bowling Green. Nice home and very quiet neighborhood. Very accommodating home owners. Closely located to pharmacy and grocery.
2022-07-01,5,Group trip,"The house is super perfect, almost everything we need is there! Very clean and surrounded by quiet and friendly neighborhood! Close to Walmart and attractions!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place to stay for visiting caves around the place.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Our stay at the Wanni House was absolutely wonderful!!! This house and the neighborhood is a gem!
We were traveling to Mammoth Cave National Park and the house was a short 30 minute drive to the Visitors Center. A perfect location!
It was beautiful, impeccably clean, the beds were very comfy, and we felt very much at home! Lori and Nick have thought of so many little touches to make a stay at the Wanni House so nice. Our family was especially appreciative to have so many universal charging cords throughout the house, fire wood and kindling if we had the time for a fire during our stay, and even left us a welcome plate of cookies. I felt like our friends had loaned us their beautiful home to use while we were in town. We felt right at home!
Lori and Nick were so quick in their communication with us, helpful with all questions, and offered great suggestions. Thank you both so much and glad we had the accidental chance to say hi!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Beautiful house and neighborhood. Lori is awesome and made wonderful dinner recommendations. House is immaculate, nice location situated between Mammoth Cave and state park lake."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Wonderful house that is 30 mins to Mammoth Cave. We commuted there for 3 days, and had an awesome time at the National Park.
This home was neat, clean, and updated (kitchen/bath). A/C was very strong, and the neighborhood very nice (lots of walkers and scooters).
Larger space with master bed on first floor then 3 more rooms on 2nd. Worked great for our family of 5!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Great place!!! Lori was an amazing host and the house was in a great location. Everything was very streamlined and easy to understand. Check in to check out we had a great experience. Plenty of room and great private touches.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Lori and Nick (and their place) are fantastic! There us plenty of room, the place is in a great location to explore, and they were very helpful when needed (and left us explore when needed). They even left us firewood and s'mores stuff for the beautiful weather we had! Great touches and super great place and people!"
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,We are so happy that we stayed here over trying to find a hotel. We loved the house. Lori and Nick were great to deal with. We were in the area for tours at Mammoth cave and we were about 30 minutes from the visitors center. Great area and everything was easy to find. I definitely will recommend this place to friends and family to stay at.
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great house! Quaint. Quiet street and great neighborhood. Loved our stay. Had everything we needed. Comfy beds. Updated kitchen and bathrooms. Great space outside to relax. All- around great place.
2022-06-01,5,Group trip,Such a cute little house in a cute little neighborhood. You will enjoy your stay! Nice little touches left to enjoy. Good communication with help offered at every turn. We loved sitting in the backyard and on the side porch. Would definitely come back!!
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The house is lovely and very clean. A basket full of s’mores supplies and fresh flowers greeted us when we walked in. Beds were comfortable and the backyard was small but with a nice porch and fire pit. 20 minutes from Mammoth Cave.
2022-05-01,5,Group trip,10/10 would recommend. Great price and they even made cookies for us!
2024-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Rock House was AWESOME! The decor was really nice. Beds were really comfy. Peggy told us places to go that were walkable. We did go to Museum of the Barrens. Would recommend that for sure. All in all this is return trip if in the area again.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We had a great stay at Peggy's place. Large parking area that can accommodate two vehicles. Really nice back patio area.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Our team loved the location downtown. Great place.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great place to stay that’s walking distance to cute shops and Yancey’s brewery. The beds were very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure.
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We enjoyed our stay at the Rock House in Glasgow and found it to be perfect for our trip to Mammoth Cave National Park. We felt privileged to be able to stay somewhere with such history and we enjoyed the thought of staying inside the old general store that probably outfitted other Mammoth Cave visitors more than a hundred years ago.
We found the beds to be very comfortable, the private deck was great for quiet relaxing and conversation in the mornings and evenings, and it was nice being within walking distance of shops and cafes. As other reviews have mentioned, the traffic can be loud, especially in the mornings, but we already live in an urban environment so it wasn't too much for us to deal with. We would definitely consider staying again upon a return trip in the future."
2024-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Absolutely loved everything about this place!! I can't wait to come back and check out all the little places around!!
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great location. Breakfast place nearby. Post office nearby. This was our homebase for visiting Mammoth Cave. The only issue was that there was an odor...walking up the stairs to the bedroom area there was the distinct odor of cat urine. Quite noticeable each time we entered the unit but somehow it wasn't overwhelming. perfect size for my sister and i.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with a pet,"Super cute building! Decor was great as well, and was cozy. Walkable to the downtown square area, that offered cute cafes & restaurants. Conveniently close to Mammoth Caves. Our family enjoyed the couple nights we stayed!"
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,A cute and hidden place right in Downtown Glasgow. Well within short walking distance of everything around the square. Would recommend to anyone especially looking for something within a reasonable (25 minute) drive of Mammoth Caves National Park.
2024-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The rockhouse was perfectly situated for our trip to Mammoth Cave, while also being located in a walkable little downtown. The owners have taken great care in the aesthetic of the home and I personally appreciated all the original art on the walls! It was too cold for our stay but the back patio would be a lovely spot to hang out in the warmer months.
Be sure to grab breakfast at Fine Arts Bistro, as recommended by the host. Food was delicious and the service was warm.
Two things to note if you decide to book: I don’t think I appreciated just how loud traffic on the road in front of the house would be. We ran the white noise and my kids were unbothered but I struggled a bit. I didn’t find the kitchen to be equipped enough if you were really going to cook and there’s only seating for two.
All in all a great spot for exploring the area."
2024-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Comfortable accommodations for two couples. This is our second time staying at this location. We enjoyed our stay and would book again.
Peggy is a responsive host. We contacted her about empty dish soap and a fresh bottle was promptly dropped off.
Suggestion for improvement would be to have a few bottles of water, body wash, and facial tissues in the unit upon arrival."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We definitely enjoyed our stay at the Rock house. The kitchen was easy to cook in and the washer and dryer worked great. The bedrooms were great and the mattresses were perfect. We were able to walk into the town for food and drinks, only a block away! Definitely recommend this listing."
2024-02-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This house is 30 minutes to the MCNP visitor center and within walking distance to the downtown area.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The place was lovely. Some of the cutest little touches. Enjoyed it and would highly recommend.
2024-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"I would go back in a heartbeat. We had planned excursions in Mammoth and some surrounding places and the location was ideal.
Some things that may be helpful for others (not at all a bad thing but some people will appreciate the details):
It's very easy to walk to the center of town. Cute town too! Everyone we spoke to were extremely nice and helpful.
The host had recommendations that were on point.
There are no TV's in the bedrooms (not a problem for us but some people may not like that).
There wasn't a great place to hang out in the house if the weather is bad or something-my significant other hated sitting on the couch to watch TV at night (it's a super cute couch though but not really inviting to lay on if that makes sense). Didn't bother me because I sit up but he likes to lounge and he's over 6 ft tall.
I'm missing the water pressure in the shower-it was like a firehose and I loved it.
Outside for the dogs was small and by a busy street (be aware).There is a dog park close."
2023-12-01,5,Stayed about a week,"Great location for visiting Glasgow and Mammoth Cave NP! The things we were interested in seeing and doing were all easy to get to from here. Clean, cozy, and well appointed. Peggy was friendly and responsive, thanks for having us!"
2023-11-01,5,Stayed about a week,"We were so pleasantly surprised when we walked into the Rock House!! The place was decorated so cute and Peggy thought of everything! We had a wonderful stay and the location was perfect. I will definitely stay again, I didn’t want to leave! Thank You Peggy!!"
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,My sister and I stayed for a long weekend while visiting Southern Kentucky. The stone house was beautiful and had everything we needed to relax after long days of hiking and exploring. Peggy would send suggestions of things to do in town daily and was very helpful with ideas of places for us to explore. We walked to the town center to check out the cute shops and explore the town. We highly recommend staying at Peggy’s place!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed about a week,Peggy’s place was bright and spacious. Its location is right in downtown Glasgow. It is easy to walk to shops and restaurants on the square. There can been a little noise from loud trucks but it’s nothing that earplugs can’t resolve. I was traveling alone and felt safe while there. I would recommend this place and would stay here again.
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This place was wonderful, the pictures honestly didn’t do it justice. Peggy was extremely accommodating letting the bride and her bridesmaids get ready there, and taking a little stress off us which helped immensely. The private patio was my favorite part, a nice place to set and unwind for a bit. Very highly recommended."
2023-10-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peggy was the best host with lots of local recommendations! The place was very nicely decorated and clean! The beds were super comfortable and the blackout curtains and sound machines were a nice touch!
2023-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Everything was great and perfect stay coming home to Glasgow!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,It was great!
2023-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was such an interesting old building. We enjoyed staying in something historic. And it was updated very nicely inside. The location is great if you want to enjoy the shops and restaurants around town, and its a short drive to other interesting attractions. Overall, we had a great stay here."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Loved staying at the Rock House and the history of the home. There are several things to do within walking distance. The house was nice and cozy. Peggy checked in with us through text regularly and gave us recommendations. I knew if there was a problem, she was just a text away. Would love to visit again."
2023-09-01,5,Stayed with a pet,awesome stay. nothing else to say. just comfy friendly clean awesome. we will come again!
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I past a peaceful stay.
The place was very nice 👍 beds very comfortable.
And the owner Peggy was very quick to respond."
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The rock house is super cute and an awesome place as a base to explore all the caves in the area! We also loved the location being basically right by the historic downtown square of Glasgow, walkable breakfast/lunch and even walkable dinner places! The art bistro across the street was closed but we enjoyed the old time diner instead- such a neat experience for our kids! Cj’s bbq was also awesome. Mammoth cave, hidden river cave and diamond cave were all about 25 minutes away and Peggy was helpful with recommendations. She also had left a local attraction summary and several brochures which made it easier for us to pick our tours beyond mammoth cave.
Yes you’ll hear noise from the street but we expected it and had no issues when using the white noise machines. We’d stay again!"
2023-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,The Rock House is a lovely place to stay. Restaurants are within walking distance and we really enjoyed the games provided by our host! Very comfortable and clean! Easy drive to Mammoth Cave!
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The rock house is very cute and extremely clean, all the linens were clean and we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Peggy is very responsive, you can tell they take pride in their place and it is very well taken care of. The square is beautiful and is only about a 3 min walk to eat, shop and get ice cream!! We come often to visit our daughter and would definitely stay again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We loved staying at a place with history. The inside was tastefully decorated and had everything we needed. We enjoyed walking to the town square for ice cream. The ONLY drawback is the traffic noise esp at night. The sound machine wasn't quite loud enough though we appreciated the gesture. We used an app so we could set it louder. The back patio was cozy and we were happy to find dog friendly accommodations.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The house was just as described and at the end of a historic town square. Several small business are within walking distance. Everyone we encountered was welcoming and friendly. Bowling Green and Mammoth Cave are both a short drive away.
Peggy gave clear instructions on how to get into the house and even checked in on us after a day or so. I would happily stay here again if the opportunity presented itself."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great location while we visited friends in Glasgow. Will most definitely stay there again and recommend this place to others. The Main Street traffic was noticeable but the noise machines provided while sleeping were very helpful.
Thank you Peggy. We’ll visit again."
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peggy’s place was just like the photos. Super cute and it smelled amazing when we walked in… the vibes of the whole place were great. Loved all the art & decor! Peggy was super helpful and responsive to all the messages, very nice!"
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,We enjoyed our stay. Peggy was a great host.
2023-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"My family and I loved our stay in Glasgow. The house was clean and inviting. I loved the coffee and my kids loved the high-speed internet and TV (w/ Disney+ I might add). Lots of great restaurants and a Walmart are nearby in case you need to grab something you might have forgotten (i.e. snacks and a bar of soap). Peggy was very responsive and accommodating, answering our questions almost immediately. There is some occasional road noise, but it didn't interfere with us getting good sleep, and the provided noise makers helped too. I would recommend this place to stay and is just a 30 minute drive to most of the caves and parks nearby."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peggy’s home was amazing and charming! Peggy was super helpful and responsive! Would definitely stay here again!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"This place was everything it stated it would be. The vibe / decor of the home was so cool, the kitchen was fun to use and it had everything we needed. The home was bright and welcoming. The back upstairs patio was a sweet bonus and we enjoyed our breakfast and dinners on the private patio. The town of Glasgow is cute and there are great restaurants and entertainment. Peggy left suggestions for local attractions and there were sound machines in each of the bedrooms available if you need to block noise.
We were so happy with our stay and if we are in the area again, we will book this place again for sure!
Thank you for hosting such a cool space for adventurous travelers."
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had business to attend to all around Barren county and needed a central location. The Rock house was perfect and we enjoyed our stay in downtown Glasgow. Book this place if it’s available and do it with confidence. It’s all together stylish, spacious, clean, comfortable and charming. Also, eat at the Bistro just a block away towards town on the left. Delicious!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful and Peggy helped us with a little later check out!!!
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"This was a great Airbnb experience! The space was very cute and comfortable; everything was clean and aesthetically pleasing. We felt right at home. Peggy (the host) was proactive about messaging important information, and suggested restaurants and activities. We could easily walk to every restaurant and bar we visited during our stay. Would definitely stay here again!"
2023-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Very nice well-equipped accommodation with parking just next door. Peggy is very responsive and attentive. A little noisy with the main road nearby.
2023-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Rock House is awesome. Exceeded my expectations. Nice private balcony, comfortable beds, functional kitchen. Nice to have bathroom on both floors. Describe exactly as on the site, fully remodeled and a Glasgow time piece.
Peggy engaged doing the stay, reaching out to see if we needed anything. Great experience!!"
2023-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great! Excellent place, really clean and well furnished. Maybe bring an eye mask—the curtains in the bedroom don’t black out the street lamp super well. But that’s a really minor complaint. It was still easy to sleep there. All in all, wonderful place!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"If you’re thinking about it, just book it. The Rock House is probably the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. The host’s attention to all the details and kind/quick communication resulted in a fantastic experience that really made the place feel like a home away from home. It was comfortable, clean, and well decorated. Also having two bathrooms was a huge plus! And the kitchen was the perfect size and had everything we needed.
I can always tell when we’re at a great Airbnb when my dog is comfortable there immediately.
I only wish the weather was a little warmer so we could have taken advantage of their outdoor patio upstairs.
Thank you so much for having us, we will definitely be booking here again. A true gem!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Highly recommend! This was a great place to stay while visiting caves in the area. Quaint town with lots of options.
2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"We had a great stay! Peggy's place was clean and comfortable. We had plenty of room for 4 people. The beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed the close proximity to the square, and it's only a short drive to Mammoth cave and many other caves. They gave us great recommendations about local food and coffee. Peggy is quick to respond and very helpful!"
2023-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We loved staying at the Rock House. It was everything plus more! We have already booked our next trip back. Absolute gem of a place to stay, exceeded all of our expectations. Peggy is a wonderful host."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Rock House was great - conveniently located to Mammoth Cave, but on the Main Street of Glasgow with plenty to walk and do. Fun art inside the house, very clean, responsive and helpful host. The kitchen is small with seating for two, but quite functional. The house was fun for our kids ages 6 and 4, but might have been challenging with toddlers as there are some attractive, beautiful vases which are easy to reach for little hands. I appreciated that there were plastic dishes and metal cups which worked for the kids. The traffic noise was as expected. Peggy was very helpful and a wonderful host. The best part was that she told us to enjoy our vacation and not worry about any cleanup or other checkout responsibilities, which was very refreshing. We would definitely stay again!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy’s place was as described. It was clean and comfortable. The location was right in the center of town and convenient for us during our stay in Glasgow. It was a nice alternative to staying at a local hotel.
The instructions to access Rock House were easy to follow. Peggy had several restaurant recommendations available on a handout.
We enjoyed our stay and will definitely consider booking again on our next trip to the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Very cozy space..and the history of the building is very cool!
Peggy was a great host.. checked on us often and accommodated us on early check in.
Would highly recommend!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,It was pretty and the town was beautiful
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Greatly enjoyed our stay at the Rockhouse. Loved walking through the town, enjoyed the shops, and had great food at the local, recommended restaurants. Great distance to Cave City and Mammoth Cave. Peggy was easy to reach and responded very quickly. Everything was as listed, would definitely stay again if in the area."
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,Fun place! Everything was as advertised. It is right on a busy street and can be a little bit noisy with the traffic. Overall it was a great stay.
2023-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Wonderful place to stay while visiting the area!
2023-02-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a cute and clean airbnb! I have never stayed at such a clean pet friendly airbnb before. Peggy & Sandy were super responsive and kind. The location was great as far as being within walking distance of so many things and short driving distance to other attractions. The only downside was the traffic noise at night because I’m a light sleeper and sound machines don’t help me out unfortunately. Overall, it was a great stay and I would definitely return!"
2023-01-01,5,Group trip,We wanted to stay at the Rock House because a friend’s mother worked there in the 60’s when it was a restaurant. We enjoyed listening to her stories and history about the house and surrounding businesses. Supper was super convenient! We ordered and walked to pick it up! It was a grown-up slumber party and the place was perfect! We felt right at home! Thank you for a memorable night!
2023-01-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"super cute place, reasonably priced. great location and clean space. would definitely recommend and stay here again."
2023-01-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Very charming, historic place! Perfect location for our trip to Mammoth Cave NP. Peggy had everything we needed to make our stay cozy. As a light sleeper, I really appreciated the blackout curtains in the bedrooms."
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Peggy’s place was great for our stay. Would highly recommend. Very nice and as advertised.
2022-12-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Our family spent Christmas at The Rock House and brought our dog along. We made great memories there and enjoyed our stay. Peggy thought of everything and even decorated for the holidays, which we appreciated.
The Fine Arts Bistro was a favorite. Mammoth Cave National Park is just a short drive away and we will not soon forget the experience.
The pictures were true to form and the place was perfectly appointed, spotless, and tastefully decorated. The combination of historic exterior and contemporary interior was a win for us. We spent one week and wanted for nothing. There was snow and subzero temperatures during our stay, but we were warm and cozy inside.
We did not use the noise machines and felt it was peaceful. The shower had excellent water pressure and the washer/dryer was a bonus. The kitchen sink was massive and there was an abundance of linens, blankets and towels. We only have positive things to say.
We felt fortunate to find this place. Do not hesitate to book!"
2022-11-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We had a lovely stay in Glasgow. The family enjoyed the well designed space. Thank you for making our holiday a breeze.
A note, there is not an oven in the unit. They have accommodated by adding a toaster oven."
2022-11-01,2,Stayed with kids,"There was a strong urine smell downstairs. It felt disgusting to be hanging out with urine, especially having a toddler.
The surfaces where all dirty there was even a hair painted onto the coffee table.
The couch and chair while cute are very uncomfortable my husband kept standing while watching a movie.
The price us good but its for a reason. The road was noisy and the beds were not that comfortable. The downstairs toilet bubbled water and could not be used while someone was showering upstairs.
One room had blackout curtains but the other does not and the street lights aluminate the room. There is not an indoor lock/latch for the upstairs patio.
I will say they had a great selection of pillows for sleeping and I appreciated the provided sound machines to block out road noise. Check in and out was easy and no specific list of things to do at check out."
2022-11-01,5,Group trip,"This place is amazing! It’s the perfect Airbnb stay. I was amazed by how cute and comfortable this place is- it is conveniently located close to everything, and has the best little coffee bar ever!! We would sit on the back deck and drink our coffee and just relax! Will definitely stay her in the future!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Peggy’s place was perfect. This is our second time having a weekend get away to Glasgow. The town is quaint and everyone is friendly. Peggy’s place was walking distance to the Fine Arts Bistro a great place for good coffee and breakfast) Yancy’s… we enjoyed good food and live music. Fall is our favorite time to go, the town has a farmers market set up in the square most weekends. And we enjoy hiking… there are lots of places within a short drive with good trails. Also Mammoth Cave is about a 25 min drive. Being able to travel with our pups is a big plus! We always do our best to leave a place the way it was when we arrived as to not lose the pet friendly status! Peggy’s place, The Rock House, was the perfect fit. Very clean. Nice decor and comfortable! Thanks Peggy!"
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Really like the Rock house. Was clean and nice central location. Enjoyed the local restaurants and shops as well.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Great stay. Traffic was a bit noisy but other than that fantastic.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This place was perfect for our family. Beautiful and cozy. Proximity to the downtown square shops and restaurants was great. Peggy was a perfect host and helped us make the most of our stay in Glasgow.
2022-10-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Charming place to stay. The decor is beautiful, beds are comfortable , and the shower had great water pressure. Road noise can be loud at times , but not a deal breaker. Great little restaurant across the street . Would stay here again!!!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Loved it!
2022-09-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Peggy’s place was great for a family trip to Mammoth Cave! Sparkling clean and very well appointed! Great coffee maker and ample towels. The location on the main road meant you could hear cars passing by but I’d this is not an issue for you, the location is great!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Great stay, very clean and great communication"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Truly a gem! Loved the historic building, but the inside was very clean, modern and captured the area perfectly. Communication was incredibly by Peggy - every step of the way she communicated what I needed...and more. Would recommend this place for any one in Glasgow or the Cave Region. Thanks for everything!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Cute, homey with an eclectic feel. Very convenient to shops, places to eat, and things to see.
Peggy was a great host. Checked in, via app, to make sure everything was as it should be."
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Roomy and cute! Downtown was interesting! Loved the game store across the street We had everything we needed. The coffeemaker was a wee bit complicated, but the manual in the drawer helped immensely. We had no problem with the street noise, even though we are used to a quiet country setting! This was a fun stay for us!"
2022-09-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Such a charming little place in such a great little town! We came up to spend our 4th wedding anniversary together and to see Mammoth Caves National Park. It’s only 25 minutes to the park which made it a great location to stay. The house is adorable, super comfortable, and really awesome! Not to mention the host Peggy is an amazing communicator and super friendly. 10/10 recommend staying here!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"The Rockhouse was such an enjoyable experience for us. The pictures really don't do it justice. Clean, well-appointed, comfortable, spacious, and safe. The main street noise didn't really bother us. We were especially happy to bring our two small doggies with us. It was convenient to Mammoth Cave, which we visited twice. Peggy was the perfect host with helpful recommendations for us throughout the trip. We hope we can return one day."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Peggy’s place is a peaceful spot and was perfect for our two day visit into Mammoth Cave. We were really surprised by the friendliness of the townspeople when we ventured into town for dinner one night. I would definitely stay here again when in the area.
2022-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The Airbnb was amazing-so beautiful! It was situated in a cute small town near Mammoth Cave National Park. It was wonderful to explore the park and caves and then have such a nice place to stay to chill and regroup. Peggy was a very responsive and positive host. We want to visit again!
2022-08-01,4,Stayed with kids,"The location of this fun home is great for visiting Mammoth Caves. We loved walking to restaurants (especially the Fine Arts Bistro!) nearby. There are lots of little details that add to the experience at this home like the bottle opener mounted to the wall right by the fridge, the coffee maker that grinds the beans and brews, the window in the stairwell/upstairs hall that provides sunshine in the day and night light effects at night, noise machines in both bedrooms, and having two toilets!"
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with kids,"wonderful, fresh, two story space within walking distance of delightful downtown glasgow and a short drive away from beautiful mammoth cave national park."
2022-08-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Glasgow is definitely a cute town to fill your time: good food, friendly people and very good live music at the local brewery (many of the acts are coming from Nashville). It is a wonderful place to stay if going to Mammoth Caves. The place was open, comfy and bright with lots of space for our family 5 and dog. It's located on a busy road but noise was not an issue at night."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We just spent 2 nights in the Rock House and it was nothing short of perfect for our needs. From the ease of check-in until the check-out, we had everything we needed for our family. The place was clean, well stocked and nicely renovated. Location was perfect for our trip to both the caves and to the Corvette Museum. Perfectly furnished with all the amenities required and the communication was top of the line. Peggy was very knowledgeable and offered extremely helpful advice on places to eat and attractions to see. Super host is spot on for her. Thank you for the opportunity to stay in this wonderful house!"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy is an easy host to communicate with and offers suggestions of things to do in the beautiful town of Glasgow! The location is an easy walk to diners, restaurants, pubs, gift shops and the town square.
The condo is clean and has a great sense of de or with the cutest little upper balcony to sit on and enjoy! A great stay"
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The cutest condo, so well decorated! And conveniently located! Great place at a great price."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with a pet,Two couples and our pups stayed here on a weekend trip to Mammoth Cave. The house was very nice and had everything we needed. It is conveniently located near the town center with my local restaurants that we walked to for dinner and breakfast. There was even a farmers market right outside the door on Saturday morning. The biggest surprise highlight was directly across the street had a board game store with a better selection than you'd expect in even a big city. We bought some games and lounged in the house because it was so homey.
2022-07-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy’s house was a five star rental for sure!! It was the perfect size for our family of four and loved that we were able to being our four legged baby with us too! The house is super cute with a great deck and beautiful art work! It was in a great location for visiting the Mammoth Cave, Dinosaur World & the other local caves too! We will defiantly visit the Rock House again when in the area."
2022-07-01,5,Stayed with kids,Peggys place is remodeled beautifully! My family stayed here while we visited mammoth cave as well as the corvette museum. It was a perfect fit for the 5 of us. Peggy even provided two twin roll away beds. There is ample room for sleeping many more with two futon couches and two queen beds. We had breakfast across the street as suggested by Peggy and it was amazing. I highly recommend Peggy’s place if you are looking for an affordable place for your entire family. You can even bring the dog!
2022-07-01,4,Stayed a few nights,"Peggy is an attentive host! Loved the space and location. Ah, the luxury of having two bathrooms!"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"Let me start by saying that Peggy’s place is well appointed, clean, great water pressure and temp, excellent coffee maker and super cute. It was a great point for my husband to travel to our destination each day. The only downside (which may not be any consideration for those not coming from a rural area) is that the Main Street is a thoroughfare ALL hours of the night. Close to everything in town. Depending on your preference this is a great place to stay :)"
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,Beautiful accommodations with an artists touch. This vintage store has been graciously remade into an upscale chic getaway. Great restaurants are a quick walking distance and Mammoth Cave is an easy drive. Why waste money on expensive cookie-cutter hotel rooms when you can get this much nicer location for 1/2 the price?
2022-06-01,5,Stayed a few nights,The “Rockhouse” was the coolest place I have ever stayed. It is so modern and feels like a home away from home! The host was very accommodating and ensured we had a great stay! Very clean place and in downtown square which was a short walk to coffee & antique stores! Highly recommend!
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"We really enjoyed our stay! It was nicely decorated, clean and close to everything. We will definitely stay again in the future."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Look no further. This is a standalone house that has been redone beautifully top to bottom. Great location, at the edge of historic downtown but only a couple of miles from many mainstream stores and services one might need. The Rock House is very secure, open, bright, and cool (literally and figuratively). Much larger than we expected. We loved it."
2022-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,A perfect location for exploring Mammoth Cave with the convenience of local restaurants. There is a lot of street noise but the house is fantastic.
2022-05-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"Wonderful location and nicely updated/decorated old rock house. It was beyond my expectations, when I walked in."
2022-05-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"My daughter and I loved staying at the Rockhouse on our recent hiking trip to Mammoth Cave, which is less than 30 minutes away. It’s also a short walk to several restaurants, and we loved our Sunday morning walk exploring Glasgow.
The beds were comfortable, the living space was great for relaxing in the evenings, and the kitchen met our our needs while vacationing since we weren’t up for cooking big meals.
Peggy is a great host! Highly recommend!"

They have made great use of the space. Owners were very easy to work with. Will defiantly book again."
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is such a unique space in such an excellent location. It truly is pet friendly and there’s such a nice little back porch is perfect for grilling or just enjoying. I would stay here again - it was perfect for us.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The home is located right on the edge of downtown within walking distance to all the restaurants and shops. It could get a little noisy during “rush hour” being on the street but wasn’t too bad. The home is well appointed and had everything we needed. Would recommend to anyone staying in Glasgow.
2022-04-01,5,Group trip,Adorable house and within walking distance to great restaurants and downtown. There is a lot of traffic so the noise machines really helped us sleep better. The beds were super comfy. The host is very attentive and did a great job of letting us know about local events going on in the area. We would stay there again.
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The Rock House is a true gem!!!! We took our spring break to Mammoth Cave and wanted to be in a space we could cook in, etc. We were extremely lucky to find this amazing rental!!!! If you're planning a trip to the caves, we highly recommend this airbnb rental!!! Downtown Glasgow os within walking distance and has a lot of shops and great live music on the weekends. Peggy and her husband are so accommodating and helpful!!!!! You definitely won't be disappointed!!!!!"
2022-04-01,5,Stayed with kids,"We had a fantastic time staying at the Rock House! It is very clean and nicely furnished. The Rock House accommodated our family of 5 with our teenage son sleeping on the loft couch. It is centrally located to all of the attractions and only 1 block from the city square. We walked to breakfast and a great Chai Tea at Fine Arts Bistro, listened to live music at Yancey's, and ate very well at A Little Taste of Texas! We highly recommend the Rock House and would stay there again anytime!"
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,The Rock House was so darling. The pictures really don't do it justice. Our host was so accommodating and thought of everything. We were so comfortable and had easy access to activities. We would definitely stay here again!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,5 stars are not enough. Great communication and clean. Street noise did not bother our toddler with the noise machine on. 15-20 minutes to cave / horse city. Great stay
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with kids,"Great, historical house. Decor and art make it even better. Great communicators-they kept us up to date about events happening in the community. Parking is great. There’s also a local hobby store almost across the street that has game nights as well. Local shops within walking distance with groceries and household goods in case you forget something. Hot water is limitless and the shower pressure is amazing. Comfy beds. Quality pillows! House is pet friendly."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,We loved Peggy’s place! It was close to all the attractions and a beautiful place to stay. We would definitely recommend staying here!!!
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"What a hidden gem! The Rock House is cute, comfortable, and a short walk away from a great brewery, restaurants, and a nice museum. It was the perfect weekend getaway for our family of three."
2022-03-01,4,Stayed with kids,"House was beautiful, exactly as pictured! Beds were comfortable and the bedding was luxurious. The board games were a huge hit for our family! The only downside was that it is on a very busy road and the road noise indoors was pretty loud at times."
2022-03-01,5,Stayed with a pet,This is a great house and easy drive to Mammoth. House is just like the pictures and very clean. Easy walk to downtown for restaurants and coffee shops. The dog park is very convenient and my pup loved it. Highly recommend!

2024-06-01,5,Stayed with a pet,"After a six hour drive, Sarah’s home was extremely welcoming and comfortable. Everything was pristine, and the home itself was adorable. All we wanted to do was go to sleep when we arrived after working all day and making the trip down, the bed was very comfortable and we both slept soundly.
I wish we had more time to spend here, the creek is well worth the short walk. It’s beautiful!
Sarah was one of the most responsive and caring hosts I have ever had while using Airbnb. Thank you Sarah!"

2023-08-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"The country cottage is the most peaceful, clean, comfortable, and relaxing place to stay. I enjoyed being out in the rural farmlands where everything is lush and open. I was looking for a place I could enjoy while venturing over to Mammoth Cave National Park. This was the perfect spot! I enjoyed being unplugged from my electronic gadgets and having a full kitchen to cook meals and pack lunches. The master bathroom is like having your own personal spa! Very spacious and luxurious! I had my guitar with me and was able to write some new lyrics in this quiet, homie setting. I napped in the hammock on the large, breezy, screened-in porch and watched gorgeous sunsets over the vast, green fields. The cottage is surrounded by a well-manicured lawn, has a large deck (in addition to the porch), with offerings of a BBQ area and fire pit. Daniel welcomed me like a friend when I arrived and was readily available for anything I needed during my stay. Truly, this place is a treat for the Soul."

2023-06-01,5,Stayed with kids,"The cottage was beautiful and felt isolated while being near town. It was larger than I anticipated, and the space was really nice. The bathroom in the bedroom was a standout! The overall layout of the house gave some versatility to the home. The area was lovely with its rolling hills and the greenery of trees and grasses, and crops. Daniel and his wife were very friendly and ensured that our stay was a wonderful one."

The cottage is well cared for and offers many personal touches that made our stay comfortable. Daniel and Rhoda checked in on us after our arrival to make sure we had no further needs and thoughtfully provided a pack N play as well as offering toys for our young son. Such kind hosts!

It was cozy, relaxing, clean and had all we needed. We were glad to return ""home"" to it after a day of exploring the area. Spent one evening on the screened porch as the sun went down and listened to the sounds of the country at night. We enjoyed the country setting and the drive out to it. Our hosts answered any questions quickly, were accommodating, and friendly. If we stay in the area again, would love to stay here!"
2023-03-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"One of the most peaceful places, I have ever been. This is a perfect place to relax and recharge your mind and soul. The house is neat and clean as well.

2023-02-01,5,Stayed with kids,I needed a place to stay last minute for my grandmother's funeral. This place was perfect and the kids were able to disconnect from the world with no TV's and no wifi and play board games we brought us. There was little notebook with part renters reviews. It was a nice little touch. Also love how God is incorporated throughout the house. The tub was huge and definitely needed. We will be back again when we visit.

2022-11-01,5,Stayed one night,"This was a quiet, super clean, country home. The master walk in shower was huge and was beneficial for me since I had a broken ankle. You can tell the owners put a lot of love into this home. It was pretty chilly so we didn’t get to enjoy the screened porches or the fire pit. Which the chairs and firewood were supplied. Maybe next time! However we did enjoy the electric fireplace in the living room. No TV, but we had cell signal and were happy we could reach out and were able to locate the property with no issues. Perfect!"

It is about 30-40 minutes from Mammoth Caves State Park and about 15 minutes from the little town. It is a very easy drive. The hosts are very kind, friendly and available if you need anything.

The bidets on the toilets are wonderful; we have something similar at home.
My husband loved the downstairs shower so much we just ordered the same one!
I highly recommend this home. You can walk downtown and on the way there's a reasonably good Mexican restaurant; we stopped for drinks and really liked it. The outdoor patio is excellent, but be aware that it gets very busy so if you plan to eat dinner there, you should get there early or prepare to wait (we saw people waiting both Friday and Saturday evenings).
Overall, this is an excellent home and value. I highly recommend it!"

2023-04-01,5,Stayed a few nights,This is the most well provisioned AirBB we’ve ever stayed at. It was only two of us so way more room than we needed; this would be a great space for a family. But it was a great spot for us.

2021-12-01,5,Stayed a few nights,"OUTSTANDING!!!
We have stayed in hotels, country inns and airbnbs in the Glasgow and Mammouth Cave area. We visit 2 – 3 times per year.
This is the best!!!
The bedrooms are well equipped. Beds are comfortable and the bedding is excellent. There is an Alexa unit plus a large TV in every bedroom.
The main/living room has a large screen and theater seating. In fact, there were large screen TV's in a number of rooms--and all the streaming apps were available for use. Just turn it on.
The kitchen is extremely well equipped. Pots, pans, etc. are all great quality. The Keurig coffee machine, plus a variety of coffee pods, is ready for use. We also used the Italian Bialetti Express Moka pot, which produces strong coffee, which we like.
There were a variety of snacks (Poptarts, popcorn, peanuts, etc.) on the kitchen counter. And there were eggs in the fridge.
We had arrived late and did not have to go to the grocery for breakfast items--thanks to our host.
The bathrooms were equipped with top-of-the-line Biobidet units, a touch of luxury and a definite topic of conversation.
The laundry room has full-size washer and dryer.
The house is equipped with a back deck, which has a table with chairs and a gas grill. If one wants, there is a fire pit available for use.
In summary, this was one of the best airbnb’s we have ever encountered – and we plan to come back! You will see us again!"

You will be lacking nothing here that you will need for your stay.
